Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself last year after she was allegedly sexually assaulted at a party

The three teenage boys who authorities say drove 15-year-old Audrie Pott to hang herself in 2012 have admitted to sexually assaulting the girl - and taking photographs of the humiliating ordeal - eight days before she took her own life.

After admitting to the attack - during which the three teens 'digitally penetrated' the young girl - the boys each were sentenced to serve 30 to 45 days in a juvenile detention facility.

Because of their ages, the three teens have not been identified.

Pott's family has declined to comment on the criminal case, but appear to be outraged by the anonymity the boy's get to enjoy.

'As much as we strongly disagree with and are actively attempting to change the lenient privacy laws afforded to juveniles, even when they commit as here heinous acts on an unconscious minor, we cannot publicly comment on any aspect of any criminal proceedings involving these young men,' Robert Allard, an attorney for Lawrence and Sheila Pott - Audrie's parents - said in a statement to SFGate.

Pott, from Saratoga, California, took her life in after sending Facebook messages to the boys who assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party in September of 2012.

After the party, where Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade, the teen woke up without her shorts on and with mocking comments written in marker all over her body.

Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers.

'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident.

She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos.

'I swear to god if u still have those
 pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers
 in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.'

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house.

In addition to the criminal charges, the Potts have filed a civil lawsuit against the teens they say are responsible for their daughter's suicide.

Shockingly, one of the boys convicted of assaulting Pott is claiming that the girl's parents share some of the blame in their daughter's tragic death.

In court documents filed by attorney Philip Pereira on behalf of one of Pott's unnamed attackers, the boy claims that Lawrence and Sheila Pott failed to act on the girl's 'long-standing and serious emotional problems before her suicide and they should have sought professional help.'

The filing also mentions an 'altercation' between Audrie and two of her friends shortly before her death.

Allard, the parents' attorney, reacted angrily to the assertions.

Cruel: Pott, right, was allegedly assaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack

He released a statement reading: 'The sole issue in this case is the callous behavior of the 
suspects which directly led to Audrie's unnecessary death.

'Since this 
lawsuit was filed, it has become quite clear to us that the suspects 
refuse to accept responsibility or show remorse for their actions.'

SFGate.com reported that Allard described the document as 'a revolting attempt to deflect 
responsibility away from his clients.

'This case is and will always be 
about the tragic consequences associated with sexual assault and cyber 
bullying.'

Her devastated 
parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at 
the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up 
their involvement.

On 
the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house 
drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when 
her parents left town.

Three male classmates allegedly 
helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her 
body and sexually assaulting her.

Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012

Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers:

AUDRIE: i need to talk to u.

BOY: What

AUDRIE: one word... marker

BOY: What about marker

AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u

BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me... And I'm sorry about the marker

AUDRIE: You have no idea what it's like to be a girl

An exchange with another classmate:

CLASSMATE: lol that shit gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah

AUDRIE: oh my god... i f***ing hate people... Do you know how people view me now?... I now have a reputation I can never get rid of.

AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how.

In police interviews, the teenagers admitted 
to coloring half of her face black with marker, then 
pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals.

They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the 
time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days 
later, scores of students had seen the images.

Rolling Stone magazine has
 revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and 
has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom
 she had known since middle school.

She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images.

'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.'

'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body.

She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her.

'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.'

She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'

When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person.

'She had been, literally, the best person
 you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had 
changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.'

Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase.
