When Gwyneth Paltrow released her latest super clean cookbook It's All Good and revealed that she avoids feeding her children pasta, 
bread or rice because it 
is 'bad for them', a nation of mothers were quick to comment.

But keen to give the 40-year-old A-lister a run for her macrobiotic diet money is Calgary Avansino: the glossy, glamorous and super healthy Vogue wellbeing editor.

30-something Calgary, who is dubbed the 'unofficial health expert' at Vogue Towers, has revealed her secrets to clean living for herself and her two children, and carbs and junk food are most certainly off the menu. As are most foods that the average busy mother might feed her children,

Health conscious: Calgary Avansino feeds her family on a diet of super healthy smoothies, flax seeds and quinoa toast

The stylish blonde explained to Sunday Times Style magazine how she feels more passionate about good food than anything else in the world and can't imagine raising her two children to live on unhealthy foods.

She credits the likes of Halle Berry, Stella McCartney and, of course, Gwyneth Paltrow ('no one does healthy as stylishly') for their 'trendy' clean eating.

She operates an 80/20 system, which eliminates wheat, cow's milks, processed white stuff, dairy, animal protein, fizzy drinks and candy 80 per cent of the time and does admit that she is a complete control freak when it comes to food.

Clean and lean: Calgary maintains that, if you have the option to eat healthy, why shouldn't you

A typical day for California girl and her family is kick started by one of her super healthy 
smoothies (see recipe below), gluten-free porridge mixed in with flax and chia seeds.

Yoghurt comes in the coconut variety and a carb craving is answered in 
the form of quinoa toast with almond butter.

Speaking to the magazine, she said: 'Now, before you roll your eyes and damn me for ever to the most-annoying mother category, I will reassure you that of course my kids beg me for sweets and they want crisps every time we stop for petrol.

'However, they also regularly ask me to make veggie burgers, quinoa stir-fries and kale chips.'

When
she is out and about in what she calls the 'normal world', she allows 
her children to indulge on birthday cake and ice cream at parties but 
ensures that when they return home they feast on raw vegetables whilst 
doing their homework.

Her mantra is: why not offer a healthier substitute when you have the choice to.

She added: 'Yes, they would squeal with joy if I 
brought home Fruit Loops (not that they're even aware they exist), but 
they would also know they are unhealthy and full of "nasty nothings".'

And while Calgary and Gwyneth both share a taste for clean living, it seems that not quite everyone agrees.

A mother-of-two wrote on Facebook: ‘Still laughing off the idea from Calgary Avansino in Sunday Times Style that any sensible mother would go to the trouble and expense of this ludicrous breakfast for her family.

‘I’m all for healthy eating, but can't believe her smug superior article.’

While a father-of-one added: 'Oh gosh it appears we are fresh out of Bee Pollen. Just popping to the shops Darling' ...<Leaves his stupid wife forever>.
