A federal investigator who responded to the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood says the crime scene was gruesome, with bodies and medical equipment 'all over the floor'.

FBI Special Agent Susan Martin testified on Tuesday during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan. He is accused of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others in the attack at the Texas military base.

Martin says agents found hundreds of pieces of evidence, including 146 shell casings and six magazines, inside the building where the shootings took place.

She says agents eventually ran out of numeric markers and used sticky notes.

The
testimony marked a shift as prosecutors begin focusing on forensic 
evidence. In the trial's first week, prosecutors ran through 60-plus 
witnesses, many of them soldiers injured in the attack.

It was also revealed today that Hasan told a mental health panel he wished to die 
while carrying out 'jihad' because it would signal God had designated 
him as a religious martyr.

The
New York Times on Tuesday published an account of parts of the panel's 
January 2011 report on Major Nidal Hasan, a 42-year-old U.S.-born Muslim
whose court-martial began at Fort Hood, Texas on August 6.

The 
newspaper also published an image online of the official report. Some 
pages of the report were released by Hasan's former civilian lawyer, 
John Galligan, the newspaper said.

The
panel, known as a sanity board, was assembled to assess whether former 
Army psychiatrist Hasan was able to stand trial.

It concluded he was fit
for trial but the contents of the report have not been heard by the 
jury of military officers.

Hasan told the court last week that he switched sides in what he called a U.S. war on Islam.

He told the jury, 'I am the shooter' and he has not contested the testimony of more than 60 witnesses who described the November 5, 2009 shootings, the worst non-combat attack on a U.S. military base.

The court-martial resumed on Tuesday with expert witness testimony about the crime scene. Hasan attends court in a wheelchair after being paralyzed from the waist down in a shootout with military police who ended his rampage.

Hasan could face the death penalty by lethal injection if he is convicted.

'I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life,' Hasan told the panel of military mental health experts.

'However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,' Hasan said.

He also denied having remorse and considered his injuries a 'badge of honor,' according to the report.

The terse, unapologetic statements help 
explain tension between Hasan, who is defending himself, and a team of 
standby lawyers assisting him who have sought to take a lesser role 
because they say Hasan is actively seeking the death penalty.

The standby lawyers say their code of ethics prevents them from assisting. Hasan has disputed the assertion he is seeking the death penalty for himself, and military judge Colonel Tara Osborn has denied the lawyers' request to reduce their role.

Hasan was 'encouraging or working toward the death penalty,' one of his lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Kris Poppe, told Osborn during the court-martial.

The lead military prosecutor has said Hasan at the time of the attack wanted to avoid his impending deployment to Afghanistan and felt a religious duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. Many of the witnesses have said they at first believed the shooting was a training exercise because soldiers are normally prohibited from carrying weapons on base.

A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike.

The mental health report said Hasan wore earplugs to muffle his semi-automatic handgun blasts and chose areas at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center that had the 'greatest density' of uniformed military personnel.

He also told the panel he prayed in the morning at a mosque in nearby Killeen, Texas, on the day of the shootings and destroyed personal identification, which he would not need because he would either be killed or in jail.

Hasan denied that depression or anxiety contributed to his motive.

'I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,' he told the military panel.
