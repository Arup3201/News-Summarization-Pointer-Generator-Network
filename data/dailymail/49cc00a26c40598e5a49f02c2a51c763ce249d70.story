A stunning collection of classic Australian travel posters which depict iconic visions of the nation in the early 20th century have been sold at an exclusive auction in New York.

The 50 vintage posters, which are from the private collection of an Australian vendor, date from the early 1920s to the 1960s, and represent the height of glamour in early tourism efforts.

Swann Auction Galleries sold the impressive collection at their 14th Annual Rare and Import Travel Posters sale, with many of the glorious posters selling for well above asking price, which Nicholas Lowry, Swann's president and director of posters, attributed to the 'strength and rarity of the material'.

The Swann Gallery said that the interest in Australian posters has historically been quite high, both within the country and around the world, with this particular collection the 'single best collection of Australian posters to have come up for auction anywhere in the world.'

'I've been in this business for more than 20 years and this [auction] marks two firsts: It is the largest collection of Australian posters to come up for public sale and it is, in my opinion, definitely the best collection of Australian posters to ever come on the market,' Mr Lowry told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

Many of the posters had not previously been recorded in reference books, with Mr Lowry labeling the collection a cornucopia for serious collectors to view images unseen in public before. 

 The beautiful Sellheim print, 'Australia/Surf Club' (1936, above) sold for $8,450, well above the lower end estimate of $5000.

Several modernist images by Gert Sellheim were up for grabs, and sold for well beyond the reserve price, including 'Sunshine and Surf/Australia' (1936), which was estimated to sell for as little at $6000 and went for $8,750. 

Sellheim, an award-winning German-Australian artist, was responsible for designing the now iconic Qantas Airlines flying kangaroo logo, and his work has been in circulation since the early 1920's.

'Orient Line to Australia' (1938) by Sir William Dobell, a two-time Archibald Prize winner, sold for $6,500, well above the expected $3,000-$4,000 estimate. 

Sir Dobell was commissioned by TIME magazine to paint four portraits for covers, with his subjects including former Australian prime minister Robert Menzies, the then-president of South Vietnam, th chairman of General Motors and the then-prime minister of Malaysia.

The collection of 200 posters also included British travel posters intended to glamorize travel and tourism with the aim of selling more tickets.

‘These posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for the large railway companies that operated ...with the intention of filling seats on their trains,' Mr Lowry told MailOnline.

‘They also wanted to beautify ticket offices and train platforms where most of these posters were intended to be displayed.

‘The posters bear striking, colourful and eye catching images from destinations which the different rail companies serviced. Some show lifestyle images giving visual snapshots of the way of life of the elegant people who vacation in those spots.'

'I can certainly imagine that even at the time these posters were created that the areas being promoted did not, in fact, look as glamorous in real life as they did in the posters.'
