When a Midwestern scrap metal dealer spotted the golden egg at a bric-a-brac market, he anticipated a money-making opportunity, but only for the value of its gold and jewels.

He just didn’t realise quite how much he would profit on his $13,300 (£8,000) purchase.

After failing to sell it on because would-be buyers thought it over-priced, the man decided to research the piece further – and discovered he was the owner of a $33 million (£20million) long-lost Faberge egg.

Intricate: The egg contains a Vacheron Constantin watch which was given by Alexander III to his wife Empress Maria Feodorovna for Easter in 1887

Kieran McCarthy, the expert who verified the extraordinary find, likened the moment to ‘Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark’.

'I could never have dreamed something of this caliber would just walk through our door,' said McCarthy, director of antiques firm Wartski and Faberge specialist.

The ornamental egg is the third of more than 50 Imperial Easter Eggs designed by Carl Faberge for the Russian Royal Family.

After the Russian Revolution all the eggs were seized by the Bolsheviks and most were sold to the West.

But eight of them are missing, of which only three are believed to have survived the revolution – including this one.

It was last seen at an exhibition in St Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922

It was last seen at an exhibition in St Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922.

It was only in 2011 that researchers discovered the Third Imperial Egg survived the revolution, and had been sold at an auction in New York in 1964.

It had then found its way to a house in the U.S. Midwest overlooking a Dunkin' Donuts.

A photo taken at the home shows the coveted egg beside a chocolate cupcake.

'From caviar in Moscow to a cupcake in the American Midwest,' joked McCarthy.

'The seller could never have conceived of the life the czarina lived. And the czarina could not have conceived of the life lived by the finder.'

Not surprisingly, the finder intended to sell it immediately.

'A quick turn around,' said McCarthy.

But prospective buyers thought he had overestimated the price. And the buyer was too stubborn to take a loss.

Lucky for him, one night in 2012, the owner typed ‘Egg’ and ‘Vacheron Constantin’, a named etched on the timepiece, into Google.

A newspaper article regarding the egg appeared quoting McCarthy.

Mr
 McCarthy said: ‘He flew straight over to London and came to see us.

'He 
brought pictures of the egg and I knew instantaneously that was it. I 
was flabbergasted.'

Mr McCarthy flew to
 the US to verify the discovery.

The third Imperial Easter Egg was last seen at an exhibition in St. Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922.

Like many of the eggs, this one made the trip to America during the Revolution.

But it wasn't until 2011 that researchers discovered the egg had survived at at all.

The egg had been sold at an auction in 1964. According to Faberge specialist Kieran McCarthy, it fetched far less at the time than it was worth.

It's provenance at the time remained unknown.

Flash forward to recent years and a Midwestern scrap metal enthusiast purchases it for the worth of its gold, watch, and jewels for around $13K at a Rust Belt rummage sale.

The lucky finder snapped a photo of the egg sitting beside a big chocolate cupcake at his home, which sits near a Dunkin' Donuts.

'From caviar in Moscow to a cupcake in the American Midwest,' joked McCarthy.

'The seller could never have conceived of the life the czarina lived. And the czarina could not have conceived of the life lived by the finder.'

But he'll soon find out what the luxurious life is like now that his egg has fetched $33 million.

He said: ‘I examined it and said, “You 
have an Imperial Faberge Easter Egg”, and he practically fainted.’

‘I
 have been around the most marvelous discoveries in the art world, but I
 don’t think I’ve ever seen one quite like this – finding extraordinary 
treasure in the middle of nowhere.’

McCarthy is as surprised as anyone that the egg resurfaced the way it did, but he sees a true American tale in its discovery.

'The treasures are out there. They're not in the stately homes,' he said. 'This is the ultimate success of that spirit.

'It gives hope to us all.'

Wartski bought the egg for a private collector. It is set to be displayed in London from April 14 to 17.

As
 it returns to a anonymous private collection in a city that remains a 
mystery, who knows when the miracle egg will be seen again.

'After that,' said McCarthy, 'it could disappear for another 100 years.'
