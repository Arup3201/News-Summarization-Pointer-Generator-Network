New bank TSB is to be based in England and not its native Scotland ahead of its £1.5billion flotation on the stock market, it emerged today.

The decision by Lloyds Banking Group to domicile TSB in England comes just seven months ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence, which could leave its existing Edinburgh headquarters in a foreign country.

Financial firms have voiced concerns about the impact of independence on their ability to trade with the London markets if Scotland breaks away.

Lloyds is to domicile the new TSB bank in England ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence

The TSB brand was resurrected by Lloyds Banking Group last year to hold the 631 branches it was ordered to sell by European regulators as a condition for receiving a £20billion government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis.

Lloyds is expected to sell between 30 and 50 per cent of its stake in TSB this summer, with analysts expecting the business to be worth up to £1.5billion pounds.

TSB will be put in TSB Banking Group Plc has been registered at Companies House in London and is incorporated in England and Wales, the Telegraph reported.

By contrast TSB Bank Plc  and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are both incorporated in Scotland.

The revelation comes as unionists were warned 
against ‘complacency’ after the pro-independence campaign narrowed the 
gap in the bitter referendum battle.

A
 Survation poll for the Scottish Daily Mail has found that support for 
the break-up of Britain is now at 37.7 per cent among those who say they
 will vote in September’s contest.

That
 is a very slight rise from 37 per cent in the most recent comparable 
polls, carried out by Panelbase and ICM in January and February.

Rock legend David Bowie has 
electrified the debate over Scottish independence, issuing a plea for 
people north of the border to 'stay with us'.

The
 high profile message to voters ahead of September's referendum was 
delivered by supermodel Kate Moss as she collected a Brit Award on his 
behalf at last night's star-studded ceremony.

Politicians
 battling to preserve the United Kingdom seized on the singer's 
comments, but critics were quick to point out that Bowie lives in New 
York.

Reading a statement on behalf of the singer, Moss said: 'Good evening ladies and gentleman, David has asked me to say this.

'In Japanese myth the rabbits from my old costume that Kate's wearing live on the moon.

'Kate comes from Venus and I from Mars, so that's nice. I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male, but I am, aren't I Kate? I think it's a great way to end the day.

'Thank you very, very much and Scotland - stay with us’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told LBC
 97.3: 'I hope we do stay together in the United Kingdom, as does David 
Bowie - one of my great childhood heroes.'

A spokesman for TSB Bank said: ‘Lloyds Banking Group intends to sell TSB Bank via an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014.

‘As part of the process for preparing for the IPO, Lloyds Banking Group has established a new holding company for TSB called TSB Banking Group plc. 

‘The new company replaces an existing company which currently holds TSB Bank in the LBG corporate structure and like this existing company will be registered in London at TSB’s main office.

‘Establishing new companies as part of a listing or IPO process is standard practice.  The Board of the new company will mirror that of TSB Bank.  The completion of the restructure is subject to regulatory approval.’

Lloyds insisted that TSB will remain a Scottish bank because that is where it is licensed.

Voters will go to the polls in the historic referendum on Scottish independence on September 18, 2014.

Homeowners have been warned they face crippling mortgage 
increases of almost £5,200-a-year if an independent Scottish Government 
walks away from its share of the national debt.

Chief
 Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander yesterday said there would be
 a ‘premium’ to borrow from the markets, which would eventually trickle 
down to families and businesses.

After
 Westminster politicians last week ruled out a deal to share the British
 pound with an independent Scotland, panicked Scottish ministers 
retaliated by threatening to refuse to take their share of the UK’s 
national debt - estimated at around £130billion.

Critics
 said the move would horrify the international money markets, destroying
 Scotland’s reputation and leaving the country with a dismal credit 
rating - which would ultimately push up costs for businesses and 
mortgage holders.

Scotland 
would join the ranks of Ecuador, Grenada, Paraguay, Argentina and 
Indonesia as one of the countries that has defaulted on debt since 2000.
 Today, Argentina is still paying its price in the debt markets for its 
last default.

In contrast, the UK Government has not failed to honour its payments since the reign of King Charles II in 1672.

Yesterday,
 Mr Alexander said independent analysis from Jefferies investment bank 
suggests there would be a considerable ‘premium’ for an independent 
Scotland in the money markets if a share of the national debt was 
refused.

“They have 
suggested that under those circumstances there would be a premium of 
more like five percentage points in that default scenario,' he told 
MSPs.

'Assuming a 75 per 
cent pass through from bond rates to mortgage rates would be an extra 
cost of about £5,200 on an average mortgage cost in Scotland. None
 of these things are certain, but you see the range of financial risks 
that come with borrowing under an independence framework.'

One of the big battlegrounds between supporters and opponents has been whether an independent Scotland would be better off.

The financial sector trade body - Scottish Financial Enterprise – this month claimed a Yes vote would mean products and services needing to be tailored to a new regime for tax, consumer protection and regulations.

It would be a major blow for the financial services which employs 100,000 people in Scotland, generating £11.2billion each year.
