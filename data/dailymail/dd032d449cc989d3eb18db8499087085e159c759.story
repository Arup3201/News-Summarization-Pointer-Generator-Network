A tormented 15-year-old told his mother that he'd had enough of being bullied, just before he died of a fatal overdose, an inquest has heard. 

Simon Brooks, from Tonyrefail, South Wales, died in hospital four days after taking a drugs overdose as a 'cry for help' following a row with his best friend over a girl.

Before taking the pills in March this year, the teenager had written a heartbreaking note which blamed bullies for making his life a misery.

After taking the overdose, he told his mother Julie (with whom he is pictured): 'I've had enough of being bullied and pushed around'

At an inquest into his death, the court heard how Simon later told his mother Julie: 'I have had enough of being bullied and pushed around' as he lay in his hospital bed. 

Simon then died from multi-organ failure at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Mrs Brooks, 49, a mother of five, told the inquest: 'He told me that he wished he had not done it and that it was stupid of him.

'He just looked so sorrowful and told me he was sorry.' 

Simon had been taken to hospital in March this year after being found shaking in his bedroom at home.

In a witness statement given to South Wales Police following the death, Mrs Brooks told officers that she had returned to the family home near Pontypridd to find emergency services at the house.

She said her son, a pupil at Y Pant Comprehensive School in Talbot Green, was surrounded by empty packets of medication.  

'To him, heaven was a better place,' she said. 'He knew he would be out of pain and suffering of life. To him, that was a better place to be than here.' 

Mother-of-five Mrs Brooks, 49, told the inquest that her son had told her how he wished he had not done it and that it was 'stupid of him'

But she told the hearing that Simon was not 'a suicidal misery, he was a lovely boy who loved life'.

She said: 'He was not depressed and he was not miserable - he was resilient and brave. Rather than killing himself, it was more about getting out of this life.' 

Simon's family's solicitor, Mari Rosser, described the overdose as a 'spur of the moment reaction' which was 'a cry for help'. 

Close friend Emily Wintle also described how Simon had had a row with one of his friends on the day that he took the drugs. 

He had texted Emily saying: 'I am going to take an overdose - bye.'

When she tried to contact him again, he said: 'Too late' and hung up.

He later told Emily on the phone: 'Emily do you know I am a Christian - I want to go and be with God.'

The inquest also heard from PC Nicholas Hughes, who went to Simon's house. He told the inquest how Simon and his best friend 'had fallen out over a girl'. 

Paramedic David Blacker, who took the schoolboy to hospital, said: 'He said he had been bullied that day and they had tried to force him to fight someone.

'He wanted to die because he had enough of being bullied.'  

Valleys Deputy Coroner Graeme Hughes said Simon's intention is taking the overdose was 'unclear'.

He said: 'The standard of proof should be that it is beyond reasonable doubt.

'I believe there is doubt as his mother gave evidence to indicate he regretted his actions which was corroborated by an entry in his hospital notes.'

He recorded a conclusion that he 'died from deliberate self harm in the setting of unclear intention'. 

After the hearing in Aberdare, South Wales, Mrs Brooks said: 'I am convinced he did not mean to kill himself and I am delighted at the verdict.'  

Mrs Brooks is planning to continue her campaigns against bullying.

Ms Rosser added: 'There were a number of questions that were asked today that were not responded to. Those are things that we are going to need to take further.'

At the time of his death, Mrs Brooks told how Simon had been bullied at his current school and at his previous school in Treorchy, South Wales, where he was allegedly assaulted on a train on the way to school. 

But she said Simon did not want to press charges or complain to the school authorities, because he felt it would only make things worse.

She said: 'He was being pushed about, having his bag grabbed and subjected to verbal abuse.

'He loved the lessons and had a lovely group of friends, but he wasn't being left alone at break times and lunchtimes.

'Every Sunday night he would beg me not to send him to school. During the school holidays he would count the days and hours until he had to go back.

'He was so brave he used to go every day and try to stick up for himself.'
