Seats were still being filled up more than an hour into the funeral service of Nelson Mandela today as soldiers moved in to occupy empty chairs.

Thousands of guests turned up to the service of South Africa's former president which was being held in a giant marquee in his hometown of Qunu in Eastern Cape province this morning.

Empty seats however could still be seen in parts of the marquee more than an hour into the event, which some members of the Mandela family were unable to attend because there apparently was insufficient room.

The ceremony itself overran as political figures gave a series of extended eulogies, meaning that his tribe's tradition that burials should be at noon 'when the sun is at its highest and the shadow at its shortest' had to change.

Guests included senior South African officials, veterans of the fight against white rule and foreign diplomats. Britain's Prince Charles, entrepreneur Richard Branson and former Zimbabwean prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai were also there.

During coverage of the service, the BBC's David Dimbleby discussed the timings and how the service had overran with his studio guests.

Professor Zilibele Mtumane, an expert on African languages and culture, said there could be a complaint from the Thembu clan that the burial took place after midday.

However, he added: 'And I also think some of the traditional practices might have been conducted last evening already. That is why we don't see much of them here.'

Zambia's former president Kenneth David Kaunda gave an unscheduled address at the service.

 89-year-old jogged to the stage to loud cheers before paying tribute to
 Mandela, who he described as 'this great son of the world'.

Elsewhere, stadiums where the funeral was being screened were left unfilled this morning.

According to IOL News, the Lucas Moripe stadium, in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria, was virtually empty.

The stadium was one of a number of venues across South Africa showing live footage of the funeral.

Ellis Park Stadium, in Johannesburg, also reportedly remained empty shortly before 8am while Orlando Stadium had few people in at 7.45am.

The late president died in his Johannesburg home on December 5, aged 95.

His
 body lay in state for three days this week, drawing huge crowds of 
South Africans who mourned his death and celebrated his successful 
struggle against apartheid.

Many
 were disappointed when they could not view his remains because long 
lines and traffic problems meant that thousands had to be turned away 
without paying their final respects.

His
 casket arrived at the family compound from the capital yesterday. It 
was accompanied by an enormous convoy of police, military and other 
vehicles.

Earlier this week, Mandela's great-nephew Mzwandile Mandela – grandson of the former president’s 
brother Maurice, who died last year – had said he was unable get a pass to today's service.

He said: ‘I’m
 sad because I would have liked so much to be there. But they say there are not enough passes for young ones in 
the family.’

Mandela’s 
niece, Gloria Mkwedini, 38, the daughter of his last-surviving sister 
and her family of 16, also said she was unable to attend the event.

She said: ‘It makes us feel like outcasts.'

Local ANC councillor Kwanele Mdikani said: 'If
 Mandela could wake tomorrow, he would be very upset because he would 
have wanted the families of the people he grew up with to be there.'

Preparations
 for Mr Mandela's funeral were marred by a public spat between the South
 African government and retired archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the most
 prominent survivors in the long anti-apartheid struggle.

Mr
 Tutu, a Nobel laureate who has strongly criticised the current 
government, will attend after earlier saying he would not, despite 
wanting to pay respects to his long-time friend.

He had said he was not invited - an apparent snub that the South African government vehemently denied.
