An abandoned dog has been found with a massively swollen head caused by her collar being embedded five inches into her neck.

The mixed-breed dog was found in a Toledo park on Monday with such severe injuries that dog wardens didn't think she would survive the night.

Despite her injuries, which have caused her head to swell, the dog is already responding well to the people taking care of her and has been wagging her tail and lapping up attention.

Raw: The dog has a 3in wide wound around her neck from her collar

'She’s got the sweetest little face, you can’t not feel for this dog,' Lucas County dog warden Julie Lyle said.

She is working with Ohio University's vet department to find a way to treat the wound, with the medical bills being covered by the animal charity Cutie's Fund.

The dog, renamed Princess P, has a wound 3in wide and 5in deep, according to the Toledo Blade.

'It is so deep that you can see her trachea,' Ms Lyle said. 'It surpasses any wound we’ve ever dealt with here.'

She added: 'She was in such horrible shape, I wasn’t sure if she was even going to make it through the night.'

Princess P's face is so swollen because the lymph nodes are unable to drain properly. Because of her injuries, no one is sure what type of dog she is.

Saved: Despite her horrific injuries Princess P is a friendly dog wanting attention, dog wardens say

Dog wardens plan to place her with a rescue group once her initial injuries have been dealt with, so she can fully heal and be found a new family.

Cutie's Fund, a charity that helps pay for emergency care for rescue animals, is helping to pay for Princess P's treatment.

Since it was set up in November, to help a chihuahua, it has raised $46,573 to help fund emergency care for more than a dozen dogs.
