McQueen's sharp suited goths stormed London Collections: Men today presenting the fashion house's offering for AW15. 

With shiny side-parted black hair slicked to a point and pale complexions, the house's sullen models wore velvet jacquard suits with quilted detail, smoking jackets, statement pin badges and long, dramatic overcoats.

Many modelled conventional slim fit slacks but a new trouser length for McQueen was wide and cropped at the calf, which emphasised skinny mankles (that's man ankles).

Peony motifs were a running theme seen on various jumpers and coats while stacked, patent and pointed lace-ups finished off each dark and decadent look.

The show reflected everything Alexander McQueen's presentations have become famous for, such as emotional power and raw energy, and a vintage romantic nature with a highly contemporary edge.

The juxtapositions between fragility and strength, such as the peony with the thick, patent glove, tradition and modernity, fluidity and severity is at the core of the collection.

The odd splash of colour was kept fairly sombre, such as this blue military-style suit, left, and the red petals embossed on a black jumper

McQueen’s collections combine an in-depth working knowledge of bespoke British tailoring, fine workmanship and the impeccable finish of Italian manufacturing.

Sarah Burton was appointed creative director of the brand in May 2010 having worked alongside Lee McQueen for more than 14 years.

The collection had emotional power and raw energy, along with the label's signature vintage references, romance and a  contemporary feel
