A major criticism of electric cars is that they don’t have the style and personality of many petrol-powered vehicles.

The next best thing, therefore, is to take a classic, iconic car and transform it with an electric motor.

That was the thinking behind Zelectric Motor’s David Bernardo who specialises in turning the Volkswagen Bug into a quieter, smoother, battery-powered car.

Harley Davidson began road trials of its first electric motorcycle last month.

At a launch event in New York City, riders took the iconic motorcycle brand's experimental machine across the Manhattan Bridge and through the streets of the city centre.

Like other electric vehicles, the engine on Harley Davidson's Livewire prototype is silent, although the meshing of gears reportedly makes a hum like a jet aeroplane taking off, quietly.

Its 74 horsepower engine has a top speed of 92mph (148km/h).

Mr Bernardo begins by replacing the engines of classic Volkswagen Bugs, built between 1958 and 1966, with electric motors.

Battery packs are fitted under the hood, and behind the car’s rear seats to distribute the extra weight more evenly. 

This means the car’s original balance is maintained, despite the extra 350lb (158kg) weight.

Mr Bernardo, with help from electric car experts at EV West, then increases the car’s suspension and fits stronger brake discs to account for this extra weight.  

Electric cars typically have a 
single-speed transmission, but Mr Bernardo keeps the Beetle’s four-speed
 transmission to allow for manual gear changes – although this is 
optional.

The company has already made a red, and a black prototype, and plans to build models it can sell within the next year. A completed car is expected to cost $45,000 (£26,300).

The car lasts up to 110 miles (177 km) on a single charge, and has a top speed of 90mph (144km/h).

‘Retrofitting a classic with an electric drivetrain just makes good sense,’ said Bernardo. 

‘This makes best use of an existing car rather than using new non-renewable resources to create one from scratch.

‘Investment-grade vintage Beetles continue to rise in value, and when Zelectrified are incredibly smooth, quiet, and super fun to drive.’

Bernardo said he chose models built between 1958 and 1966 because they are the most driveable and collectible Beetles.

Unlike earlier versions, these models are built to handle the increased torque of the Zelectric drivetrain along with more than double the original horsepower.

The only metal modifications that take place during a Zelectric installation are limited to holes to accommodate wiring.

The Beetle was devised by Adolf Hitler who created a plan to solve Germany's unemployment problem by building autobahns for motor vehicles. Work began on the roads in 1933, but the car was not finished until 1939 when production was handed over to the German Air Force. A 1930s Volkswagen ad is pictured

The Beetle was devised by Adolf Hitler who, while in prison in 1924, created a plan to solve Germany’s unemployment problem by building 
autobahns for motor vehicles. 

This involved mass producing a car, which later became the Volkswagen.

Work
 began on the roads in September 1933, but the car was not finished 
until 1939 when production was handed over to the German Air Force at 
the start of the war.  

The original design was for a car with a top 
speed of 62 mph (99km/h), that would transport two adults and three children and 
not cost more than £86.

Hitler also had plans for the styling of the 
Volkswagen, he is reputed to have said: It should look like a Beetle, 
you have to look to nature to find out what streamlining is.’

In 1946, a total of 7,677 Volkswagens had been built and in 1947 this figure rose to 8,987.

By 1948, production had increased to 19,244.

The most famous Volkswagen Beetle is Herbie (pictured) - a 1963 Bug which was the main character in Disney films,  starting with the 1968 film The Love Bug. In the films, Herbie has a mind of its own and is capable of driving itself, and competing in races

Various
 changes were made to the beetle over the years including the removal of
 the split window to a small oval shape, and in 1953 the engine size was
 increased.

In August 1955 Beetle production reached 1 million.

Over the years, larger engines were fitted to Beetles, but the biggest redesigns were made between 1970 and 1973. 

The
 1302 Beetle was designed to overcome criticism of the Beetle's small 
under bonnet capacity, while the 1303 had an increased curved 
windscreen, shorter bonnet and a plastic padded dashboard.

The Beetle reached it's highest ever production total in 1969 when it sold 1,076,897 cars, but after 1971 production fell.

In 1974 
Volkswagen made a loss of
 £142.5 million, the first loss in the firm’s history and it switched its focus to the then new Volkswagen Golf.
