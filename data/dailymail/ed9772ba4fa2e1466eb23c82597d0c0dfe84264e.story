A vicious road rage rant was caught on camera after a motorcyclist pulled up in front of an angry female motorist .

The dash cam footage was captured on a busy Sydney highway by the female driver of the vehicle in front of the incident, who pulled over in a bid to subdue the enraged driver.

But the gesture only angered her further, causing her to hurl her abuse towards the young woman and demand she 'f**king get in your car and f**k off!'

The  footage shows the cyclist pulling up in front of the furious female driver, before she alights from her vehicles and begins the outburst

The angry driver's daughter can also be seen attempting to calm her mother, but she is pushed aside as the woman continues her outburst.

The motorcyclist tries to explain he was 'lane filtering'- moving alongside vehicles that have stopped or are moving slowly-a tactic which is legal in NSW.

But the driver still insists he is in the wrong, screaming about how he nearly caused an accident and should have followed the road rules.

'You f----ing cut me off up there. It's your bike, you should know the rules.'

The woman who offered her assistance asks the motorcyclist to follow her, and she later gave him the dash cam vision

When the driver finally returns to her black 4WD, the woman who filmed the incident asks the motorcyclist to follow her.

They later exchanged details, and the woman offered him a copy of the footage.
