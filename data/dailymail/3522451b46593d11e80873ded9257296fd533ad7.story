The 1.3-inch diameter screen has a 320 x 320 resolution, touchscreen, with 300 ‘nit’ luminance, which should make it bright enough to see in direct sunlight.

The G Watch R measures 1.8 inches (46mm) x 2.1 inches (54mm) x 0.4 inches (9.7mm). 

It connects to any Android phone running 4.3 or higher, via Bluetooth, and can also be controlled using voice commands.

It is powered by a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor and 512 MB of RAM memory, making the device extremely powerful.

The G Watch R additionally comes with 4GB of storage.

LG said the watch will go on sale in October, although price details have not been announced.

As well as being waterproof, the watch features a heart-rate sensor on the rear, but doesn’t have a GPS sensor.

Instead, once it has been synced with a smartphone, the watch can use the phone’s built-in GPS sensor when navigating maps, for example.

This sensor is said to have been left out of the watch to save battery life, and LG hasn't revealed how long its battery will last.
