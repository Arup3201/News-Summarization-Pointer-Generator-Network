Former Sunderland chief executive Roberto De Fanti has hit back at claims made by Paolo Di Canio about his part, or lack of, in the club's recruitment last summer.

Di Canio, who was sacked at the beginning of last season, says he didn't choose any of the 14 players the Black Cats signed before his departure.

But De Fanti has slammed the Italian boss, insisting he 'blames everybody but himself' and that he had his say on every new arrival.

Paolo Di Canio, who was sacked as Sunderland boss last year, claims he didn't pick players to sign in 2013/14

De Fanti told BBC Sport: 'Paolo had the final decision on every player.'

He added: 'He always blames everybody else but himself.'

The comments contradict those of Di Canio, who was speaking earlier on Goals on Sunday. 

and said: 'Not one of those was brought by me.'

'De Fanti and Valentino Angeloni were the two responsible for that technical error, with the maximum support from the chairman, which is Ellis Short.'

The 46-year-old was sacked five games into the 2013/14 season and replaced by Gus Poyet, and despite saving the club from relegation the season before, De Fanti says he didn't believe Di Canio was right for the long term.

He has however, pledged his support to Poyet, despite the 8-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday.

'The biggest mistake of the club's board was not to listen to me and Valentino's suggestion not to confirm Paolo at the beginning of last season,' said De Fanti.

'Paolo was fundamental in saving the team from relegation, but not the right manager to lead what would have been a new group.

Di Canio started well at Sunderland and kept the Black Cats up but was sacked early on the next season

'Cracks inside the locker room were evident already then.'

'Luckily, our suggestion to take Gus was not unheard and he was able to achieve results with exactly the same team as the beginning of the season,' said De Fanti.

'He will also save the club also this year, if he is allowed to work properly.'
