Radicalised: Michael Adebolajo after the brutal murder

Internet giants were last night slammed for refusing to remove extremist websites.

Search engines such as Google and Yahoo must do more to shut down hate-filled sites in the wake of the Woolwich attack, MPs said.

Thousands of videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men are easily available on YouTube.

And within hours of the execution of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, vile messages praising the attack and encouraging further outrages appeared on Twitter.

Police have seized computers since Wednesday’s atrocity and are still investigating if the two fanatics who beheaded the soldier were indoctrinated by online terror videos. Michael Adebolajo, 28, was radicalised by a banned extremist group whose members use the internet to recruit impressionable young men.

Search engines and social media websites say they rely on members of the public to ‘flag up’ incendiary material. But critics last night called for more investment to be used to stop the spread of radical videos.

In other developments yesterday:

Yesterday a search for Al-Shabaab videos on YouTube –  owned by Google – produced 65,500 results. Al Shabaab is the Islamist terror group in Somalia which Adebolajo was attemtping to join last year.

Meanwhile a search on YouTube for videos by Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead ideological leader of Al Qaeda, produced 82,000 results, up from 2,000 three years ago.

Adebolajo's accomplice was seen talking to 48-year-old Ingrid Loyau-Kennett as she calmed the men down to keep the peace

Somalia terror group Al-Shabaab has previously had an account on Twitter suspended after it used it to announce it would kill a French hostage and then said it had done so.

However, the group has opened a new Twitter account and has used it to glorify the Woolwich attack, along with references to the recent bombing of the Boston marathon and gun attacks in Toulouse, France, last year.

It wrote: ‘Toulouse, Boston, Woolwich. Where next? You just have to grin and bear it, it’s inevitable. A case of the chickens coming home to roost!’

The Black flags of Khurasan, a video about the Taliban in Afghanistan which was viewed by the Boston marathon bombers, can be found in 6,200 searches and even the suicide video of Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 bombers produces 132 results.

Last night YouTube said material that is ‘purely of a religious nature’ would remain online.

But Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘Some of the hate messages are particularly dangerous, especially after recent events. We need to find a better way of policing the web.’ Tory MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘This proves more than anything that whenever possible search engines and servers have got to be made to act responsibly. Whenever this sort of thing can be detected we’ve got to close it down.’

Videos of Adebolajo at extremist  rallies have emerged since he and Michael Adebowale, 22, executed Drummer Rigby. One shows Adebolajo alongside hate preacher Anjem Choudary, whose hate-filled rants are all over the internet and who has admitted that both he and the Woolwich killer are on the ‘same ideological wavelength’.

Yesterday Baroness Neville-Jones, a former security minister and chairman of the British Joint Intelligence Committee, said internet hate preaching could have inspired the two terrorists.

‘What we shouldn’t forget is that even if there is nobody else behind it, one of the things which runs through the scene at the moment is the inspiration that comes from internet hate preaching and jihadist rhetoric and this is a very, very serious problem now.’

Colonel Richard Kemp, a former Army commander and terrorism expert, said that ‘one of the biggest priorities’ for the security services should now be looking at the role the internet plays in ‘motivating people’ to commit attacks.

A YouTube spokesman said: ‘YouTube has community guidelines that prohibit dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we have removed a significant number of videos under these policies.’

A spokesman for Microsoft, which runs Yahoo and Bing, said: ‘When we are made aware of any illegal content, we remove it from our services, including our search engine and report it to the police.’ Twitter and Google declined to comment.
