It's traditionally the ideal time to tear yourself away from the sofa and put the kettle on.

But Channel 4 is hoping a little Gallic flavour will encourage viewers to stay tuned during a unique ad break devised to mark the launch of a French zombie drama.

In a UK first, the broadcaster will fill the break with adverts for brands like L'Oreal, Renault and Boursin cheese - all in the language of their native France.

French flavour: Channel 4 is to screen the UK's first ad break broadcast entirely in French to mark the arrival of French zombie series The Returned - or Les Revenants - on Sunday

The adverts will include English subtitles for those not au fait with the language.

It is thought it will be the first time an entire ad slot on UK television has been in a foreign tongue.

A French voiceover will announce the three-and-a-half minute break during the opening episode of The Returned on Sunday June 9, which will be made up of adverts originally shown on TV in France.

Jonathan Allan, sales director at Channel 4, said: 'We're really excited to bring the first entirely French ad break to Channel 4 to herald the arrival of our eagerly-awaited new zombie drama series - it should really make the ads fit within the context of the show and surprise the viewer.'

The Returned, or Les Revenants, is a supernatural crime thriller set in an Alpine village where the inhabitants do not realise they have been dead for years.

The first episode will air at 9pm on Channel 4 on June 9.

Channel 4 plotted another eye-catching advertising stunt back in 2008 when it broadcast a live TV commercial during an episode of Come Dine With Me.

The £500,000 stunt, to promote Honda, saw 19 expert skydivers, all equipped with cameras, leap from a plane and spell out the word 'Honda' as they plummeted through the air.

They had just three minutes and 25 seconds to pull off the series of challenging formations in the skies over Madrid.

The broadcaster said at the time the stunt broke the boundaries of 'the "perceived" confines of TV advertising, which is something Channel 4 is striving to do'.
