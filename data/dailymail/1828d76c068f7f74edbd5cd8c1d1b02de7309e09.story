As he told the perplexed crowd, Tom Arnold hasn't been in the same room as his ex-wife Roseanne Barr for 17 years so when he showed up her Comedy Central roast... even she was lost for words.

The sharp-tongued comic appeared genuinely 
surprised when Arnold took the stage near the end of her taping.

What a difference a couple of decades make: Tom Arnold shocked everyone - including ex-wife Roseanne Barr - by appearing as a surprise guest at her Comedy Central Roast

'We have not been in the same room 
for over 17 years,' 53-year-old told Arnold the audience after taking to the stage.

His roast went against the grain, and the comedian, whose marriage to Barr collapsed in the most acrimonious way possible, waxed lyrical about the star, 59.

After receiving a standing ovation, Arnold wondered out loud: 'Is this really the best format to do this? Getting together with your ex at a roast.'

But Roseanne was clearly touched by his appearance.

'I'd really like to thank Tom for 
showing up. It was very brave and he was very funny,' Roseanne said when
she took the stage to sup up the roast.

However, her acerbic touch had returned and she said of the man she hired to work in a plum role on her eponymous hit show: 'But Jesus Christ how many 
jobs do I have to get that guy?'

Arnold did offer a recap of their 'white-trash Camelot' life together before tackling their sex life and gently poking fun at his former wife's notorious temper. 

Tom had previously ruled himself out of an appearance at the roast, which made it all the more surprising.

And after the couple's acrimonious split, nobody was much surprised.

Tom ended his surprise appearance with
complimentary comments about Roseanne's rise to fame after 
appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, declaring, 'Roseanne, you were my Johnny Carson,' and then thanking her 'from the 
bottom of my heart' for launching his career.

So happy together: The couple married in 1990 and seemed to be made for each other, initially

Ceremonies at the event, and used the opportunity to make a dig at the

Other celebrity roasters included 
Carrie Fisher, Wayne Brady, Ellen Barkin, Katey Sagal, Gilbert 
Gottfried, Jeffery Ross. The Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne airs August 
12 at 10 p.m.

Barr, who now lives with partner Johnny Argent, in Hawaii initially seemed deliriously happy with Arnold.

The couple mud-wrestled for a Vanity Fair cover before showing off their tattooed backsides to a stadium full of '89 World Series fans.

But before long there were reports of screaming rows on the set of Roseanne after its titular star employed her younger husband as an executive producer.

She then fired him on the spot after accusing him of having an affair with his assistant, and before long she filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.

She wrote in the papers: 'I now realize that I have been a classic battered and abused wife.'

'Throughout our marriage [Tom] hit me, struck me, has thrown objects at me, pinched me and verbally abused me.'

This led to a showdown, when he allegedly stormed onto the set to confront her, scratching and hitting four people before he was finally escorted off the premises.

Roseanne also demanded a restraining order against Tom. 'I am extremely afraid for my physical safety,' she said. Her petition was granted.

Arnold later claimed that he and Roseanne were fine and that she was unaware of the charges made by her lawyers, but admitted they had slanging matches on set.

His relationship with assistant Kim Silva also caused problems, despite her being so close to Roseanne that they offered up a mock three way wedding.

Friends of the couple also doubted the claims of abuse and Roseanne herself recalled that she became detached from reality during this period.

Comedy Central will be cutting a joke told by Jeffrey Ross at the roast when it airs because it refers to the Aurora shooting and alleged murderer James Holmes.

Ross was heckling fellow comedian Seth Green when he compared him to the alleged shooter.

'Seth, congratulations. This is actually a great night for you,' Ross said according to the Hollywood Reporter. 'You haven't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in Aurora.'

Seth Green was also there to roast Barr and was picked out by Ross for his red hair. Ross was comparing Green's hair to the dyed orange hair of James Holmes.

Ross went on to say that he was only joking. He then added, 'You are not like James Holmes. At least he did something in a movie theater that people remember!'
