Pawned: David James Montgomery, 58, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of him and a young girl

A Maryland man faces charges after child pornography was found on a CD left in a laptop he pawned, authorities say. 

On September 10, David James Montgomery, 58, of Hagerstown, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of a preteen girl.

Montgomery was arrested Thursday and is charged with possession of child pornography, soliciting a subject for child pornography, permitting a subject to take part in child pornography, and child pornography depicting a sex act, according to Washington County District Court records. If found guilty, Montgomery could spend 35 years in prison, the total maximum sentence for the four charges.

The Herald-Mail Media reports that a pawn shop employee found the CD in Montgomery's laptop and 'expected it to be music.' 

He then played it in another computer and saw that the CD contained a video of Montgomery 'directing a young girl to do sexual things.' 

Police began to investigate Montgomery after being called to the Washington Street Pawnbrokers in Hagerstown and, after investigating the incident, authorities obtained a search warrant for Montgomery's residence where they reportedly found other media and discs. 

Montgomery turned himself in and admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the girl nor did he share the videos which were all allegedly recorded August 2. 

Montgomery reportedly told investigators that he had forgotten he left the videos on his computer. 

Admitted: Montgomery admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the young girl nor did he share any of the videos

Herald-Mail reports that the preteen victim has been interviewed by police and Montgomery could face additional felony charges when the grand jury reconvenes. 

Assistant Public Defender Elizabeth Steiner told the Herald-Mail that Montgomery has no criminal record and asked the judge to place Montgomery on home detention, or make his bail unsecured or lower it, at a hearing on Friday.

Montgomery's bail remains at $125,000 and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19.
