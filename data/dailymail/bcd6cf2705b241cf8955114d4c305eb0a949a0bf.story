Hope Solo, goalkeeper for the U.S. women's soccer team, has been arrested for allegedly striking her sister and teenage nephew during a dispute at her home in Seattle, police said.

Police who responded to a 911 call at Solo's house in Kirkland a little after midnight on Saturday morning could hear noise from the 'disturbance' from the street, according to a police statement.

Solo, 32, appeared intoxicated and upset, police said, and her 17-year-old nephew and adult sister were visibly injured.

The football star was hosting a party at her house when the dispute took place, the Seattle Times reported.

Solo is being held without bail in a local jail, on two charges of domestic violence assault in the fourth degree, according to the jail's inmate registry, where she is listed by her married name, Hope Amelia Stevens.

Representatives from U.S. Soccer and Solo's professional Seattle team, Reign FC, both said they are aware of Solo's arrest but declined to immediately comment further on the situation.

Her husband, Jerramy Stevens, is a former National Football League player for the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Just a few hours before their wedding in November 2012, police arrested Stevens on the belief that he had assaulted Solo, but he was released because of insufficient evidence, and charges were never brought, according to media reports.

Solo has appeared as a contestant on ABC television's Dancing with the Stars and has played on two women's soccer teams that won Olympic gold medals.

It was not clear whether Solo had a lawyer. Solo is due to appear in Kirkland Municipal Court on Monday.
