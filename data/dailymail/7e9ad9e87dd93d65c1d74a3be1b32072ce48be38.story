The Scots think of Irn-Bru as their national soft drink and for a long time it has been marketed under the slogan: ‘Made in Scotland from girders.’

Well, England’s Laura Trott, 5ft 4in and eight stone if she’s had a hearty breakfast, was made in Essex from tungsten.

That’s certainly how it felt after the 22-year-old took an astonishing gold medal in the points race just days after being diagnosed with a kidney infection that left her feverish and barely capable of walking, let alone holding her own in the velodrome.

‘After the week I’ve had, this is right up there with the Olympics,’ she said moments after victory, sweat pouring off a diminutive frame that looked even smaller after her illness.

Beaming, she added: ‘I am so over the moon right now, it’s so hard for me to describe.’

1. Laura Trott (England) - 37 points

2. Elinor Barker (Wales) - 37 points

3. Katie Archibald (Scotland) - 33 points

Trott’s 
medal on the last night of cycling here was the second and final track 
gold for England at these Commonwealth Games, indeed the second and 
final one for the home nations combined, the para-cycling events aside. 
England’s Sophie Thornhill and Scotland’s Neil Fachie won two each of 
those.

Trott’s
 boyfriend and England team-mate Jason Kenny failed to make the keirin 
final, while compatriot Jess Varnish had to settle for sprint bronze.

As such, Trott’s gutsy glory went some way to saving face for the English (and British) as the  Australians turned the tables.

At
 London 2012, Team GB won seven of the 10 available golds on the track, 
and Australia just one. Here, Australia won seven of 13 track golds and 
England two. 

Glaswegians
 appreciate a bit of grit and, my goodness, they  witnessed it as Trott,
 a double Olympic champion from London 2012, drew on all her mental and 
physical reserves to snatch victory in the final yards of a 
25-kilometre,  32-minute race.

‘The crowd were just unreal,’ Trott said. ‘When it came up on the screen that I’d won and they went mad, I was just so happy.’

This
 was cat-and-mouse stuff, 80 laps of ebb and flow punctuated by 10 
frenetic sprints. By the time it was over, the crowd was almost as 
feverish as Trott had been when she registered 38.9 degrees on her team 
doctor’s thermometer in the early hours of Friday.

Even
 though the home hope, Katie Archibald, was beaten into third place, the
 level of appreciation for Trott from a largely  Scottish crowd was 
deafening.

‘I
 can’t believe it,’ Trott said. ‘I felt so bad at times in that race. I 
am just so glad I managed to get into that final sprint. I wouldn’t say I
 am 100 per cent. I haven’t eaten properly for the last two days. I have
 been living off porridge and I am not even a porridge fan!’

Points
 are accrued from the 10 sprints spread across the race and, as Trott 
crossed the line after 31 minutes and 48 seconds, she had amassed 37, 
the same as Elinor Barker of Wales and four more than Archibald.

The
 only thing that separated Trott from Barker in the final  reckoning was
 the order they had finished in the final surge. Archibald won that, and
 Trott was just ahead of Barker.

Trott
 is shaping up to be one of Britain’s greatest female Olympians. No 
other British woman has more than the two Olympic golds she won in 
London and at her tender years she has multiple Games, and likely golds,
 ahead of her.

Here,
 however, she flopped because of her illness in Friday’s individual 
pursuit, not making it past the qualifiers, and was only 11th in 
Saturday’s scratch race.

‘I was so devastated the night before the individual pursuit, because I knew something was wrong,’ she said.

‘I
 couldn’t sleep that night. I went to the doctor and said something’s 
wrong. He said there wasn’t. I said there definitely was!

‘My back was really hurting. I went to see him the following morning and he diagnosed me with a kidney infection.

‘This
 morning I woke up and I was hungry. I actually wanted food. I knew it 
was going to be a good day. I had a good feed on the way up, rested as 
much as I could and  it paid off.’

The
 race was intense, Trott taking the lead for the first time with just 20
 laps to go after winning the eighth sprint of 10. In that final frantic
 dash, even as she crossed the line, she had no idea whether she had 
succeeded. In fact, she believed Wales’s Barker had pipped her to glory.

‘I
 cycled up alongside Elinor and said, “Well done, Commonwealth 
champion”,’ she laughed. ‘Then it came up and I thought, “Oh c**p, she’s
 going to think I said that on purpose”.’

Shane
 Sutton, in charge of the English team here but also the supremo of 
British Cycling, insisted last night that these Games were not a 
disappointment for his riders —  and all would be well at the 2016 
Olympics.

‘I know we can be the best we can be in Rio,’ he said. ‘I know we’ll be ready. We’ve got a great team.’

But
 he also admitted that the British riders did not undertake the full 
taper preparation that the  Australians had done, and that he told Trott
 before her race: ‘It’s all about Rio for you. Go and enjoy it.’

She certainly did.
