ASIO is currently investigating thousands of terror leads and suspects, with at least 400 people being deemed high risk, it will be announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday.

This is double last year's figure, and Mr Abbott will also warn that Australia is heading for a 'long-term era' of heightened terror threat, when he announces the appointment of a National Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator.

In a major secutiry speech, the prime minister is also expected to announce the creation of new strategies for counter-terrorism, following a review of Australia's current defence, Fairfax reported.

The review, separate to the one into the Sydney siege whose findings were released on Sunday, will show that 'Australia has entered a new, long-term era of heightened terrorism threat, with a much more significant home-grown element,' Mr Abbott will say, according to Fairfax.

In a speech to Parliament on Monday Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce new counter-terrorism measures and a National Counter-Terrorism Coordinator 

'It assesses that the terrorist threat in Australia is rising. On all metrics, the threat to Australia is worsening,' he also says, according to Fairfax.

The prime minister is expected to announce an increase in funding for national security agencies, and present a more cohesive plan that would see state and national efforts brought in alignment.

Plans to strip dual citizens of their citizenships should they present as a terror threat and a crackdown on extremists groups are also believed to be included in Monday's address.

The public will have more information available to them about the country's current terror threat - which now sits at high - so they can better understand the system and its levels. 

On Sunday when Mr Abbott released the review into the Sydney siege, he said that a shift in the balance between individual freedoms and community safety. 

'There is an ongoing and inevitable debate in a country such as ours … between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community,' he said.

Mr Abbott may also reveal that another attack, like the one carried out by Man Haron Monis (pictured) is likely

'My judgment is that – while having always to respect both – the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn.' 

Meantime The Australian reported that Mr Abbott will also announce that another terrorist attack is likely given the current climate.   

This comes as the review into Sydney's Martin Place siege was released, revealing crazed gunman Man Haron Monis 'slipped through the cracks of the system'.

Despite an apparent 18 calls to ASIO in the days leading up to December 15 when Monis took 18 people hostage in the Lindt Cafe, authorities had deemed him as not a threat.

The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege.

The new counter terrorism mechanisms are aimed at stopping home grown terrorists like Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar

The announcement will come a day after an review into the Sydney siege was released

'Plainly, this monster should not have been in our community,' Mr Abbott said.

'The difficulty is that while he was well and truly on a lot of radar screens, he was routinely assessed as not being a threat to himself or to the community.

'Plainly, at some stage he did become a threat. We obviously do need more checks and more scrutiny in the visa process, in the citizenship process.'  

The new counter-terrorism measures set to be announced on Monday are going to deal increasingly with 'home-grown terrorists', like Australia's most wanted jihadists Mohammed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf.

The review found that despite multiple reports to ASIO about Monis, he slipped through the cracks of the system to hold hostages for nearly 17 hours on December 15 and 16

Sharrouf and Elomar both fled Australia to join the Islamic State insurgents fighting in Syria and Iraq in 2013 and in July 2014 the Australian Federal Police issued arrest warrants for the disturbed pair.

Sharrouf flew out of Sydney in December 2013 using his brother’s passport and was soon followed by his convert wife Tara Nettleton who brought their five children to the Middle East with her. 

The men gained notoriety as part of the more than 100 Australians who have joined Islamic State after they posted disturbing photos of themselves holding up decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers last year.

Sharrouf even got his seven-year-old son to hold up the severed head of a soldier in the Syrian city of Raqqa, accompanied with the caption 'that's my boy', in an image that shocked the world.
