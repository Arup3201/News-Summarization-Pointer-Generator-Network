It took more than 15 minutes to persuade these puppies to stand still for a family photograph, but as the results show it was worth the wait.

The border collie puppies are looking for new homes but visitors at the Big Sheep farm and theme park in Bideford, north Devon were treated to a glimpse of the park's latest arrivals.

Staff were on hand to help the dogs into position but the youngsters clearly found it difficult to be centre of attention and contain their energy.

Their front paws were lifted up on to a low fence by staff, who quickly ran out of shot.

They then stood behind photographer Richard Austin and made noises to try to hold the puppies' attention - though perhaps they might have preferred a snack as a bribe.

Some looked a tad bored by proceedings, resting their snouts on their paws and gazing into the distance.

The puppies were born to one of the farm's working sheep dogs and will be ready to move in with new owners in a few weeks' time.

The distracted dogs were in need of a helping hand from staff to try to get them in the right pose
