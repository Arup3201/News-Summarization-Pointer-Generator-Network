Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier serving a 35-year sentence for leaking a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks, has spoken out from his military prison cell in Kansas to warn Americans that they are being lied to about Iraq once more.

In a remarkable New York Times Op-Ed piece written from behind bars, Manning said she believes the 'limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.'

Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after beginning sex-reassignment treatments, also defended her leak of 700,000 secret documents - the largest leak of U.S. intelligence in history.

'I understand that my actions violated the law. However, the concerns that motivated me have not been resolved,' she wrote.

'As Iraq erupts in civil war and America again contemplates intervention, that unfinished business should give new urgency to the question of how the United States military controlled the media coverage of its long involvement there and in Afghanistan.'

President Barack Obama said this week he was 'looking at all the options' to halt the offensive that has brought militants within 50 miles of Baghdad's city limits, but ruled out any return of U.S. combat troops.

Obama has been under mounting fire from Republican critics over the swift collapse of Iraq's security forces, which Washington spent billions of dollars training and equipping before pulling out its own troops in 2011.

While the US military was upbeat in its public outlook on the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary elections, suggesting it had helped bring stability and democracy to the country, 'those of us stationed there were acutely aware of a more complicated reality,' Manning wrote.

'Military and diplomatic reports coming across my desk detailed a brutal crackdown against political dissidents by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and federal police, on behalf of Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki. Detainees were often tortured, or even killed.'

Critical: Manning's piece has claimed that the US is lying to Americans about Iraq

Manning, a former US Army intelligence analyst, said she was 'shocked by our military's complicity in the corruption of that election. Yet these deeply troubling details flew under the American media's radar.'

She claimed she and other U.S. soldiers were ordered to help the government of President al-Maliki root out dissenters, including intellectuals who simply criticized the government's policies. The U.S. military referred to such dissenters asÂ  'anti-Iraqi.'

Criticizing the military's practice of embedding journalists, Manning charged that 'the current limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.'

Manning pointed at that at any given time, there were no more than 12 journalists embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq - a nation of 31million people.

'In contrast to the solid, nuanced briefings we created on the ground, the news available to the public was flooded with foggy speculation and simplifications,' she wrote.

She also added that contractors were hired to vet journalists for embed based on how likely they were to produce favorable coverage.

Furthermore, the military uses the threat of pulling a journalist's embed at any time to help quash negative reports and convince journalists to self-censor, she claims.

Manning is serving out the prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and had requested a name change after court-martial proceedings revealed the soldier's emotional turmoil over sexual identity.

A US Army general denied clemency to Manning in April, upholding the 35-year sentence.
