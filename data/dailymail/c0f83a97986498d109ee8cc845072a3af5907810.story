Sorry, Kate, you've officially been replaced as the nation's most emulated style icon by your 8-month-old baby boy.

Much like his mother, Prince George is already proving to be something of a trendsetter with his choice of outfits. Designers of the clothes he has worn on his first Royal Tour are reporting a huge surge in sales thanks to the 'George effect' and it's showing no sign of abating.

Today sees the tiny trendsetter strike again as the Annafie romper suit he wore on his arrival in Sydney earlier appears to be 
totally sold out, with negative stock in all sizes and shipping times of
 2 months.

Tiny trendsetter: The white Annafie romper suit Prince George wore today on his arrival in Sydney has already sold out

The young prince looked 
dapper in his nautical themed romper suit as he disembarked an 
Australian Airforce jet in Sydney on Wednesday.

In the arms of his doting parents Prince William and The Duchess of Cambridge he was blissfully unaware of the furore he caused.

It's a sell out! The garment appears to be totally sold out, with negative stock in all sizes and shipping times of 2 months

Spot the difference: Princess Diana was photographed with baby William wearing a similar outfit to George

Within seconds of them arriving in Australia, Twitter was awash with commentary about his ensemble.

Many speculated that the romper came from European baby clothes boutique Annafie. 

Meanwhile others believed that it looked like a dress. One commentator remarked: 'Wonder how much George's dress was?

While another stated: 'Prince George 
proves the smocked romper suit with peter pan collar has never gone out 
of style for royal babies.'

But the cool, calm and collected prince appeared more than comfortable in the white romper with sailing boat embroidery and it seems the world wants to emulate his style.

This Debenhams duplicate is over half the price but just as cute (see

This isn't the first time that George's wardrobe choices have sold out.

His Rachel Riley smocked romper 
sold out in almost all smaller sizes since his appearance in them on 
Wednesday and following the family's portrait for Mother's day this year, when the prince 
sported a baby blue number with 'George' emblazoned on his chest, personalised baby clothes retailer 
My1stYears.com sold 1200 jumpers in just four hours.

The Prince George effect has also brought a welcome boost to the high street as copycat clothes fly off the shelves.

The
 youngest royal is busy winning hearts and fashion-followers on his tour
 down under as his classic wardrobe of dungarees, shorts and traditional
 knitwear sends sales of lookalike outfits soaring back home.

 navy sailing boat dungaree set with matching top, Â£20, from J by Jasper
 Conran at Debenhams has almost sold out in smaller sizes after baby 
George was pictured wearing a similar luxury branded pair costing more 
than three times the price at his first major public engagement in 
Wellington, New Zealand, last week.

As
 a result of Baby George's recent fashion choices, traditional baby boys
 clothing has seen an overall increase of 62 per cent with navy 
dungarees sales doubling in less than a week.
