Everton have announced the signing of 18-year-old defender Brendan Galloway from MK Dons for an undisclosed fee.

The England youth international has signed a five-year-contract with Roberto Martinez's side and will join up with the club's Under-21 squad.

Galloway made a total of 17 appearances for the Dons last season and has been hailed as the next Rio Ferdinand by those that watch him play regularly.

Toffee: Brendan Galloway has signed a five-year contract with Everton

The Zimbabwe-born player has been capped by England up to Under 19 level. Those who have watched him play regularly say he is in the mould of Rio Ferdinand.

Was the youngest player ever to take to the field for MK Dons, aged just 15, when he came on as a substitute in 2011.

He also became the youngest player in MK Dons' history to feature for the club when, at the age of 15, he made his debut as a second-half substitute in a 6-0 FA Cup victory over Nantwich Town in November 2011.

The defender to Everton's official website: It means an awful lot to me coming to such a great Club.

'I'm now looking forward to learning off some of the more senior players - the likes of Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka.

'Long-term, I also want to get in the Everton team and play week in and week out in the Premier League and play in a team that's doing well, which I know we will do.'
