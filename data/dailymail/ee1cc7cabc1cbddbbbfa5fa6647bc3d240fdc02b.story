Cesc Fabregas has revealed Xavi will be the next big star to leave Barcelona this summer.

Fabregas ended his three-year spell at the Nou Camp to rejoin the Barclays Premier League with Chelsea.

And now he believes Xavi will be the third big name to leave, after Carles Puyol also ended his career with the Catalan giants.

‘Xavi and (Carles) Puyol have decided to step aside, to be closer to their families and to move to a less demanding environment,’ Fabregas told Spanish newspaper Marca.

Xavi has been linked with a move to Qatari side Al-Sadd in recent weeks, with reports saying that the new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is planning wholesale changes at the club ahead of next season.

If he were to join Al-Sadd he would be linking up with his former Spain teammate Raul, who joined the Qatari club in 2012 after leaving Bundesliga side Schalke.

Hands off: The midfielder could join Wesley Sneijder in exiting one of Europe's top leagues pre-retirement

The 34-year-old’s current deal at Camp Nou runs until 2016.

Xavi has won seven Liga titles and three Champions League since making his first team debut for Barcelona in 1998 and has played more than 700 times for the Catalan giants.

In the wake of Fabregas’ move to Chelsea, Barcelona moved quickly to snap up Croatia international Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla, on a five-year deal.
