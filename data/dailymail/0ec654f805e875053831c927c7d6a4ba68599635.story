Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is thinking about helming a Supreme Court challenge to the National Security Agency's recently uncovered program of phone and Internet surveillance of its private citizens.

The government's monitoring program called Prism was launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to prevent future terrorist activity.

Paul spoke out in the wake of the program coming to light, claiming that Prism is an invasion of citizen's civil liberties and announced his intention to get voter's signatures on a class-action lawsuit which he will bring to the Supreme Court.

Republican Senator Rand Paul announced his intention to bring a class-action suit to the Supreme Court against the government's Prism program, which monitors citizen's phone and Internet records

A Libertarian Senator, Paul supports less government and claims that the phone and internet monitoring program is an infringement American's right to privacy,

'The Founding Fathers didn’t want that,' he told Fox News Sunday. 'I think the American people are with me. Young people who use computers are with me.'

On the news program Rand unveiled his plan to urge all Internet and phone providers to ask their customers to join in in a class-action lawsuit.

'If we get 10 million Americans saying we don’t want our phone records looked at, then maybe someone will wake up and something will change in Washington,' he said.

The information surveillance program was exposed last week by The Guardian, who released details of the top secret court order issued to Verizon in April, requiring that the company turn over phone records to the government on an 'ongoing daily basis.'

Rand Paul announced on Fox News Sunday that he would like to bring a Supreme Court challenge against the government's phone and Internet surveillance program of its private citizens

The court order mandated that the company give the numbers of both parties on the call, their locations, call duration, and the time the calls were placed, though the call's contents were not revealed or recorded.

The telephone company was told to record their subscribers information whether they were suspected of a crime or not, resulting in roughly three billion phone records being turned over a day.

'That doesn’t look like a modest invasion of privacy,' Paul told Fox. 'I have no problem if you have probable cause … but we’re talking about trolling through a billion phone records a day.'

One of Paul's biggest objections to the program is that the government is using a general warrant to obtain the data, as opposed to a specific warrant targeting specific suspects.

Paul argued that this violates the Fourth Amendment with prevents unreasonable search and seizure of citizens.

He also alleged on the program that the massive amount of data gathering is actually hindering the government's targeting of terrorists, as they are overwhelmed by the volume of audio conversations and cannot pinpoint specific criminal correspondence.

President Obama defended the government's surveillance program saying 'you can't have 100 per cent security and also 100 per cent privacy'

Paul first spoke out against Prism when it was brought to light last week, calling the NSA's program an 'astounding assault on the Constitution,' The Huffington Post reported.

He condemned the Obama administration, calling his government 'authoritarianism,' and criticizing the new surveillance tactics as being harsher than anything President Bush used during his time in office

'The irony is that people voted for President Obama hoping for something different,' he said. 'That's why a lot of people I think are disappointed in the president.'

Meanwhile, the President and several Senators have come out in defense of the information monitoring.

'You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience,' Fox News quoted President Obama as saying. 'We're going to have to make some choices as a society.'

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke in favor of the information monitoring programming claiming that it helped to keep America safe against further terrorist attacks

'Terrorists will come after us if they can and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence, senator Dianne Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a press conference. 'It's to ferret this out before this happens. It's called protecting America. I think people want the homeland kept safe.'

Washington officials have acknowledged that all branches of the federal government were aware of the Prism act being carried out over the past few months under the Patriot Act, the Huffington Post reported.

However Paul still has strong objections to the way in which the government has been gathering its data against terrorists.

'I've been saying for a long time that we ought to obey the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,' The Huffington Post reported that Paul said in a statement.

'I'm all for going after terrorists, I'm all for going after criminals, but I think you go to a judge and you ask for a warrant specified to a person. You shouldn't look at millions and millions.'
