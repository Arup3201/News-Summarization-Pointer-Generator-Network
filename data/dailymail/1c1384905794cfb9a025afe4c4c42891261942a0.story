A letter from Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon begging the Pope to block their divorce is expected to fetch up to £35,000 at auction.

In the note dated October 3, 1529, the Spanish-born Queen asks a cardinal from her home country to seek the pontiff’s help in halting the king’s bid to annul their marriage because she had failed to produce a son.

Pope Clement VII’s eventual refusal to grant the divorce led to a schism with the Roman Catholic Church, with Henry appointing himself head of the Church of England.
