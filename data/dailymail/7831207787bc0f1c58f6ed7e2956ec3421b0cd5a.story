A dog with a bizarre love of surfing is using her skills as a form of therapy for war veterans, children and the disabled.

Golden retriever Ricochet was originally turned down as a guide dog as she kept chasing birds so owner Judy Fridono tried to find another way she could help people.

And when she discovered her pet's hidden talent she realised it could help cheer up those less fortunate.

Owner Judy Fridono took her to the beach near their Del Mar home in California, USA, where Ricochet opted to do more than just doggy paddle.

After proving to be a natural on a board, she decided to share her dogs skills with others.

Together they have raised tens of thousands of pounds and have more than 200,000 likes on Facebook.

Judy, executive director for puppyprodigies.org in San Diego, said: Most people say they can't think of words to describe how they feel when surfing with Ricochet. 

'She's able to communicate in a language left unspoken and allows people to feel at ease while healing - through surfing - is taking place.

'Another common thread among those she interacts with is that their confidence improves from spending time with Ricochet,' her owner added.

'Whether she is surfing with the kids, people with disabilities, or wounded warriors, everyone involved says it's an experience of pure joy.

'The most noticeable thing about Ricochet is how she is able to instantly connect and develop a deep heart-to-heart bond with everyone on the first interaction. 

'She has an ability to mirror other people's emotions, and has a soft, caring and nurturing personality. 

'She also won't let someone stop petting her.'
