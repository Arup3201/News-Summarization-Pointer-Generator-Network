Gareth Bale has been taking more than his fair share of flak from Real Madrid fans this season but supporters of the club's basketball team would surely welcome him with open arms.

That's if the Wales forward's performance during the NBA halfcourt challenge is anything to go by.

Bale followed in the footsteps of his former Tottenham team-mates by taking on the challenge and scored an incredible three shots out of five from halfway, bettering anyone from the north London club.

Bale leads the list of footballers to take part in the challenge ahead of Demba Ba, Petr Cech, Andre Schurrle, Geoff Cameron and Brad Friedel, who all managed just one.

The 25-year-old missed with his first attempt but found his range with the second before narrowly missing his third shot after the ball bounced off the rim.

But Bale hit the target with his final two attempts to round off a hugely impressive display before throwing the gauntlet down to team-mate Luka Modric and Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton.

Bale's fondness for basketball stemmed from a holiday in Miami.

'(Miami Heat) were playing in the Finals and just from then I have been really intrigued by it and enjoy watching it,' Bale said.

'Just from there I have supported the Heat and obviously LeBron James being there before was a big reason in that.'

Bale also selected his NBA dream team, and named himself among the starters.

'Peter Crouch for a nice bit of height in the team, Luka Modric for the playmaker, Yaya Toure for the lungs of the team for the back and forth and Brad Friedel. Brad's got the safe hands, he's American, knows the game and he can control everything.'
