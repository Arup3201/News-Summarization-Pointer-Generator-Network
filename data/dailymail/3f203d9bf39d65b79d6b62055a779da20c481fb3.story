Paul Scholes has signed a four-year deal to become a pundit on BT Sport.

The Manchester United legend will be one of the channel's star analysts for their Barclays Premier League coverage this season and he will also be heavily involved in BT's offering when they assume the rights for UEFA Champions League football from the start of the 2015-16 season.

Grant Best, senior channel executive producer of BT Sport, said: 'Paul has proved himself to be a forthright and astute pundit since he hung up his boots.

'His recent opinions have been every 
bit as tenacious as his tackling on the pitch. It is fantastic that we 
have been able to sign up a legend like Paul to offer a unique insight, 
based on a record of consistent success at the highest level of the 
game.'

Scholes has also penned a deal to join ITV Sport to help with their coverage of the Champions League.

The 39-year-old, famously reserved in his days as a player for United and England, has come out of his shell since retiring from professional football in the summer of 2013 and he wrote a weekly column for the provocative bookmakers Paddy Power during the World Cup. His critique of former team-mate Wayne Rooney and England's performances in Brazil dominated the news agenda last month.

Will he stick the boot in? BT and ITV will hope Scholes is as combative in the studio as he was on the pitch

Scholes outlined his potential as a broadcaster in a surprise punditry appearance on Sky Sports when Manchester United sank to a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City at Old Trafford in March. He criticised the performances of his former club under David Moyes and also argued that the signings of Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata had fallen below expectations.Â 

He then proceeded to offer a brutal 
assessment of Arsenal's credentials and suggested that Jack Wilshere had
 not progressed over the last few years, with the midfielder so shaken 
by Scholes views that he called him up to discuss how he can progress as
 a player.

Scholes' debut on BT could be for their first live Premier League match of the season when former club United host Swansea City at Old Trafford in Louis van Gaal's first official match in charge - although the channel will also be showing the Community Shield between Arsenal and Manchester City one week earlier.

Scholes remains a paid ambassador at Old Trafford and United manager Van Gaal is keen to find him a role in the youth coaching set-up, although an agreement is yet to be reached.
