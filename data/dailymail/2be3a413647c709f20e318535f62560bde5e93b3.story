When Gerald Flint swooped into tornado-ravaged Henryville in his special operations flight suit, the townsfolk thought the relief they so needed had finally arrived.

Allegedly claiming he was with Homeland Security, the 53-year-old took charge immediately, heading straight for the emergency supply depot to begin work.

But when supplies appeared to go missing suspicions were aroused.

Behind bars: Gerald Flint was arrested after he allegedly claimed to be working on behalf of Homeland Security

Doubts
deepened when Flint began coordinating whip-rounds for his donation 
fund, but demanded all cheques to be made to cash, residents claim.

Residents in the Indiana town called police and Flint was promptly arrested. He has now been charged with stealing supplies and impersonating a government official. He denies all charges.

'[He] portrayed himself as some kind of commander, an on-scene commander,' tornado relief volunteer Jerry Lucas said.

Other residents said he also claimed to be working for an aid agency called Volunteer Medics Worldwide.

'We got his truck loaded up, his trailer up and off they go,' Rose 
Aycock, director of the local Covenant Cooperative Food Pantry told ABC News.

But at his court hearing this week, 
Flint remained defiant saying he never claimed to be from Homeland 
Security and vowed to clear his name.

In an interview from his prison cell,
he told ABC News that he had been 'climbing the ladder' at the 
government agency and that it was his duty to report the things he saw.

But authorities said this claim was not true.

Before his arrest, Flint, who is a military veteran with medical evacuation background,  had allegedly flown all around the world tending to disaster-hit areas.

The
Volunteer Medics Worldwide website is peppered with photographs of 
Flint performing medical examinations on patients in disaster zones all 
over the world.

But when asked if he has a medical degree by ABC, he relied: 'I can't answer that.'

The organisation's website, bannered with the quotation, 'Nothing beats stronger than the heart of a volunteer',
claims to have helped relief efforts in disaster zones all over the 
world, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Haiti and 
post-tsunami Japan.

Henryville local volunteer Kevin Coley said while the town had felt 'duped' by Flint, he added that it 'feels good' that another town will not fall for the same trick.

Flint pleaded not guilty to the charges in court, telling the judge he had served his country faithfully and wanted to clear his name.

He will reappear in court for a second hearing in May.

The case continues.
