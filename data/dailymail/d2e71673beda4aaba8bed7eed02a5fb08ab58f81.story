A fugitive oligarch who accused Prince Andrew of accepting £15million worth of laundered money for his old family home was yesterday ordered out of France.

Judges in Aix-en-Provence, in the south of the country, said Mukhtar Ablyazov, 50, should be extradited to Ukraine or Russia to face fraud charges.

He was arrested in July following a raid by French special forces on his luxury rented villa near Nice after being accused of siphoning off billions from his home country of Kazakhstan.

Fraud charge: Ablyazov is accused of having embezzled billions of dollars

As part of his defence at a London 
trial, Ablyazov said Sunninghill Park, the 600-acre Berkshire estate 
where Prince Andrew used to live with his ex-wife, the Duchess of York, 
and their two daughters, was bought with suspicious funds from 
Kazakhstan.

At one stage, Ablyazov wanted to call Andrew as a defence
 witness in court – something which would have caused the prince huge 
embarrassment because of his role as Britain’s international trade 
ambassador.

Sunninghill was sold to Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law 
of the president of Kazakhstan, for £15million in 2007, despite having 
been on the market for £3million less.

Ablyazov said he had documents
 which linked the purchase with the sell-off of a £110million stake in a
 state-owned oil and gas company in Kazakhstan.

There was no suggestion that Andrew would have known the source of the funds, and he did not appear in court.

Ablyazov
 is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan on fraud charges worth 
£3.6billion. He disappeared from Britain in February 2012 just before 
being sentenced to 22-months in prison for contempt of court in a 
financial fraud trial.

Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts

He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets.

Armoured
 vehicles and a military plane were used in the raid on Ablyazov’s French
 home because he was known to have a ‘private militia’ at his disposal.

Ukraine
 wants him extradited to face charges over an alleged £100million scam 
while he was chairman of the BTA Bank from 2005 to 2009.

Mr Justice 
Teare, sitting in London’s High Court last year, said Ablyazov was 
accused of ‘fraud on an epic scale’ and had committed ‘deliberate and 
substantial’ contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to 
stop money vanishing.

The conviction was upheld at the Court of 
Appeal in November 2012, where Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov 
had shown ‘rare cynicism and deviousness’ as he fought the claims 
against him.

Yesterday Peter Sahlas, a lawyer for Ablyazov, said: 
‘This court wants to send Ablyazov, a refugee, straight to the very 
people he should be protected from.’

The banker’s wife, Alma 
Shalabayeva, added: ‘For my husband, extradition is a death sentence. If
 he is extradited, he will never see me or our four children ever 
again.’

But a spokesman for the BTA bank welcomed the French 
decision, saying it ‘demonstrates once again that Mr Ablyazov’s repeated
 attempts to portray himself as being pursued by the bank for political 
reasons are groundless’.

Kazakhstan does not have an extradition treaty with France – hence Ablyazov having to be sent to Ukraine or Russia.
