Change of heart: Kerry Washington wore a coral Miu Miu gown to the Oscars

Django Unchained star Kerry Washington risked upsetting film mogul Harvey Weinstein by not wearing his wife's fashion label to the Oscars.

According to the New York Post the actress was meant to wear a 'stunning' custom-made Marchesa gown created by Mr Weinstein's other half and A-list favorite, Georgina Chapman.

But she decided to ditch the dress last-minute in favor of a crystal-embellished Miu Miu frock.

Miss Washington attended the Oscars to present and because her most recent film Django Unchained, produced by Mr Weinstein, was up for several awards.

One fashion industry source said: 'Isn’t it career kamikaze to upset Harvey’s wife on such an important night?'

As well as jeopardizing her career Miss Washington may also have damaged her relationship with Ms Chapman.

The two have been longtime friends and 
regularly attend social events together.

In 2009 they made a grand entrance to the 
Music Unites Fall Masquerade in New York wearing matching tutu-like Marchesa 
designs.

At Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles only one photograph released from the event shows them together.

In the shot Ms Chapman and Mr Weinstein are seen sharing an awkward conversation with Miss Washington at the dinner table during the Governors Ball.

However Miss Washington wasn't the only actress who appeared a Weinstein-produced film but did not to wear Marchesa to the ceremonies.

Jennifer Lawrence, the star of Silver Linings Playbook, shone in a stunning strapless Dior Couture gown.

But as the newest face of Dior the brand was a fitting choice.

Stars who did wear Marchesa at this year's Oscars included Olivia Munn, Chinese actress Fan Bingbing and Georgina Chapman herself.

It is the second time Miss Washington has worn a Miu Miu design to a red carpet event this year.

At the 2013 Golden Globes she stepped out wearing a shimmering nude-colored design.

A Marchesa representative declined to comment on Miss Washington's Oscars dress choice.
