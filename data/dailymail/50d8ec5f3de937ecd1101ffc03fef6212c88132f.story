Lizzy Yarnold surged to victory in the first race of the World Cup skeleton season in Lake Placid on Friday.

In her first race since claiming Olympic gold in Sochi in February, Yarnold finished 0.77 seconds clear of Canadian World Cup debutant Elisabeth Vathje after recording the fastest time in each of her two runs.

Yarnold is the hot favourite to retain her overall World Cup title following the retirement of her closest rival, American Noelle Pikus-Pace, in the wake of the Sochi Games.

But Yarnold said: 'With it being the start of the season I was a bit apprehensive that I wouldn't be quick enough or think quick enough.

'There have been so many retirements that it's not the same as before, but these younger athletes are so good so I knew I had to bring my best performance, which I did.'

Yarnold now faces a flight back across the Atlantic in order to be present for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in Glasgow on Sunday night, for which she is one of 10 nominees.

She will then return to north America and bid to continue her winning streak at the second World Cup of the season in Calgary at the end of next week.

Yarnold's Great Britain team-mate Rose McGrandle dropped one place on her second run to finish in sixth place with Laura Deas further back in 12th.
