It was a lifestyle that promised peace, love and seclusion from the wickedness of the 'outside world' - but this week a family of 14 walked out of a remote community declaring they had been living in a 'false system'.

The family, many of whose children were born in the Gloriavale Christian Community in Haupiri - on New Zealand's west coast - have moved 200 miles away to live with a 'normal' family as they begin reintegrating into society, the New Zealand Herald reports.

Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children.

'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday.

The adults have forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while the children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. 

When it was revealed that the large family had walked out - following other groups who have left in recent years - donations of money, clothes, furniture, toys and books, began to pour in to help them get back on their feet.

The father, identified only as James, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job.

The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'.

But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail.

The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship.

Their website states the couple 'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can "marry" them'.

The marriage procedure is as follows: 'Then they go to a private place pleasantly prepared for love-making. As they consummate their marriage before God, He joins them together in a bond that only death can break.'

'They return as a married couple to a wedding feast with the rest of the Church.'

The cult has several sources of income which includes dairy farming and deer farming.

Gloriavale consider home births to be significant events with about 35 babies born each year, according to their website.

Speaking of the family of 14 who have recently walked out, Ms Gregory said they had 'come to believe they were in a false system and have left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known.'

She added: 'They are hugely courageous…they are very excited about starting life out here.

'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' 

Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.'

A former member, Phil Cooper - who is the son of leader Neville 'Hopeful Christian' Cooper - told the Greymouth Star last year that he knew of two or three families that have left in recent times.

He said that young people growing up at Gloriavale were cut off from the outside world and when they left they were not allowed to keep in touch with those left inside the community.

This, he told the paper, had left people 'devastated' because of the emotional pain of people not being able to see their own mother again.

Young people who had grown up at Gloriavale 'don't know anything else,' he said.

'My kids (living on the 'outside') have strong faith - they chose that. But (Gloriavale children) know nothing else.'

Peter Righteous, spokesman for the Gloriavale Christian Community, told the New Zealand Herald that they did not comment on people who had walked out.

'We haven't got time to be caught up in a lot of nonsense,' he said. 'We have a life we must live before the Lord.

'If people do not want to live an unselfish life of service to the Lord, it's up to them. They can do as they wish.'
