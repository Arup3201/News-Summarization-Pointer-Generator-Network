A paranoid schizophrenic who chopped off his mother’s head because he thought she was a witch has admitted manslaughter today.

Daniel Coriat, 44, beat 76-year-old Elizabeth Coriat to death before mutilating and decapitating her body.

She was discovered at the flat she shared with her son in Taymount Grange, Forest Hill, southeast London, last March 24.

Psychotic: Daniel Coriat beat his mother Elizabeth to death before decapitating her body

Coriat was discovered hiding inside a litter bin at nearby Forest Hill railway station shortly afterwards.

When questioned by police, he claimed his mother was a witch, later adding: ‘You saw the body when it was taken away. It didn’t look human.’

Coriat was due to stand trial for his mother’s murder, but prosecutors accepted a plea to a lesser charge of manslaughter.

Prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC said he was a paranoid schizophrenic and medical experts agreed he was suffering a psychotic episode at the time.

The killer, who has a previous conviction for attacking a three-year-old boy in a buggy in a random street attack, will be sentenced tomorrow. 

Coriat denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.The murder charge was left to lie on the court file.
