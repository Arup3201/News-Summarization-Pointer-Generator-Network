Pan’s People pin-up Dee Dee Wilde told a court yesterday that Dave Lee Travis was a ‘pussycat’ with whom she felt ‘very safe’.

Wearing leopard-print stiletto heels, the 67-year-old said Travis was a ‘big bear of a man’ who would often give her cuddles.

She said she never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour from the former Radio 1 DJ, 68, who is accused of indecent and sexual assault.

Former Pan's People dancer Patricia 'Dee Dee' Wilde - pictured yesterday (left), and in her youth (right) - told the court that unlike Jimmy Savile, whom she found 'very creepy', Dave Lee Travis was 'an absolute pussycat'

Miss Wilde said that dancers were used to men being over-familiar but said she had no trouble from Travis

However, she said some of his  
colleagues did make her feel uncomfortable, including Jimmy Savile who 
would lick her hand as he kissed it.

Miss
 Wilde, a founding member of the dance troupe Pan’s People in 1966, was a
 regular on Top Of The Pops when Travis was presenting.

Travis (pictured yesterday outside court) was a 'big pussycat' and a 'lovely man', Miss Wilde said

Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, she said: ‘When I first met Dave I thought “what a lovely man he is”.

‘The
 thing about Dave is, he is a big bear of a man. If he came up and gave 
you a cuddle you felt very safe with him, unlike other DJs. He was a 
pussycat. He was a consummate professional, totally together.

‘For
 a DJ, the profile of being  on Top Of The Pops was very  important so 
you did your best  on it. I think Dave was one of the most gentlemanly 
and nicest DJs who appeared.’

When
 asked if she had witnessed any inappropriate behaviour by Travis, she 
replied: ‘Absolutely never. Because we were there 52 weeks of the year, 
we were on the premises so frequently, if something had gone on we would
 have heard about it.

‘There were a couple of DJs and a producer, who I won’t name, who were always mentioned.

‘If
 something had gone on it spread like wildfire, but never once did I 
hear anyone say Dave had behaved in an inappropriate manner.’

Miss Wilde said Travis’s behaviour was in stark contrast to Savile’s. ‘I didn’t like him at all, he was creepy,’ she said.

‘As
 a woman I didn’t feel like comfortable in his presence. He would pick 
up your hand and kiss it and lick it at the same time, quite revolting.

‘As
 a young dancer you just got on with it. It was very different in those 
days. Things that were acceptable then are not acceptable now.’

Earlier,
 Elisabeth Birks told the court how Travis had taken naked photographs 
of her in his home in 2010 while her husband sat in another room.

Travis
 met the musician at a charity event in south-west London, and asked if 
he could take her picture after he spotted a tattoo on her back.

She said Travis was ‘very, very professional, very polite’ and made her ‘feel very comfortable’.

An
 ex-BBC producer also told jurors how Travis and his fellow DJs were 
frequently mobbed by young female fans, who were dubbed ‘trainspotters’ 
by Corporation staff.

Timothy
 Blackmore MBE, giving  evidence in defence of Travis, said: ‘There was 
an enormous amount of excitement when Radio 1 was launched. For the 
first time, young people could listen to pop music all day long.

'It was very different in those days. Things that were acceptable then are not acceptable now'

‘The
 result was many of the DJs became elevated in the national  
consciousness to practically the same level as the people whose music 
they were playing.

‘There 
was always a crowd outside the headquarters of Radio 1. They were asking
 for autographs most of the time or to have their photos taken. There 
was a great deal of enthusiasm to meet their heroes.

‘I
 remember trying to rescue Tony Blackburn from a crowd and I had a very 
hairy drive to get Noel Edmonds away from a crowd who wanted to tear 
every limb from his body.’

Travis,
 of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who is being tried under his real name 
of Dave Griffin, denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual 
assault. The trial continues.
