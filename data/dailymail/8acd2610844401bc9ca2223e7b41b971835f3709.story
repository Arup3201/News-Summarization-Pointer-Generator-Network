England's front-row resources could be stretched alarmingly during the autumn Tests after it emerged that two injured Lions props are destined to miss the four-match campaign.

Leicester’s Dan Cole and Mako Vunipola of Saracens are both in rehabilitation after serious setbacks and neither is expected to return to action until November. On that basis, they will not be in contention to play for the national team against Southern Hemisphere visitors New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster is due to name his elite player squad in October. He and his assistants must prepare to be without Cole — the country’s premier tighthead, who has had neck surgery — until the Six Nations.

Missing: Dan Cole will play no part in England's schedule this autumn and is expected to return in November

Blow: Mako Vunipola of Saracens (centre) is also out after dislocating his knee in the Heineken Cup final 

Headache: It isn't ideal preparation for England coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the autumn Tests 

At the launch of the Aviva Premiership season, the Tigers’ director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘Coley has had the all-clear from the surgeon to ramp up his training and that was a week ago. He should be fit about 12 weeks from that date, so we’re hoping Dan will be playing again in 10 or 11 weeks, but we will see. We will give him as much time as he needs. The disc that has been replaced will be stronger than the one he had in there in the first place.

‘We will listen to the specialists to make sure that when he comes back, he is good to go. It would be nice to have him back within the 12-week timescale but if it’s a month later, two months later or he doesn’t play until April, it is what it is.

‘It’s far more important that he gets his neck absolutely right rather than come back a bit early and have issues with it. Stuart Lancaster is very sensible about it. Coley will be ready to play when the specialist deems he is ready and not before.

‘The disc has been replaced. It is a metal disc — there’s a plate and a ball-and-socket joint inside. He has been letting the bone heal and has done nothing at all for a few months, but now he can start doing some cycling, some running, some light weights and gradually build himself back up.’

Cole, 27, has played 45 times since he made his debut at the 2010 Six Nations Championship, as well as representing the Lions in 2013 as a substitute in all three Tests against Australia. Bath’s David Wilson has stepped into the tighthead role, backed up by Henry Thomas of Sale Sharks.

Vunipola had an operation after dislocating his knee during last season’s Heineken Cup Final — an injury which ruled him out of England’s tour of New Zealand. The 23-year-old loosehead is on the mend but Saracens won’t expect him to regain full fitness for some time.

The club’s director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: ‘Mako has an injury from the European final. He’ll be out for a while — until November possibly. But he has no chance for the autumn internationals.’

Meanwhile, Saracens also expect to be without England fly-half Owen Farrell for the start of the Premiership season as he continues his comeback from a knee injury which ended his own tour involvement.

‘Owen is coming back,’ added McCall. ‘He may miss the first couple of games of the season but we’ve got Charlie Hodgson there so we have cover.’
