Cristiano Ronaldo goes in search of the all-time European Cup goalscoring record in Bulgaria’s Vasil Levski stadium on Wednesday with coach Carlo Ancelotti admitting: 'He is the best player I have ever coached.'

The words of praise came with Ronaldo just three goals from Raul’s Champions League scoring record of 71.

The man Manchester United fans tried to tempt back with a 20ft banner and a light aircraft at the weekend has 68 Champions League goals and is homing in on the former Real Madrid captain’s haul.

Former Manchester United ace Ronaldo is currently three goals behind former Real Madrid striker Raul

1. Raul - 71 goals

2. Cristiano Ronaldo - 68

2= Lionel Messi - 68

4. Ruud van Nistelrooy - 56

5. Thierry Henry - 50

6. Alfredo Di Stefano - 49

7. Andriy Shevchenko - 48

8. Eusebio - 46

8= Filippo Inzaghi - 46 

10. Didier Drogba - 42 

For mere mortals the gap might be too big to bridge in one match but having already scored 25 hat-tricks in his career Ronaldo has a chance to equal that other famous Madrid No 7 on Wednesday night.

Messi is also chasing down the record and drew level with his footballing nemesis after scoring against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.

Ronaldo overtook Messi last season scoring 17 goals in 11 games in Real’s Champions League-winning campaign, including a penalty in the final. 

He has scored 53 goals in 52 games in Europe for Madrid, vastly improving his average at  United. Ancelotti joked before the game. 'His greater strike rate is all down to me playing him in a position where he can score more goals he knows that.'

At the weekend Ronaldo made a mockery of the idea that he might be slowing down as he approaches his 30th birthday by breaking the 20mph barrier in his run that led to Real's second goal on Saturday.

Madrid doctors believe he is back operating at the same speeds as before the injury problems that marred his end to last season and also inhibited him during the World Cup.

He has had difficulties with his left knee and his left hamstring and he has already missed one game this season – Real Madrid’s away defeat by Real Sociedad. But the sprint against Villarreal seems to suggest he is back to his explosive best.

It’s not the first time this season he has shown his athletic prowess – he leapt to over 2.6 metres for the headed goal he scored in Real Madrid’s 8-2 win over Deportivo recently. It’s little wonder United fans keen on his return don’t seem too worried about the fact that he will turn 30 next February.

His goal at the weekend meant he had reached 10 goals in a league season earlier than any player in the club’s history and faster than anyone in La Liga since Pahinho for Deportivo in 1954.

Madrid’s opponents Ludogorets nearly took a point from Liverpool in their opening group game and play their first home match in the Champions League.

They do so without genuine home advantage, however, because their 6,100 capacity Ludogorets Arena does not meet UEFA’s minimum requirements and so they must play 324 km away in the national stadium in Sofia.

Around 5,000 fans will make the five-hour trip to watch their team and many of the the remaining 40,000 tickets have been snapped up by Bulgarian supporters in the capital as anxious to see Ronaldo as they are to see how Ludogorets fare.
