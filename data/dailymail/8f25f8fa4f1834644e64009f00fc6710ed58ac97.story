Andy Murray had his chances but he was eventually outfought, and seemingly outkidded, by Novak Djokovic to lose his fourth Australian Open final.

His long-time Serbian rival appeared to play with Murray’s mind by acting as if he was physically down and out at times, before miraculously reviving to ultimately carve out a 7-6 6-7 6-3 6-0 victory.

The pair had run themselves to a standstill by the end of the second set when, with two-and-a-half hours already on the clock, Murray fought back to level by winning the second tiebreak.

But just when he thought he might have cracked the world No 1 he revived to come back and clinch the third set, which always looked like deciding the match.

It was not unlike their meeting at the US Open quarter-final stage last year, but this match was especially notable for the way that Djokovic went through two particular spells looking like he was on the brink of collapse.

Oscar nominee or genuine difficulties? It can be hard to tell with Djokovic, and the same question has dogged Murray on occasions.

The first spell was early in the second set and the other most crucially, was at the start of the third, when Murray went an early break up. Both times Djokovic recovered from stumbles and strange body contortions, displaying a previously seen capacity for suddenly rallying after being in distress.

And both times it seemed to play with Murray’s mind, as he appeared distracted by what was going on at the other end of the court. He will already have known that he had created chances to prevent Djokovic registering what is an eighth win out of nine over him.

Djokovic received treatment on his hand during the first set and for a while was shaking his head as though he couldn't continue 

He led the first set tiebreak 4-2 before double faulting, and missed a straightforward forehand volley at 5-5 that would have put him in front. It was when he led early in the third set, however, that he looked in the best position to win. For the second time the Serb was breathing extremely heavily, while his legs buckled from under him on several occasions.

When all is said and done a huge difference was their second serve. Djokovic won 62 per cent of his and Murray only 34 per cent. For all the progress he has made with Amelie Maursemo that remains an achilles heel for the very best to exploit.

By the time the last set came around the 27-year-old Scot was spent, and it all ran away quickly from him.

This will be a shattering blow to Murray, although anytime you play well enough to reach a final it is an achievement in itself. He has definitely turned a corner this fortnight, but will make the long journey home wondering what might have been.
