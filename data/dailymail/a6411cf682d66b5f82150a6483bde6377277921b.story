Edinburgh city has ruled out a proposed 'bed tax' on tourists for the second time after a cool response from the Scottish Government and local hotels.

Local authorities contacted Scottish ministers to discuss a voluntary 'transient visitor levy' which would impose an additional fee for every night's stay in Edinburgh.

But concern over the reliability of income and whether enough hotels, B&Bs and guest houses would sign up saw the plan stall.

Edinburgh city chiefs scrapped plans to tax tourists visiting the city extra per night for the second time 

A proposal of a compulsory tax - which would have added between £1 and £2 per night to a room bill - were backed by the council in 2011 and they say up to £10 million could have been raised for festivals, venues and conference centres.

The tax, however, would have needed new legislation to pass through the Scottish Parliament and ministers weren't responsive to a potential backlash against the move.

City officials are now considering whether to create a Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID), which would see hotels pay levies to fund urban improvements.

Tristan Nesbitt, chairman at the Edinburgh Hotels Association (EHA), said: 'The compulsory tourist levy was dropped as it was not deemed a fair, suitable and efficient way to raise additional funding.

Funds raised from the 'bed tax' would have raised money for local festivals and venues

'Those same reasons still apply to the business environment today and it is difficult to see how a voluntary scheme would be feasible or desirable by members of EHA.

'We would also worry that this additional cost could make Edinburgh even less price competitive as a destination to travellers on top of some of the highest VAT taxes and Air Passenger Duties in Europe.'

But festival promoters said it was unlikely large numbers of high-paying overseas tourists would be put off by a bed tax, particularly during the Fringe.

Scottish Highlands Council is considering a similar fee but VisitScotland has urged against it

Tommy Sheppard, director of The Stand comedy club said: 'I think it might have a deleterious effect on the weekend break market, particularly in the off-peak months.

'But in terms of peak demand, I don't think it would present a great barrier compared to the considerable charges already being levied, and it creates a pot of money that's ring-fenced for visitor improvements.'

Council finance leader Alasdair Rankin, said: 'The idea of a voluntary Transient Visitor Levy has now been ruled out, however Marketing Edinburgh continues to explore options around a TBID for the city.'
