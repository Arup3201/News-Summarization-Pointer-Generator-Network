The Prince of Monaco arrived at the Red Cross Gala Ball with two royal belles in blue on Friday.

Albert, 55, was joined by his wife, Princess Charlene of Monaco, and his sister, Princess Caroline of Hanover, for the 65th Annual Ball at Monte-Carlo's stunning Sporting Club.

Charlene, 35, danced the night away with as her husband twirled her around on the dance floor and the couple slow danced and laughed together.

The former swimmer, who represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, showed off her elegant sculpted shoulders and youthful decolletage in a strapless, shiny bright turquoise gown.

Charlene Wittstock's satin dress was accessorised with just a glamorous pair of diamond chandelier statement earrings - and a bouquet of flowers. Her blonde highlighted hair was swept back in a romantic wavy up-to.

Princess Caroline, 56, opted for a more demure dress in striped cream and navy dress with sequin lace overlay and short fitted sleeves. She wore navy stud earrings and silver bracelets to complement her look.

The Prince of Monaco, Albert II, opted for a cream dinner jacket, white shirt, black bow tie, trousers and shoes.

The event comes in just one week after the Monégasque royals attended another glamorous gala - the annual 
Love Ball.

As the family came out to celebrate again, this time at the sumptuous Salle des Etoiles, Prince Albert's sister once again joined the royal couple to celebrate not only the Red Cross Gala Ball but also her daughter  Charlotte 
Casirgahi's birthday. She turned 27 yesterday.

The evening's entertainment was provided by a music set by French DJ Bob Sinclair.

He joined singer 
Michael Bolton, TV presenter China Moses and Monaco's minister Michel 
Roger on the VIP guest list.

Built by Albert's father Prince Rainier III, The Sporting Club has 
hosted the gala ever since its foundation in 1948 which was presided 
over for many years by his consort, Princess Grace.

Following Princess Grace's death Albert's sisters Princesses Caroline 
and Princess Stephanie took up the post, often attending with
Caroline's children Charlotte, Andrea and Pierre Casirgahi. However this year only Caroline was able to make the event.

Since last year's Red Cross Ball, much has happened for the Grimaldi family.

Princess Caroline's first grandchild arrived on 22 March, when her son 
Andrea and Tatiana Santo Domingo welcomed new baby Sacha into the family.

Last month, Princess Charlene finally put rumours to bed over the 'turbulent' start to her marriage in a rare Interview.

The Princess proclaimed the tears streaming down her cheeks at her wedding to Albert in 2011 were not, as reported, the result of a series of rows over his womanising ways, but in fact tears of happiness.

She described this speculation, as well as rumours she attempted to escape in the days leading up to her wedding, as 'categorical lies'.

'Everything was just so overwhelming 
and there were all the mixed emotions because of the rumours, and 
obviously the tension built up and I burst into tears [immediately after
the ceremony].

'And then I burst into tears some more because I was thinking 'Oh no, now the whole world has seen me cry''.

Despite the slew of negative headlines that marred her big day, Europe's newest royal wife has happy memories of her wedding.

'It was such a wonderful three days,'
she told the Times Weekend Magazine. 'Even months afterwards I would 
get flashbacks and think, 'Oh my goodness, did I really have the Eagles 
playing at my wedding?'

'I think back and wonder how we 
managed to pull it off. There was a lot going on. It was beautiful; it 
was sentimental, showing my most intimate moment to the world.'

The couple were in undeniably happy spirits at this weekend's ball.
