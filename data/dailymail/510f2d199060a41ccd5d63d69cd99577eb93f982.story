Iain Duncan Smith today insisted he could live on as little as £53 a week as he defended wide-ranging cuts to welfare which take effect today.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Coalition's benefits reforms would allow people to 'break free' of welfare dependency.

But when challenged on whether he could live on £7.57 per day, Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'If I had to, I would.'

The former Conservative leader told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are in an economic mess. We inherited a problem where we simply do not have the money to spend on all the things people would like us to do.

'What I am trying to do is get this so we don't spend money on things that are unfair.'

A number of controversial measures take effect today, including the so-called 'bedroom tax' which will see social housing tenants penalised if they have spare rooms.

In a fiery early-morning exchange, a market trader named David Bennett who says he is dependent on housing benefit complained that his net income is no more than £53 a week.

Mr Duncan Smith, who married into an aristocratic family, is now paid £1,581 a week - although he is believed to have received benefits after leaving the Army in the early 1980s.

Economist David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, tweeted: 'Wonder how IDS would buy clothes shoes heat on 53 quid a week? Barely enough to buy food I assume. Rent?'

By this afternoon, more than 10,000 people had signed an online petition calling for the minister to prove his claim by living on £53 a week for a full year.

Mr Duncan Smith said today that the 
housing benefit bill had doubled in 10 years under Labour, and a quarter
of a million people were living in overcrowded social housing.

'What
I am trying to do is at least use the money we have got to be fair,' he
said. 'What we are trying to do is get control of the welfare bill... 
without actually slashing or attacking people, we are trying to reform 
and change it.'

The Cabinet minister said his target was 'restructuring the culture so that people always find that work pays'.

'Full-time work is where you break free of the welfare system. That is the critical element,' he said.

'These
reforms, yes they are about holding back on the costs. But really 
critically this government will look back and people will say this is 
modernising a welfare system.'

As
well as the 'bedroom tax', welfare reforms coming into effect this 
month include a 10 per cent cut in council tax benefit, a rise in most 
benefits limited to just one per cent, and an overall cap on total 
benefits of around £26,000.

The
combined effect of the cuts will leave the average family £5,000 worse 
off than three years ago, according to research released today.

Labour frontbenchers have attacked the Coalition's measures, which shadow chancellor Ed Balls denounced as 'possibly the worst, most cack-handed and massively unfair piece of policy-making I've ever seen'.

Economist David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, tweeted: 'Wonder how IDS would buy clothes shoes heat on 53 quid a week? Barely enough to buy food I assume. Rent?'

Liam Byrne, Mr Duncan Smith's opposite number, said: 'This wicked bedroom tax is going to rip neighbour from neighbour, force vulnerable people to food banks and loan sharks, and end up costing Britain more than it saves as tenants are forced to go homeless or move into the expensive private rented sector.'

David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, told the Observer yesterday: 'The bedroom tax is one of these once-in-a-generation decisions that is wrong in every respect.

'It's bad policy, it's bad economics, it's bad for hundreds of thousands of ordinary people whose lives will be made difficult for no benefit – and I think it's about to become profoundly bad politics.'
