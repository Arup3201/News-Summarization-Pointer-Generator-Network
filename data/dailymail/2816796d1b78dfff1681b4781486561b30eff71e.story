Gary Giordano - the man held in Aruba 
over the disappearance of missing Robyn Gardner - arrived home in the 
U.S. today after he walked free from an island jail Tuesday.

The 50-year-old businessman was taken
into custody four months ago after his lover vanished during a five-day
trip to the Dutch Caribbean island - but he was free to leave on 
Tuesday night.

Giordano arrived in Miami shortly before 
noon Wednesday on an American Airlines flight accompanied by his attorney Jose Baez, who represented Casey 
Anthony in her murder trail this year.

Back in America: Gary Giordano arrived in Miami today after spending four months in an Aruban jail on suspicion of involvement in the death of Robyn Gardner. He could still be extradited back to the Caribbean island

After and before: Giordano is pictured leaving jail, left, and arriving at jail in August, right - with a lot more hair

A video of Giordano leaving jail, before he was seen in an SUV with his lawyers wearing a baseball hat, showed him with remarkably less hair than was previously seen in his mugshot and older videos.

Giordano, a Gaithersburg, Md., resident denies any wrongdoing over Miss Gardner's disappearance. He was freed after a judge ruled authorities lacked 
enough evidence to continue holding him. Prosecutors have appealed and 
await a ruling.

Giordano said nothing as he got off the plane. He, Baez and another man 
and woman went into American Airlines' private club. It was unclear if 
Giordano was awaiting another flight.

Giordano will appear on ABC's 'Good Morning America' on Thursday to tell his side of the story.

He was told investigators still consider 
him a suspect, an Aruba appeals court could put him back behind bars as 
early as today and the island's chief prosecutor proclaimed: 'This is 
not over'.

Aruban defense attorney Chris Lejuez said that his client did not plan on waiting around for Wednesday's hearing.

Lejuez said he did not know Giordano's immediate destination but said it
would either be Miami, New York or home to the Washington area. 
Although Giordano was free to leave the island, a spokesman for the 
prosecutor's office said he could be extradited back to Aruba if 
necessary.

Baez said Giordano, the divorced, 50-year-old owner of an employment 
services business, is looking forward to returning home to spend time 
with his family.

Missing: Ms Gardner is said to have met Giordano on a swingers' website and they travelled together to Aruba on July 31

Lovers: Giordano, right in Miami today, claims Robyn Gardner disappeared while they were snorkelling

Baez said on ABC's 'Good Morning America' that Giordano wants to spend 
time with this children and plans on trying to 'reassemble his life' 
after nearly four months in jail.

Mr Baez said: 'We're hoping that of 
course this is the end of it. However, he's not running. So if they have
a legal basis to require him
to come back, he's going to come back.'

Giordano has said that Gardner, a 35-year-old from Frederick, Maryland, 
was swept out to sea while they were snorkeling in the late afternoon 
Aug. 2 off the southern tip of Aruba

Jose Baez propelled himself to become one of America's most high-profile defence lawyers after the Casey Anthony murder trial.

The 43-year-old led the team who successfully defended the Florida mother accused of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008.

He was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in New York City and Florida with his single mother.

Mr Baez ran two bikini companies then became a qualified lawyer in 2005 before the landmark  Anthony case consumed all of his time.

Prosecutors said they were still 
trying to build a case against him and will seek his extradition if an 
appeal's court ruling issues a reversal and orders the businessman back 
to jail.

‘Gary Giordano is happy to be out of 
prison, yet he is very uneasy,’ said his Aruban attorney, Chris Lejuez. 
‘He still feels something could go wrong and he could be back in 
prison.’

‘The case does not end here,’ Aruba's solicitor general Taco Stein said. ‘Mr. Giordano will remain our prime suspect.’

Aruban law allows for pre-trial 
detention while authorities investigate a crime, but it is subject to a 
judge's review and the threshold of evidence necessary to hold someone 
increases as time goes on.

A judge ruled last week that 
prosecutors had not met the requirement and ordered the release of 
Giordano, who is from Gaithersburg, Maryland.

The appeals court agreed to hear 
prosecutors' challenge to the order at a closed hearing on Wednesday, 
and authorities expect a decision later in the day.

Giordano has been a suspect since 
August 5, three days after reporting to police that Gardner was 
apparently pulled out to sea while they were snorkelling off the 
southern tip of Aruba.

Her body has never been found despite 
extensive searches, leaving investigators with only a circumstantial 
case that a crime was even committed.

Home sweet home: Gary Giordano's house in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It is unclear where he will go now, but his lawyers said if he was extradited back to Aruba he would return

‘The prosecution conducted extensive 
investigations that either confirmed his story or brought up nothing 
relevant to the case,’ Mr Lejuez said.

‘Up to this moment there is no proof whatsoever that a crime has been committed or that Giordano may have committed a crime.’

Mr Stein added: ‘The investigation must have yielded enough evidence to draft a charge. And we are not in that position yet.’

The case has been compared to that of 
Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who disappeared on Aruba in May 2005 
on the last night of her high school graduation trip to the island.

Her body was also never found and the 
prime suspect was detained for months before he was eventually released 
for lack of evidence.

Kelly Reed, a cousin of Ms Gardner's, 
said the family hopes attention to the case will generate a lead that 
will help investigators resolve the case.

Out at last: Giordano made an emotional phone call from his hotel room after his release in Aruba

‘Needless to say, our family is very 
disappointed that even after all this time, we are no closer to finding 
out what happened to our Robyn,’ the cousin said.

‘We trust that the FBI and the Aruban authorities will continue their fervent efforts to investigate her disappearance.’

Giordano, the divorced owner of an 
employment services company, first drew suspicion with what 
investigators felt were inconsistencies in his account of Ms Gardner's 
disappearance.

Later, they learned he had taken out a
$1.5million accidental death policy on her, which Mr Stein said was 
viewed as a possible motive.

Ms Gardner's friends and family also 
had serious doubts about her disappearance, saying it was unlikely the 
35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, would have gone snorkelling 
anyway.

The pair had gone travelling with each
other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on a swingers' website called
Adult Friend Finder and were last seen at an island bar at 4pm on 
August 2.

Last sighting: Ms Gardner, 35, leaves the Rum Reef Restaurant in Nanki with Giordano on August 2

CCTV video emerged showing them having
a violent fight hours before she disappeared. He allegedly threatened 
to kill his friend while grabbing her by the neck and shoving her into a
lift.

'The case does not end here. Mr. Giordano will remain our prime suspect'

Taco Stein

A team of cadaver dogs from the 
Netherlands were brought in at the end of September but were 
unsuccessful in the search of the Dutch Caribbean island.

Police also investigated a National 
Enquirer report that she was buried alive in a dog’s grave dug up by her
lover who taped a plastic bag over her head.

Aruban law allows authorities to hold 
someone as a suspect while they investigate an alleged crime. It is 
common for people to be held for months before being released without 
charge.

Free: Gary Giordano was released from prison in Aruba earlier this evening after being held for four months as the only suspect in the disappearance of Robyn Gardner

His American lawyer, Jose Baez, said 
in the defence team was grateful for the judge's ruling and that 
Giordano was 'excited to return home to his family in the United 
States'.

'Needless to say, our family is very disappointed that even after all this time, we are no closer to finding out what happened to our Robyn. We trust that the FBI and the Aruban authorities will continue their fervent efforts to investigate her disappearance'

Kelly Reed

Now in the U.S. he is free to file a claim to redeem the American Express travel insurance 
policy he took out on Ms Gardner.

American Express could not confirm 
Giordano has such a policy but said anyone making such a claim would 
have to produce documentation such as a death certificate and any police
reports.

No claim would be paid if it turned 
out there was fraud or 'anything untoward' that would void the policy, 
an American Express spokesman said.

Mr Stein said authorities have been 
conducting active searches for Ms Gardner's body and last week sent 
divers and underwater robots to search in the area where Giordano 
reported her missing.

They are also awaiting additional 
forensic evidence, including an FBI analysis of Giordano's Blackberry. 
Mr Stein and investigators are not convinced by Giordano’s version of 
events.
