Taxpayers will not fund a new identity to protect the mother of Baby P when she is released from jail, it emerged last night.

Despite fears over her safety, Tracey Connelly – who allowed her son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend – could walk to her freedom this week without protection.

The 32-year-old will be transferred from Low Newton jail near Durham to a parole hostel where she will start her re-integration back into society.

Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison this week without the protection of a new identity. She was jailed in 2009 over the death of her son Baby P, right

Connelly is expected to move away from Tottenham, north London – where her son was abused – and may decide to change her appearance to avoid attacks  by vigilantes.

There has been widespread horror at her imminent release, but ministers have decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round-the-clock police protection. Prison sources told the Mail yesterday that Connelly did not meet the criteria for receiving a new identity at great expense to taxpayers.

One source said: ‘It is very rare to give prisoners a new identity. The bar is extremely high and Tracey Connelly did not cross that threshold.’

She was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Release: Connelly is set to transferred from Low Newton Prison in Durham to a parole hostel later this week

Peter was 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother’s flat after suffering 50 separate injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

Sickened by the depravity, 132,000 people joined ‘hate groups’ on social networking internet sites calling for Connelly, Barker and Owen to ‘burn in hell’.

Some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released.

Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘The decision to provide a new identity is reserved for a very small group of people who are at the gravest risk of harm from the public.

'The risk must be so great that it is justifiable to the public purse.’

Anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon  Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

The parole board is expected to make a decision on Connelly’s release today. If approved, she will walk free ‘within days’.

After spending a stint in a parole hostel, Connelly will be allowed to move into a private home. Officials will be keen to learn how well she integrates back into society and if she forms a new relationship.

Social services will be alerted should she get pregnant and would almost certainly apply to have the baby taken into care. Connelly has told friends how she dreams of looking for men on her release.

With her time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served longer than the five-year minimum tariff handed down at the Old Bailey. Owen was freed on licence in 2011 but returned to jail  after breaching parole conditions.

Barker was given an indefinite sentence with a tariff of ten years.
