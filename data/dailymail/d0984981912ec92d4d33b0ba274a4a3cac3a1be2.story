Radamel Falcao has been left out in the cold frequently by Louis van Gaal during his start to life at Manchester United.

However the 28-year-old has been fortunate enough to live in some fine locations around the globe including Colombia, Porto and Monaco. Surely he knew the climate would be slightly different in England.

It seems Falcao isn't deterred by the cold climate in Manchester, as the 28-year-old enjoyed a snowball fight with his wife Lorelei Taron and daughter on Thursday in a video posted on Taron's Instagram account.

The Colombia international has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford following a big money loan move from Monaco. 

He has managed just three goals in 13 Premier League appearances and failed to impress in United's goalless FA Cup draw with minnows Cambridge United last Friday evening.

Van Gaal has only twice played the 28-year-old for a full 90minutes, leading so-called super agent Mendes to suggest his player would have been better off under the former regime of Ferguson who retired following the 2013-14 season,

Fellow South American team-mate Marcos Rojo also took his family out to enjoy the snow.

The Argentina defender posted on his Instagram a picture of a snowman he built with his family on Thursday.

Falcao and Rojo will hope to have an impact at Old Trafford on Saturday, as Manchester United host Leicester City in the Premier League, looking to avenge the 5-3 loss in the reverse fixture in September.
