Former England manager Steve McClaren has praised Roy Hodgson for the way he handled the 'nightmare' situation following Raheem Sterling's omission from the Estonia qualifier.

Liverpool winger Sterling sparked controversy when he asked to sit out England's Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday because of fatigue and the Derby manager admitted some of his players were 'tired' when they reported for international duty this week.

But McClaren, who had a 16-month spell in charge of the Three Lions from 2006 to 2007, expressed sympathy for England boss Hodgson on Thursday as he attempts to deal with the latest club versus country debate.

He said: 'I think Roy's handled the situation very well. Raheem looked as though he came on and changed the game and England got the win, so everybody's happy.

'At the end of the day once the players are in your care and you've got them and you think they're fit then you play them because you've got to win football matches - you're not bringing these players to look after them for the club.

'Ultimately the club do suffer in the end because they do play an extra two games that you could do without at club level.

'We look at our players at Derby and they're tired. We've just played seven games in 20 days before this international break.

'I would love to phone Martin O'Neill and Gordon Strachan and say 'look our players are too tired', but I'm afraid once they go with the international teams we're relying on them.

'Everyone's honest and open and I'm sure we do look after the players, be that international or at the club, we want the best for every player. But they have to win football matches so if they're deemed fit to play they have to play and we can't do anything about it.'
