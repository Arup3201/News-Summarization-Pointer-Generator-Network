Smokers who litter the streets with cigarette butts will be given a £30 shopping voucher if they complete a stop smoking course and quit the habit. 

The vouchers will be given to anyone who is fined for dropping smoking-related rubbish - such as butts and empty cigarette packets - and then completes a course commissioned by the council. 

Those who successfully give up smoking will be able to redeem the taxpayer-funded vouchers at a number of popular high street shops including Debenhams and Boots.

Penalty: Under the scheme, those caught dropping cigarette butts and packets will receive a fixed-penalty notice of £80 - reduced to £55 if paid in 10 days. They will then be invited to attend a stop-smoking course

A public health charity said that the scheme could 'boost the resolve' of those who are struggling to quit. 

But opponents to the pilot programme, which launches in the London borough of Wandsworth next month, have branded it as 'bizarre'. 

They argue that it is unfair to rewards those who litter - adding that the council's money could be better spent elsewhere.  

Resident Alex Gore, 30, said: 'It's barmy. What about those who don't drop litter or have quit smoking off their own back? 

'The council would be better off providing more bins with ashtrays on top then doing a bonkers gimmick like this.'

Writing on the council website, another resident Kim Willott said: 'Whilst its easy to blame the people who do it the council should provide more bins.' 

John O'Connell, Director for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is utterly bizarre. Litterbugs are fined for the obvious reason that it costs money to clean up. 

Expensive problem: Wandsworth council said itaiming to reduce smoking by 3 per cent next year

'Rewarding those who continue to do it is a strange brand of justice. The scheme is clearly open to abuse, and needs to be rethought " 

Under the plans, those caught dropping cigarette butts and packets will receive a fixed-penalty notice of £80 - reduced to £55 if paid in 10 days.

Offenders will be given the option of attending a stop-smoking course commissioned by the council and will be given the £30 upon completing the programme. 

A spokeswoman for charity Action on Smoking Health said: 'Most smokers want to quit so this incentive scheme could boost the resolve of those who are struggling to kick the habit. 

'Combining the anti-litter initiative with helping people to stop smoking should be beneficial all round as it will save money and improve the health of those who succeed in quitting smoking.'

Health spokesman Cllr Jim Maddan said: 'We know that 65 per cent of smokers want to quit, but often they don't know where to turn for help. This scheme will help them find that help.

'Stopping smoking is the single most beneficial thing anyone can do for their health.

'We won't force people to sign up for a stop smoking course, but we hope that this £30 voucher will encourage them to take the first step.'

The vouchers are available at a range of shops Debenhams, HMV, River Island, House of Fraser, H Samuel, Habitat, Toys R Us, Homebase and Clinton Cards among others.

The council handed out fines to 614 people for littering in 2013-14, around half for smoking-related rubbish.

The borough said it spends £4million picking up 7,000 tonnes of litter from the streets every year.

It is aiming to reduce smoking by 3 per cent next year and claims to have helped more than 6,500 smokers to quit since 2010.
