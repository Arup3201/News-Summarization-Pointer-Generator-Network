When actor Colin Firth movingly 
portrayed King George VI and his battle to overcome his stammer to speak
in public, he won an Oscar for his efforts.

Yesterday, teenager 
Musharaf Asghar was also being given the celebrity treatment at college 
after an equally emotional screen performance.

The 16-year-old’s 
triumphant real-life battle to conquer a severe speech impediment had TV
viewers in tears during the final episode of the hit Channel 4 
documentary Educating Yorkshire.

A young star of Educating Yorkshire who lives with a stammer has described a breakthrough in coping with his speech disorder as 'the most amazing moment'

The fly-on-the-wall series — which 
placed 64 cameras around Thornhill Community Academy in Dewsbury, near 
Leeds — showed the GCSE pupil struggling hopelessly to get his words 
out, before his English teacher Matthew Burton used a technique he had 
seen in the Oscar-winning film The King’s Speech.

Wearing headphones 
with music playing in the background, ‘Mushy’ successfully read a poem 
to his class, which he had struggled to utter a word of previously.

It also enabled the pupil to make a ten‑minute speech that formed the oral part of his English GCSE.

He
later used the same trick to make a speech in front of 200 people at 
his final school assembly, as tearful staff and friends gave him a 
standing ovation.

Tearful: Another member of the school struggle to contain his emotion

Humbled: This pupil was also profoundly affected by his speech to 200 fellow pupils on their last day of secondary school

Both Musharaf, now 17, and his dedicated teacher were 
being hailed as an inspiration yesterday.

Musharaf still has a stammer, 
but estimates his speech has improved by 80 per cent following his 
teacher’s tip earlier this year.

The teenager, who had previously 
been the target of bullies, said: ‘It felt great to be able to speak 
out. People knew exactly what I was saying. Before, some people didn’t 
understand who I really was.’

The idea to make his leaving speech to
all his  Year 11 pupils came from two teachers, and Musharaf bravely 
accepted the challenge, delivering it with aplomb.

Olympian effort: Jessica Ennis-Hill, who won a gold medal in the heptathlon at last year's Olympics, was one of thousands of viewers reduced to tears

#crying: Writer Caitlin Moran expressed her emotion at Musharaf's speech as well

Example: Shadow chancellor and former education secretary Ed Balls, who has himself struggled with a stammer, tweeted his pride

Musharaf has now 
discarded the headphones and his speech is improving all the time. 
Having achieved five C-grade GCSEs, he was able to start an applied 
science course at Huddersfield New College in September.

The son of a taxi driver hopes to study science at university and, thanks to Mr Burton, has ambitions to be a teacher.

Musharaf described his mentor as ‘perfect’ and said he was ‘amazing’ at his job.

Mr Burton was modestly playing down the plaudits yesterday and said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ for his former pupil.

He
admitted being reduced to tears when he watched the programme, and said
he had borrowed The King’s Speech DVD from his brother and decided to 
‘give it a try’ to help Musharaf in class.

‘It gave him a real 
confidence boost, which he really needed,’ said Mr Burton. ‘I won’t 
forget that moment for the rest of my life.

‘He is such a high-quality young man, he has a wide circle of friends and is well‑respected. I’m delighted for him.’
