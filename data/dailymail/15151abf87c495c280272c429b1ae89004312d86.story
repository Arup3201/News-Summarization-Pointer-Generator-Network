The French anarchist arrested for shooting a newspaper photographer fled to Britain to work as an office manger in Essex after serving time for supplying a weapon to France's infamous 'Bonnie and Clyde' murderers.

French Algerian extremist Abedlhakim Dekhar, 48, is currently in custody after allegedly wounding a press photographer with a shotgun on Monday morning.

He fled to England in 1999 to escape surveillance by French authorities after serving four years for helping revolutionaries Florence Rey and Audry Maupin murder three policemen and a taxi driver.

Assaulted ex-partner: Paris 'shotgun shooter' Abdelhakim Dekhar, seen here on CCTV at the Concorde underground station, was convicted of domestic violence in Britain before returning to France

Dekhar worked in London and married a 
student in Redbridge in 2000, listing his address as a small flat close 
to Ilford Methodist Church.

He continued to live in England, where he also worked in a restaurant until July this year.

His sister Farida Dekhar-Powell still lives in the Essex commuter town of Shenfield and teaches French.

She said: ‘I stopped talking to him 20 years ago. He is not part of my life and that's how it stays.’

Dekhar
 was arrested in an underground car park on Wednesday night after taking
 an overdose of sleeping in Bois-Colombes, a Paris suburb.

Address: The block of flats in Ilford, Essex, where Dekhar is listed as having lived between 2000 and 2003

Accomplice: Dekhar was jailed for four years for supplying a gun to France's infamous 'Bonnie and Clyde' murderers Florence Rey, left and Audry Maupin, right, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver

It
 was the dramatic end to a manhunt that started on Monday morning when 
Dekhar critically wounded a photographer at the offices of Liberation 
newspaper in Paris.

He then 
opened fire on the offices of the Societe Generale bank in La Defense 
business district of Paris, before briefly taking a motorist hostage.

Dekhar's DNA matched genetic prints found on the shotgun cartridges the gunman used and the car he commandeered.

Police
 found letters written by Dekhar which referred to Islamism and 
conflict-ravaged Arab countries including Libya and Syria.

Wanted: Police are hunting this man, pictured on security cameras carrying a bag, red arrow on left, outside the Liberation newspaper office in Paris, France

Search: This CCTV image shows the alleged shooter sitting on a bench of a tramway station in Paris

Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV

He also attacked the media and capitalism in general, saying they were both part of a ‘fascist plot’.

Dekhar
 spent  four years in prison for buying a gun used in the 1994 attacks 
by Florence Rey, a 19-year old student, and her lover Audry Maupin, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

Mr
 Maupin died in the chase, while Miss Rey, a fresh-faced student from a 
middle-class family, claimed Dekhar was the ‘third man’ in the ‘Bonnie 
and Clyde’ killing spree.

Dekhar,
 nicknamed ‘Toumi’ was under surveillance at the time, because of his 
links with a variety of radical groups, including would-be Islamist 
terrorists.

Witnesses
 at the trial in 1998 described him as a mentor to the couple and 
accused him of exploiting their youth to manipulate them.

Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception

Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun

Escape: The suspect, who was described as white, in his 40s and shaven-headed, fled the scene

In
 the early 1990s he was known to hang out at squats that were used by 
left-wing radicals and were often under police surveillance.

Despite 
this, it took detectives three days to track Dekhar down following this 
week’s attacks, suggesting the French authorities had lost track of his 
movements.

Dekhar’s 
former lawyer, Emmanuelle Hauser-Phelizon, today confirmed that she had 
been contacted about ‘Dekhar’s London links’, suggesting it was where he
 was hiding out.

During the 
90s and early 2000s, the English capital was routinely referred to as 
‘Londonistan’ by French intelligence because of the number of radical 
Islamists based there.

The 23-year-old photographer wounded in Monday’s attack has since undergone a six hour operation and is expected to recover.
