Former Great Britain prop Garreth Carvell has been named in John Kear's first Wales squad, 14 years after he last played for the country.

The 33-year-old former Hull and Warrington front rower, who is on a short-term deal with Castleford, is included in Kear's 22-man squad for the 2014 European Championships, which get under way when Wales meet Scotland in Workington on Friday, October 17.

Carvell, who last played for Wales in the 2000 World Cup, is currently sidelined with a neck injury but has put his hand up to play for his old Hull boss Kear, who has succeeded Iestyn Harris as Wales head coach.

Kear said: 'Garreth enjoyed playing for the Welsh team all those years ago and, when I spoke to him about it, I was pleased with his response and how keen he was to come back.

'I'm expecting him to be a stalwart in the side. At 33, he is our oldest player, while Connor Farrer, at only just 19, is our youngest. It's good that we have old hands helping through the up and coming lads, and it bodes well for this tournament and the future of Wales Rugby League as we continue to build towards Rugby League World Cup 2017.'

Kear's squad is selected from 14 clubs across four professional leagues, with World Cup squad members Peter Lupton (Workington), Dan Fleming (Castleford), Jake Emmitt (Leigh) and Elliot Kear (Bradford) providing the experience alongside a host of newcomers.

J Burke, D Grant (both Barrow), B Smith (Batley), E Kear (Bradford), G Carvell, D Fleming (both Castleford), R Williams (Central Queensland Capras), M Barron (Gateshead), I Duffy (Gloucestershire All Golds), O Olds (Ipswich Jets, Australia), J Emmitt (Leigh), R Massam, C Roets (both North Wales Crusaders), Y Parker (Oxford), A Bateman, P Carleton, P Emanuelli, C Farrer, K Scrivens, J Sheridan (all South Wales Scorpions), M Fozard (St Helens), P Lupton (Workington).
