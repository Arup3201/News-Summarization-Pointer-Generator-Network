A Baltimore teacher is under fire after a cellphone video emerged of her fighting a 17-year-old student, slamming the girl against a locker and threatening to kill her.

The beginning of the video, taken last Friday and obtained by local stations WBAL and WBFF, shows the girl shoving a chair in the teacher’s direction inside a classroom at Carver Vocational-Technical High in west Baltimore.

The 17-year-old senior reportedly became upset after the female teacher ordered her to stop using her cellphone during an exam.

Shocking behavior: The teacher, seen here pushing a boy trying to break up the fight, has been placed on administrative leave  

Fisticuffs: The teacher slammed the 17-year-old senior against a locker yelling at her, 'I'll kill you in here'

A video taken inside the classroom last Friday shows the teen pushing a swivel chair at the teacher and then throwing an object, believed to be a keyboard, at her before storming off. 

The argument between the teacher and student quickly escalated and spilled outside the classroom into the hallway, where the teen hurled a book at the woman.

That is when the grainy footage shows the teacher charge the girl as a tall male student tries to intervene, but to no avail.

Later, the recording captures the enraged educator slamming the 17-year-old against a locker and pulling on her long hair. At one point, she is heard yelling at the girl, ‘I’ll kill you in here,’ followed by expletives. 

City schools spokeswoman Anne Fullerton said the teacher was treated for minor injuries and was placed on administrative leave pending an internal and external investigation. The student, she said, was charged with assault and released to a parent.

The girl’s family told WBFF they are outraged by what the video shows.

‘You’re supposed to be a role model to these children and you took your shoes off and physically was fighting her like you was outside on the street?’ said Nikia Jones, the student’s aunt.

Nancy Jones, the girl’s grandmother, said it does not matter if a student is a problem child.

‘You don’t expect nobody to fight her like that,’ she said.

Not a class act: The teacher and student came to blows after the girl pushed a chair towards the educator and slammed an item down on her desk for telling her to stop using her cellphone

The violent altercation has divided the Carver community, with some parents siding with the teacher, while other saying she should not have resorted to violence.

‘Somebody throw something at me, that’s just your natural reaction,’ Tanya Thompson told CBS Baltimore. ‘No one is going to just stand there and let someone assault them.’

But Baltimore parent Earl Halstead said the teacher should have conducted herself in a more professional manner.

‘If there were no weapons or nothing involved, I feel the teacher could have tamed the student better than she did,’ he said.
