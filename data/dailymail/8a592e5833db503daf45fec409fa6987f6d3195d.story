A New York City politician filmed himself and a colleague leering at young girls and asking for their body measurements during a wild trip to the Dominican Republic.

Bronx Assemblyman José River, 77, wearing a baseball cap with 'The Bronx' 
on, is also filmed drinking a Mamajuana, a traditional drink made of rum, red wine,
 twigs and bark that is supposed to act as an aphrodisiac.

After swigging the concoction he says in Spanish he feels 'strong enough to get laid with all those young ones' when a vendor replies 'A child! A little girl?' he appears to reply 'yeah'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Rivera with a bottle of Mamajuana, a supposed aphrodisiac drink made with rum, red wine, twigs and bark that is a supposed aphrodisiac, afterwards he said he felt 'strong enough to get laid with all those young ones'

The veteran politician, posted the video online and then quickly
 deleted it in 2005 but a copy was downloaded by an activist and 
recently posted on YouTube.

Rivera told the New York Daily News he was a victim of changing times and had not meant to offend anybody on the tape, which was filmed in 2005.

He said: 'It
 was a walking tour through the area and I just was joking with the 
people, walking around.

'Obviously I said something out of line, that 
could be misconstrued. But I was joking. We were just joking throughout 
the event.

'If
 you hear the conversation, it could be interpreted as I acted 
inappropriately. I said the wrong thing.

'The story is the story. I meant to offend no one by it. It was never my intention to hurt anyone.

The veteran lawmaker asked one woman in Spanish, 'what are your body measures' while the camera pans down the length of her body

He is also joined on camera by ex-Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV (pictured).

'This is different times now 
than our lifetimes. If you were able to use the whistle of the wolf, it 
was okay in the old days. You can’t do that no more.'

He is also joined on camera by ex-Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV.

At one point, Rivera appears to be filming Powell, who jokes that he's not going back to New York City as the camera pans the full length of a woman's body.

When it was first posted online the video was downloaded by Andrés Duque, an activist, who recently decided to post the footage on YouTube.

He said: 'I was pretty disgusted by the whole 
thing.

'Rivera has been good on the issues that matter to me, 
but when I saw that, I thought, you don’t get a pass on some issues and 
behaving that way once you go to the Dominican Republic.

'I’m a little 
stunned.'

Powell said he remembered shooting the video, which he claims displayed 'respectful flirting.'

'It was an educational video, showing young men how it's done,' he added.

'When we were young and sexy, everything was appropriate. Now we're old and fat.'
