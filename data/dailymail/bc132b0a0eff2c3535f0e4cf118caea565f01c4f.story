An unarmed 60-year-old Florida man has been shot twice in his own driveway by deputies who mistook him for a car thief.

For the past month, Roy Middleton, of Pensacola, says he has been living in perpetual pain and struggling to sleep, haunted by the events of the night when he was shot.

At around 2.30am on July 27, Middleton went to retrieve a loose cigarette from his mother's Lincoln Town Car in the driveway on Shadow Lawn Lane when he was spotted by a neighbor.

Mistaken identity: Roy Middleton, 60, of Pensacola, Florida, was shot by deputies in his own driveway after being taken for a criminal

Bad call: Middleton was rummaging in his mother Lincoln Town Car in search of a loose cigarette when a neighbor spotted him and contacted police to report a car thief

No questions asked: Mr Middleton said that instead of asking him for his ID, the officers opened fire on him in his own driveway, striking him twice in the leg

Middleton lives with his wife and mother at the Pensacola address, and his name is listed on the insurance of the Lincoln, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

Believing that a car break-in was in progress, the resident called 911. Within minutes, officers Jeremiah Meeks, Sgt. Matthew White and Charles Wright arrived on the scene. 

Meeks and White ordered the 60-year-old man to show his hands, and when Middleton allegedly hesitated and made what was described as a lunging motion, they unleashed a barrage of 15 bullets, two of them striking the man in the legs. 

The officers and their superior, Sheriff David Morgan, have maintained that the use of force in this case was proper because Middleton did not immediately comply with their orders and appeared to reach for a metal object.

The victim, however, claimed that he was raising his hands when the deputies fired on him instead of asking for his identification or simply inquiring him if he lives there.

Middleton added that the object that put the officers on edge was nothing more than a key chain with a flashlight given to him as a present by his daughter, who is serving in Afghanistan.

The shooting has left the 60-year-old man, who also has a bad back, in a state of agony, exacerbated by nightmares.

Mr Middleton told the station WEAR-TV that the bullets that struck him shattered his left leg, requiring an operation to insert metal rods in order to keep the limb intact. Now, he says he cannot even sit on the couch without pain.

The man was released from Baptist Hospital late last month and is expected to begin physical therapy next week. 

Defiant: Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has sided with his deputies, saying that the use of force against Middleton was appropriate because he had failed to immediately comply with their orders

‘I ask myself why they shot me first. 
And why they shoot me so many times afterwards. Yeah, I ask why -- 
that's all I can ask is why,’ he told CNN in his first public interview.

Sheriff Morgan sided with his officers and sounded a defiant note amid the firestorm that has erupted in the media since the incident last month.

‘There was nothing glaringly apparent to us that the officers did that was out of the ordinary in the given set of circumstances as have been given to us,’ Morgan said in an interview with CNN.

The deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation that will determine whether any charges will be filed against them.

Mr Middleton is now planning to file a civil lawsuit against the sheriff's office claiming excessive use of force. Beside punitive damages, the 60-year-old also wants an apology.

His wife, Sharlet, said the shooting has had a devastating impact on her husband – previously a laid-back, jovial man who enjoyed fishing and family gatherings.

'He still tries to be the Roy that we all know, but he's not,' she told the paper.
