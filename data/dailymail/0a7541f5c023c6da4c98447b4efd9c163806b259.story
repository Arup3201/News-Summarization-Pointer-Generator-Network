This is the game that the national team cannot and will not lose. Once again, they have a point to prove.

Italy have become increasingly defiant in recent visits to Twickenham, but it is unthinkable that Stuart Lancaster's side will undermine their heroic victory over Wales in Cardiff eight days ago by succumbing to an upset in this second instalment of their RBS 6 Nations campaign.

On that basis the focus shifts. What took place at the Millennium Stadium was a be-all and end-all encounter with no wider context required. This time, against a country England have never lost to, the players will be well aware of the need to keep the bigger picture in mind. If these opponents don't generate sufficient edge and focus, the ticking of the clock should do the trick.

The scenario was neatly summed up by scrum-half Ben Youngs, who said: 'As a team, week by week, we have to push on. Every game is a dress rehearsal for a World Cup. Italy is a dress rehearsal for a home World Cup.

'We've only got seven games before the first game against Fiji so there are only so many dress rehearsals left and everyone wants to put their hand up and stake a claim.'

Such an outlook is crucial to quell any threat of English complacency on Saturday afternoon. While the result may not be in doubt, the manner of the performance will speak volumes for whether the post-Cardiff fanfare of optimism has been justified.

455: Italy’s hugely experienced starting XV have 405 more caps than England’s line-up.

15: England have won all 15 Six Nations matches between the two sides since Italy’s inclusion in the tournament in 2000.

3: For only the third time in his time in charge England head coach Stuart Lancaster has the luxury of naming an unchanged starting XV.

On this occasion, maturity will be gauged in the ability to display a ruthless streak; by taking charge against inferior rivals and by clinically dispatching them.

On Valentine's Day, the hordes at HQ will expect a massacre and while that is unlikely, they can reasonably demand an emphatic margin — eventually. England have abundant firepower at their disposal, whereas Italy will be physical and resolute, but typically limited.

The build-up has been dominated by a determined attempt to avoid a drop-off in intensity, after the high-stakes opener in hostile territory.

Billy Vunipola has put the disappointment of the November series behind him and his showing great form 

Youngs is alert to the danger of easing off the throttle, saying: 'That is the biggest challenge, to maintain the levels of performance from last week. That is one of the things we have focused on. Last time we played Italy at home, it was 18-11. That reinforces the fact that if you are not right on it, they will cause you problems. We have to back up everything we did last weekend.'

England's players know they must be patient. That will require another demonstration of the composure which characterised their triumph at the Millennium Stadium, when an early 10-0 deficit was taken in stride, rather than prompting Lancaster's players to go into headless-chicken mode.

Captain Chris Robshaw led the steady, unflustered revival, and many of those who instigated the fightback showed maturity beyond their years.

All around there were 20-somethings keeping their heads and today their challenge will be to avoid clumsy haste as they search for the Italian jugular. The man tasked with leading the attacking onslaught is George Ford — the precocious 21-year-old No 10 who is thriving at Bath after emerging at Leicester. Youngs is in awe of his half-back partner's qualities.

Reflecting on the fly-half's breakthrough with the Tigers, he said: 'I was pleased he was a 10, not a nine, otherwise I might have been the one moving!

'I was fortunate enough to see him come through from the academy at Leicester into the first team and watch him kick on. I don't think I'll see another guy like that come through the system, until I retire.

'He's just so mature for his age, in the way he plays; you'd think he has played more Tests than he has. He is still only 21, but you wouldn't think that when you speak to him and see him around the camp. He gives everyone direction. Guys like that are very rare.'

Ford is not the only rare gem available to England. Jonathan Joseph's try-scoring contribution in Cardiff re-emphasised his class as a fast and elusive centre amid the heavy midfield traffic, while Anthony Watson — who also touched down — is delivering on his immense promise as a potent force out wide.

Right at the back, Mike Brown's kicking game has given him and his national team a whole new dimension.

But for these men to thrive, the England pack must withstand Italy's imposing forwards. That surely won't be a problem for a national team who could field two separate eight-man units of elite Test pedigree.

Just as Joseph and Ford and Co in the back line must continue to prosper in order to ward off the threat from challengers for their shirts, the same is true up front.

Every man who starts today has someone breathing down it. Joe Marler is on a roll as the starting loosehead prop, but he has Mako Vunipola and Alex Corbisiero keeping him honest.

The situation is identical for hooker Dylan Hartley, James Haskell at blindside flanker and for No 8 Billy Vunipola while soon, when the injury backlog eases, there will be a jostle for places in the second row too.

That is the World Cup factor today. Above and beyond beating Italy, to maintain their title quest, England's players know that the audition phase is intensifying. The time to make a good impression is running out.
