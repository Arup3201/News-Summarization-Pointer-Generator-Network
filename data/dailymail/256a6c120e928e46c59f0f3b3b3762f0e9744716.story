Young binge drinkers will be shamed in a new 'You’ve Been Framed' scheme with hospitals showing them film of their drunken disgrace.

Drunk revellers needing hospital treatment will be shown shocking footage of themselves staggering around and passing out.

The candid camera project in Cardiff is designed to tackle binge-drinking culture and ease pressure on hospitals.

Young binge drinkers will be shamed in a new 'You've Been Framed' scheme with hospitals in Cardiff, south Wales, showing them film of their drunken disgrace

Worried health chiefs in the Welsh capital hope people will be shocked at seeing video of themselves so intoxicated.

Conrad Eydmann, head of substance misuse strategy, said: 'Our intention is that the vast majority of people will be surprised and hopefully concerned about the state of their behaviour.'

Health chiefs revealed that up to 60 per cent of A&E beds can be taken up by intoxicated patients. Camera equipment will film intoxicated patients as they are brought to city centre casualty units set up to deal with late night drunks.

After they sober up they will be shown film of their drunken behaviour in a bid to prevent them getting in a similar state again.

Mr Eydmann said: 'It gives the option for individuals to review the video of their arrival. It indicates how alcohol can affect their behaviour.'

Cardiff has earned a reputation as the UK capital of binge-drinking.

Binge-drinking causes trouble in the centre of Cardiff and leads to a rush at A&E on Saturday nights

Cardiff, the capital of Wales, is well known across the UK for its vibrant nightlife. St Mary Street, one of the main streets is also one of the main city's hubs of clubs and pubs

Stag and hen parties from across 
Britain descend on the city in alcohol-fuelled hoards on weekends - and 
streets are littered with passed out revellers.

People have described the scenes of stumbling shot drinkers as like witnessing a 'zombie apocalypse'.

boyfriends in shop doorways and intoxicated girls sob in public.

The police have nicknamed the St Mary 
Street end of town 'Animal Farm' because of the behaviour of the 
late-night revellers - especially the scantily-clad girls.

Every
Christmas, a MASH-style field hospital is set up in the Millennium 
Stadium to stop the huge numbers of festive drunks rolling through the 
doors of A&E.

If the 
camera scheme proves successful in tackling the problem of binge 
drinkers blocking beds then it could be rolled out in hospitals across 
the country.

If the camera project is a success, it could be rolled out across UK cities that have the same problem. Here a woman drinker slumps on the pavement in Bristol

The candid camera project, funded by the Welsh Government, aims to tackle the rising pressure from late-night revellers using up vital bed spaces.

Mr Eydmann said: 'Substantial proportions of beds and trolleys can be taken up by people who are intoxicated.'

The candid camera footage will be wiped after being shown to the sober patient.
