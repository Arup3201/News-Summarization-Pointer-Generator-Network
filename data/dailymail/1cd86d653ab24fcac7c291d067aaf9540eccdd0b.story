The Police and Crime Commissioner who spent £700 on two journeys in a chauffeur-driven car is to hire a spin doctor to ‘manage reputational risks’.

Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes has offered a salary of nearly £600 a week for someone to carry out duties which will include giving advice on ‘how to handle the media in order to maintain public perception’.

The job offer comes after the commissioner reported four members of staff to the police for telling a local newspaper about his expensive taxpayer-funded trips in a hired Mercedes.

Three of the staff members were arrested while a fourth has been questioned.

MPs have condemned the arrests as an outrage against democracy and a threat to freedom of speech, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an inquiry.

The three, who have not been named but who include two police staff members, face serious charges and possible jail sentences if charged with crimes and found guilty. They have been bailed until 24 May.

Now in an extraordinary move Mr Rhodes has advertised for a permanent staff member to ‘raise the perception’ of himself among the public.

The Cumbria PCC website is offering a salary of up to £30,633 for a ‘communications and engagement officer’ whose job will include ‘raising the public perception of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner and managing any reputational risks.’

The spin doctor will also ‘carry out media and/or public relations activity in the event of a major or critical incident’. Cumbria Constabulary already have a press office which deals daily with media inquiries.

A spokesman for Mr Rhodes said yesterday the spending on a spin doctor had been approved before the Mercedes incident and the arrests that followed drew him to national attention.

‘It is in the medium to long term strategy to recruit a Commissioning Manager and fill the vacant Communications and Engagement post. The Police and Crime Panel approved the Office structure in early April,’ she said.

The two journeys in the chauffeur-driven Mercedes, one to a dinner with the Archbishop of York and the other to a regimental reunion, cost the taxpayer £313 and £385.

Mr Rhodes, who was the winning Tory candidate in the Cumbria Commissioner election in November, said last week: ‘I have made two mistakes.

'Firstly, not checking the cost of the car. Others had made the arrangements. I failed to ask questions about the costs. Once I knew the costs, I immediately asked the office to stop the arrangements.

‘Secondly, I apologise that my expenses were not published earlier. The short period of time since November has been a very busy period for the office.

‘I apologise unreservedly to the people of Cumbria, regarding my expenses.’

The Commissioner has now been supplied with a Hyundai 4x4 vehicle for travel around his patch. It is estimated to have cost £23,000.

In the Commons on Wednesday Lib Dem party president Tim Farron, who is MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, told the Prime Minister: ‘Last week three people in Cumbria were arrested for apparently blowing the whistle in the public interest over the actions of the police commissioner.’

He asked Mr Cameron: ‘Will you agree with me that this is a threat to freedom of speech, an outrage in a democratic society and will you intervene to make sure there is an independent investigation?’

Mr Cameron replied: ‘I will look carefully at this case. In general we should support whistleblowers and what they do to help improve the provision of public services. I will have a look and get back to you.’

Another PCC was also revealed to be hiring a spin doctor yesterday.

Hertfordshire Police PCC David Lloyd is to hire a mouthpiece on a salary of £66,312 - £75,786, with a car allowance and final salary pension scheme.

Tory Mr Lloyd, who was elected on a turnout of just 14.5 per cent of Hertfordshire’s voters, is himself paid £75,000 a year.

The advert, which on his website, is for a Director of Communications and Engagement and reads: ‘You will have a track record in providing vision, direction and clarity in the development and delivery of communication plans and strategy and play a key role in the successful implementation of the Commissioner’s ambitious Police & Crime Plan, Everybody’s Business.’
