The son of film legend Humphrey Bogart is suing British fashion brand Burberry for allegedly using a photograph of the star illegally to promote its coats.

In what is being hailed as a landmark case, Stephen Bogart – the son of the late star and Lauren Bacall – filed a lawsuit again Burberry at Los Angeles Superior Court last month.

He claims the company used an image of his father from the 1942 movie Casablanca to plug its products on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter.

Burberry has filed a counter- claim saying the picture of ‘Bogie’ was a historical reference protected under America’s First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech.

In a statement, Stephen, 63, said: ‘This is such a disrespectful action by Burberry.

‘It is important brands are not allowed to commercially use my father’s name or image without our permission.’

He also cast doubt on whether Bogart is wearing a Burberry in the picture, taken from the closing scenes of Casablanca as Bogart’s character Rick Blaine says goodbye to his lover, played by Ingrid Bergman.

‘It is well known my father was a loyal Aquascutum customer in his personal life,’ he said.

Bogart died in 1957, aged 57, but continues to earn millions in death through lucrative licensing deals, including a furniture range.

Lawyer Michael Crain, representing the Bogart estate, said last night: ‘This case is historic because the role of social media in advertising is new.’

In its lawsuit, Burberry states: ‘Burberry’s use of the image was not directly connected to the sale of any merchandise but rather was a historical positioning of the image within  an educational project along with numerous other photographs.’

The Bogart estate is seeking ‘unspecified damages’ that could run into  millions. Burberry last night declined to comment.
