Scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble-like simulations of Earth's interior.

By recording seismic tremors, researchers are able to build a 3D picture of Earth's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core.

They do this by analysing the speed of the tremors, which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma.

Computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures. In this view of the mantle below the Pacific Ocean, slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue

The Princeton team fed data from seismograms into a computer model, which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter. 

The resulting "synthetic seismograms" were compared to real seismograms, and the differences fed back into the model to improve it. 

The researchers do this repeatedly, comparing data with simulations and extracting differences. With each pass, they improve their model.

In these images, slower waves are in red and orange, while faster vibrations are in green and blue.

The 3D models were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km) - by the end of the year.

His team have been using the number-crunching capabilities of the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second.

Professor Tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater, which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide.

These stations make recordings, or seismograms, that detail the movement produced by seismic waves, which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes.

'We are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes,' said Professor Tromp, 'but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features.'

The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates, which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other.

The maps could also reveal the locations of magma that, if it comes to the surface, causes volcanic activity, the researchers said.

Previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves: primary or compressional waves, secondary or shear waves, and surface waves.

Professor Tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake – described as adjoint waves.

The Titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter, and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms.

The differences are then used by Titan to improve its model.

Professor Tromp said: 'You don't know what it is you are looking for…that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover.'

This map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles (389 km). Blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds, and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds

A computer program designed by Tromp and his team compares real earthquake data to a computer-generated model, then uses any discrepancies to improve the model
