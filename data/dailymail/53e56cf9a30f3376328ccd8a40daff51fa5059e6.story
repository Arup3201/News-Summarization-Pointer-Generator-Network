A new book alleges that former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary have compiled a so-called 'enemies list' of fellow Democrats who didn't endorse Hillary in the 2008 presidential primary, but instead backed her main rival, then-Senator Barack Obama.

According to the book, titled HRC - the initials of Hillary Rodham Clinton - she and her husband created 'a special circle of Clinton hell...for people who had endorsed [President] Obama.'

The book claims that after the 2008 primary, the Clintons had an aide compile a list of everyone they felt betrayed the former first lady.

Enemies: According to a new book, Bill and Hillary Clinton have created an 'enemies list' for Hillary's potential 2016 presidential campaign

Bitter: The Clintons appear to still be a little bitter that President Obama beat Hillary in the 2008 Democratic primary

'She and Bill would have at their fingertips all the information needed 
to make a quick decision,' the authors reported. 'So that friends could 
be rewarded and enemies punished.'

The book is written by Politico's former White House Bureau Chief Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes - who often is criticized as being a Fourth Estate shill for the Obama administration.

According to the book, those who provided Clinton with the most help during the 2008 Democratic primary were rated a '1' in the Clintons' rating system.

Those who supported Obama - or committed other acts of political treason - received a rating of '7.'

Secretary of State John Kerry, who supported President Obama in the primary, received a '7' rating, according to the New York Post.

According to the book, Clinton staffers would often 'joke about the fates of the folks they felt had betrayed them.'

Scorned: The Clintons loathe former Senator Ted Kennedy after he gave Obama his endorsement just days before Super Tuesday in the 2008 primary

Ratings: On the Clintons' turncoat 'ratings' system, Secretary of State John Kerry scored a '7' - the worst possible rating

'Bill Richardson: investigated; John Edwards: disgraced by scandal; 
Chris Dodd: stepped down; . . . Ted Kennedy: dead,' an aide once joked, the book claims.

Speaking of Kennedy, the book claims the longtime Massachusetts senator 'had slashed Hillary worst of all, delivering a pivotal endorsement 
speech for Obama just before the Super Tuesday primaries [in 2008] that 
cast her as yesterday’s news and Obama as the rightful heir to Camelot,'
 the authors wrote. 'Bill Clinton had pleaded with Kennedy to hold off, 
but to no avail.'

The book claims that the Clinton's enemies list was started in 2008 after Hillary lost the primary to Obama. The planning stages for a potential 2016 candidacy for Hillary gained more steam in 2012 when Obama struggled to beat Mitt Romney in the general election.

According to the book, Bill Clinton offered letters of recommendation and political endorsements to those he feels could help his wife win the White House in 2016. He also used it to punish those who supported Obama in the past.

According to the Post, Clinton backed Democratic New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell in a primary against Congressman Steve Rothman after the two representatives' districts had been merged into one.

Rothman was an early Obama supporter in the 2008 primary, and apparently had drawn the ire of the Clinton camp - with Bill's backing, Pascrell easily defeated Rothman.

Rival: Bill Clinton refused to appear with Senator Elizabeth Warren because she could be a threat to Hillary winning in 2016

The book claims that the Clintons tried to get Pennsylvania Congressman Jason Altmire to support Hillary's campaign in 2008. Altmire, however, endorsed Obama.

In 2012, when Altmire was in a primary battle with opponent Mark Critz, Bill Clinton backed Critz, who went on to win the primary. 

When Clinton did what previously was unthinkable - campaign for Obama in 2012 - the book claims he went out of this way to make sure he did nothing to hurt his wife's chances in 2016.

According to the book, Obama asked Bill Clinton to appear with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. He declined, the book claims, because Warren was viewed as a potential Hillary opponent in a 2016 primary.
