Secret deal? Mandela's grandson, tribal chieftain Mandla Mandela (above), denies claims he sold rights to his grandfather's funeral for £250,000

Nelson Mandela's grandson has been forced to deny that he secretly sold television broadcast rights for the anti-apartheid icon's funeral to the BBC.

Mandla Mandela has been accused of selling exclusive rights to film the anti-apartheid campaigner's funeral for around £250,000.

The tribal chieftain, 37, is alleged to have cut a deal with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in conjunction with the BBC.

Mandla's first wife Thando claimed he made the deal in 2009 - well before his grandfather, now 93, experienced his recent bout of health problems.

She claimed he received three million South African rand (£248,000) for the arrangement.

As part of the couple's divorce battle Thando Mabunu-Mandela has forced her ex-husband - now a leading figure within the Mandela family - to make a legal statement on issue.

And this week Mandla Mandela told a court: 'I am not in possession of any written agreement with either the SABC or BBC or any other broadcasting company or corporation for the broadcast rights to Mr Nelson Mandela's funeral, as such agreement does not exist and I do not possess such rights.'

Using the term 'M-plans', the world's 
news organisations have for years been planning how best to cover Nelson
 Mandela's funeral.

They have staked out locations, booked hotels and even pre-arranged pundits in anticipation of a global news event to which every living US president, the British prime minister and many other world leaders are expected to attend.

The intense level of preparation is, from a television executive's perspective, understandable.

But many South Africans have been offended by the sense of anticipation of the much-loved statesman's death.

So great is the national 
affection for the country's first black president that any perceived 
lack of respect for his dignity is taken extremely seriously.

The recent revelation that two international news agencies - Associated Press and Reuters - had installed television cameras on top of telegraph poles in Nelson Mandela's home village of Qunu provoked fury locally, despite the fact that the cameras were turned off and would only be activated when the funeral started.

Mandla has also attracted criticism for ordering that the bodies of three of the former president's children be exhumed from their home village of Qunu and reburied in the nearby hamlet of Mvezo where he is a chief.

Mandla's motive, say his critics - some of whom are within the Mandela family itself - that the former president will also be buried in Mvezo: something that is sure to act as a lure for big-spending tourists.

Mandla Mandela's personal life has also been criticised.

While polygamy is legal in South African tribal law, he has been accused of breaching a court's order to marry his second and third wives while divorce proceedings against the first are still active.

Nelson Mandela, now 93, has previously been treated for prostate cancer, tuberculosis and damage to his eyes.

Last month, he underwent surgery for a stomach condition.
