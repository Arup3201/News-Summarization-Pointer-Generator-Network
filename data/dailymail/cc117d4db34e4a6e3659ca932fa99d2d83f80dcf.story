President Obama told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that he 'must halt the flow of weapons and fighters' into Ukraine as the U.S. imposed tough new sanctions on Moscow.

The tough action, in the form of new sanctions on Russia's lucrative energy and defense companies as well as a handful of Russian banks, was announced by Obama in a half-empty White House press briefing room on Wednesday.

It came as his administration struggled for a way to quell a Moscow-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine.

The penalties, which Obama said were a response to Russia's 'provocations in Ukraine,' significantly expand on previous U.S. sanctions, which were limited to Russian individuals and companies.

'Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border in Ukraine' and pursue international talks, Obama said. 'I've made this clear directly to Mr. Putin,' his counterpart in Moscow.

The president said his administration 
was 'designating selected sectors of the Russian economy as eligible for
 sanctions,' and then applying 'significant but ... also targeted' 
sanctions to companies in those sectors.

'We
 have to see concrete actions and not just words that Russia is in fact 
committed to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border,' he told
 reporters.

'There are some clear steps that we've asked Russia to take that they haven't taken,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday.

'And that is what has elevated the risk that Russia faces right now as it relates to additional economic costs that could be imposed by the international community,'

U.S. officials 
said earlier in the day that they were continuing to hold in reserve a 
strategy that would cripple entire market sectors in Russia, in case 
Moscow launches a 
full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Obama warned that with a new round of financial penalties, 'what we are expecting is that the Russian leaders will see once again that their actions in Ukraine have consequences.'

The U.S. will continue to help Ukraine 'defend its territorial integrity,' he vowed.

Hours earlier, the
 U.S. Treasury Department listed the Bank for Development and Foreign 
Economic Affairs, Gazprombank Gas Industry, Rosneft Oil Co. and the 
Joint Stock Company Military-Industrial Corp among the sanctioned 
entities.

They are among Russia's largest business entities, but will no longer be permitted to borrow funds on the American market for medium- and long-term periods of over 90 days, The New York Times reported shortly after a closed White House conference call with journalists.

The companies will still be able to conduct overnight loans and other short-term banking business.

During the same brief press conference, Obama announced that Afghanistan had agreed to abide by the results of an international audit of its recent presidential election.

He added the U.S. continues 'to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between Israel and Hamas.'

'Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people,' Obama declared. 'There is no country on earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets, and I'm proud that the Iron Dome system that Americans helped Israel develop and fund has saved many Israeli lives.'

But he condemned 'the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in Gaza – men, women and children caught in the crossfire,' and said he would continue to pursue a diplomatic peace.

Obama also added that he was considering an extension of Friday's deadline for Iran to make good on its commitments to halt its nuclear weapons program.

'Based on consultations with secretary [John] Kerry and my national security team, it's clear we've made real progress,' Obama said, while acknowledging that gaps remain between America's expectations and what Iran has delivered to date.

The president took no questions after he finished reading his statement, and said nothing as a reporter shouted a question about whether he would hit Iran with sanctions similar to those he was leveling on Russia.

The U.S. 
announcement came as European leaders met into the night in Brussels to 
discuss taking their own measures aimed at helping ease tensions along 
Russia's border with Ukraine.

EU
 diplomats were also looking at penalties that would go beyond the 
current travel bans and asset freezes against individuals, though it was
 unclear whether their sanctions would go as far the U.S.

Until
 now, the U.S. has insisted on hitting Russia with penalties in concert 
with Europe in order to maximize the impact and present a united Western
 front.

The European Union has a far stronger 
economic relationship with Russia, making the 28-nation bloc's 
participation key to ensuring sanctions packages have enough teeth to 
deter Russia.

But those same economic ties have made Europe fearful that tougher penalties could boomerang and hurt their own economies.

The
 White House's willingness to punish Russia without European backing 
comes as the Obama administration faces criticism that its repeated 
warnings about tougher sanctions are little more than empty threats.

'Sometimes
 I'm embarrassed for you, as you constantly talk about sanctions and 
yet, candidly, we never see them put in place,' Republican senator Bob 
Corker said during a Senate hearing on Ukraine with administration 
officials last week.

The U.S. and Europe have levied coordinated sanctions on Russian individuals and companies connected to Moscow's alleged destabilization in Ukraine.

Obama administration officials argue that those penalties have had an impact on Russia's economy, citing International Monetary Fund statistics showing a downgrade in Russia's growth this year.

However, officials have acknowledged 
that the sanctions have not had an impact on Putin's decision-making in Ukraine.

State
 Department spokesman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that if Putin 'cares deeply
 about his people, about the economy, his own country' the sanctions 
would shift his calculus.

But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov blasted
 the U.S. in the wee hours of Thursday morning in Moscow, warning that a
 Russian retaliation could be 'quite painful and serious.'

'The
 new decision by the U.S. administration to lodge sanctions under false 
pretenses against a number of Russian businesses and individuals can’t 
be called anything other than outrageous and totally unacceptable,' 
Ryabkov told the Interfax news service.

Obama
 and European counterparts have vowed to take even broader sanctions 
targeting Russia's lucrative energy and defense sectors, as well as 
access to financial markets, if Moscow failed to quell tensions with 
Ukraine. But it is unclear what the new package of U.S. sanctions would 
include.

During a Group of 
Seven meeting in Brussels in early June, Western leaders warned Russian 
President Vladimir Putin those penalties could be levied within a month 
if Russia did not meet specific conditions.

Unmoved: President Putin has so far failed to react to threats of sanctions from Europe and the U.S.

The conditions included recognizing the results of Ukraine's May 25 election and starting a dialogue with President Petro Poroshenko, ending support for the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine and stopping the flow of arms across the Russian border.

The end-of-June deadline the West outlined for Putin came and went with little follow-through from Russia, yet no penalties were levied by the U.S. and Europe.

Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the West's failure to follow through on its threat of sector sanctions has raised a 'credibility question' for the Obama administration.

'I think the bluff has now been fully called,' Conley said.

If Obama moves forward with unilateral sanctions, he will face opposition from the private sector.

U.S. businesses have been pressing the administration to hold off on sanctions that could put them at a disadvantage in the global economy.

'It's not clear to us that breaking commercial ties with the Russia partners, consumers gets anyone to where they want to be,' said Gary Litman, vice president for international strategic initiatives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
