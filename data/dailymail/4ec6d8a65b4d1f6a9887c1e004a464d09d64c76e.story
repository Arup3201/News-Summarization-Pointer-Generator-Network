What could be so horrible? Grade-school math.

As schools around the U.S. implement national Common Core learning standards, parents trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus.

As schools around the U.S. implement national Common Core learning standards, parents like Jacobson-Francis trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus

They're stumped by unfamiliar terms like 'rectangular array' and 'area model.' They wrestle with division that requires the use of squares, slashes and dots. They rage over impenetrable word problems.

Adopted by 44 states, the Common Core is a
 set of English and math standards that spell out what students should 
know and when. The standards for elementary math emphasize that kids 
should not only be able to solve arithmetic problems using the 
tried-and-true methods their parents learned, but understand how numbers
 relate to each other.

Stacey Jacobson-Francis, 41, of Berkeley, California, said her daughter's homework requires her to know four different ways to add.

'That is way too much to ask of a first grader,' she said. 'She can't remember them all, and I don't know them all, so we just do the best that we can.'

Simple arithmetic isn't so simple anymore, leading to plenty of angst at home. Even celebrities aren't immune: The comedian Louis C.K. took to Twitter recently to vent about his kids' convoluted homework, writing that his daughters went from loving math to crying about it.

Comedian Louis C.K. has even taken to Twitter to make fun of how ridiculous he thinks the Common Core math standards are. He has two daughters, Mary Lou and Kitty, who attend elementary school in New York City

'Part of what we are trying to teach children is to become problem solvers and thinkers,' said Diane Briars, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 'We want students to understand what they're doing, not just get the right answer.'

That's a radically different approach than many parents are accustomed to.

Jennie Barnds, 40, of Davenport, Iowa, was puzzled by her fourth-grade daughter's long division homework, a foreign amalgam of boxes, slashes and dots with nary a quotient or dividend in sight.

'If we are sitting there for 20 minutes trying to do a simple problem, how is an 8, 9, 10-year-old supposed to figure it out?' she said. 'It's incredibly frustrating for the student and the parent.'

Another sample question from New York's Common Core exam for the third grade

Whether Common Core itself is responsible for the homework headaches is a contentious issue.

Some experts say Common Core promotes reform math, a teaching method that gained currency in the 1990s. Derided as 'fuzzy' math by critics, reform math says kids should explore and understand concepts like place value before they become fluent in the standard way of doing arithmetic. Critics say it fails to stress basic computational skills, leaving students unprepared for higher math.

This question, for New York's Common Core math test for fourth graders, is one of the most detailed questions asked on the exam

Stanford University mathematician James Milgram calls the reform math-inspired standards a 'complete mess' — too advanced for younger students, not nearly rigorous enough in the upper grades. And teachers, he contends, are largely ill-prepared to put the standards into practice.

'You are asking teachers to teach something that is incredibly complicated to kids who aren't ready for it,' said Milgram, who voted against the standards as part of the committee that reviewed them. 'If you don't think craziness will result, then you're being fundamentally naive.'

Under Common Core, parents are likely to see some unfamiliar terms on their children's elementary-school math homework. Here are some examples drawn from New York state's math curriculum:

SECOND GRADE

Addition: Solve using your place value chart and number disks, composing a 10 when necessary: 53 + 19

Subtraction: Craig checked out 28 books at the library. He read and returned some books. He still has 19 books checked out. How many books did Craig return? Draw a tape diagram or number bond to solve.

Are these comparisons true or false?A) 2 hundreds + 3 ones > 5 tens + 9 ones ______B) 9 tens + 2 hundreds + 4 ones < 924 ______C) 456 < 5 hundreds ______

THIRD GRADE:

What is another way of expressing 8 ×12?A. (8 ×10) + (8 × 2)

B. (8 ×1) + (8 × 2)C. (8 ×10) + 2D. 8 + (10 × 2)

The number of objects described in which situation can be represented by 24 ÷ 4?A. There are 24 boxes with 4 pencils in each box.B. There are 24 people on a bus, and 4 people get off the bus.C. There are 24 marbles that need to be sorted into 4 equal groups.D. There are 24 books on a shelf, and 4 more books are put on the shelf.

What number sentence is another way to represent the missing number in the equation 36 ÷ 4 = ?A. ? × 4 = 36B. 36 × 4 = ?C. 36 + 4 = ?D. ? ÷ 4 = 36

FOURTH GRADE

Multiplication: Represent the following expressions with disks, regrouping as necessary, writing a matching expression, and recording the partial products vertically: 3 x 24Word problem: Cindy says she found a shortcut for doing multiplication problems. When she multiplies 3 × 24, she says, '3 × 4 is 12 ones, or 1 ten and 2 ones. Then there's just 2 tens left in 24, so add it up and you get 3 tens and 2 ones.' Do you think Cindy's shortcut works? Explain your thinking in words and justify your response using a model or partial products.
