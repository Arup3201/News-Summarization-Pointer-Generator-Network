A two-year-old boy who was taken hostage by a burglar fleeing from police in South Dakota on Tuesday has been rescued after a six-hour ordeal.

In a dramatic end to the standoff, officers armed with assault rifles descended on the house in Rapid City and managed to save the toddler without having to fire a single shot.

A 32-year-old man, Raymond Cuny, was arrested on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping and second-degree burglary.

Tense: An armored vehicle and SWAT team surround a Rapid City house on Tuesday after a burglar took a two-year-old boy hostage

The standoff started after police were called to reports of burglary at about 4pm and followed the burglar as he fled to a neighboring property.

Several adults and children who were in the house were able to escape but Cuny, who was believed to be armed, allegedly kept a two-year-old as a hostage.

Cuny is not believed to have known the child or had any form of relationship with anyone in the house where he fled.

Roads around the property were blocked off and the neighborhood was put on lock down as negotiations began with Cuny, who police described as 'uncooperative'.

Rapid City police updated residents about the siege on Twitter, with tweets including: 'Suspect refusing to come out, has small child in the residence with him. Police believe suspect is armed.'

Armored cars and SWAT teams were seen moving into the streets around the house, and officers moved vehicles and pulled up fences to clear the way as they prepared to storm the house.

Officers in an armored vehicle that had been parked in the middle of the street used a loud speaker to try to communicate with the suspect, calling for him to give himself up.

At about 10.30pm armed police stormed the house, using door breach rounds and distraction techniques to rush in and grab the child.

Police chief Karl Jegeris gave details of the rescue on social media, tweeting: 'Baby rescued and safe. Suspect in custody. All officers and deputies are safe.'

In a statement, Police Chief Jegeris said: 'I am extremely proud of the Special Response Team and their
