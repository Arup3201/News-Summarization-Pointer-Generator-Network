France has called for the United Nations to enforce envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria - in a move which could see force used against Assad's regime.

Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was hoping that Russia, a key ally of Syria, would agree to invoking the UN's Chapter 7 to make it happen.

It allows the use of military force. The first stage could be to impose a No Fly Zone and allow humanitarian aid into the country.

But, as seen in other conflicts, could escalate to more drastic action if the regime doesn't bend to international demands.

And echoing UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous's comments yesterday, he said the Syrian conflict was now a 'civil war'.

He said: 'We propose making the implementation of the Annan plan compulsory.

'We need to pass to the next speed at the Security Council and place the Annan plan under Chapter 7 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions.'

France would propose toughening sanctions on Syria at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers, he added.

And the international community would prepare a list of second-ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice, alongside President Bashar Assad and his immediate entourage.    

He said: 'They must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression. The time for taking a decision has arrived. They have to jump ship.'

Earlier today Syrian troops claimed to have won a bloody eight-day battle to regain control of a crucial rebel mountain-top hide-out - with the help of Russian attack helicopters.

State television boasted that forces loyal to brutal dictator Bashar Assad had 'cleared terrorist fighters' from the town of Haffeh.

It came after more than a week of heavy fighting which led the U.S. to warn that a potential massacre would soon take place there.

Newsreaders said the troops had 'restored calm and security in Haffeh' after they 'cleansed it of armed terrorist groups' - a term authorities use to describe rebels fighting Assad.

The Russian helicopters are thought to be old ones and not the new batch referred to by U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton yesterday.

She said Washington was worried Russia may be sending attack helicopters to Syria.

It prompted Russia's foreign minister to today defend his country's sale of arms to Syria and accuse the U.S. of supplying rebels with weapons to fight against the government.   

'We are not violating any international law in performing these contracts,' said Sergei Lavrov, in response to a question about Clinton's comments at a news conference during a visit to Iran.   

'They are providing arms and weapons to the Syrian opposition that can be used in fighting against the Damascus government,' he said on Iranian state television.

Russia is one of Syria's principal defenders on the diplomatic front and, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with the power to veto resolutions, has stymied efforts by Western powers to pressure President Bashar al-Assad into stepping down.   

Lavrov said Russia's position was based on concern for the Syrian people and the country's integrity, rather than personal preference for Assad.   

'I have announced time and again that our stance is not based on support for Bashar Assad or anyone else ... We don't want to see Syria disintegrate.'

Russia is resisting Western and Gulf Arab pressure to take a harder line against Assad, rejecting calls for sanctions and proposing a conference bringing together global and regional powers including Iran.    

Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said the Syrian crisis could not be resolved by external powers.

'The Islamic Republic of Iran has announced many times: the issue of Syria needs to be dealt with in Syria by Syrians, not through the interference of others.'

The United States says it does not believe Iran, Assad's closest regional ally, is ready to play a constructive role in Syria, where the United Nations says government forces have killed more than 10,000 people since March 2011.     

Last night the UN said that violence in Syria has escalated so much in the last five days that the country is now in a state of full-scale civil war.

The organisation's chief peacekeepers has admitted for the first time that the bloodshed between President Bashar Assad's troops and rebels has reached unprecedented levels.

Herve Ladsous, when asked if the Syrian conflict has escalated into civil war, replied: 'Yes, I think one can say that'.

UN observers have seen a steep rise in violence and a dangerous shift in tactics by both sides in Syria in the last five days, his spokesman Kieran Dwyer added.

The Syrian government, intent on wresting back control of rebel-held areas, is shelling heavily populated districts and using attack helicopters over cities 'with devastating impact on civilians,' Dwyer said.

The opposition, in turn, is increasingly coordinating attacks against government forces and civilian infrastructure, and 'the conflict has reached all parts of Syria virtually,' he added.

He also revealed that UN observers have been prevented from entering besieged rebel-held towns.

They were pelted with  stones, metal rods and gunfire  as they tried to reach Haffa, where civilians were feared trapped by government shelling.

The observers were not hurt as they were turned back by the assault on their vehicles yesterday. But other areas have also been blocked to their colleagues.

Last week, it took days for the monitors to reach Mazraat al-Qubair, where nearly 80 people were reportedly killed, because government troops and residents blocked them.

As the conflict deteriorates into a murderous grind, regional power brokers from Iran to Turkey risk getting drawn into the fight.

The UN's special envoy on Syria, Kofi Annan, asked governments with influence to 'twist arms' to end the bloodshed. But there are few signs the diplomatic pressure is having any measurable effect.

'The longer this violence continues, the more dangerous it becomes not only for the country and the Syrian people but the region,' Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, told reporters in Geneva. 'It's dangerous and the red light is flashing.'

The deteriorating situation in Haffa has raised alarm in the past eight days, and Washington had said on Monday that regime forces may be preparing a massacre in the village, which is about 20 miles from Assad's hometown of Kardaha in Latakia province along the Mediterranean coast.

Activists said government forces were firing mortar rounds into the village.

Calls to the area did not go through yesterday. The government restricts journalists from moving freely, making it nearly impossible to independently verify accounts from either side.

Violence has escalated significantly in recent days as the government fights to reassert control of pockets of resistance across the country.

Syrian forces fired mortars at protesters yesterday in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour, killing at least 10 people, activists said. Clashes also were reported in central Homs province.

Amateur video of the mortar attack on Deir el-Zour showed some of the dead in a street as survivors screamed in panic and tried to remove their bodies. Other videos showed some of the wounded being treated at a hospital.

The state news agency SANA blamed the Haffa violence on terrorists - the term it uses to describe rebels - who had attacked residents in the village.

The report also said a reporter and a cameraman for the pro-government Ikhbariya TV were wounded when bullets hit their car in Haffa on Monday.

Throughout the uprising, violence has rattled Latakia, an area of profound importance to the regime.

Latakia province is the heartland of the Alawite minority to which Assad and the ruling elite belong, although there is a mix of religious groups.

Syria's Sunni majority makes up the backbone of the opposition, and minorities such as Alawites and Christians have generally stuck to the sidelines, in part out of fears that they will be marginalized - or even face retribution - if Sunnis take over.

As the violence worsens, world powers have struggled to find ways to end the bloodshed. Annan brokered a peace plan that was supposed to go into effect April 12 but never took hold.

More than 13,000 people have died in Assad's crackdown on the uprising that began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring, according to activist groups.

Annan renewed calls yesterday for the bloodshed to end.

'It is totally unacceptable and it must stop,' spokesman Fawzi said, 'and that is why Annan has invited governments with influence to raise the bar to another level, to the highest level possible, and twist arms if necessary, to get the parties to implement the plan.'

He didn't specify the countries that might still have leverage with the Assad regime, but Russia, China and Iran are Syria's closest and strongest allies.

Fawzi said it was up to the government to take the first step to end the violence.

'The stronger party should send a strong signal in good faith and stop the violence, and the stronger party in this case is clearly the government of Syria,' he said.
