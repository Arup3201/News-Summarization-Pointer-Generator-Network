A former Playboy model has reportedly been accused of embezzlement by a jailed fraudster.

Brande Roderick, a former Playmate of the Year and Baywatch actress, and her husband Glenn Cadrez are facing allegations from Michael Prozer III.

Prozer, who was jailed for eight years in 2012 for fraud, claims the couple asked him to invest £150,000 in their company Financially Hung, a networking group for business people seeking exclusive parties.

But he claims the pair instead deposited the cash in their personal accounts and never used it for the business, it was reported by TMZ.

Roderick has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.

Prozer was jailed for eight years in August 2012 after pleading guilty to multiple counts of bank fraud totalling $3million.

He once lied his way onto the TV show Millionaire Matchmaker, a dating show for wealthy people, by claiming he owned the South American PayPal, was worth $400 million, flew by private jet and lived in a mansion on Davis Island in Tampa.

However, it was all a facade created using wire, bank and mail fraud on a multi-million dollar scale, leading to the 38-year-old using his appearance on the Bravo show to convince those he robbed that he was in fact a genuine millionaire.

Accuser: Michael Prozer once claimed to be worth $400 million and that he owned a private jet. In reality, he was a conman who had fraudulently scammed $3 million from a bank

During his appearance on the show, Prozer, who is father to two young boys, told the audience that he was the multi-millionaire CEO of Xchange Agent Inc, an online payment service for people in South America.

Viewers saw his 33,000 square-foot home set on 26 acres and discovered that despite all his apparent wealth he could not find a wife to share it with.

His appearance on the show was not successful after Prozer upset his date Elana by showing off on a jet ski.

However, a federal indictment in April of 2010 exposed the fact that Pozer took a loan from the Park Avenue Bank based on fake, non-existent collateral after asking a man named Fedor Salinas, a Wachovia Bank employee, to falsify documents verifying the existence of these funds.

His set to be released from prison in 2019.
