Eight children were found living in a home near Marietta where sewage water was leaking over exposed wires and feces from a dog and a small child was littered throughout.

The cops were called to the home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon on Saturday after a two-year-old child was found alone outside, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 

Once inside the home, officers said they encountered terrible conditions where 8 children were living, from ages 2 to 13.

A garage used as a living space contained more than 50 bags of trash, some rotting and attracting insects, as well as stained mattresses and the smell of sewage.

In other areas of the home, damaged pipes leaked sewage water onto the floor and wiring was dangerously exposed to occupants.

Scattered throughout the house was old food that had become moldy along with feces believed to be from the dog and a toddler.

Police arrested both parents of the children and charged them with eight felony counts of cruelty to children, according to Cobb County jail records.

Stephen Tavizon was also charged with two counts of contributing to the deprivation of a minor, a misdemeanor defined as not providing parental care necessary for a child's physical, mental or emotional health under Georgia state law.

Deprivation? Records show the home of Stephen and Loni Tavizon was in an unsanitary condition, though Facebook photos of the couple show no sign of the alleged neglect

Loni Tavizon is the mother of all eight children at the home and Stephen is the biological father of two of them, having guardianship over the other six.

A Facebook page belonging to Stephen Tavizon claims he once worked aboard the USS John C. Stennis, an aircraft carrier.

The couple's photos show them playing or snuggling with the children and give little sign of the disarray police found in the home.
