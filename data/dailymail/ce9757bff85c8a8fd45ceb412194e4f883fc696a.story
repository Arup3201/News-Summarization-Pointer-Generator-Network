Beautician Sarah Bryan has made a dress that is good enough to eat - adorned with 700,000 multi-coloured sugar strands.

Sarah, 26, from Ossett, West Yorkshire, spent 30 hours gluing the sweets - normally used to decorate trifles and cakes - to the fabric of the two-piece outfit at the rate of 250 per square inch.

And she worked her way through 18lbs of the micro-sweets at a cost of £96. And the tubes of glue cost her another £60.

Sarah, a mother-of-two, said: 'I think the dress looks fantastic - although the sweets made a terrible mess in the house while I was making it. They ended up all over the place.'

She first sewed a crop top and constructed a long hooped skirt stiffened with wire.

Then she squirted glue on the fabric and delicately placed the sugar strands with a make-up brush.

She even spent three hours sorting out all the pink ones - a couple of millimetres long - so she could decorate the skirt with a pink heart.

Sarah, from Ossett, West Yorkshire said: 'I stuck loads of the sugar strands on but I would lose a lot whenever I moved it. 

'Loads of the them ended up all over the floor and I was always having to vacuum them up. They were all over the house.

'I am now lacquering the dress to make them completely secure.'

She is now planning to auction the dress off for charity - one she made last year out of 14,000 Skittles sweets ended up being shipped to Florida where it was to be displayed at Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum. But it was damaged in transit.

Sarah came up with the sweet idea for the first dress as a way of raising money for a cancer charity.

She said: 'After making one dress out of sweets I got hooked and decided to make another. People think I am mad but I think they look great.

'This one has been messier than the first to make. I thought using sugar strands would be easier - but it was harder and more intricate.

She said her partner Nick Webster, 31 would come home from his night shift as a store assistant and finding evidence of the sweets crunched into the carpet.

She added: 'He thinks I am crazy and he's getting fed up with the mess and smell of the sweets. I must admit it is pretty sickly. Not only that, when you tread on them you ended up with multi-coloured powder all over the place.

'But I think the dress is well worth the trouble. The dress looks great although admittedly you can't go out in the rain as the colours would run.

Bryan created a dress last year out of 14,000 Skittles sweets which was shipped to Florida and displayed at Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum

'Sunshine is all right..as long as you are not anywhere really hot like Egypt.'

She also had to watch daughter Isabella 18 months and son Keegan, 11 didn't try eating the dress.

She said: 'When I made the Skittles dress I kept finding patches where some of the sweets had vanished.

'I eventually realised that it was Keegan who was secretly snacking when my back was turned. This time he has been on his best behaviour.'
