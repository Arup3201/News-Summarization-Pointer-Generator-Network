While most cheese fans will delight in a strong cheddar, the durability of this cheese takes things to a whole new level.

A chef from Mexico has carried out a shocking experiment which reveals how a slice of processed cheese fails to melt when held over a naked flame. 

In a bid to make a statement about processed foods, Jose Raul Reyes filmed himself holding the supermarket cheese directly over the heat.

But instead of melting as some might expect, the cheese merely blackens - just like plastic would.   

Jose Raul Reyes uploaded a video to Facebook showing how a piece of sliced cheese failed to melt when held directly over a naked flame (left and right)

The video went viral within hours of being published online and has attracted hundreds of comments from shocked viewers.

One wrote: 'Why doesn't the health Ministry ban something like this which clearly isn't cheese?'

And another wrote: 'if anybody wants to know why cancer is on the increase, look no further.'

Mr Reyes said he decided to carry out the experiment after a friend told him that the slices were not real cheese.

He said: 'I tried it out after hearing from a friend of mine that these cheese slices are not real cheese and don't melt, and he showed me what happened when you put them over a gas flame to prove it.

'I felt like I was being ripped off so I videoed it and stuck it on YouTube, and was surprised about the reaction.'

Mr Reyes said the video shows that the cheese, sold by discount chain Aurrera, is more akin to plastic and believes it is enough to deter people from eating processed cheese for life.

Instead, the cheese slice merely blackens, leading the chef to liken the product to plastic 

He added he had wanted to post the footage to warn people about what they were buying.

The row over processed cheese started last year in the U.S with a similar video involving Kraft sliced cheese.

It prompted the company to release their own YouTube video explaining why it does not melt at high temperatures. 

The slices used in the bizarre experiment were from the Aurrera discount chain in Mexico 

At the time, Kraft said it was well known that their cheese only melted at low temperatures and stressed that the cheese was perfectly healthy to eat and contained only real cheese and natural product additives.

The only other addition, they said, was the use of emulsifiers to bind the proteins and fat which they said was also common in chocolate and many other foods.

The emulsifiers, they said, meant that at high temperatures the cheese did not melt and it would need lower temperatures and a longer period of time if people wanted to see their Kraft cheese slices melting
