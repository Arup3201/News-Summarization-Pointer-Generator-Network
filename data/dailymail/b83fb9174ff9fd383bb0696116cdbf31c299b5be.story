Pub Landlord Al Murray's campaign to defeat Nigel Farage struggled to get off the ground today, after being told he was too heavy to parachute into the Kent seat where they are both standing for election.

The comedian hoped to use the the stunt to reject claims he had been parachuted in to fight the South Thanet seat for his new party FUKP - Free United Kingdom Party.

But as the media gathered at Headcorn Aerodrome near Ashford this morning he was told that because he was heavier than the 14st 7lb (92kg) limit to was too big to jump.

Pub Landlord Al Murray was told he was too heavy to parachute into the South Thanet seat where he is standing for election 

He joked that he had been 'held back by health and safety gone mad' as he posed for this photo on Twitter

Murray, 46, is standing in South Thanet, which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the general election in 2010.

It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there, despite Ukip taking just 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago. Recent polls suggest he could be on course to win the seat. 

Murray's decision to stand against him has been seen as an attempt to undermine Farage's pint-swilling image.

FUKP's policies include bricking up the Channel Tunnel, locking up the unemployed and selling beer for 1p per pint.

Today the dejected star tried to put a positive spin on his inability to parachute into the seat, telling reporters it proved he was officially a 'political heavyweight'.

Murray is standing against Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has welcomed the addition of the comedian to the campaign, declaring: 'The more the merrier'

Quote: 'We would not want to be like the Swiss, would we? That would be awful! We'd be rich!' 

Murrary added: 'Unfortunately today's stunt - and that was exactly what it was, a stunt to garner publicity it might generate - has had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.

'It seems that I am too heavy to jump. It's a double whammy. Not only am I another tragic victim of this country's obesity epidemic, but also I have been held back by health and safety gone mad.' 

CURRENCY

The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more.

NHS 

If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on.

FOREIGN POLICY 

Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying.

IMMIGRATION 

The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse.

EUROPE

Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.

LAW AND ORDER

Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed.

The 6ft 3in comic said he was unaware how much he weighed. He was asked whether Friday the 13th - today's date - was the best day to perform such a stunt.

Murray, dressed in his trademark burgundy blazer, said: 'I'm a true British man - I neither cry nor weigh myself on scales. Those are my values.'

Oxford-educated Murray has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character, in which he promises: 'I pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 and the edge of the Solar System by 2050. Common Market sense.

'In the meantime Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.'

He included a pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 'and the edge of the Solar System by 2050'. 

On the hot topic of immigration, he plans to stop people reaching the shores of 'the greatest country in the world' by bricking up the Channel Tunnel - with British bricks and using Polish labour.

In a further bid to win over wavering voters, he has promised to introduce '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'.

A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: 'Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick.' 

In nearby Wendover, Bucks, Ukip leader Nigel Farage expressed his doubts about the legitimacy of his rival candidate's campaign.

He said: 'He's not even standing as himself, he's standing as his alter ego.

'It is a bit of a laugh and and I have no doubt that in terms of promotion for his tour around the UK he will make a lot of money off the back of it.

'I don't really think the joke is going to last that long.' 

South Thanet, which includes the coastal towns of Ramsgate, Sandwich and Broadstairs, has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day .
