Jailed: Dana Amin, 33, from Mitcham, South London, has been jailed for his part in the 'honour killing' of Banaz Mahmod in 2006

A cousin of an honour killing victim who helped dispose of her body has said he is proud of his actions.

Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled to death with a shoelace by her father and uncle in her south London home, seven years ago.

Her cousin Dana Amin, now 29, helped put the 
young woman's body in a suitcase and transported it to the Midlands before burying it in a make-shift grave in a
 Birmingham back-garden.

As he was sentenced to eight years in prison, Amin told Southwark Crown Court he did not regret his actions.

Iraq-born Banaz was murdered by members of her family because she walked out of an arranged marriage and fell in love with another man.

Her father, Mahmod Mahmod, and uncle, 
Ari Mahmod, were jailed for life in 2007, after being found guilty of what has become Britain’s most notorious honour 
killing. 

On the eve of Banaz's death, Amin, a father-of-one, joined two other cousins, Mohammed Ali, and Omar Hussain, who were jailed in 2010 after being extradited from Iraq, at the former's Brixton home to discuss plans to kill her.

Although none were convicted of Banaz's murder, the cousins later travelled to Birmingham in Amin’s black Lexus to help their uncles get rid of the 20-year-old's body.

Banaz’s case highlighted the occurrence of honour killings in Britain, after her body was discovered in the Brimingham garden, three months after her disappearance.

The young woman's nightmare began three years earlier, when she 
agreed to an arranged-marriage to a Kurdish man, then 
aged 28, who she later told police was ‘very strict'.

She had met her 
husband-to-be only three times before her wedding day and, according to 
Banaz, her husband regularly 
physically and sexually abused her.

‘When
 he raped me it was like I was his shoe that he could wear whenever he 
wanted to,’ she explained to police. ‘I didn't know if this was normal in my 
culture, or here. I was 17.’

Murder: The body of Banaz Mahmod was found inside this suitcase, three months after she has been buried in a Birmingham garden by three of her own cousins

The terrified young woman left her husband after two-and-a-half years, a decision that angered her family, who had arrived in Britain when Banaz was 12.

After returning to her family home, she met and fell in love with Rahmat Sulemani, a family friend.

Rahmat
 would later give evidence at the trial, revealing that he and Banaz had 
been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other.

The
 mobile phone footage he took of Banaz when she was lying covered in 
blood in a hospital bed, in an apparent earlier attempt to murder her, 
was shown at the 2007 trial.

The 
lovers pretended they had parted after the shocking incident, but they 
continued to meet in secret. They were spotted together in Brixton on 
January 21 and the Mahmods were informed.

Rahmat was kidnapped by four men who threatened to kill him.

Harrowing: Banaz visited police five times asking for help, but nothing was done in time

When he phoned Banaz to warn her, she went to the police and said she would co-operate in bringing charges against her family and other members of the community.

The 
policewoman who saw Banaz tried to persuade her to go into a hostel or 
safe house but she is thought to have seen her home as safe because 
her mother was there.

She returned to the family home and was murdered just days later.

Despite denying any involvement in the plot, Amin was convicted by a jury yesterday following a week-long trial.

Judge Martin Beddoe slammed the ‘perverted code’ followed by the killers which dictates a woman cannot do as she chooses.

He told Amin: ‘I am quite satisfied that you knew well before she was murdered what was going to happen to your cousin.'

Judge
 Beddoe added: 'Her
 death had been planned for about a month or so before it actually took 
place. There had even been an attempt on her life already.

‘I
 am sure you were aware of all these matters and you knew not only of 
what had gone on but what was intended to happen. I fear for any female 
child you may father.

‘When I think of that girl in that suitcase in that hole 
in the ground, I find it really hard to consider your family situation.

‘It is a reflection that you are again thinking of yourself and demonstrating a complete lack of remorse.’

Amin,
 of Mitcham, south London, denied doing acts tending and intending to 
pervert the course of public justice and preventing the lawful and 
decent burial of a corpse.

He
 is about to become a father for the second time, and the court was told
 he plans on joining his wife and sons in Iraq after he has served his 
time.
