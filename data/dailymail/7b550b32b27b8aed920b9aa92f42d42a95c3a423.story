Having both worked for the BBC for more than 20 years, Radio 4 presenters John Humphrys and Justin Webb have a wealth of experience when it comes to uncomfortable exchanges.

And while normally it's their punitive line of questioning that sees interviewees squirm, this time the pair had listeners grimacing all by themselves in a painful bid to get down with the kids. 

Taking instructions from an urban slang expert, the journalists spat the words 'bro', 'rude-boy' and 'blud' as part of their early morning broadcast.

To the entertainment of guests Nihal Arthanayake, a BBC Asian Network presenter, and Peter York, author of the famous 1980 Sloane Range Handbook, Humphrys and Webb held nothing back as they indulged their inner street-egos.

Their conversation stemmed from David Cameron's claim that he and Barack Obama are so close, the President sometimes calls him 'bro'. 

'Well when I come in at 4am, I normally say to John: 'Yo rudeboy', 54-year-old Webb joked. 

'Yo rudeboy, that's right,' Humphrys, aged 71, joined in. 

Complimented that in fact he had good 'street credentials' by Arthanayake, also known as DJ Nihal, Humphrys retorted: 'Thanks bro.' 

Later, the veteran journalist revealed where he had learnt some of the phrases tossed around in the excruciating exchange. 

'What about blud? My son calls me blud often.' 

Listeners took to Twitter to share their amusement, with one jokingly comparing Humphrys to the American rapper Drake.

The bizarre episode was sparked by David Cameron's confession that he and Barack Obama are so close, the American president calls him 'bro'. 

Referring to the Prime Minister's boastful admission, social commentator Peter York said he likely recognised the term as one of endearment from the American drama, The Wire.

The show, which follows Baltimore narcotics police and a network of violent drug dealers as they evade try to evade prosecution by the former, was 'very, very popular, where the Prime Minister grew up, he said. 

'The Wire was really popular int hat bit of notting hill where Cameron used to live, so there is Cameron - a certain kind of public schoolboy with a certain kind of sensibility, thinking it's flattering, thinking he's cool.

'But actually the most important thing is to stake his claim for closeness to the most powerful guy in the world, it wouldn't matter what he called him as long as it was tolerably intimate.' 

York is the author of the 1980s Sloane Ranger Handbook, an observation on the etiquette and lifestyle of privileged west Londoners. 

Unlike the Prime MInister, York, the former style editor of Harpers and Queen, said he would greet acquaintances as 'Darling you.' 

Rather than an opt for an urban alternative, the author said: 'I would say You or Darling, You.

'Obama to Cameron, I don't think "Darling, you" would quite work. 

'Perhaps the other way around.' 

At the end of the programme he celebrated: 'My dogs..Wonderful, my dogs. It's wonderful that four middle-aged people would devote time to talking about this.'
