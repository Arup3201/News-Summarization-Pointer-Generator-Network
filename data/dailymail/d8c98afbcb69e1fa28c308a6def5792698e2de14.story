Oxford University has been accused of 'betraying' alleged victims of sexual assault by hushing up allegations made against students and members of staff.

More than a dozen men and women have described a 'culture of silence' preventing them from reporting claims of sex attacks and rapes.

The collection of claims have been compiled in a booklet created by the Oxford University Student Union.

The editor of the booklet, in an unsigned foreword, describes the collection as representing a ‘whole spectrum of feelings from antagonism, anger and frustration to sadness, guilt and betrayal towards the university and its services’.

According to The Times, the union’s vice-president for women, Sarah Pine, said that while there had been ‘positive steps’ made by the university since the booklet was published last autumn, some staff continue to hold the wrong attitudes.

She said that the ‘overriding response’ appeared to be that ‘those in positions of responsibility mediated by the university have had some victim-blaming views’.

She said some of the colleges had ‘very badly’ and that ‘intellectualism’ could get the better of humane instincts.

A university spokesman said: ‘Oxford has always taken complaints of harassment very seriously. It has a policy and procedures in place to help students make complaints in all such cases, including sexual harassment and assault.

'While the OUSU publication referred to is now out of date, the University’s culture has always been one of offering comfort and support to victims.

'We are committed to continually educating our staff and students on how best to offer relevant and sensitive support, working closely with OUSU on this.'

The spokesman said the university has more than 270 'training harassment advisors' offering 'immediate support'.

They added: 'The benefit of Oxford’s collegiate system is that students live and study in small communities offering a close and supportive environment.

'In instances of sexual harassment or violence, welfare teams, peer supporters and harassment advisors based in the colleges, are on hand to offer immediate support to students.

'They will always support students who report  sexual violence and would encourage them to report those allegations, which are a criminal matter, to the police.’
