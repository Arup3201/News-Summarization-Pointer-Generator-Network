Princess Beatrice and Sarah Ferguson enjoyed their second mother–daughter date in a week.

The royal pair were seen leaving glamorous 45 Park Lane Hotel restaurant in Mayfair last night, having enjoyed another gourmet dinner.

While most of us have to curtail nights out during the week, or risk falling asleep at our desks, the 25-year-old royal is lucky enough not to have to get up for work in the morning.

Last night’s dinner marked the third time this week Beatrice has hit the town.

Fergie wore a simple grey skirt suit with a light blue shirt and her eldest daughter chose an unusual long sleeved black velvet dress

Again dining with her mother the pair seemed to have coordinated their outfits, both opting for a flash of blue around the neckline.

While Fergie wore a simple grey skirt suit with a light blue shirt underneath, her eldest daughter chose an unusual long-sleeved black velvet dress with a plunging neckline emphasised with a bright blue trim.

Both wore sheer black tights: Fergie opted for a pair of black ballet pumps to complete her look, while Beatrice adding an edge to her outfit with black patent high heels.

Sister Eugenie was not present, in spite of the fact she is thought to be in the capital, having flown back to London from New York earlier this week.

On Wednesday night, Sarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice were joined her ex-husband the Duke of York for dinner at smart Mayfair restaurant ‘Restaurant C’ while last Friday Beatrice was seen leaving fashionable new Marylebone eatery the Chiltern Firehouse, where she had been dining with friends.

Princess Eugenie has been back in the UK this week, attending the official opening of the new High Dependency Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital

Younger sister Eugenie has had a busy week too.

Taking a break from her job at online auction house Paddle8 in New York, the 24-year-old flew home to open the new Children's High Dependency Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital where she underwent spinal surgery herself aged 12.
