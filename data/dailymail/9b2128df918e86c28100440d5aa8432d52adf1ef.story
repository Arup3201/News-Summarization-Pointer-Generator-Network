Wrestling legend 'Paul Bearer', real name William Alvin Moody, died of a heart attack caused by an untreated rapid heart rate, according to his son.

Michael Moody told TMZ on Saturday that his father’s death certificate lists the cause of the heart attack as supraventricular tachycardia, or SVT -- an extremely rapid heart rhythm that occurs at the part of the heart's control system which keeps the top of the organ properly functioning.

Mr Moody, the pasty-faced, urn-carrying manager for performers The Undertaker and Kane, died on Tuesday, March 5. He was 58.

Heart attack victim: William Moody, aka Paul Bearer, the pasty-faced, urn-carrying manager for performers The Undertaker and Kane died of heart attack caused by an untreated rapid heart rate, his son said

SVT is typically not life threatening, though it can decrease one’s heart functionality if prolonged without treatment, according to medical sources.

SVT's symptoms are similar to anxiety and heartburn, so it is not uncommon for people to wait out the discomfort instead of seeing a doctor.

Those who get treated for the fairly common heart condition without waiting too long more often than not survive, one cardiologist told TMZ.

Michael Moody said doctors believe his dad had been struggling with SVT for several weeks.

Three days before Mr Moody died, he had reportedly complained to friends and family that he was suffering a blood clot.

The WWE released a statement at the time of his death saying, ‘WWE is saddened to learn of the passing of William Moody, aka Paul Bearer.’

‘Moody made his WWE debut in 1991 as the manager of The Undertaker and went on to become a memorable part of WWE over the course of the next 20 years. Our deepest condolences go out to Moody’s family, friends and fans.’

After stints in various independent wrestling promotions, Mr Moody joined the WWE in 1990 and quickly became associated with The Undertaker, a character who claimed he was undead and boasted of mystical powers.

The WWE said in a statement that Mr Moody, 'went on to become a memorable part of WWE over the course of the next 20 years.'

In
 the WWE plotline, Paul Bearer later managed Undertaker's on-screen 
half-brother Kane. He also managed the bad-guy character Mick 'Mankind' 
Foley.

His shrill 
catchphrase, 'Ooohhh yeeesss!' and contorted facial expressions made him
 one of the sports-entertainment company's more popular personalities 
for more than a decade.

In the outlandish world of pro wrestling, Paul Bearer was once placed in a glass casket and buried in concrete.

In his final WWE appearance last year, Paul Bearer was locked in a freezer by Randy Orton and left there tied up even after he was found by Kane.

That was Mr Moody's life in the WWE. And it was a business he loved for nearly 40 years. Many of his colleagues paid tribute to him on Twitter following the news of his death.

'Rest in peace, Paul Bearer. You will never be forgotten. There will never be another,' wrote wrestler Triple H.

On March 2, Mr Moody allegedly told people at a Cauliflower Alley Club reunion that he was seeking treatment for 'respiratory issues.'

The president of the wrestling society, Bob Kelly, told TMZ that the wrestling manager was hospitalized immediately after the reunion.

Mr Moody was a perfect fit as a macabre mortician.

When he joined the WWE, he ditched the blond hair and Percy Pringle name he forged in the 1980s for jet black locks complete with powdered white face.

In the act, Paul Bearer's urn had some 
unexplained power that protected the Undertaker, allowing his protégé to
 escape unscathed from every leg drop and big boot to the face. Paul 
Bearer also hosted the WWE segment, 'The Funeral Parlor.'

Mr Moody, an Alabama native, told the pro wrestling website PWTorch.com last year that he had a degree in mortuary science. He said he was a licensed funeral director and embalmer.

He was called to WWE chairman Vince McMahon's office about taking the job as Undertaker's manager without the company knowing his true background.

'It was one those had-to-be-there moments when Vince realized I was the real thing, the real deal,' Mr Moody told the website. 'I was the real Undertaker.'

Mr Moody battled health and weight problems and worked on and off for the company after 2002.

Foley said he babysat Mr Moody's children and called him 'Uncle Paul.'

The Paul Bearer character will be remembered most for the soap opera twists in his relationship with The Undertaker, still one of the premier stars of the WWE.

'It just seemed so bizarre,' Foley said in a telephone interview. 'But at the same time, he was a perfect fit for The Undertaker. They went on to become iconic figures in our profession.'
