Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech in London to set out why he would not back an EU referendum, unless Brussels tries to seize more powers

Ed Miliband today faced a backlash from within the Labour party after ruling out holding an referendum on Britain leaving the EU.

The Labour leader is refusing to match David Cameron’s pledge to hold a 
vote by the end of 2017 on whether Britain should stay in the European 
Union.

In an attempt to appear at least open to the idea of a referendum, Mr Miliband says he would only
 hold a vote if the UK decides to hand even more powers to
 Europe – something even he admits is ‘unlikely’.

But one Labour MP dismissed it as a 'shoddy compromise' while another said the party had to be more 'trusting' of people.

Labour donor John Mills said the growth of the EU's influence over Britain in the past 40 years 'warrants a referendum regardless of future events'.

But a shadow cabinet source admitted that opposition to a vote was the party's only policy which business liked.

It pitches Labour and the Tory party into a bitter battle over who is willing to give the public a say. It was 
greeted with delight last night in Downing Street.

Speaking at the London Business School, Mr Miliband insisted that a Labour government would not be part of an 'inexorable drive to an ever closer union' in Europe.

He said that while he believed it was 'unlikely' that there would be any moves to transfer any more power to Brussels in the next parliament, his new 'legislative lock' would ensure the public would have a say before that could happen.

'Now, there are no current proposals from other countries for such a transfer of powers.

'And I do not believe this is the direction in which Europe should head. Indeed, I think some powers should come back the other way. But we cannot be certain about the emerging shape of Europe,' he said.

But Mr Cameron dismissed the new policy as a fudge cooked up by a committee trying to please a range of conflicting views inside the Labour party.

Speaking to reporters on a trip to Israel, the Prime Minister said the Labour leader's intervention meant the Conservatives will be the only mainstream party guaranteeing a referendum on Europe, both at May's European Parliament elections and the General Election next year.

Mr Cameron said: 'This is a policy clearly designed by a committee - a committee who obviously couldn't decide what to do, who have come up with a policy that makes no sense whatsoever.

'The British people now have a very, very clear choice - at the next election they can elect a Conservative government that will renegotiate Britain's position in Europe and give people a guaranteed In/Out referendum by the end of 2017.

'If they get a Labour government they will get no referendum, no choice, no reform - nothing.

'It's absolutely clear - you get Miliband, you don't get a referendum, you don't get a choice. It's the classic Labour "we know best" approach to politics.'

Mr Miliband was criticised by some Labour MPs for the fudge in response to the Tory pledge of a referendum by 2017

The Labour told the London Business School that threatening Britain's membership of the European Union risked causing damage to the economy

Mr
 Miliband’s move will exasperate senior figures in his own party, who 
have been pressing him to match the Prime Minister’s pledge.

But after shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced a fresh tax raid on pensions, bankers and houses to fund a youth jobs scheme, it is hoped that ruling out an EU referendum will help bolster Labour's support among business leaders.

One shadow cabinet minister told MailOnline: ‘Opposing a referendum is our only policy which businesses like. Rightly or wrongly – and it is unfair – there is the impression that we are anti-business.

'Why would we give up the only thing which marks us out from the Tories which business like?’

Mr Miliband has launched a series of attacks on big business including energy firms, pensions companies and banking.

Today it emerged shadow employment minister Stephen Timms had launched a scathing attack on capitalism.

He claimed businesses were 'driven by greed' and that unethical business practices were 'the natural way that capitalism operates', The Times reported.

But the decision was greeted with 
dismay by some in the party. Labour donor John Mills, who gave the party
 £1.5million last year, said: 'The growth of the EU's influence over 
Britain warrants a referendum regardless of future events.'

Labour backbencher Graham Stringer said: 'I think it's a shoddy compromise really, between those people in the Parliamentary Labour Party who want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it, and those people desperate not to have a referendum.

'I think the public are very clear that they want a referendum. This is so ambiguous as to be impossible to sell on the doorstep.'

Labour
 MP John Mann said he still hoped Mr Miliband would go further and 
commit to an in-out referendum even if no power transfer is on the 
table.

'Certainly I've 
polled very (extensively) Labour votes in my area, and without question,
 they're more hostile than they were to the European Union - 
significantly more so - and I think that we need to be in touch and we 
need to be trusting the people,' he told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight.

'So
 I hope that over the next few months he'll go further and say that the 
Labour Party's going to trust the people and let the people have a say 
on this.'

One Labour frontbencher said Mr Miliband had ruled out a referendum as the only policy which business supported

However, business leaders have warned the prospect of an EU referendum would cause unnecessary uncertainty and threaten the economy. The CBI argues it 'is in our shared interests for the UK to stay in the EU'.

In response to Mr Miliband's announcement, by Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising and media giant WPP, said: 'I would say not having a referendum is better than having one. Having a referendum creates more uncertainty. The last thing we need is more uncertainty.'

Mr Cameron used a speech in January last year to promise to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

Labour dithered for months about whether to match the pledge, with Mr Balls and international development spokesman Jim Murphy among those urging Mr Miliband to include the promise of a referendum in the 2015 manifesto.

Ex-Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said Mr Miliband was showing 'strong leadership' by ruling out a popular policy

But writing
 in the Financial Times, Mr Miliband says: ‘My priorities for government
 after the election are very different from the Conservatives.

'Labour 
will focus on dealing with the cost-of-living crisis by building a 
better economy so people can look forward to a better future for their 
children.

‘An arbitrary 
timetable for a referendum on leaving Europe would damage our ability to
 deliver on these priorities.’

He adds: ‘The next Labour government will
 legislate for a new lock: there would be no transfer of powers from the
 UK to the EU without a referendum on our continued membership of the 
EU.’

Mr Miliband's decision is also a blow to Ukip, whose leader Nigel Farage had repeatedly 
insisted Mr Miliband would be forced to buckle and agree to a 
referendum.

The Labour leader stressed his determination to reform the EU if elected in 2015, and pledged a legal lock that would guarantee an in-out vote if Westminster was asked to hand over more control.

The legal lock proposed by Mr Miliband would effectively upgrade the one introduced by the coalition which guarantees a referendum before any powers are transferred.

Labour's position aligns it closely with the Liberal Democrats on Europe, offering common ground for any potential negotiations about forming a joint government in 2015.

Posting on Twitter last night, Mr Cameron said: 'By his own admission, Ed Miliband says it's unlikely there'll be an in-out referendum on Europe under Labour.

'Only the Conservative Party can guarantee and deliver that referendum.'

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Jerusalem today, said only the Tories would offer a vote

Mr Cameron could not contain is delight at Labour's decision to rule out matching his pledge on holding an in-out referendum

A
 Conservative spokesman added: ‘Our relationship with Europe isn’t 
working and it needs to change. That’s why David Cameron has set out a 
plan to seek a new settlement for Britain in Europe, and then put it to 
the British people in an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

‘Both
 Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose this plan – they won’t give the
 people a referendum and Ukip simply cannot deliver one. Only the 
Conservatives will trust the British people to have their say on our 
country’s future.’

Former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson hailed Mr Miliband's decision as an example of strong leadership.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'Most people in the first instance will say that a referendum has looked quite popular amongst many in the public and therefore he’s doing something which shows strong leadership in standing up against that position.

'But even those who disagree with him generally on matters, on a referendum in particular, I think they will admire him for showing leadership and guts on a major issue.

'Therefore this is a test of him and his approach to leadership as much as to the issue itself, and for those who are worried about Britain just sleepwalking out of Europe, not only those who are running businesses and depending on Europe’s vast market, MIliband’s statement will be particularly important and welcome.

But his comments indicated a dramatic change of heart, having argued in 2010: 'I believe a fresh referendum will be necessary because the political parties cannot reconcile their own differences and come to a final conclusion on their own, and nor should they.'
