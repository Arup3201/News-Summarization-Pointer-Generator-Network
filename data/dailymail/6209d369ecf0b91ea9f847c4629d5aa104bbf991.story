A 63-year-old Wisconsin man is in a coma after falling off a roller coaster due to a faulty safety bar three weeks ago.

An attorney for the family of 63-year-old Anthony Theisen said the man remains at University Hospital in Madison with numerous fractures and a brain injury caused by the March 6 accident.

According to Lake Delton police, Mr Theisen fell nearly 17 feet from the Opa! Twister Steel Roller Coaster to the concrete floor at Mt. Olympus Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells.

Unrestrained: An investigation revealed that Mr Theisen's lap bar became loose while the four-person cart he was on was rounding a corner

Theisen's wife, Kay Theisen, was riding in the same cart and told police her husband's lap bar unlocked when they went around a corner, hurling him into the air.

Attorney Todd Korb said Theisen sustained a fractured scapula, four fractured vertebrae, fractured toes, a fractured finger and dislocated shoulder, in addition to life-threatening brain injuries.

Officer Troy Spencer wrote in his police report that he checked the four lap bars in Theisen's cart several times and found three bars could not be pulled up. But, the fourth bar, where Thiesen was sitting, came unlocked.

‘It appeared that the lap bar on Seat #1 locking mechanism was stripped. I checked the lap bars over three times to make sure Seat #1 was the only seat to come unlocked, which it was,’ Spencer wrote.

Police interviewed several witnesses at Mt. Olympus, including a maintenance worker who told investigators the ride was working properly during test runs that day.

Theisen's attorney said a safety test was done on the ride earlier this week. Sand bags to simulate Theisen's weight were placed in the seat he was using, Korb said, and when the cart reached the point on the track where Theisen was ejected, the lap bar opened.

The couple who were riding with the Theisen couple in the four-person cart said they saw the man ‘flying out of the cart’ and hurtling through the air ‘like a rag doll,’ Wisconsin Dells Events reported.

Another amusement park visitor told police she rode in Theisen’s very seat five minutes earlier and noticed the safety bar was slack, according to the report cited by Channel 3000, forcing her to hold onto it for the entire duration of the ride.

Anthony and Kay Theisen live in Fremont, and according to the woman’s Facebook page, they have three grandchildren.

Tourist destination: Mt Olympus officials said it is the first time an accident of this type has occurred at the Wisconsin theme park

Playground: Mt Olympus Water and Theme Park, which has been in operation since 2004, features a total of 53 rides, including seven roller coasters

Mt. Olympus said in a statement released by general manager Adam Makowski that the company has fully cooperated with Lake Delton Police and the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS).

It is the first time an accident of this type has occurred at the theme park, the statement said. The roller coaster will remain closed pending the results of an investigation.

DSPS records show the Mt. Olympus ride had been inspected eight times since 2006, most recently last May, with only a few minor problems identified in 2008 concerning sharp corners and protruding screws and bolts. 

Mt. Olympus Water and Theme Park, which has been in operation since 2004, consists of four sections featuring a total of 53 rides, including seven roller coasters.
