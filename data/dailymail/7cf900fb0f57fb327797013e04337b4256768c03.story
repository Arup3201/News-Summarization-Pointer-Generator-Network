A French magazine has sparked controversy by booking a white model for an 'African Queen' fashion shoot - then heavily bronzing her face and body to make her appear black.

Numéro magazine chose to use blonde-haired, blue-eyed industry darling Ondria Hardin, 16, for the shoot - which features in the March issue - despite then making her up as a black model.

The 
editorial - shot by photographer Sebastian Kim - also sees Hardin dressed in 'traditional' prints, with make-up done
by artist Maud Laceppe.

Critics have now slammed the magazine for using the North Carolina teenager, saying that if they wanted a black model they should have simply hired one.

Jezebel's Laura Beck points out that Ford 
Models, the agency representing Hardin, has several black models 
on its roster, but instead the magazine opted to employ a white girl.

Saying there was 'no excuse' for the move, she added: 'It's impossible to look at this and not ache for young women of color who want to pursue careers in modeling. If jobs for "African Queen" photo spreads aren't going to black women, what hope is there?'

Commenting on Jezebel, one user named 'fashionlady' wrote: 'Can I just say as a young black model (I'm a girl) having worked my ass for the past three years, this hurts my soul.'

Twitter users were also outraged by the move. Kelly Madison tweeted: '‏@MadisonKellyNYC Over it! Just book a blk model!?! no??'

Elisha-Rio Apilado ‏ tweeted, 'Innovative? More like ignorant,' with Abbas Somji ‏adding, 'New low in the world of #fashion,' and Afroklektic saying: 'Ondria Hardin, is not an African Queen. This is not artistic expression. This is just wrong.'

Numéro Magazine issued a response to criticism, stating: 'The artistic statement of the photographer Sebastian Kim, author of this editorial, is in line with his previous photographic creations, which insist on the melting pot and the mix of cultures, the exact opposite of any skin color based discrimination.

'Numéro has always supported the artistic freedom of the talented photographers who work with the magazine to illustrate its pages, and has not took part in the creation process of this editorial.

'For its part, Numéro Magazine, which has the utmost respect for this photographer’s creative work, firmly excludes that the latest may have had, at any moment, the intention to hurt readers’ sensitivity, whatever their origin.

'Numéro Magazine considers that it has regularly demonstrated its deep attachment to the promotion of different skin-colored models.

'For instance, the next issue of Numéro for Man on sale on 15th March has the black model Fernando Cabral on the cover page, and the current Russian edition’s cover of our magazine features the black model Naomi Campbell on its cover.

'This demonstrates the completely inappropriate nature of the accusations made against our magazine, deeply committed to the respect for differences, tolerance and more generally to non-discrimination.

'Considering the turmoil caused by this publication, the Management of Numéro Magazine would like to apologize to anyone who may have been offended by this editorial.'

Januari Afrasiabi: If I ever see Ondria Hardin on the street I am throwing eggs at her for wearing blackface...

Paula:
If you're going to fetishise "Africa" (a massive CONTINENT) you could 
use a woman of colour as your model.. http://bit.ly/YsPa5d ugh

Numéro also courted controversy in October
2010 when white French model Constance Jablonski posed as a mother
to a black child.

Several other brands have featured 
racially questionable editorial. In 2006 Kate Moss posed for The 
Independent wearing nothing but black paint covering, and in 2010, 
Claudia Schiffer posed for Karl Lagerfeld with a black face, yellow wig 
and brown bodypaint. In 2012, make-up brand Illamasqua featured a 
black-faced white model

And this isn't the first time that model Ondria Hardin has been involved in a controversial shoot.

The North Carolina teenager has been 
embroiled in a number of underage modelling fiascos, including when she 
walked for Marc Jacobs at the age of 14 and appeared in Vogue China 
before her 16th birthday, seemingly flouting the magazine's policy not 
to employ models under 16.

Vogue later claimed the spread had been commercial and therefore out of their jurisdiction.
