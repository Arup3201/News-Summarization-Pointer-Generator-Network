Criticism: Many guests have been left less than impressed after staying at Gordon Ramsay's York & Albany Hotel in London

He is famed for turning the fortunes of faltering culinary ventures.

But while Gordon Ramsay embarks on his new Hotel Hell fix-it tour of the US - many guests at his own London establishment are being left with a sour taste in their mouths.

A spate of lousy reviews on popular website TripAdvisor criticise the 'horrible breakfast' while claiming the 'staff couldn't care less' and the guesthouse is 'poor value for money'.

The cheapest room available at the York & Albany hotel and restaurant, which is next to Regent's Park, costs more than £200 a night - while a three-course meal is likely to set you back more than £40.

Much of the criticism is aimed at the 'small bog standard' rooms but other reviewers lay into the food claiming their breakfast was 'pre cooked and kept tepid while a choice of eggs was added'.

One reviewer called JCBrighton writes: 'Two out of our party of four chose maple-flavoured ham - which looked, and tasted, like it came straight out of a tin. 

'Two small, rectangular slices of ham of suspiciously-identical thickness without a hint of maple flavour. Very, very poor. For a bill of £238.50 for four, including drinks, I expect much, much better. 

'If you want to experience good quality food and cooking at fair prices, try any Jason Atherton place - so much better. 

'Just leaves you with the feeling that Ramsay's empire has just got too big for its boots Only plus point? The guys behind the bar are great! Needless to say, won't be coming back.'

There were some positive comments with one reviewer recently giving the establishment a five out five rating - although their comment ends 'I wouldn't stay here again and that's only because of the price'.

Another called it a 'lovely experience' and wrote: 'A great base for exploring and the town was extremely interesting.' 

Of the 138 reviews on TripAdvisor, 22 are average, 19 poor and eight call the hotel terrible. 

Many of the messages left in the comments book are also less than complimentary, The Daily Star Sunday reports.

One note read: 'Room disappointing, good food, saving grace the cocktails and friendly bar staff.'

Another guest from Scotland said 'a bit more attention to room cleanliness' was needed, although they did still call it 'a fab wee place'.

The newspaper also took pictures in the hotel showing broken tiles, cracked mirrors, unattached bath fixtures and peeling wallpaper in one en-suite room.

The swanky York & Albany has been voted 527th out of the 1,073 hotels in London.

More positive: A reviewer in December called their stay at the York & Albany a 'lovely experience' 

A spokesman for Gordon Ramsay told the Daily Star Sunday: 'Guest feedback is welcomed and taken seriously across all our properties.

'The York & Albany enjoys a strong online rating with the majority of TripAdvisor reviews having rated it as either 'Excellent' or 'Very Good'.  

As the establishment struggles to make a lasting impression on its guests, the celebrity chef has begun filming a second series of Hotel Hell in America.

The show's publicity statement reads: 'Gordon Ramsay travels across the US visiting struggling hotels, motels and bed and breakfasts, attempting to fix their problems and turn the troubled establishments around.'

Gordon Ramsay recently lost a court battle over his personal liability for the £640,000 rent on the business.

The chef's own 'kitchen nightmare' stemmed from a bitter dispute with his estranged father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his businesses until he was forced out in 2010.
