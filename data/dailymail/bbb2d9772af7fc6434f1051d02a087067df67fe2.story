Ajax manager Frank de Boer will wait until the end of the season to speak to Tottenham Hotspur over a potential move.

The former Holland defender led Ajax to the Eredivisie title last weekend and confirmed he has been 'approached' by Spurs.

'Spurs have made an approach,' he said to Dutch broadcaster NOS. 'After the last league game (against NEC on May 3) I'll think about it. I'll talk to them and listen to what they have to say.'

Ajax held off a late charge from Feyernoord, who have won seven games in a row, to take the Dutch title at Heracles Almelo on Sunday.

The 43-year-old, whose assistant at Ajax is Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp, is in his first managerial role since retiring as a player and the latest title made it four in a row for the former Barcelona and Rangers defender.

De Boer has also been mentioned as a possibility to take over at Monaco. He said he had been informed of the approach by the club's director of football Marc Overmars.

‘I would like to add something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool.

‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.’

Influence: De Boer believes he can emulate the kind of success Brendan Rodgers has had at Liverpool

Ajax confirmed to the BBC that an approach by Tottenham had been made to Overmars more than three weeks ago.

Current boss Tim Sherwood, who has the best win percentage of any Spurs manager in the Premier League era, was handed an 18-month contract in December but he was told a few weeks ago that he will be replaced in the summer.

In recent weeks a number of managers from around Europe have been linked with the job and a frustrated Sherwood told reporters 
after the 1-0 victory at Stoke that other managers should stop 'touting 
themselves' for the role.

Return? Glenn Hoddle has been linked with a comeback as the Spurs manager

'Every press conference I do it’s, “This manager’s coming in” - Van Gaal, then Hoddle, this one and that one,’ Sherwood said. ‘Some of these managers are touting themselves for my job. I don’t think that’s right.

‘At every press conference at our training centre it’s, “You’re keeping the seat warm for someone else”. Yeah I am, but the seat’s getting quite hot!’
