Cancer patients in Wales are being denied life-saving new treatments being made available to those in England, campaigners warn today.

The Labour-run Welsh government’s refusal to fund the drugs has left patients with no choice but to move across the border, where they have a chance of getting help through the Cancer Drugs Fund, or raid their savings.

Although it insists it cannot afford a cancer drugs fund, the administration in Cardiff spends more than £30million a year on providing free prescriptions for everyone – even the wealthiest – including for drugs available over the counter such as aspirin.

Last night Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the state of the NHS in Wales to the Mid Staffordshire scandal, and said an inquiry was now needed into shocking revelations over ‘care failures and cover-ups’.

He added: ‘More appalling than the problems themselves is the fact the Welsh Labour government continues to resist calls to sort them out. I wholeheartedly support the Daily Mail’s calls for an investigation.’

On the fifth day of this paper’s series exposing the crisis, we reveal:

■ There are 71 types of advanced cancer treatment available in England under a special fund that are not routinely on offer in Wales.

■ Half of Welsh patients’ requests for new cancer drugs not on officially approved lists were turned down in 2012-13, Rare Cancers Foundation research found.

■ Last year the Welsh NHS spent £4.6million on prescribing paracetamol and nearly £2million on dispensing aspirin.

English cancer patients now have routine access to medication such as Avastin, which can extend their lives by years, thanks to the £200million Cancer Drugs Fund set up in 2010. But in Wales, seriously ill people must make individual patient funding requests, which are frequently rejected. Fewer than one in 20 of the patients in England treated via the fund would have been treated if they lived in Wales, according to the Rarer Cancers Foundation.

Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record 

Kate Northcott set up a campaign to help cancer patients when her mother Pamela died in 2007 aged 58 after being refused a pioneering treatment by Welsh authorities. She has witnessed the divergence of patients’ fates at the Countess of Chester Hospital, which treats people from both England and Wales because it is near the border. She said the waiting room is divided into two groups – one is going to get access to treatment and one isn’t.

The Rarer Cancers Foundation calculated in 2011 that setting up a cancer drugs fund for Wales would cost £3.3million a year, but this could be higher depending on treatments. The Welsh government introduced free prescriptions for all in 2007. Until then the NHS in Wales had recouped about £32million a year from charges for prescribed drugs.

Last year an average of 24.8 prescriptions per person were given out, compared with 19.1 in England, 18.6 in Scotland and 21.1 in Northern Ireland. A Welsh government spokesman said: ‘We will not be replacing our system with a cancer drugs fund – the chair of the fund in England has admitted it provides funding for drugs which have “no impact on survival” and “uncertainty” on whether quality of life is improved.

‘We spend more per head on cancer care than in England and we do not agree with spending millions on non-approved medicines.

‘We are proud prescriptions in Wales are free for everyone, removing a barrier to long-term good health.’

Terminally-ill Cheryl Sheard said she had not even been told about the life-prolonging drug Avastin until she went to England to be treated for her cervical cancer.

The mother-of-two, of Dyserth in North Wales, said: ‘Avastin was never mentioned to me in Wales. But doctors in Liverpool offer it as standard.’

Mrs Sheard, 36, was told her cancer was terminal by doctors in Glan Clwyd Hospital. After she asked for a second opinion, specialists in Liverpool were willing to try surgery.

This was not a success, but it was then she was told about Avastin, which costs £24,000 a year but could prolong her life by months.

She said the difference in care was ‘staggering’. ‘Doctors in Liverpool tried so much more. Glan Clwyd just said there was no point,’ she said.

Her case for Avastin funding has been put to Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, but months on she is yet to be given the green light. She added: ‘I know this drug is not going to save my life. But if it prolongs my life by one week, I have to try. I’ve got two young children. I’ve got to fight for everything. I’m praying for a miracle.’

A Betsi Cadwaladr spokesman said: ‘We are satisfied patients are given access to these drugs where it can be demonstrated they are most likely to benefit.’

The NHS in Wales has been accused of ‘wasting’ hundreds of thousands of pounds on trade union officials rather than paying for treatments.

Freedom of information figures showed large sums being spent on the wages of staff engaged in union activity either full- or part-time.

Tory MPs slammed the Labour-run Welsh government for spending more than £1.5million in the past three years on what has been branded a ‘scandalous subsidy’ to the unions. ‘Facility time’ is paid time for trade union representatives to take part in union duties. It is provided for in the Employment Relations Act 1999 and the Trade Union Labour Relations Act 1992.

Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spent more than £500,000 in three years for staff to undertake union activities, while Cwm Taf University Health Board spent £100,000 a year on four union representatives.

Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford’s spokesman said: ‘The Tories in Westminster have lost the plot on the NHS. Now they’re attacking the rights of hard-working NHS staff to have proper representation.’
