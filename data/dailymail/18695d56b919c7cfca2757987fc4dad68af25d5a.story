Bobi was rescued from the brink of starvation in a Bulgarian gutter and nursed back to good health, only for vets in the UK to rule he was not fit enough to live and must be put down immediately.

But in a remarkable turn of events - following a ‘Save Bobi’ campaign that quickly gathered pace, attracting supporters across the world - the Daily Mail can now reveal that he will be saved.

The dog, who is partially paralysed will now be cared for and given daily medical treatment by Canine Rescue - the charity that saved him from Bulgaria - before it is decided if he will be rehomed. 

Born survivor: Bobi is finally able to enjoy his new life in Britain after a vet declared he should not be put down

Worldwide support: This appeal by K9 Rescue prompted a successful campaign to save the disabled dog

Yesterday the paper told how the 
disabled dog had been brought to Britain by the charity who discovered 
him severely crippled and close to death.

With the help of the public, they funded his medical treatment and several vets deemed him fit enough to be rehomed.

He
 then had a brief period with a foster carer who struggled to cope with 
the demands of having a disabled dog with incontinence and then was 
rehomed with Jayne Jones, a manager for Canine Rescue.

But the 
partially paralysed dog was taken from his new home by an RSPCA
 officer – just two hours after arriving there on Friday.

Miss Jones later received a phone call to say a vet had decided Bobi was too unwell and must be put down the following day.

This was despite a video taken days earlier showing the him happily playing and jumping around.

Canine
 Rescue workers described the RSPCA as ‘barbaric’, saying the charity’s 
answer to everything is to kill, rather than working with the animals to
 make them better.

A ‘Save Bobi’ campaign was promptly set up by 
separate charity, Action Aid for Animals, which gathered pace almost 
immediately on social media.

Battle for survival: Yesterday the Daily Mail highlighted the plight of the terrier  who was rescued from starvation in Bulgaria, but condemned by the RSPCA because he was not fit enough to lead a happy life

Saved: Bobi, who has paralysed legs and has to wear nappies, will now be allowed to live following an examination by Langford Veterinary Services in Bristol. However, he will require constant care and medication

Last night, more than 9,000 people had signed a petition on campaigning website, Change.org.

Last
 night a vet from the Langford Veterinary Practice in Bristol, 
revealed they believe  Bobi should be allowed to live, but acknowledged 
that he is severely disabled and will need constant care if his quality 
of life is to be ensured.

Canine Rescue last night thanked the 
thousands of supporters who helped save Bobi’s life and said they would 
do everything in their power to ensure Bobi's happiness continues.

Founder,
 Michelle Jones, wrote on the groups Facebook page: ‘Excellent news, 
Langford Vets have confirmed there is no need to euthanize Bobi 
immediately.

‘We cannot thank you all enough for your incredible 
support as we all know what Bobi's fate was just 2 days ago, without you
 all behind Bobi this amazing sweet little dog would have had no future 
at all. Thank you!’

The vet said it is up to Canine rescue if and 
when they want to have Bobi put to sleep, adding that because of a 
series of medical problems brought on by a physical trauma early in his 
life, his ‘longevity of life' will be 'shortened’.

This means Bobi may have to be put to sleep in the future if his condition further deteriorates.

Joint effort: The successful campaign to save Bobi attracted 9,000 supporters from across the world

Michelle
 Jones said: ‘I know that Bobi will lead a happy life for the time being
 at least because we will give him everything he needs to do so.

‘He will have a wheelchair to help him walk and take the pressure off his back legs, physiotherapy and acupuncture.

‘We just don’t know how long his life will last.’

She explained that as soon as Bobi appears to be suffering, the charity will reassess his situation.

‘Bobi will receive much love and care – all the things we intended to give him before he was cruelly taken away from us.

‘With specialist treatment, dogs with a poor prognosis like Bobi can get amazing results, so we are still hopeful.’

The
 RSPCA said: ‘Due to the severity of Bobi’s condition the independent 
vets spoke to the Police, who seized him on veterinary advice and 
legally signed him over to the RSPCA's care.

‘At the owner's request 
and with the support of the RSPCA, Bobi was taken to further independent
 specialist vets of the owner's choosing.

‘Sadly their report 
confirms the first vet’s opinion that Bobi's condition is so bad that he
 would never enjoy a good quality of life and the kindest option is to 
put him to sleep.

‘They said the large open sore on Bobi’s leg is
 down to the bone, could take months to heal and even then would be 
likely to recur. His double incontinence cannot be cured, his back legs 
are chronically deformed and would only deteriorate further.

‘Bobi
 has now been seen by a total of five independent vets, all of whom 
believe the kindest option is for him to be put to sleep.

‘However
 the expert veterinary advice, provided today by specialist vets from 
Langford Veterinary Services at Bristol University, does say that whilst
 they would not recommend them, there are potential intensive, long-term
 treatment options available as long as Bobi can be kept comfortable.’
