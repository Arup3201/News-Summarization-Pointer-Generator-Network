His legs might not be as fresh as they once were, but Esteban Cambiasso’s brain and left foot are as sharp as ever. They might just keep Leicester City in the Barclays Premier League.

That is Nigel Pearson’s hope — and a realistic one — after watching the midfielder with the huge trophy cabinet transform his club’s weekend.

Leicester were crushed for 45 minutes, spared only by the inability of Stoke’s attackers to put their chances on target.

Then Cambiasso, whose 23 European and domestic titles match Lionel Messi’s haul, entered at half-time. 

This was Leicester’s first clean sheet in 12 Premier League games.

Within one minute the Argentine was directing his team-mates. Within five, he had pinged a 40-yard through-ball for £8million striker Leonardo Ulloa, who later scored his third in four games.

Cambiasso was deemed surplus to requirements by Inter Milan in the summer, but in a side with a glaring lack of top-level know-how, Cambiasso looks to be a perfect fit.

Pearson said: ‘He is well respected by the players and staff. He has authority. He also has a humility that is very refreshing and I am very confident he will have a positive effect on the players.’

The result meant Stoke have lost both their home games this season, with Mark Hughes frustrated his side are not yet getting the best out of Bojan, their summer signing from Barcelona.

He said: ‘Bojan did OK. We need to get him between the lines more than we were able to. But it is about introducing him into the right games.

‘We need to give the ball a bit quicker and on more occasions. If we do that he will have key moments and create chances.’

Leonardo Ulloa scored the only goal of the game with a lovely finish to earn all three points

Mark Hughes admitted that he is not yet getting the best out of former Barcelona striker Bojan Krkic
