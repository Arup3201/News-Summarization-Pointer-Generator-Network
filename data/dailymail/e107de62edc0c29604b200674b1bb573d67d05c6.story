Arrested: Victoria Beltram, 34, was arrested for 'making death threats to husband's mistress'

A transsexual actress who starred in Sacha Baron Cohen’s film The Dictator was questioned by police after she was accused of making death threats to a New York psychologist.

Victoria Beltran phoned her husband's colleague Katarzyna Sakowicz after deciding the pair were having an affair.

She allegedly threatened Ms Sakowicz saying  'I will kill you and get you fired,' according to court papers.

The Dictator features  Cohen, in the role of Admiral General Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya visiting the United States.

In the 2012 film Beltran plays one of his glamorous foot soldiers wearing a short green uniform, red beret and holding a machine gun.

The 34-year-old was charged Wednesday with aggravated harassment in Bronx court, revealed the New York Post. 

The drama began in January when  Beltran discovered $500 charge for spa treatments at the  
Trump SoHo spa on the couple’s credit card statement.

She rang the hotel and found out her husband Brett Bergmann had attended 
the appointments with Ms Sakowicz.

The pair both work on Rikers Island, New York City's main jail complex.

According to LinkedIn Mr Bergmann
is a Senior Mental Health Clinician in the Correctional Punitive 
Segregation Unit, and has worked there for over four years.

Meanwhile Ms Sakowicz states that she works as a Clinical
Supervisor at Rikers Island Correctional Facility and has worked there 
for eight months.

Allegations: Victoria Beltran, 34, starred in Sacha Baron Cohen's 2012 film The Dictator

After discovering the appointment Ms Beltran is accused by Ms Sakowicz of threatening her as well as sending hostile text messages, according to the New York Post.

Ms Sakowicz vehemently denies having an affair with Mr Bergmann.

She claims that she only became close to  Mr Bergmann after Ms Beltran told her husband about her sex change - it is understood she underwent the transformation when she was 15.

'She was worried that, being in The Dictator,' it was going to get out 
that she had a sex change as a teenager,' Ms Sakowicz told The New York Post.

'She 
sat him down, I’m not sure when, but that’s when he said he was done 
with the relationship.'

Ms Beltran
denies she only recently told her husband about operation and insists 
he was aware it from the beginning of their relationship.
