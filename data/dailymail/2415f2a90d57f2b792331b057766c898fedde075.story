A woman is set to marry the man who saved her life on their first date.

Cheryl Wray, 22, had a tumour the size of a satsuma removed from her pancreas after fiancé Stephen Kittles insisted she see a doctor.

He was concerned after noticing she was suffering from severe pain in her side.

Cheryl Wray, 22, was diagnosed with a tumour on her pancreas after Stephen Kittles insisted that she went to see a doctor about a pain in her side

Miss Wray, of White Notley, Essex, said: 
‘I thought the pain was due to muscle strain. I was working at a 
supermarket and was doing a fair amount of heavy lifting at the time.

‘Me and Stephen were in a car together when I put the seat back and involuntarily yelped out in pain.

‘He became very concerned and asked what was wrong. I told him it was probably nothing but he said, “no, you have to go to see a doctor”.

‘I didn't want to be thought of as a hypochondriac so was ready to brush it aside, but Stephen being so insistent made me change my mind and I booked an appointment.’

Miss Wray visited her GP in January 2009 and was sent for an urgent ultrasound scan.

She said: ‘At first we thought it was kidney stones. Stephen came with me to the scan for support.

‘The doctor phoned me with the results before I went to work. I knew straight away that something serious was going on - the doctor doesn't usually call you directly.’

Ms Wray was not intending to see a doctor about the pain as she thought it was caused by a strained muscle she had suffered while working in a supermarket

Ms Wray (pictured with her father, Patrick, in hospital) had to have surgery to remove the precancerous tumour

The ultrasound revealed an alarming growth suggesting a cancerous or pre-cancerous tumour on her pancreas.

It is rare for teenagers to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which is often fatal.

A month after the growth was revealed, Miss Wray and Mr Kittles, 27, became engaged during a visit to Clacton-on-Sea.

She said: ‘I asked him to marry me on the beach by writing the words in the sand. He wrote “yes” and then took me to the end of the pier, where he got down on one knee and asked me back.

‘When we met, it took just two hours for me to realise I wanted to be with him. We both love Bon Jovi - especially the songs “Always” and “Thank You for Loving Me”, which has become our song.’

Ms Wray no longer has any signs of the tumour in her body but she still has to go for check ups every year

After several nervous months of further tests, Ms Wray underwent surgery just days after her 18th birthday in July 2009.

She said: ‘I signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock. It was difficult to understand what was happening to me. They removed the growth, but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too.’

Miraculously, the growth was judged to be precancerous and there were no signs of the cancer spreading to any other part of her body.

The realisation of how precarious her position had been only dawned on her as she lay in hospital for a month recovering from the operation.

Ms Wray said: 'I signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock. It was difficult to understand what was happening to me. They removed the growth, but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too'

She said: ‘It suddenly dawned on me how serious things were. The tumour had grown really quickly and had I left it any longer the surgeons probably wouldn't have been able to do anything about it.

‘I was shocked and broke down in tears, but Stephen did a really good job looking after me.’

Mr Kittles, who works at a bowling alley
 in Braintree, said: ‘Looking back I'm so glad I was so insistent that 
Cheryl went to the doctor. Even though we'd only just met, I was very 
worried about her.

Pancreatic cancer is notoriously hard to diagnose as it rarely causes symptoms in the early stages.

Symptoms do not tend to develop until the cancer is advanced.

The first symptoms can include pain in the upper abdomen, unexpected weight loss and loss of appetite, jaundice, diabetes, nausea and vomiting.

‘It was very difficult to see Cheryl suffering through the diagnosis and the surgery, but I stayed supportive, and I always will be supportive.’

Ms Wray, who now requires annual cancer scans, said she is looking forward to enjoying a happy, healthy life with her fiancé.

She said: ‘We're trying to have children and I'm on medication to help us along with that. We'll get married as soon as we can, but we don't know when that will be yet.’

Miss Wray now offers support to sufferers of pancreatic cancer on Facebook, giving encouragement and advice through her group entitled "Pancreatic Cancer-help".

She said: ‘Some people feel as though they can't talk to their families and I know how hard that can be.

‘I'm here to talk to people if they want.’
