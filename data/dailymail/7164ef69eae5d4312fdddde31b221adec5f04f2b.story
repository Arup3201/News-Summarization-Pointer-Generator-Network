Tottenham Hotspur vs Crystal Palace (White Hart Lane) 

Team news

Tottenham

Tottenham defender Danny Rose could make a return as Mauricio Pochettino's side host Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

Rose has recovered from a rib injury and could replace Ben Davies at left-back, but Vlad Chiriches and Kyle Naughton are both doubtful with knocks.

Emmanuel Adebayor is still recovering from a virus and is not considered ready while Kyle Walker is expected to play for the club's Under 21 team after returning from an abdominal injury.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Dier, Chiriches, Naughton, Vertonghen, Fazio, Kaboul, Rose, Davies, Bentaleb, Mason, Capoue, Dembele, Paulinho, Lennon, Lamela, Chadli, Eriksen, Soldado, Kane.

Crystal Palace

Crystal Palace are likely to be without midfielder Joe Ledley for their trip to Tottenham on Saturday.

The Wales international is suffering from a recurrence of a hip problem that ruled him out of Tuesday night's defeat to Aston Villa.
