Historically subjected to witty taunts from 'ginger nut' to 'carrot top', redheads are now being celebrated in a new exhibition exploring the notion of a 'ginger utopia'.

Artist Anthea Pokroy snapped hundreds of men, women and children for her project I Collect Gingers, which features the full-range of redheads from strawberry blonde to flaming auburn.

Herself a proud redhead, South African Ms Pokroy said she was inspired by the 'romantic colour-palette' of a ginger person.

'Ginger utopia': Anthea Pokroy snapped hundreds of red-headed men, women and children for her project

'I Collect Gingers': A selection of the redheads photographed for the exhibition, which celebrates the full range of red from strawberry blonde to flaming auburn

The 26-year-old spent three years working on the project, which she said aimed to explore prejudice, racial classification, and the prospect of a 'ginger utopia'.

'As a ginger myself, what initially interested me was the beautiful, romantic colour-palette of a ginger person and all that it connotes,' Ms Pokroy said.

'But it was only after my first photography session with seven gingers that I began exploring the innate sense of community and collective experience that emerged from the otherness of the gingers.'

Flame-haired: Ms Pokroy shot close-up photographs of her flame-haired subjects in a studio in South Africa

The South African artist, who began her collection in August 2010, photographed her subjects dressed all in white under stark studio lighting.

She also shot close-ups of hair, skin and eyes and took a strand of hair from each of them.

As her work progressed she began to arrange the 'gingers' into a more sophisticated classification system, with colour divisions including copper, burnt orange, light orange and auburn.

She said it led her to imagine what a perfect world would be for gingers - who make up between one and two per cent of the global population - and the possible implications of this.

Body of work: Ms Pokroy's exhibition I Collect Gingers features redheads of all ages and all shades

The fine-arts graduate, from Johannesburg, South Africa, said she had hoped the project would address issues of discrimination and elitism in her country and the rest of the world.

'This body of work hopes to clearly highlight this using the gingers as a symbol of both the oppressed and the oppressor,' she said.

The exhibition debuted at the CIRCA on Jellicoe Gallery, in Johannesburg, South Africa, earlier this year.
