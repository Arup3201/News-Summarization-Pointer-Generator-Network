Ex-MPs are demanding public money for them to tour the country at taxpayers’ expense despite being given the boot by voters years ago, MailOnline can reveal.

Commons Speaker John Bercow has been approached about creating a fund worth thousands of pounds for failed and retired politicians.

And the Association of Former Members of Parliament (AFMP) also wants a return to the famous green benches to hold a debate in the Commons chamber once a year.

The former MPs want to hold a debate in the Commons chamber once a year to relive old glories

The call comes from the same group which last year announced it wanted to award ex-MPs with a gold-plated gong, which has now gone on sale for £199.

Representatives of the group of around 500 former MPs have approached the House of Commons Commission, which Mr Bercow chairs, about securing public funds to pay for their work.

They have been told to submit an application in the next bidding round this autumn.

They want to base the group on the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress, which receives a large chunk of its funding from a body founded with $7million of public money.

But the extraordinary demand for former politicians to have state backing after leaving office has been condemned at a time when the government is imposing deep spending cuts on public services.

Eric Moonman, Labour MP for nine years in the 1960s and 70s, said the money was needed to allow ex-politicians to travel the country and give talks at colleges and universities.

But he admitted it could be ‘seen to be trivial given all the pressures that people have’ at a time of austerity.

Ex-MPs can now buy a gold-plated medal for £199 from the AFMP, which comes 'in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft Italian green leather with a cushion/silk inlay'

The AFMP has 500 members, including Tony Blair, Sir John Major and Boris Johnson.

It was set up to help MPs ejected from the Commons at elections to cope with 'becoming suddenly unemployed' and the 'real blow' of losing touch with friends in Westminster.

It runs an 'outreach programme' where former ministers and backbenchers give talks to students and voluntary groups.

But Mr Moonman says public money is needed to pay for it.

‘I don’t think we are talking about 
big money. One step would be to have specific levels to cover the 
outreach programme to go into areas and pick up expenses,’ Mr Moonman 
told MailOnline.

‘The second step having fully 
justified out worth and value would be to have a conference or seminar, 
something along the lines the Americans do. That could be low key and 
low budget.

‘My target and ambition is what they have done in the US Congress and Canada.’

Former Labour MP Eric Moonman said time should be found for ex-politicians to debate in the Commons, but Tory MP Philip Davies (right) said the famous green benches should not be used by 'all and sundry'

He suggested that ‘towards the end of a session’ in parliament when the government is ‘looking for items to debate’ an hour-long session should be set aside for former MPs to hold a debate in the Commons chamber on ‘the issues that they see’.

‘It could be an enormous lift to the whole idea that when a member is no longer in the House he can still play an important role.’

Ex-MPs won a battle with Commons authorities over the design of a gold-plated medal they wanted to award themselves.

Licenced by the Queen, the crowned portcullis emblem was blocked from being used on the ex-MPs’ gong.

A House of Commons spokesman said the crowned portcullis was a royal badge and its use was had to be formally authorised and licensed by the Queen.

He added: ‘It must not be used where there is a risk that its use may be wrongly represented as having the authority of the House.'

But the latest edition of the association’s quarterly magazine reveals they ex-MPs won the battle.

The ‘gold plated lapel badge’ is on sale for £199.

The advert states: ‘A stylish Gold Plated hand polished badge/brooch depicting the wording Former Member of Parliament, Crown and Portcullis.

‘Personalised with your initials and individually numbered on reverse, it is a ﬁtting way to display your involvement in British Politics. 

‘Your badge/brooch will be placed in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft Italian green leather with a cushion/silk inlay, a brass plaque engraved with your name plus years of service will be attached to the box.’

But the ideas were rejected as an attempt to use public money for a 'reunion tour' for failed politicians.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I will be a former MP at some point. If people then want me to speak at a university I can either say yes or no.

‘I would like to think I would say yes but I don’t think the public should pay for that.’

He said he feared after the Youth Parliament was allowed to hold debates in the Commons chamber that other groups would also demand access.

‘It would appear that my fears are being realised. I think the chamber should be for MPs.

'Those people had an opportunity to have their say.

'They have now moved on and I think debates in the chamber should be for MPs and not all and sundry.’

Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘Only a small number of MPs could think that taxpayers should pay for them to play ex-politicians, even after they have been booted out of office.

‘We already have the House of Lords without devoting time and money to bring back formers members of the House of Commons for one last hurrah.

‘It’s MPs jobs to reach out to communities when they’re in office, just because some miss it after they’re done does not mean taxpayers should foot the bill for a reunion tour.’

The AFMP wants to copy the USA  Association of Former members of Congress which maintains a
major sponsor through John C Stennis Centre for Public Service, which 
was founded in 1988 by Congress with $7.5 million held in a trust fund 
in U.S. Treasury securities.

Mr Moonman admitted it would be ‘hard’ for an 
ex-MP to publicly call for public money.

He suggested it would ‘take a 
strong, existing member who is not necessarily troubled by the ballot 
box to say this is what ought to happen’.

‘The important thing is to recognise 
that individuals have got experience, have got some views, has been 
disciplined and what a terrible waste,’ he added.

Mr Moonman, who was Labour MP for 
Billericay from 1966-1970 and Basildon from 1974-1979, said ex-MPs were 
‘like footballers’ who retire without earning a lot of money.
