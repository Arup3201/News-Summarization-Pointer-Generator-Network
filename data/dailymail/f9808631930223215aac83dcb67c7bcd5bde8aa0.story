Crystal Palace supporters unveiled a banner with a message aimed at Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich just before their Premier League game at Selhurst Park.

Supporters of the home side brandished the banner ahead of the London derby which referred to the amount of money Chelsea's rich Russian owner has spent on the club.

The banner read: 'Roman's dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game'.

Abramovich has poured hundreds of millions into Chelsea since buying the club in 2003

Crystal Palace hosted Chelsea in a Premier League contest at Selhurst Park on Saturday

Abramovich brought Chelsea in 2003 and poured hundreds of millions into the club to turn them into one of the leading teams in the country.

Chelsea have won the Premier League three times since Abramovich's arrival - in 2005, 2006 and 2010, having previously only won England's top-flight title in 1955.

The Blues have also won four FA Cups, two League Cups, the Champions League and Europa League over the last decade.

Oscar's sixth-minute free-kick and a second-half goal from Cesc Fabregas saw Chelsea extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table back to five points over Manchester City.
