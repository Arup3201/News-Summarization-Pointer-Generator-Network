A two-month-old baby boy  died in hospital two days after allegedly being beaten and strangled by his parents at their Montana home on Christmas Day.

The unnamed infant was reportedly assaulted by his mother, Kayla Edwards, 23, and 29-year-old father, Brandon Edwards, at their house in Billings on Thursday evening.

He was rushed to St Vincent Healthcare with a critical brain injury, before being transferred to Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora. But despite medics' best efforts, he died on Saturday.

On Thursday, the baby's parents were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault. It is unclear what charges they may face now their son has succumbed to his injuries.

'We’re just waiting for the county attorney’s office to see what the actual charges will be, since the baby died,' Billings Police Department Lieutenant Jeremy House told the Billings Gazette.

Paramedics were first alerted to the child's fate at around 8pm on Thursday after Kayla Edwards called 911 and reported that her son had stopped breathing, KRTV reported.

They raced to the house on the 200 block of Terry Avenue, where they discovered the baby in a critical condition. They alerted police after spotting a number of 'suspicious' injuries on his body.

'Medical personnel observed suspicious injuries on the infant and notified the Billings Police Department,' Lt House wrote in a press release on Friday.

During a subsequent police investigation, Kayla Edwards was found to have 'struck her son in the head so hard that she caused a brain injury', an affidavit of probable cause stated.

'The defendant then strangled her son to prevent him from breathing,' it added.

In an interview with police, Brandon Edwards allegedly admitted to watching and allowing his wife to assault their newborn son, as well as confessing to choking the child on another occasion.

The baby, who died at 3.48am on Saturday, is believed to have a twin sister. His parents remain in custody at Yellowstone County Jail. They are expected to appear in court on Monday.

Police are investigating.
