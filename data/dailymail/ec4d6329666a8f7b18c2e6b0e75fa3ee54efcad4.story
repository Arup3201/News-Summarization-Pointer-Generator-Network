Self-published success: Amazon, who sell the Kindle, have emerged as the leading seller of self-published books

A quarter of the top 100 Kindle books sold by Amazon.com are written by self-published 'go it alone' authors, it has been revealed.

Although the figures are for the online retailer's U.S. website, experts said the same is likely to be repeated in Britain over time.

The statistics, released at a trade show, have been dubbed a victory for start-up authors who have traditionally struggled to get their work published.

The chart was posted on Twitter by Writer.ly, an online marketplace which links writers with the editors, book designers and marketing help they need to publish.

Amazon.com's
 figures revealed a quarter of the leading titles are by 'indies' - a 
broad term which includes all titles that aren't put out by the big six 
publishers.

Although
 the online giant has not released figures for the UK, it is thought 
that there has been a significant growth in the success of 'indie' 
authors.

Orna Ross, director of the UK
 Alliance of Independent Authors, said the success of self-publishers in
 the U.S. is likely to be repeated in Britain.

'We
 are in the middle of a major change. I wouldn't be at all surprised if 
we reached a situation where the majority of the top books are 
author-published. I don't see what would stop that,' she told The Guardian.

Hugh
 Howey, a Florida-based author, who became an overnight success after 
publishing his novel Wool, wrote that individual authors were 
collectively as powerful as leading names.

He Tweeted: 'Taken together, indie authors form a new major publisher to round out the "Big 6." That's the level of sales we represent.'

A spokesman for Amazon said that the figures released to a trade fair were for the the U.S. only.

'This figure is referring to Kindle 
books on Amazon.com in 2012, with 'indie' meaning books self-published 
via Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP).

'So a quarter of the top 100 bestselling Kindle books on Amazon.com in 2012 were self-published via KDP.'

Amazon has emerged as the leading retailer of self-published works following the rapid growth of the Kindle in recent years.

The retailer gives 'indie' titles equal billing alongside the work of leading publishing houses.

Richard Mollet, chief executive of the UK Publishers Association, told The Guardian: 'It is notable that very often those authors who find initial success from self-publishing subsequently work with publishers to take their writing career to the next level.'
