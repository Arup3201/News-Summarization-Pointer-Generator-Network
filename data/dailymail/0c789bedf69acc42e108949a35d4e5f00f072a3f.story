A rescue fund for Britain’s high streets championed by retail guru Mary Portas has gone almost completely unspent, it emerged today.

Councils have spent just seven per cent of more than £7million assigned to turn around struggling town centres.

Town halls were today accused of ‘fiddling while Rome burns’ at a time when one in seven shops is standing empty.

Retail guru Mary Portas was tasked by the government to help revive town centres but little of the funding given to the councils has been spent

The High Street Innovation Fund was set up in response to Portas’ review of what could be done to boost struggling shopping areas.

In all 100 councils were given a share of £10million. But a survey of 72 councils reveals 47 have not spent any money at all. Of the £7.2million shared between them, they have spent just £519,363.

Ms Portas once said the money should not be ‘spent by the usual suspects sitting round a table planning Christmas decorations’.

But it emerged today that the public money has been spent hiring reindeers and a Father Christmas.

Kingston upon Hull spent £5,563 on a nativity street theatre, while the Vale of White Horse splashed out £1,000 on reindeer and £485 on a children’s farm for a Christmas Extravaganza, The Independent reported.

Sensibe spending? One council spent £1,000 of its funding to bring in reindeer while another hired someone wearing a Eppa Pig costume

Retailer Paul Turner-Mitchell, who uncovered the data through Freedom of Information requests, said: ‘It’s hard to see how council spending from this fund is encouraging innovation. Councils are continuing to throw taxpayers’ money at the same stale ideas they’ve been peddling for years.

‘They really are just fiddling while Rome burns and the fact that it’s being done under the banner of “innovation” adds insult to injury.’

Wyre Forest District Council spent £12,000 on bringing 10 empty shops back into use.

But a different council spent £10,900 on Christmas lights, while another authority spent £10,038 on a train station ramp.

Meanwhile, Swale Borough Council in Kent spent £164.60 on a snow machine.

One in seven shops is empty, according to the Local Data Company, up from fewer than one in 30 in 2008

Mr Turner-Mitchell told the BBC: ‘It's hardly what Mary Portas would call game-changing stuff. It's very worrying seeing an innovation fund being used for tired, unoriginal ideas.’

The latest revelations come after criticism levelled at 12 so-called Portas Pilots, set up as trailblazers for the Portas reforms.

Traders in the seaside resort of Margate in Kent, which won a £100,000 government grant, claimed the town's high street is now in a worse state than when she arrived to help, as the Government-appointed 'retail tzar', six months ago. 

And last month it emerged Dartford Council spent £1,160 hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, £317.46 on items from Waitrose, £5,983 on newspaper surveys and £1,317 on surveys.

The council said the Peppa Pig outfit was a proven way to attract crowds.

High hopes: Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Mary Portas as his high street tsar in May 2011

The Department for Communities and Local Government insisted the government was working to turn around town centres.

A spokesman said: 'We are absolutely committed to reviving the nation's high streets which 
is why we gave the 100 councils with the highest numbers of empty 
properties a share of £10million to attract new businesses into their 
areas.

'We've also extended small business rate relief to help small shops and 
small firms and have simplified planning restrictions to allow new 
businesses to set up on high streets.

'We would rather councils spend this money strategically and wisely, to 
ensure long term success for our High Streets, than rush to spend it and
waste taxpayers' money in the process.'
