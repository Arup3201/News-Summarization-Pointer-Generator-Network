Jailed: Cagefighter Vincent Graham, 33, who ran a cocaine-dealing gang, has been ordered to repay £700,000

A cagefighter who quit the ring to lead a cocaine-dealing gang after losing his leg in a road accident has been ordered to pay back £700,000 - or face more time behind bars.

Father-of-ten Vincent Graham, 33, lived a lavish lifestyle and drove a fleet of sports cars as the leader of an organisation which smuggled drugs into Britain from South Africa.

The playboy, nicknamed 'Big Vin', posed semi-naked on online dating sites and had been seeing a series of women who had been dazzled by his lavish lifestyle.

But his drug dealing was exposed after he was arrested and questioned over an alleged kidnap plot in the Netherlands.

Dutch police released him without charge but they tipped off their British counterparts and told them to raid a series of properties connected to Graham amid suspicions they were being used to deal Class A drugs.

Officers discovered 25 kilograms of benzocaine - a chemical used to dilute cocaine - in a house in Liverpool which would have produced enough cocaine to sell for more than £1m.

Graham was renting a £1,500 a month five-bedroom luxury £500,000 home in Brockhall Village, Lancashire, in an exclusive development opposite Blackburn Rovers' training ground.

He had a fleet of nine cars including a Lamborghini Gallardo, worth more than £40,000, a Nissan Skyline, worth £35,000, and an Audi Q7 worth more than £20,000.

Police recovered £5,000 cash when they raided a series of premises owned or rented by Graham.

Motorbikes, jet skis, quad bikes, off-road motorbikes, electrical goods, jewellery and artwork together worth over £150,000 were found in his garage.

Examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling over £35,000. They also seized a £50,000 Jacobs watch and a £32,000 diamond necklace.

During a police surveillance operation officers watched as Graham would check his Nissan GT-R's wheel arches with surgical gloves.

In July 2011, Graham, described by police as a 'significant player' in the supply of drugs in the North West of England, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was jailed for seven years.

This week he was brought back to Preston Crown Court under a Proceeds of Crime hearing and was warned he faced a further four and a half years jail if he doesn't pay back £700,000.

Today Detective Chief Inspector Paula Parker, from Titan, an elite police squad which tackles organised crime said: 'Vincent Graham was living the kind of lifestyle most of us can only dream about.

'He paid for almost everything with cash and lived in a gated community normally associated with Premiership footballers and business executives.

'However, his income was not legitimate in any sense of the word but in fact came from dealing in Class A drugs.

'He did not care about the damage these drugs would do to the people taking them, or the wider community. He only cared about lining his pockets with drug money and living a film star lifestyle based on other people's misery.

'It is incredibly satisfying to know that not only does he still have a sizeable part of his prison sentence still left to serve but also, when he comes out, all his assets will have been taken and used to take more criminals off the streets.'

Undercover officers tracked Graham for about six months after the tip off from their Dutch colleagues.

It emerged he was a cage fighter had been linked to a number of organised crime groups in the UK.

The court heard former garage boss Graham, who lost his right leg in a motorbike accident in his 20s, never touched the drugs during transactions.

But he was arrested after police filmed two accomplices engaging in a drug deal in Southport with a third man from Nigerian.

Nick Courtney, prosecuting, said: 'Inquiries into Graham's financial affairs by the police revealed a lavish lifestyle wholly inconsistent with his declared income.'

'An examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling more than £35,000 and no evidence of the payment of household bills from his bank accounts.

'Although he is connected with two businesses, no accounts have been filed in relation to those businesses with Companies House and inquiries with HM Revenue and Customs show that he has made declarations of only limited earnings, which would not support his lifestyle.'

Paul Archer, 36, and Christopher Malpass, 26, both from Southport, were jailed respectively for three years and four years five months at earlier hearings. Sylvester Nkemakolam 46, from Hackney, got seven years and two months.
