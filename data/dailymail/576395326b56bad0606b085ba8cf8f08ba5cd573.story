Previously unnoticed audio from a video recorded in the chaotic moments after Michael Brown's fatal shooting last Saturday in Ferguson, Missouri, could help back up Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson's version of events.

Overheard while one man films the gruesome aftermath of Brown's daylight shooting, the barely discernible audio is of one unseen man recounting the alleged version of events that he saw to another man, off camera, while bystanders scream and shout at police to assist the stricken 18-year-old.

At around the six minute and 30 second mark in the 10 minute long video, one man is just heard over raucous shouting asking another how Brown ended up at least 30-feet away from the police squad car that presumably was being driven by Wilson.

WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND UPSETTING VIDEO

The body of Michael Brown lies on the ground in the aftermath of his shooting death

The first man explains to the second man that Brown was there because he had previously been near the police car and run, which contradicts what the teens friend, Dorian Johnson, has told police and in interviews.

Johnson has said that Brown was never inside or near Officer Wilson's police car before the shooting.

Johnson alleges that Wilson exited his car and struck 6ft 4inch Brown as he was trying to open the door, setting off the calamitous series of events that ended with Brown running from a shooting Wilson, before turning with his hands raised in surrender before being gunned down.

The audio heard in the video gives a different version of events.

The alleged witness tells the man that Brown apparently had a confrontation with Wilson near to or in his vehicle and ran away.

'Then the next thing I know he doubled back towards him cus (sic) the police had his gun drawn already on him,' according to blog, Conservative Tree House.

The witness then contradicts the now crucial narrative of the how the tragic events unfolded last Saturday.

Ferguson police officer: Darren Wilson, 28, pictured receiving a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February has been named as the police officer who shot dead Michael Brown, 18

Instead of Brown being fired on while his hands were raised in surrender, the witness claims that Brown was moving towards the officer when he was shot.

While this version of events does not match most of the eyewitness accounts, it does seem to tally up in a small part with the account of what occurred given by a friend of Wilson.

Begins at 6:28/6:29 of video

Man 1: 'How’d he get from there to there?'

Eyewitness: 'Because he ran, the police was still in the truck – cause he was like over the truck'

Eyewitness: 'But him and the police was both in the truck, then he ran – the police got out and ran after him'

Eyewitness: 'Then the next thing I know he doubled back toward him cus - the police had his gun drawn already on him'

Man 1: 'Oh, the police got his gun'

Eyewitness: 'The police kept dumpin on him, and I’m thinking the police kept missing – he like – be like – but he kept coming toward him(crosstalk)'

Eyewitness: 'Police fired shots – the next thing I know – the police was missing'

Man 1: 'The Police?'

Eyewitness: 'The Police shot him'

Man 1: 'Police?'

Eyewitness: 'The next thing I know … I’m thinking … the dude started running …  then something about he took it from him'

'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' said the friend in an interview with Josie on The Dana Show.

'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them.

'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up.

'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip.

'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off.

'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. So, he stands up and yells, 'Freeze!# Michael and his friend turn around.

'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bumrushing him. He just started coming at him full speed.

'And, so he just started shooting. And, he just kept coming. And, so he really thinks he was on something.'

This new development follows photographs from last Saturday that were taken in the minutes after Brown's death.

Wilson is now on paid administrative leave following the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.

The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' on February of this year.

'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.'

He said Wilson encountered Brown and another man on the street during a routine patrol.

A confrontation ensued and Wilson fatally shot Brown, who was unarmed.
