The world of a Jane Austen novel was a dangerous place for a single, young woman.

Not only must they fight it out for the best husband, but they are forever falling victim to a fever - usually as the result of something as simple as wet stockings or being caught in the rain.

But now medical historians have claimed that Jane Austen's hypochondriac characters did, in fact, have plenty to fear.

With deadly airborne diseases such as 
tuberculosis much more widespread in the 19th century, being wet could 
actually have made them much vulnerable to illness.

Science broadcaster Vivienne Parry, who is presenting a talk on Pride, Prejudice and the Doctor at the Cheltenham Science Festival today, said: ‘We may laugh at Jane Austen and her heroines susceptibility to dampness.

‘But the reality is we still cling this idea that going out without shoes or going to bed with wet hair means we could catch our death of cold.

‘At the time no-one treated the cause, but the symptoms.

‘And death rates from infectious diseases such as TB were very high, while four of Jane’s sister-in-laws died in childbirth.

‘So women had every reason to be cautious.’

Professor John Oxford, Britain’s leading flu expert, said that in Austen’s time, it was possible that a good soaking could leave a person more vulnerable to the biological infections rife during the period.

He said: ‘I don’t think it’s possible to catch a virus from getting wet and cold.

‘What really happens in winter time is that we all stay indoors and huddle closer together making it easier for infections to spread. It has nothing to do with wet hair or unslippered feet.

‘But in Jane Austen’s time there were a 
lot of horrible bacteria around like TB, and if your whole body got wet 
you could become more vulnerable to these illnesses, so there may be 
some basis in it.’

Worried: Other characters in Austen's novels were famous hypochondriacs, including Mrs Bennet asking for 'compassion for my poor nerves'

Modern medicine has dismissed the idea that a slight drenching could result in a life-threatening condition.

But in fact, bizarre as it may sound, the malaises afflicting Austen’s leading ladies may not be as outlandish as they first seem.

With medical knowledge slowly advancing in the late 18th century, events that ‘excited’ the system were being linked with the onset of illness by the educated classes began.

Walking through the wet grass at twilight leads Marianne Dashwood to rapidly fall into a ‘putrid fever’ in Sense and Sensibility, while Pride and Prejudice’s Jane Bennet falls swiftly ill after being caught in the rain on horseback.

Danger: Jane Austen's characters frequently fell ill after being exposed to the elements in 19th century Britain

Other characters in her novels were famous hypochondriacs, with Mrs Bennet asking for ‘compassion for my poor nerves’, while in Emma her father Mr Woodhouse refused to eat cake on the orders of his apothecary.

Professor Michael Worboys from Manchester University said the concept of nerves was also introduced in the 18th century, with ‘nervousness becoming a disease of the English, particularly the English aristocracy’.

‘They talked about nerves in terms of fibres. They had this dual function of communicating and motor function,’ he said.

‘One of key ideas was fibres that somehow vibrated and people were highly strung. People talked about the tone of their nerves.’

As a result, in Georgian England, greater medical understanding resulted in hypochondria becoming fashionable, as the middle-class affected illness to emulate the cautions of the aristocracy.
