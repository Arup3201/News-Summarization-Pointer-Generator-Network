As Steven Defour found out the hard way, it seems a bad idea to leave Standard Liege and later join their bitter rivals Anderlecht.

On Sunday, former Liege captain Defour was treated to an incredible display ahead of their derby match, showing his decapitated head alongside the words, 'Red or Dead.'

After five years at the club, Defour left Standard Liege for Porto in 2011, spending two years in Portugal before heading back to Belgium.

To the dismay of Liege fans, his move back home was not to them, but to their fierce competitors Anderlecht. For a hero of their club to join the enemy is a betrayal of the highest order when it comes to football fans, and Liege were not going to let it slip.

The sole aim of the display will have been to rile Defour, and their mission was accomplished on two fronts. Liege won the game 2-0, and their former captain did not last the 90 minutes.

With 53 minutes on the clock, Defour reacted to an offside call he didn't agree with, smashing the ball with pace into the Liege supporters. The referee had had enough, and a second yellow was brandished.

Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, himself a former Anderlecht player, described the game as 'Belgium's El Clasico' on Twitter. But for Defour, it is one he'll hope can be quickly erased from the memory.
