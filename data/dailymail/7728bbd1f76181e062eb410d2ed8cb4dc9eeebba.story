To celebrate the launch of the Paddington film, a real-life Mr Brown from the Paddington area in London is offering his apartment free of charge to Peruvians for a break.

Paddington Bear is from deepest darkest Peru, and as such, Roifield Brown is making a one-time only offer for the weekend of December 5-7 for anyone staying in London from the South American country.

He will meet and greet the visitors and gift them with a Paddington-style suitcase full of goodies, but will not be a live-in host.

A real-life Mr Brown is using Airbnb to offer his whole apartment up for free to Peruvians the weekend after the Paddington film premiere

A childhood fan of the Paddington stories, Mr Brown jumped at the chance to recreate part of the story first-hand - especially when he learned that he lives a stone's throw from the fictional Windsor Gardens.

'I love Paddington Bear and, with the surname Brown, always felt I had a special connection with the story,' said the London resident. 

'Just like the Mr Brown from the books, my home is just off Portobello and I have listed it with Airbnb for over a year now. 

'I get visitors staying from all over the world and I thought it would be fun to see if any Peruvians, like Paddington, would like to stay for free - hopefully they are as excited about the film as I am.'

The home of Mr Brown will be available in its entirety to Peruvian travellers

The listing is on the Airbnb website, and Mr Brown's home is available all year round

Airbnb is the world's largest community-driven hospitality company, which connects thousands of guests and hosts online every day. 

With Mr Brown's listing available for anyone to book all-year around, the one bedroom apartment is available for anyone to book from roughly £150 per night. 

Peruvian visitors keen to take Mr Brown up on his offer can contact him directly through airbnb.com to request the complimentary stay (December 5-7).

Guests will also be treated to a special Paddington goody bag when they arrive at Mr Brown's house

Mr Brown is a big fan of Paddington Bear, and felt with his name, it was important to offer a unique stay

Holly Clarke Acting Country Manager, Airbnb UK & Ireland, said: 'We want people to feel that wherever they go, anywhere in the world, they belong. 

'Paddington Bear came to London from Peru looking for a place to belong, and Mr Brown provided just that. This captures the very spirit of us as a brand and it's great to see hosts like Roifield really champion this. 

'Our community is everything to the Airbnb experience; these magical moments are what makes it so special'.

Paddington comes to UK screens on November 28.
