Manchester United target Moreto Cassama caught the eye with an impressive 25-yard strike as Portugal Under 17s beat England Under 17s 2-1 at the Proact Stadium on Friday night.

The 16-year-old was is being watched by United scouts and has shown some good touches and movement throughout the age-group tournament.

Cassama's right-foot strike opened the scoring after 14 minutes in Chesterfield, catching Norwich City keeper Aston Oxborough off his line.

Born in Guinea-Bissau, Cassama moved to Portugal with his family as a youngster and honed his skills in the Sporting Lisbon academy before joining Porto last year.

Tottenham and Manchester City have also shown an interest in the teenager, who has been playing alongside Arsenal prospect Jonatas Centeno in his Portuguese age group.

Cassama's strike was cancelled out by an equaliser from Leicester City’s Layton Ndukwu shortly before half-time, but Tavares struck the winner for Portugal after 73 minutes.
