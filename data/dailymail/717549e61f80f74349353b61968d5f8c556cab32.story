The first picture has emerged of a castaway from El Salvador enjoying a decent meal after 13 months living off raw fish and turtle blood, as it is revealed that after his arduous journey, he's afraid of flying.

Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed ashore late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the Pacific Ocean living on what he could catch.

In the photograph, the unkempt shark fisherman is seen happily indulging in some bread and a bowl of food last Monday in the cabin of a Marshall Islands Sea Patrol boat as he was being transferred from where he first reached land to Majuro, the capital.

Rescuers: The picture was released by Willing Kajidrik, a sea patrol crew of the Marshall Islands Sea Patrol, who helped rescue Alvarenga

After surviving on the raw flesh of turtles, fish and seabirds caught with his bare hands and drinking their blood when there was no rain, and his own urine when there was no blood, Alvarenga no doubt relished the nourishment.

The image, supplied by Willing Kajidrik of the Marshall Islands Sea Patrol today, comes as it's revealed that after surviving such an ordeal, the humble 37-year-old is scared to fly.

'He seemed really nervous about something so I asked him what the problem was,' the Deputy Head of Mission from Manila's Mexican Embassy, Christian Clay, told MailOnline.

'He asked me "what do I have to do on the plane?" This guy went through this incredible voyage and here he is nervous about being on a plane. I told him he doesn't have to do anything. "Just sit there and they'll bring you food and drink." He seemed pretty happy about that.'

Alvarenga was released from hospital in Majuro on Friday but is too weak to travel and will remain in the island nation for a while to rest.

Diego
 Dalton, an official with El Salvador's embassy in Tokyo, said 
Alvarenga's health was 'very frail' and that he would not return home 
until he was able to make the journey. Dalton arrived in Majuro late Friday and met with Alvarenga and local officials.

'At this moment, there are no travel plans or definite itinerary,' Dalton told reporters Saturday. 'His return will depend of when his health allows the long journey back.'

According to CNN, the castaway has been moved to an undisclosed location to avoid the crush of media that has descended on the small island nation.

Security around Alvarenga has tightened since he came ashore last week and Friday night he was moved from the Marshall Islands Resort Hotel in Majuro, the sources told the network.

They added that, to confuse the media, security guards have remained at the room where he was previously staying to give the impression he is still there.

Majuro Hospital chief of staff Dr. 
Kennar Briand told CNN the fisherman would have another check up Monday 
to see if he's ready to travel.

He said his mental as well as physical health had improved.

'He
 was a bit "off," maybe it's due to him being in the open for so many 
months and not talking to people, but I think he is finally getting it 
back,' Briand said.

Alvarenga's spritely appearance Monday
 while greeting hundreds of well-wishers in Majuro had many questioning 
his story. He earlier told officials he left Mexico in late 2012 with 
another fisherman, who later died, for a day of shark fishing when a 
storm threw them off course and they began drifting.

But Alvarenga looked much weaker Thursday during a brief public appearance at the hotel, and had to be assisted into the room by two people while others stood by ready to help.

Officials said then that Alvarenga needed to be taken back to the hospital for more medical checks and that it would likely be three or four days before he was fit enough to travel back to El Salvador.
