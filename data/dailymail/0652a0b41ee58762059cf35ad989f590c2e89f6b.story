A pet owner was left heartbroken after a fire caused by her mobile phone charger killed her three pet dogs.

Dawn Jackson, 43, kept her two Labradors and whippet-cross in the home she shares with her partner and two friends in Derby.

But a fire - believed to have been started from a phone charger - ripped through the property while the dogs' owners were at work last month, killing all three pets.

All of Ms Jackson's three dogs - Labradors Marley and Riley (pictured) and the whippet-cross Dylan - died

The fire had started from an extension lead which had four sockets and was left switched on while everyone was at work.

Ms Jackson said: 'It was a freak accident and the plug wasn't overloaded.

'Marley and Riley, the two Labradors and Dylan, the whippet-cross, were in the kitchen when the fire started.

'They never had the run of the house when we were out. I want to warn people, and highlight the dangers of using extension leads.

'The main cause of the fire was the phone charger in the extension lead. This has been a wake-up call - we'll never leave anything plugged in while we're out again.'

A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Fire and Rescue service said: 'This incident is believed to be an accidental fire caused by a mobile phone charger.

Firefighters who attended the scene last month gave the dogs oxygen but were unable to revive them

Firefighters are warning others to turn off any plugs and appliances that are not designed to be left on

The spokesman added: 'The damage to the property suggests this had been a slow smouldering fire which produced a lot of smoke.

'Our fire safety message is to turn off any plugs and appliances that are not designed to be left on, always fit smoke alarms on each level within your property, and test them regularly.'

Next-door neighbour Glyn Manton, 67, called the fire brigade.

Mr Manton said: 'I looked through Dawn's kitchen window, where the dogs were, but I couldn't see anything.

'I tapped on the window and usually the dogs bark, but they didn't. Then I noticed smoke coming out of the top of the windows.'

'The firemen were brilliant. When they brought the dogs out, they were running around with oxygen and trying to get them back for some time.'

Ms Jackson and her housemates Anton Parkes and Brett Taylor were unable to return to the property
