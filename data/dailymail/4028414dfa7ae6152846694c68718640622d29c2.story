The daughter and ex-wife of murdered drug kingpin Carl Williams could be eligible for up to $740,000 in victims of crime payouts, a lawyer says.

Williams, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for playing his part in the murder of four people, was murdered at Barwon prison in April 2010.

He was beaten to death with an exercise bike by a fellow inmate. 

Fairfax media reports Williams' ex-wife Roberta and his 13-year-old daughter Dhakota have been assessed as suffering severe mental impairment after his death.

But Victorian premier Denis Napthine says the government would protect taxpayers' interests at 'every opportunity'.

'With regard to any court action that his family may take to seek compensation as victims of crime, we will continue as a government to act in the best interests of Victorian taxpayers,' Dr Napthine told reporters on Sunday.

An independent panel of psychologists and psychiatrists reportedly found the pair's level of impairment is believed to be at least 50 per cent.

He told Fairfax media the ultimate settlement would be based on the extent of their pain and suffering.

Dr Napthine said he would not pre-empt any decision of the courts.

'It's my understanding there is no court action under way. But if there is court action, we as a government would act in the best interests of Victorian taxpayers and protect the interest of Victorian taxpayers at every opportunity,' he said.

A 2012 Ombudsman's report was severely critical of Corrections Victoria's handling of Williams, whose death in the maximum security Barwon Prison was not noticed for 27 minutes.
