As a classic Lamborghini super car worth £1million went up in flames, its horrified owner could only watch on helplessly.

The classic 1971 Lamborghini Miura caught fire on a road near Acton in west London, quickly escalating and blocking traffic. By the time emergency crews arrived to put the massive fire ball out, the car has been reduced to a charred wreck.

While it is unclear how the fire started, the model - often regarded as the world first super car - has a reputation of catching on fire easily and it is recommended that owners carry a fire extinguisher as a precaution.

Up in flames: A classic supercar worth £1million caught on fire in Acton, west London as its owner could only watch on helplessly as the flames took hold

Fire ball: The flames quickly escalated as the 1971 Lamborghini Miura, one of just 764 ever built, continued to burn while emergency crews rushed to the scene

The dramatic moments were caught on 
camera and posted on YouTube by a group who film cars being driven out 
of their normal environment.

Classic sports car specialist James Cottingham from DK Engineering said: ‘It is a bitter reminder that you should always carry a fire extinguisher when you have a classic car.’

Once the world's fastest: The Lamborghini Miura, often regarded as the world's first super car, was launched in 1966

Top speed: With a V12 engine, the SV can accelerate from zero to 60mph in 6.7 seconds and reach a top speed of 171mph

While the car looked beyond repair once the flames were put out, it would not necessarily be relegated to the scrapheap.

Mr Cottingham said: ‘The Lamborghini Miura SV is never beyond repair.

‘It will need a full restoration but the car will be back on the road.'

When Lamborghini's flagship car was 
launched in 1966, the Miura generated much publicity as the world’s 
fastest road car. Only 764 have ever been built.

Can catch fire: The Miura has a reputation of catching on fire so classic car owners should always carry fire extinguishers

With a V12 engine developing around 380bhp, the SV can accelerate from zero to 60mph in 6.7 seconds and reach a top speed of 171mph.

In recent months the group, known as 'TaxTheRich100', have taken a Ferrari Enzo and Rolls-Royce Phantom off-road and have been linked to the family of Jon Hunt, the former boss of estate agency Foxtons.
