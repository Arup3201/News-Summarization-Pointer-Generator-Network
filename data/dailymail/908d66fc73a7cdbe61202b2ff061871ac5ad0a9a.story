Most brides opt for a traditional tiered white wedding cake decorated with delicate pink roses and lace for their big day.

But one bride-to-be wanted something more alternative - and she sure got what she asked for.

Celia, a bride from Haltwhistle, Northumberland, snapped up this black iced tyre cake online after seeing a beautifully decorated image, but what she actually received was much less glamorous.

Not what she bargained for: When Celia's wedding cake arrived, she was shocked by the monstrosity, it was nothing like the cake she had dreamed of (L)

Arriving at the reception on her wedding day, Celia was horrified to be confronted by a lopsided mess that barely resembled the well-finished three-tier cake she had requested.

Not only were the tiers lumpy and uneven, but they were leaning to one side. Instead of being smooth, rounded and shiny like the promised picture, the icing on the cake Celia received was different shades of unappetising grey and cracked all over.

The joins had been inexpertly covered with black ribbon, and the roses which had been on the cake dropped off.

Describing the cake that she received, Celia wrote: 'A
 few defects due to maker being unskilled.

Uncut, along with large 
amount of awful cupcakes for free. No topper or decoration. Unusual 
design. Very heavy.'

She added: 'Picture on the left is as it is, picture on the right is how it should have been. Complete disaster...offers please? I have roses which fell off this abomination if required. Sorry no returns.'

The bids started at just 99p for the black cake and Celia received 11 bids in the time that it was up for grabs.

She has, however, ended the sale - most likely due to a comment from a concerned baker who wrote: 'Sorry, but as an experienced cake maker I just thought I would contact you. I don't think you will be

able to/really should sell this cake on eBay, not least of which for health and safety reasons.

'If someone actually ate it (God Forbid!!) - I would worry it might come back on you rather than the original cake maker.

'I am sure you should be able to get a full refund from the cake maker in question.

'If you need any help wording such a request (demand!!) I would be happy to help? I am seriously shocked by this cake, the worst I have seen for a very long time - and I hope the cake maker in question is not still trading.

'Unfortunately there are now many so 
called "cake makers" setting themselves up with limited or no 
experience, and this is the result.'

Writing about the health and safety of selling a cake on eBay, Celia replied:
 'Thanks for message and concern about the cake. It has been advertised 
purely as a joke and I'm not expecting anyone to buy it.

'The
 cake was made for our wedding.. .and this is what was waiting for us at 
our reception. We have things in motion to prevent this person ever 
making a cake again and upsetting, or trying to rip off other 
unsuspecting customers.

'I have amended the advert and added a disclaimer, however I do not expect it to sell! Thanks again for your kind comments.' Â
