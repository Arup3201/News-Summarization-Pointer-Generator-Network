Two women who spent their 94-year-old relative’s money on cars, designer handbags and expensive jewellery have had their cloak of anonymity lifted by a judge.

Janet Miller, 72, and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, were not allowed to be named publicly in order to protect their victim Gladys Meek.

But now, the women who spent more than £230,000 of Mrs Meek’s savings, have been identified following her death at the age of 94.

Shocking: Janet Miller, 72 and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, who spent Gladys Meek's money on watches, jewellery and cash gifts were named at the Court of Protection, sat at the High Court

Mrs Miller, who was a niece of Mrs Meek’s late husband Bert and Mrs Johnson, a great-niece, were given power to manage Mrs Meek’s finances in 2010.

At the time it was decided that Mrs Meek’s dementia meant she lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about her estate.

But rather than protect her aunt’s savings, Mrs Miller went on to spend £17,000 on an Omega watch, more than £10,000 on rings and treated herself to two Mulberry handbags worth more than £1,000.

Named and shamed: Two women who spent their relative's savings on luxuries like a Rolex

She used money from Mrs Meek’s accounts to buy her daughter and granddaughter Vivienne Westwood handbags.

Mrs Johnson’s ‘gifts’ to herself included an £18,000 Rolex watch, a £16,000 ring and a £20,000 ‘cash gift’.

She also gave her daughters designer handbags and spent £500 on a Derby County football club season ticket for her husband.

The two women donated more than £50,000 of Mrs Meek’s money to charities.

In 2013, the women were stripped of their power after they were accused of ‘extravagant’ spending Judge David Hodge QC.

Judge Hodge made the decision to name the women following the latest in a series of hearings in the Court of Protection - which handles cases relating to sick and vulnerable people.

Before Mrs Meek died in April 2014, the court considered whether a police investigation should be called.

But rather than have Mrs Meek questioned as part of the investigation, the judge ruled that a £270,000 ‘security bond’ offered by Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson should be called in instead.

Judge Hodge concluded that publication of names would pose no risks to anyone other Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson.

Judge Hodge said: ‘Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson engaged in a course of conduct involving extravagant gifts, not only to charities, but also to themselves and members of their respective families, and involving the purchase of a motor car for each of them, computers, jewellery, watches, designer handbags and football season tickets, and involving very large transfers of cash.’

He said in April this year records showed that Mrs Meek’s assets to be worth nearly £115,000. But he said more than £90,000 of that could be eaten up in legal costs.
