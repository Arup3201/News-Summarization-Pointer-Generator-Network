Always connected: The majority of British young adults use social networks by phone everyday

Young Britons are far more advanced than their counterparts anywhere else in the world in using mobile phones to check social networking sites in their everyday lives, a new survey has revealed.

Two-thirds of mobile phone users in the 16 to 24 age group in the UK check Facebook and Twitter every day on their smartphones.

But only 37 per cent of Americans from the same age group follow suit, according to the YouGov survey conducted for mobile messaging firm tyntec.

Only the Germans (63 per cent) come close to the British for consistent use of mobile phones for networking.

Young UK residents are the heaviest users of social networks via mobile phones in the world, the survey found.

Fifteen per cent of people questioned 
told researchers they use their smartphones for networking more than 
five times a day, compared with only eight per cent of Americans with 
such a high level of use.

Young British people were also more 
aware of new apps - such as the WhatsApp, the cross-platform mobile 
messaging app. This allows phone users to exchange messages without 
having to pay for SMS.

Only 27 per cent of young Brits were unaware of this app, compared with 40 per cent of Americans under 30.

People under 30 in Britain were also more aware of Viber and Pinger.

Fifty-two per cent of young Brits told
researchers they were interested in having SMS integrated into social 
networks, compared with 61 per cent of Americans.

Researchers questioned altogether 
2,000 people in the UK and United States about SMS adoption, smartphone 
usage, mobile social networking, free and low-cost calls and SMS 
alternatives.

Figures were also obtained from Germany.

Michael Kowalzik, chief executive of 
tyntec, said: 'It is interesting to note that, for both UK and US users,
the results show that a good proportion would use SMS if integrated 
into social networks.

'This indicates a trust level and 
familiarity with SMS which presents huge opportunities for internet 
players and operators alike.'
