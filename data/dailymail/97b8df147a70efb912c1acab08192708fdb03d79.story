A 22-year-old Colorado man believed he would die while being swept up in an avalanche and almost completely buried while skiing out of bounds in Vail.

Edwin LaMair was on an off-track expedition with his brother and friend on Sunday about 4.30pm on top of Vail Mountain when he ventured off alone.

Suddenly LaMair found himself swallowed by snow and fearing the worst.

'I definitely thought I might die while I was sliding,' he told Fox News.

What started out as a regular ski quickly turned into a near-death situation for two brothers in Colorado at the weekend

As soon from a helmet camera, Edwin LaMair's brother races to the side of his brother, whose head can partially be seen here in the snow, following an avalanche in Vail

The man works quickly to free his brother from the snow by digging, which ended up taking four hours

Edwin LaMair describes in a TV interview what happened on Sunday when he was swept up in a moving wall of falling snow

Edwin LaMair was skiing here, at Vail Mountain, at the time of the accident that could have cost him his life

'I knew if I got buried it was going to be a very bad situation.

'I couldn't move at all. It was basically like I was being buried in sand.'

Luckily LaMair's brother, who had a camera mounted to his helmet, was able to find him and quickly started digging him out using his hands.

Ski patrol was called but didn't respond.

'I was just so grateful to be above the surface a little bit,' LaMair said.

'I think it would have been a lot more traumatic if I had been completely buried.'

Crazy: This is the moment Edwin LaMair's brother pulls up next to the skiier and starts digging him out

It took four hours of digging to free the survivor.

But even then, one of his skis was lost beneath the powder and LaMair had to get down the mountain on just one ski.

Once at the bottom, LaMair was checked out and discovered he had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee.

According to experts, LaMair's story should serve as a warning to other skiers, especially ones that like the adventure out of bounds.

Experts have warned skiers - especially those that like the adventure out of bounds - to always check avalanche forecasts before setting out so they are aware of the conditions they face

Ethan Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information, said skiiers should always check avalanche forecasts before setting out.

'Just like if you're going into the mountains in the summer time when you check the weather forecasts ... you want to check the avalanche forecasts to see what conditions you're facing that day,' he said.
