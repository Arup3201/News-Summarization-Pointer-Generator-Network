Never-before-seen FBI footage has revealed the harrowing rescue of 16-year-old kidnap victim Hannah Anderson following a week-long manhunt.

The FBI revealed to ABC News how they tracked down the California teenager to Idaho backcountry and saved her amid a shootout with her kidnapper, James DiMaggio, in August 2013.

ABC has also learned that since the terrifying ordeal, Hannah has returned to high school, where she is an honor student, and now hopes to become a detective.

The search for Hannah began on August 4, 2013 after her mother, Christina, 44, and eight-year-old brother, Ethan, were found burned beyond recognition in DiMaggio's Boulevard home.

Caught on camera: Two people - one at the top of the circle and one towards the right hand side - can be seen walking near a campsite in Idaho. The FBI identified the duo as Hannah Anderson and her kidnapper

Spotted: The never-before-seen footage shows the campsite where they were hiding out in August 2013

Saved: An FBI agent, the left figure, grabs the hand of Hannah, right, after a team swooped in to save her

DiMaggio, a 40-year-old family friend, then collected Hannah from cheerleading practice and fled the state. Friends said that he had a crush on Hannah that had made her uncomfortable.

Authorities issued an Amber Alert but had little to go on because neither was carrying a cell phone that could be tracked.

But after a week of searching, a group horsebacking riding through an area of Idaho backcountry known as the River of No Return Wilderness contacted the county sheriff to report that they had seen a man, a teenage girl in pajamas and a grey cat camping in the forest. The FBI knew that DiMaggio had a grey cat.

On August 9, another hiker told police that they had seen the duo setting up a camp at Morehead Lake and the next day, the U.S. Marshals Service used a small plane to search the area. 

Kidnap: Hannah Anderson, right, was kidnapped by family friend James DiMaggio, left, after he killed her mother and eight-year-old brother in August 2013. Friends say they believe he had a crush on her

Campsite: FBI photographs show the campsite where DiMaggio had been hiding Hannah. Investigators learned that he had bought the camping equipment in the days before the murders and kidnap

Hideout: DiMaggio and Hannah were spotted by horseback riders who thought they did not have appropriate camping gear. Hannah was wearing her pajamas and neither had hiking boots or rain jackets

Safe: People who had seen the duo also said they had a grey cat with them, which confirmed their identities to the FBI, who knew DiMaggio had a grey cat. The animal was unharmed and returned to DiMaggio's family

'We circled a few more times and focused in on that area. And then we were able to see that it was a blue tent,' U.S. Marshal Steve Jurman told ABC News.

Then they spotted two people with a small animal. An FBI plane took off and confirmed the animal was indeed a grey cat.

At that point, the FBI launched two hostage rescue teams to reach Hannah - and as they headed towards her, they spotted her waving her hands in the air while DiMaggio collected firewood.

'Stealth was key,' said James Yacone of the FBI. 'One of the requirements to move in on the arrest was a distance and a separation between Hannah and DiMaggio.'

So later, with DiMaggio again busy in the woods, they swooped in - with two agents running towards the teenager and leading her away from the campsite.

DiMaggio fired at least once, the FBI said, and the team returned fire - firing multiple times and ultimately killing him.

Weapons: The FBI, who said DiMaggio had fired the first shot before they fatally shot him, found these guns

Chilling: Authorities also found a machete, pictured left, and handcuffs, right, at the campsite

Photos taken at the campsite show that DiMaggio had a stash of weapons, including firearms and a machete, as well as handcuffs.

It also emerged that neither had a rain jacket or hiking boots with them, and Hannah was wearing pajama pants and tennis shoes when she was first seen. 

After they took Hannah away from the scene, she was taken to hospital - where she learned that her mother and brother had been killed.

When agents took the unharmed grey cat to her, she did not want to take it, and it was returned to DiMaggio's family.

Investigators say they believe DiMaggio was motivated to murder Hannah's family and kidnap her because he hoped for a relationship with the girl, but feared she was growing away from him.  

'Somewhere in his mind, I think he thought that he and Hannah would have a relationship and she would somehow fall in love with him,' FBI Deputy Director Britt Johnson said. 'I think the ability for him to get her away and take her somewhere - he somehow thought he could change the situation.' 

Loss: Hannah holds up a picture of her mother Christina, 44, and her eight-year-old brother Ethan at their memorial service in California in 2013. They were found burned beyond recognition in DiMaggio's home

Burned down: After burning his house to the ground with their bodies inside, DiMaggio kidnapped Hannah

New life: She is now living with her father, Brett, right, and hopes to become a detective

Friends also speculated that DiMaggio's behavior may have been sparked by the upcoming anniversary of his father's death, who had taken his life by taking meth and walking into the desert.

After the ordeal, Hannah moved in with her father, Brett, and returned to school, where she is on the honor roll, according to a family spokesperson. 

'She is exploring colleges now where she plans to study forensics and criminology with a goal of becoming a detective with a Special Victims Unit,' they said in a statement.

'The entire Anderson family is eternally grateful to all of the individuals who helped rescue Hannah, and especially to the good men and women of the FBI who have clearly influenced her career aspirations.'
