When air passengers brace themselves for a bumpy landing in bad weather, it's unlikely they give much thought to what is happening outside their windows.

But these pictures of a Swiss Air jet about to touch down at night on a fog-shrouded runway at Zurich Airport reveal what happens when a plane's wings cut through the air - to quite spectacular effect.

As the Airbus A340 glides towards the earth, floodlights over the runway illuminate the spirals of fog left in its wake.

The patterns created in the swathes 
of lit-up fog render the downwash, the ground effect and the wingtip 
vortices visible to the viewer, according to Jalopnik.com.

Wingtip
vortices are circular patterns of rotating air left behind by a plane's
wing, while the downwash refers to the air forced down by the 
aerodynamic action of the wing in motion.

The
phrase ground effect describes the increased lift and decreased drag a 
plane's wings generate when they are close to the earth.
