Aaron Ramsey has defended his form this season and called some of the criticism he has received 'unfair'.

Former Arsenal forward Charlie Nicholas accused the Wales midfielder of playing 'Hollywood football' following the 3-3 draw with Anderlecht.

Ramsey, though, said he 'knows his qualities'. He has yet to hit the heights of last season, when he scored 16 goals in all competitions for Arsenal - finding the net only three times in 17 appearances for club and country.

He was out for three weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Tottenham on September 27.

Arsene Wenger has said his player must focus on getting his 'priorities right' between attack and defence.

'I’m not worried. I know my qualities,' said Ramsey. 'I’ve had a few injuries this season and I’m just getting back.

'To be honest, I’m still not 100 per cent physically there. It does take a bit out of me.

'It will take me a few more games to be back to my best. I’m not worried. Certain criticism from people is unfair.' Ramsey was part of the Wales team who earned a point in Belgium to keep their hopes of qualifying for Euro 2016 very much alive.

The 23-year-old praised manager Chris Coleman, but also predecessor Gary Speed, who Ramsey said laid the foundations.

'Chris has done really well,' he said. 'It was always difficult to come in after Gary Speed - whoever the manager was.

'To be fair to the gaffer, he was brave to take on the job. Now he has had his own input as well as building what Gary first started off.

'He’s done really well and you can see everyone is right behind him. We all want to go in the right direction.' 

The 0-0 draw places Wales second in Group B on eight points from four games, one point behind Israel.

Scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle, with Ramsey one of several players to throw his shirt to the celebrating travelling fans.

'It wasn’t a very exciting game for them to watch when we had the ball,' said Ramsey. 'We felt like that we needed them to get us over the line. We showed them our appreciation for getting us that point in the end.

'You can see the fans are right behind us. They have come over in numbers this week and they stuck with us all through the game even when we weren’t playing great. 

Ramsey says former Wales manager, the late Gary Speed, laid the foundations for the country's current form

'We’ve got a very important point. We were under pressure for large periods of the game, but I felt we stuck together and that is something we have improved on dramatically in this campaign. We are very hard to beat and to score against.

'We are going in the right direction and we have kept the momentum going in terms of getting the point and keeping the points ticking over.

'We are second in the group but we would have snapped anyone’s hand off if we were offered that before the campaign began.

'We will go to Israel now full of confidence and hopefully be more dangerous with the ball. Hopefully it will be a more comfortable game for us.'
