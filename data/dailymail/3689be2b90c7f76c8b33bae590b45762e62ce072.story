They may be among the best-selling authors in British history but it seems many readers could not be bothered to finish Fifty Shades of Grey or JK Rowling's latest novel.

The Casual Vacancy by the Harry Potter author is the most popular book to be abandoned by readers before the end, according to six years of research.Â 

And E.L. James' controversial book came second in the list of works that readers shelved before the end.

EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey was also abandoned with one reader saying: 'I am embarrassed for us all'

One commenter said she had to put it down because 'I'm a bit of a lit snob', while another simply said 'I am embarrassed for all of us.'

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Wicked Years and Eat, Pray, Love completed the top five books reading website Goodreads' 19million-strong community shelved before the end.

Readers said the Stieg Larsson classic, which has spawned a series of films, had a 'slow beginning and hard to wait for something to make me care'.

Those that abandoned Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert said they found the heroine too unlikeable to read on.

Suzanne Skyvara, from the website, told The Independent that the issue of giving up on a book split their readership.

One in six people said they would give up on a book before they reached the 50th page

Forty per cent said even if they are not enjoying a book they will stick with it until the end.

However,
more than one in six said they are comfortable with abandoning a book 
before the 50th page while more than one in four said they will shelve a
book before the 100th.

She said: 'This turned out to be a real watercooler topic.

'People
split into defined groups; it is amazing how many people will push on 
to the end of a book they don't enjoy. I'm in the "life's too short" 
category.'

The research was undertaken by Goodreads over six years, with the website compiling books readers marked as 'abandoned'.

But it is not just modern books that readers admit to not finishing. Noted classics are also shelved early.

Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is the most abandoned classic book and Lord Of The Rings came second.

Ulysses, Moby-Dick and Atlas Shrugged also made the top five.
