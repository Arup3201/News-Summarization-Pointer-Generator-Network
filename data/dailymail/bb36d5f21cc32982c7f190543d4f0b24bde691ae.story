Newly declassified documents reveal how the CIA tried to start revolution in the USSR by printing and distributing the novel Doctor Zhivago.

When the CIA first reviewed Boris Pasternak's manuscript in 1957, they realized its high-propaganda potential and printed it in secret to be passed out to Soviets at international meet-ups in Europe.

The plan was considered a success as Soviets smuggled the banned book back to their home country and it was illicitly passed from person to person.

The CIA distributed hundreds of copies of Boris Pasternak's novel Doctor Zhivago to subvert the Soviets in the midst of the Cold War. Above, miniature versions of the novel that were printed by the CIA to be distributed at a 1959 youth conference

Authors Peter Finn and Petra Couvee obtained the more than 100 CIA memos for their new book about the novel's role in the Cold War.

'The Zhivago Affair: The Kremlin, The CIA and the Battle Over a Forbidden Book' is due out this June.

Finn and Couvee previewed their book in the Washington Post, writing about how the CIA first obtained Pasternak's manuscript from British Intelligence in 1958.

The agents immediately recognized the books potential as propaganda 'not only for its intrinsic message and thought-provoking nature, but also for the circumstances of its publication'.

'We have the opportunity to make Soviet citizens wonder what is wrong with their government, when a fine literary work by the man acknowledged to be the greatest living Russian writer is not even available in his own country in his own language for his own people to read,' the memo said.

The novel follows the life of Yuri Zhivago, a physician and poet, as he falls in love with two women throughout decades of revolution, war and Communist oppression in Russia.

For many reasons, including the fact that the main character did not subscribe to official Marxist ideology, Pasternak was considered a traitor and Soviet Union publishers refused to print the book.

However, an Italian literary scout was impressed with the book and it was first printed by a publisher there, in Italian, in 1957.

But what made the book unpublishable in Pasternak's native country is what made it so alluring to Americans seeking to undermine the Communist regime.

'Pasternak's humanistic message - that every person is entitled to a private life and deserves respect as a human being, irrespective of the extent of his political loyalty or contribution to the state - poses a fundamental challenge to the Soviet ethic of sacrifice of the individual to the Communist system,' John Maury, chief of the agency's Soviet Russia Division, said in a memo, according to the Post.

The CIA decided to print the book in secret through a foreign publisher to be distributed by agents around Europe - with an emphasis on the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium where 16,000 Soviets citizens were due to attend.

Of course the copies of the book couldn't be handed out at the United State's pavilion, so instead they enlisted the help of the Vatican .

It was at the City of God's pavilion that 200 copies were handed out in a small library behind a 'somewhat hidden' curtain.

'Soon the book’s blue linen covers were littering the fairgrounds. Some who got the novel were ripping off the cover, dividing the pages, and stuffing them in their pockets to make the book easier to hide,' the authors wrote.

Adaptation: The novel was turned into a movie in 1965 starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif, and went on to earn five Academy awards

The books dispersal at the World's Fair was so successful that word got back to Pasternak himself in the USSR that people were reading Doctor Zhivago in the original Russian.

But the plan did have one draw back. Despite the instruction that America's hand 'not be shown in any manner', the CIA messed up in printing the book by violating the Italian publisher's rights. 

The publishing house objected, and attention was drawn to the fact that so many books were being printed.

An anonymous columnist for the National Review Bulletin was sharp enough to pinpoint the blame on the CIA.

'That quaint workshop of amateur subversion, the Central Intelligence Agency, may be exorbitantly expensive but from time to time it produces some noteworthy goodies,' columnist 'Quincy' wrote. 

But overall, the CIA found the operation a success and decided to pull it off again at a Vienna youth conference the following year.

This time they printed the book at their own press back in the States, making an inauspicious pocket-sized version.

When bus-loads of Soviet youth arrived at the conference in 1959, Russian emigres stormed their vehicles and threw the books threw open windows.

The passengers under KGB surveillance didn't know what to do with so many  copies of the book readily available.

Surprisingly, the KGB officers at the conference were lenient.

Hit: Doctor Zhivago was nominated for Best Picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time

'Take it, read it, but by no means bring it home,' the agents advised.

Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1958, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to claim the award.

He spent the rest of his life in USSR and died at the age of 70 in 1960.

The 1965 film adaptation of the novel starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif went on to win five Academy Awards, a nomination for best picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time.
