As an acolyte of Ronny Deila’s at Stromsgodset, Stefan Johansen found himself the most sought-after man at Celtic Park when the name of Neil Lennon’s successor broke in the summer.

A key member of the most unlikely team to win the Tippeligaen in 40 years 12 months ago, the midfielder was only too happy to lay it on thick when a string of inquisitors asked exactly what they could expect from the new man in charge.

Tellingly though, whilst happy to eulogise about Deila’s strengths to anyone who cared to listen, Johansen stopped short of promising overnight miracles. No gain without pain might have been a neat summary of his view of the future.

Stefan Johansen believes the Hoops will continue to improve under Ronny Deila

Accordingly, when Celtic fumbled their way through the first three months of the season, Johansen felt no need to correct himself.

Provided his team-mates continued to buy into the new man’s methods, he remained convinced his long-term prediction would hold true.

‘It always takes time to adapt to a new culture but I think he’s starting to get there,’ said Johansen.

‘At the start of season we didn’t get the results we wanted. I said at the time, though, it was always going to take time with the new gaffer. He had new ideas he wanted to put into the team and you’re starting to see the team he wants. We are getting results and are still in every cup while being at the top of the league. We’re doing well in the Europa League as well and, hopefully, we can get through there. 

Celtic have lost just once in their last 15 games under Deila at Parkhead

‘Things are starting to look good now but it’s still early in the season and we need to keep it going.

‘Things were tough at the start but I don’t think anyone had a problem sticking with him. He was talking to us all during that time. It’s going to be good in the end. Like I say, just give him time. Celtic is going to be a success with him as manager.’

That statement is much easier to swallow now than at any stage in Deila’s tenure to date. Few would have dared to have muttered it aloud after the debacles that were Legia, Maribor and Hamilton but, with each passing week, matters have improved incrementally.

However, looking back on some of those grim affairs, it’s instinctive to ask Johansen if his fellow Norwegian told him to do a little dressing-room politicking on his behalf.

‘He didn’t ask me to do that,’ he stonewalled. ‘He did well in Norway and doesn’t have any problem explaining what he wants here. He’s very clear on that — he doesn’t need me to do that. He’s fully capable of doing that by himself.’

Only 39, Deila is distinct from the battle-hardened figures like Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan who have occupied the dugout in recent times. Like Lennon, he is having to learn much on the job.

The burden at times must feel overwhelming and yet Johansen can testify that time spent with him is not devoid of moments of levity.

‘He’s a serious guy when he needs to be but he’ll also make some jokes,’ he said. ‘The important thing is he’s got a good mix — in training today we needed a hard session after coming back from the international break. But of course, sometimes he will make a joke or something. That’s good. Sometimes you need to have a laugh. You can’t be serious all the time.

‘Maybe sometimes people forget he’s so young. But that’s the kind of pressure we have at the club.

‘It doesn’t matter if you are a player of 18 or 27, the expectation is the same.’ 

Johansen has been arguably Celtic's best performer so far this season

While victory at Pittodrie last time out was the most impressive domestic result of Deila’s reign to date, his reaction eclipsed anything that’s happened on the field of play. Previously sedate to the point where his passion was being questioned, Deila’s fist-pumping and roars of approval to the visiting throng went down every bit as well as Virgil van Dijk’s late winner.

Not quite the striptease he famously performed in front of the Godset fans after saving them from relegation — but scenes of unity and joy so far conspicuous by their absence since he came to Glasgow.

‘You can see the game meant a lot to him,’ Johansen added. ‘Like everyone else at Celtic, he wants to be at the top of the table. The Aberdeen game was the last game before the international break and our chance to get on top.

‘With the way we won the game, with one man down (after Scott Brown’s dismissal), it was great.

‘We kept on going and, when Virgil scored the winner near the end, it was a fantastic feeling. The game wasn’t so good, we didn’t play to our best but winning was a good feeling for everybody.’

Rest assured, that the unbridled emotion of that day was quickly replaced by a steely resolve for improvement.

Johansen can testify to the fact that, irrespective of a scoreline, Deila’s desire for individual and collective improvement is bordering on the obsessive. ‘He is always saying things to me because he always looks for improvement,’ he said. ‘He does that with all the players — especially when you are doing well. He wants you to do even better every day. That’s how it should be. You can never be satisfied or good enough in football. That’s what he’s aiming for in everyone and himself.

Ronny Deila is having to learn much on the job like predecessor Neil Lennon

‘For example, when I played in Stromsgodset, I created chances but he told me I needed to work on my defence and be smarter in where I ran. It was always a couple of small things — small details. That’s what makes you a better player.’

Those who are determined to become the best they can be will thrive under him. Those who stand still will be discarded. Evidently not a man who plays favourites, previous relationships count for nothing in the here and now.

‘I speak with him in English when all the players are around,’ said Johansen. ‘They wouldn’t understand what we were saying otherwise. If I talk with him alone, I can talk in Norwegian, but, if there’s anyone else there, I will talk in English. It’s out of respect for the other players and the rest of the staff. If they want to be part of the conversation, that’s the way it should be.’

Increasingly, in more ways than one, Deila and his players are speaking the same language.

Talk of a Treble has never been far from the manager’s lips, a view heartily endorsed by Johansen.

‘Yes he mentions it to us,’ the midfielder said ahead of tomorrow’s visit of Dundee.

‘We all know the expectation that comes with being a player at Celtic.

‘The fans want us to win trophies and that’s what we want as well. That’s why we are Celtic players — to want to win every trophy. We still have the chance of success as we are in every cup.

‘If we keep winning we will win those trophies. I know how hard it is — but it’s still possible.’
