A Wyoming couple is charged with felony child abuse for allegedly locking a seven-year-old in an outdoor cage for three weeks as punishment.

Jena Harman, the child's mother, and her 
boyfriend, Alexander Smith, each face up to 20 years jail for allegedly 
caging the child outside their Laramie, Wyoming, home.

Police said the child was forced to live in a six-by-six-foot wooden box where he/she ate once a day, slept on a cot and went to the toilet in a five-gallon bucket.

The child, whose gender was not identified by 
authorities,  was also sprayed with a hose while inside the cage and ordered to sleep outside during thunderstorms, Laramie Boomerang reported.

9NEWS reported Harman and Smith each face one count of child abuse and three counts of felonious restraint.

They were arrested on July 24 after Albany County Sheriff's deputies responded to a tip that the child was caged outside a remote Fox Creek Road home.

However that was not the couple's first contact with authorities.

Citing an affidavit, 9NEWS reported the family had eight contacts with authorities since February, but the child remained at home.

The child's school had complained to the sheriff's office several times, saying the child missed 18 days of school and at times showed up with bruises and a limp. 

However the sheriff's office said the 
reports were unfounded, even though deputies witnessed the child pulling
 food out of a garbage can and eating it, the affidavit states.

Neighbors told 9NEWS they saw the abuse but didn't report it because they were scared of Smith, a truck driver.

The Albany County Sheriff's Office would not provide comment to 9NEWS.

Child psychologists told 9NEWS the child is likely to suffer a lifetime of anxiety, depression and anger following his horrific alleged abuse.

The cage the child lived in was
 made from cattle paneling and wooden snow fence with plywood 
covering half of the opening.

A metal chain and 'dog-leash-style 
latch' were allegedly used to keep the child locked in with some clothing, books, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a bucket.

According
 to court documents, the child spent most of the time inside the cage, including to use 
the restroom.

The child ate once a day - if Harman remembered to bring food. Harman released the seven-year-old from the cage when Smith was not around, according to police. Smith lived in a camper near the home.

According to an affidavit, Harman told deputies she and Smith kept the child in the 'playpen' because the seven-year-old 'was constantly doing bad things'.

Smith told deputies he disliked the child but wanted to keep the juvenile safe in a cage. Smith said the child appeared to like the cage.

When the child was allowed in the house, they were forced to sleep on the floor. The dog slept on the couch.

The child told investigators that peeing outside was allowed, but had to hold on to 'poop' until the family could go 'into town', the affidavit stated.

Smith and Harman remain in custody on a $100,000 cash bond at the Albany County Detention Center in Laramie, Wyoming.

Smith faces a circuit court hearing on Thursday while Harman has been bound over to district court.

The child is now in the state's custody.​
