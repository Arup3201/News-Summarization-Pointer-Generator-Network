A man who was caught towing a 1.5 tonne van on his trailer with just a few ropes to secure it told police he was confident he could get home without causing a catastrophe.

The 65-year-old man was pulled over by police at Monash in Melbourne's south east on Sunday night as he drove along the freeway.

Police received a number of complaints about the man who was using his panel van to tow the less than safe load.

A closer inspection of the trailer revealed it was hitched and secured to the van with a broken D clamp.

Nylon ropes were used to secure the 1.5 tonnes van and the tyres were chocked with bricks.

Police say there was no front rail on the trailer and one axle was travelling on rims due to a flat tyre.

The 65-year-old from Thorpedale, 100km south east of Melbourne, thought he would be able to tow the vehicle safely, despite his panel van having no lights.
