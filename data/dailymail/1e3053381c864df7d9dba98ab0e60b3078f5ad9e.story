Switzerland officials confirmed the older brother of coach Ottmar Hitzfeld died on the eve of the team’s last 16 match against Argentina. 

Team spokesman Marco von Ah said on Tuesday that Hitzfeld is mourning the death of his brother, but decided not to return home before the knock-out match.

Von Ah added the coach is looking ahead and 'wants everybody to do so and respect his private sphere.'

The team did not give any details of the death, but Swiss media reported that the 81-year-old Winfried Hitzfeld died in a Basel hospital.

Switzerland lost the match 1-0 after a late strike from Angel Di Maria, who denied the Swiss their first appearance in the quarter-finals since 1954.

The 65-year-old Hitzfeld, as expected, retired after the match.
