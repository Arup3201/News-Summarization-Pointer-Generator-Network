Swansea boss Garry Monk swapped his club suit and tie for a casual open neck and jeans on the touchline – but there was nothing dress down about his team’s display. 

The Welsh club who have started the Premier League with two wins in two looked smart as they eased their way into the Capital One cup’s third round.

And Monk, who made ten changes to the starting line-up that has beaten both Manchester United and Burnley, learned he’s got plenty in reserve.

Man of the Match: Gomis. 

The rookie boss whose side stunned Old Trafford and provoked the spending spree that brought Angel di Maria to England for a British transfer record has played the transfer markets like a veteran. 

And it was the star signing of his summer, French international striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who got the crucial first half breakthrough.

The 29-year-old, picked up for nothing from Lyon, showed the class that has brought him 12 France caps as he spun on to Nathan Dyer’s pass and placed a shot in the bottom corner. 

It was a perfect opening shot from Gomis in his battle to win the centre forward’s role from last season’s 24-goal top scorer Wilfried Bony. 

And when the Ivory Coast striker replaced the Frenchman late on he was desperate to get on the scoresheet himself – but fired over from 12 yards and saw another effort blocked on the line. 

Dyer, made captain for the night, was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night.

Having a go: Gomis tried his luck on a night when he endeared himself to the Liberty Stadium crowd

Dyer, made captain for the night, was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night. 

His pace troubled the Championship new boys early on and he was so proud of the chance to skipper the side that he refused to come off despite a nasty head wound in the second half. Dyer’s enthusiasm set the tone for a committed home display, and Monk also saw a quality debut from his own Argentinian World Cup star, centre half Federico Fernandez, who cost little more than a tenth of what United have paid for Di Maria. 

And alongside him former Arsenal youngster Kyle Bartley had an outstanding night to suggest that the Swans have plenty of depth in their squad. 

Competitive: Rotherham battled hard but were unable to force an equaliser against Swansea

There were even some promising cameos from academy graduates Josh Sheehan and Jay Fulton. Rotherham boss Steve Evans made five changes to the team that beat Millwall, and clearly wanted to gain some momentum from a Cup success. 

But midfield man Lee Frecklington wasted their one big opportunity when with half an hour gone he volleyed over the bar from six yards. 

However all the time there was only one goal in it, boss Evans knew his side had a chance and he turned away in despair when sub Conor Newton drove a late chance to equalise over the bar. 

Evans could constantly be seen arguing with the fourth official when decisions didn’t go his way, but the truth was that Swansea – even in dress down mode – had far too much quality.
