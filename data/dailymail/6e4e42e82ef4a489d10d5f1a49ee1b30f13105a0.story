A new video shot from the point of view of a U.S. Army soldier in Afghanistan has captured the desperate moment when a soldier ducks for cover as he's fired on by Taliban militants.

The three and a half minute video captures the soldier’s plight as gunshots can be seen and heard all around him.

The soldier fires several shots as he heroically descends a mountain in an effort to draw fire away from his comrades.

Too close for comfort: Dust kicked up by a bullet can be seen on the video, right near the soldier's feet as he descends the mountain

As he makes his way down, bullets can be seen ricocheting by his feet - some coming dangerously close as he scrambles behind a rock for safety.

But as he crouches, the soldier drops his gun as a bullet strikes the weapon.

'I'm hit!' the soldier can be heard yelling repeatedly. 'Help me!'

His cries are not answered as shots continue to be heard.

But this war story has a happy ending, as it was revealed that the man using the helmet cam made it out alive after the Taliban bullets failed to penetrate his body armor.

He said: ‘I got a hit a total of 4 times. My helmet cam died and i made it down the mountain on my own. I was also hit in the side of my helmet and my eye pro was shot off of my face.'

The soldier said that he was part of a team on a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering mission when they encountered the Taliban fighters.

In deep: As he screamed for help, shots continued to be fired in the direction of the injured soldier

'The rest of the squad was pinned down by machine gun fire. I didn't start the video until a few minutes into the firefight for obvious reasons.

'I came out into the open to draw fire so my squad could get to safety.'

He said that one of the shots 'struck the tube by my hand of the 203 grenade launcher which knocked it out of my hands.'

Desperate: At one point in the video, his gun was knocked out of his hands by the force of one of the shots

'When I picked the rifle back up it was still functional but the grenade launcher tube had a nice sized 7.62 cal bullet hole in it and was rendered useless.'

The video was uploaded by YouTube user Funker530, which promises even more never-before-seen footage from the front lines of Afghanistan.

This footage is part of an ongoing project documenting of the war in Afghanistan.
