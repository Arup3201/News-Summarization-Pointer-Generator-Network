Changing nightwear: Many UK men now spurn pyjamas, saying they are for children. File picture

Pyjamas have fallen out of fashion because many adults have stopped wearing anything at all in bed, according to researchers.

One in four Britons do not own pyjamas or nightwear of any kind. This is the highest proportion for any country in Europe, a study found.

Men think pyjamas are for children and should be kept out of the bedroom while women are five times more likely to own a pair than their partners.

The Europe-wide study by Ipsos for cotton trademark Cotton USA asked 5,000 people aged 15 to 54 about their clothes shopping habits.

Italians are twice as likely as Britons to wear pyjamas in bed.

Only Germans have shown a similar trend to the UK for opting to sleep in  the nude.

Stephanie Thiers-Ratcliffe, of Cotton USA, said: ‘Since 2012 we have seen a rise in the number of people who do not own any pyjamas – one reason for this could be the growing popularity of loungewear.’

One of those sticking with tradition is Prime Minister David Cameron who has admitted to wearing pyjamas, even while working in the mornings.

The research found the average Briton owns 18 pairs of underwear, 17 pairs of socks, 14 t-shirts and three pairs of shorts – but only one suit.

The survey also discovered that Italian women own the most bras –12 – while Germans have the highest number of socks at 24 pairs, plus 23 lots of underwear.

British women typically own nine bras, nine dresses and six skirts.

The study revealed the average Briton owns a single suit, meaning we wear that outfit to all occasions, from job interviews to weddings and funerals. Fashion conscious Italians have the most suits, at three on average.

Miss Thiers-Ratcliffe said: ‘An interesting finding is that Brits only own 1.4 suits these days, which they will wear to every kind of formal occasion.

‘The fact the number of shorts in the nation’s wardrobes has fallen too shows it’s been a while since the country enjoyed a decent sunny summer.’

Research also showed that six out of  ten Britons donate their unused clothing to charity.
