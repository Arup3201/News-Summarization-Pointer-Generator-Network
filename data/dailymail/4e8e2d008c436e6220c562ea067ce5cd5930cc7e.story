George H.W. Bush has been rushed to a Houston hospital after he experienced shortness of breath.

The 90-year-old former US President is being kept for observation at Methodist Hospital, doctors say. 

He was taken to the hospital by ambulance on Tuesday night. Representatives for Bush say the hospital stay is a 'precaution.'

Bush is the oldest living former commander in chief. He was hospitalized for seven weeks in January 2013 for a bacterial infection and a cough - but later discharged

Barbara Bush read 'Twas The Night Before Christmas with Houston Texans player JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday before her husband's hospitalization was announced 

The 41st president is the oldest living former commander in chief - beating 90-year-old Jimmy Carter by just a few months. 

He held office for one term - from 1989 until 1993, after losing a reelection campaign to President Bill Clinton. 

Bush, who can no longer use his legs, most recently appeared seated in a wheelchair at an event in November at Texas A&M University with his son, former President George W. Bush. 

He was seen in public attending a Houston Texans NFL game on November 23. He rode around the field in a golf cart, but enthusiastically greeted players and fans at NRG Stadium.

Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, made a surprise visit with Houston Texans' JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston this evening to perform 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.' 

It's not clear whether she was with the 41st U.S. president when he experienced his shortness of breath  

Mrs Bush and Watt were the special guests for the Radio City Christmas Spectacular in Houston

Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well

This isn't the first time Bush Sr. visited that hospital. In November 2012, he was hospitalized at the same facility for treatment of a bronchitis-related cough. He was not released until mid-January. 

Bush was last hospitalized in January 2013 for seven weeks for bronchitis, a bacterial infection and a cough. 

Methodist Hospital is rated as the top hospital in Texas by US News & World Report. It is ranked nationally, as well. 

White House spokesperson Eric Schultz released a statement Tuesday night:

'The President has been made aware that President Bush was admitted to the hospital. President Obama and the First Lady send their good wishes to the former President and the entire Bush family during this holiday season.'
