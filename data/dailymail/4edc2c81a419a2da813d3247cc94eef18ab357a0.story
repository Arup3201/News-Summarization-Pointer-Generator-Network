High Street firms have a 'responsibility' to employ more ex-offenders who can be motivated and honest, the Justice Secretary has said.

Kenneth Clarke urged businesses, including household names such as Virgin and Marks & Spencer, to hire former prisoners without fear of damaging their reputation or values.

Mr Clarke is trying to convince companies to fulfill their 'social responsibility' ahead of Downing Street summit, later this month, where up to 40 companies hear him outline how prisoners can make loyal and committed employees if given the right opportunities upon release from jail.

The Government has insisted the scheme is aimed at cutting reoffending rate – which currently sees 47per cent of adult offenders commit another crime within a year.

But Mr Clarke there is ‘no reason’ why profits from prisoners' work should not be used to pay for the prisons that house them.

He admitted that when he was home 
secretary 20 years ago it was difficult to persuade firms that hiring 
ex-prisoners ‘could be aligned with the sensible management of a 
thriving business’.

‘Actually it makes very great sense,’ he said.

‘You will be able to recruit and train
people who will be highly motivated individuals when they've taken 
advantage of the opportunities this kind of thing can present them.

‘We have large numbers of major 
companies expressing a strong interest, beginning to get organised, 
Virgin, Marks & Spencer.’

Obligation: Companies have a social responsibility to help ex offenders stay out of trouble when they have been release, according to Justice Secretary Ken Clarke

He added: ‘Introducing work experience and training to people who are serving their time and being punished in prison is altogether a more intelligent way of running the prison service.’

‘There is no doubt that people who get sent to prison have made a mistake, society is entitled to look for them to be punished, but also society should be trying to do something to help those who have the gumption to sort themselves out, to resume an ordinary honest life as decent citizens when they leave.

‘If you just incarcerate people, if prison is just a warehouse in which you keep people and then release them without guidance into the world, it's hardly surprising that half of them will be back within 12 months, having committed more crime.

‘Many prisoners do not want to be part of that cycle. We need to facilitate the way in which people get back into a normal life and do not commit further crimes again.’

He went on: ‘We also stress to the businessmen that you can take part in this and derive benefits as a business and you don't have to compromise your ordinary standards of commercial judgment.

‘I want eventually to see businesses manufacturing, providing services, from prisons on a commercial basis.

‘There's no reason why they shouldn't help pay for themselves and the cost of the prison.’

The Government is working with the CBI to ensure that measures are put in place to guard against unfair competition with ordinary businesses outside the prison gates, he added.

Speaking ahead of the launch of ONE3ONE Solutions, which will replace the Prison Industries unit in helping prisoners to improve their job prospects, Mr Clarke said there were 131 prisons across England and Wales where there was the space for some sort of training and work-related experience.

‘Some of that will be organised by what was our Prison Industries but more and more of it (will be) normal household name firms actually doing it as part of their social responsibility and the running of their business.’

Virgin and Marks & Spencer are just two of the major firms interested after Timpson opened its first training academy at a jail four years ago, Mr Clarke said.

Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt added: ‘We're trying to get towards a place where instead of work being part of the prison estate where it can be squeezed in among the security requirement, we will have work central to prison, and change the way we build security around that work.’

A Virgin Group spokesman said: ‘We believe the more productive people can be while they are in prison, the more they can develop their skills and the better their chances of rehabilitation and of succeeding and not reoffending on release.

‘Everyone deserves a second chance and research shows that many ex-offenders are more committed and willing to do more than 'just the job' and are grateful for the opportunity to do something worthwhile.’

He said it was ‘still relatively early days across the group’, but added: ‘Sir Richard Branson believes this is the right thing to do.’

Old habits: Currently 47per cent of jailed adult offenders commit another crime within 12 months

The group's non-profit foundation Virgin Unite was ‘looking at how to increase the work opportunities in prisons, prior to and at the time of release’, the spokesman added.

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ‘Firms should follow the lead set by National Grid and Timpson who not only employ former offenders in prisons but have built up a loyal and skilled workforce by doing so.’

A Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said the firm does not have a formal programme which targets ex-offenders but they can be referred to its Marks & Start scheme, which aims to support people who face barriers getting into work.

Former prisoner Mark Leech, editor of the prisoners' newspaper Converse, said Mr Clarke's rhetoric ‘isn't enough’.

‘Simply telling employers to hire ex-offenders won't surmount their ingrained reluctance to do so - if Clarke is serious about this, he needs to provide incentives to employers, such as reduced employer's national insurance contributions for ex-offenders, to encourage the hiring of them,’ he said.

‘To me, it seems Clarke just doesn't get it, he doesn't understand that in order to translate theory into practice, rhetoric isn't enough - ex-offenders have paid the price for what they did, and employers should be encouraged to employ them with practical employment benefits.’

Timpson said any prisoners it employed who were eligible for paid work earned the national minimum wage, currently £6.08 per hour for those aged 21 and over, with bonuses if they achieve a particular skill level.

Inmates who were not eligible for paid work receive the weekly prison wage.

The average rate of pay for inmates working inside prisons was £9.60 per week in 2007, figures in the Prison Reform Trust's latest Bromley Briefings factfile showed.

It added that in 2007/08 prisoners spent an average of 12.6 hours a week working.
