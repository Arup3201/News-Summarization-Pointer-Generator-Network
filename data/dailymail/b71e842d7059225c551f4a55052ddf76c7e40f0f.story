Seven-time Grammy winning singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has unveiled her latest fragrance - and she's the ultimate country beauty in her campaign shots.

The new fragrance, called Taylor by Taylor Swift Made of Starlight Musical Edition, combines the singer's two loves: sweet smells and music.

The floral scent is packaged in a collectable music box that, when you open, plays the 24-year-old's hit song Starlight.

'It evokes memorable nights spent with your best friends, combined with the romantic and playful spirit of the songâ€™s lyrics,' says Taylor.

The fragrance itself is a blend of crisp fruits and soft florals and Taylor's aim was for her 'fresh and feminine' scent to encapsulate all of her favorite things.

Wearing a boho style blue and white dress, Taylor is the ultimate country chick in her campaign imagery.

She swings on a rope in the official fragrance campaign shot, and can be seen daydreaming in a sun-drenched room in behind the scenes imagery.

It's been a busy month for the singer and entrepreneur. With two
 days to go before her final bow, Taylor Swift is in no mood to slow it 
down during the last leg of her Red tour in Asia.

The
 24-year-old singer put on an energetic show as she performed 
her set of songs at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Monday.

Taylor
 showed off her slender figure in her signature black leather shorts and
 ivory blouse as she belted out her hits.

The star's last show is set for Thursday at the same Singapore Indoor Stadium.
