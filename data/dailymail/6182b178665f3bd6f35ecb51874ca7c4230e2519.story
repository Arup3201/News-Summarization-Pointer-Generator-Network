Lord Mandelson feared he would have to break in to 10 Downing Street after civil servants told him it would be inappropriate for him to be seen entering the front door after the last Election.

Gus O'Donnell, the then Cabinet Secretary, told the Labour peer it would be wrong for senior Labour aides to been seen entering No10 while talks were still ongoing about which political party would form the next Government.

This is one of the explosive scenes from a political drama that sheds new light on the historic negotiations which led to the creation of the Coalition Government, having been based on interviews with key figures in the talks including George Osborne, Lord Ashdown, Gus O'Donnell and Lord Mandelson.

No joke: Mark Gatiss plays Lord Mandelson in the drama 'Coalition' - it airs on Channel 4 on Saturday

Explosive: A scene from the political drama that sheds new light on the historic negotiations which led to the creation of the Coalition Government

In one scene Gordon Brown, who is still Britain's Prime Minister even though he does not have an overall majority, heads off to No10, joking: 'Before they lock us out.'

But a furious O'Donnell tries to divert the PM's entourage of cars when he receives a call telling him they are almost at the gates.He tells Mandelson: 'Peter, just wait a minute. This is the seat of Government. You are not the Government. You can't use Downing Street for party political purposes.' 

A furious Mandelson, played by Mark Gatiss, says: 'F***ing civil servants. We are going to have to break in.'

O'Donnell is forced, however, to allow the PM through the gates when Mandelson reminds him that Brown is 'actually and not just technically' the Prime Minister. 

But the peer and other senior party aides were forced to enter No10 through the back door of the Cabinet Office – and then found that all their computer passwords had been changed.

Coalition is on Channel 4 on Saturday at 9pm.
