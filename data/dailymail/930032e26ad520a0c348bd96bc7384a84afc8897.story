Nick Clegg was yesterday accused of a betrayal on gambling reminiscent of his U-turn on tuition fees as Liberal Democrats refused to act to curb fixed odds betting machines.

The Deputy Prime Minister had posed for pictures in March alongside campaigners trying to reduce the stakes and payouts on the machines where punters can lose £100 every  20 seconds.

They have been dubbed the crack cocaine of the high street. But last night Mr Clegg and senior Lib Dem colleagues backed a government plan to keep the stakes and payouts of up to £500 the same.

Labour MPs had joined forces with the Stop the FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminals) group and the Campaign for Fairer Gambling to force a vote and urge MPs to throw out the plans.

MPs voted by 322 to 231, a majority of 91, to approve a report by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which claimed there was no need to reduce the current maximum stake from £100.

Campaigners want to reduce the maximum bet on the machines to just £2 in a bid to rein in high stakes gambling in bookmakers, who are allowed four terminals in each shop.

Labour MP Tom Watson, who is campaigning to cut the stakes and prizes, said the behaviour of the Lib Dems was reminiscent of their willingness to be pictured signing a pledge not to increase university tuition fees – only to renege on that promise in government.

The Mail published details yesterday of a report by the Gambling Commission watchdog which showed that profits have risen by approaching 50 per cent over four years on gambling machines in bookmakers.

Bookmakers dispute figures supplied by the Stop the FOBTs campaign that a total of £46billion is gambled on the machines each year. But they admit that the fixed odds machines yield profits of more than £1billion a year.

Last night Dirk Vennix, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, said: ‘Problem gambling in the UK, by international comparisons, is very low. But one problem gambler is one too many for our industry and we are always looking at ways to increase player protection.

‘It’s why we introduced a new code of conduct recently which included a range of new measures to ensure responsible gambling. These include both voluntary limits and mandatory alerts on both time and money spent on a machine.

‘We believe a reduction in the maximum stake to £2 would have very little, if any impact on problem or illegal gambling but would devastate an industry which provides thousands of jobs up and down the country.

‘We remain determined to do all we can to help the Government and society tackle problem gambling. That is why we are devoting a significant amount of time, money and energy into addressing these concerns. We absolutely understand the responsibility on the industry to do everything it can to protect our customers.’

A Culture Department source said the Government would act ‘if there is evidence of harm’.
