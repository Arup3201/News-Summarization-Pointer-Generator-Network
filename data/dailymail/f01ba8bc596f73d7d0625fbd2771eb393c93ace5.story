Until recently, Lorraine Gilling, 47, from Rainham in Kent, was a big fan of Arsenal in more ways than one - tipping the scales at an unhealthy 20st.

Now the devoted football fan has lost half of her body weight after getting stuck in the turnstiles at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.

Embarrassingly, two stewards then had to haul her hefty frame through the narrow entrance in front of jeering supporters.

Lorraine, who had gone to the stadium to watch the rugby Challenge Cup final, was so embarrassed she spent the first half crying in the toilets.

'I didn't think I was going to be able to get through the turnstile,' remembers Lorraine who works as a bookmaker.

'I turned sideways on but I just got stuck and two stewards had to pull my arms and I had to get a push from behind.

'I
was absolutely devastated and I was so embarrassed. It was in front of 
all these teenage boys from the rugby team and their dads.'

The sports fan was so upset by the incident, she decided to give up her treasured season ticket at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, worried she was taking up too much room.

Heavyweight: Lorraine was so embarrassed by the Old Trafford incident, she gave up her season ticket

'I gave up my Arsenal season ticket after 14 years because I didn't want to be seen out and about.

'There were times that I wouldn't go out for a walk because I was scared that if I fell over I wouldn't be able to get back up.

'When I was sitting on the seats at the football I was conscious that I was overhanging and sitting on somebody's lap.'

But despite the humiliation, the incident has proven to be a blessing in disguise for Lorraine, who, determined never to repeat it, went on to lose 10st by swapping unhealthy Chinese food for fruit and yoghurt.

Lorraine, who is divorced, piled on the pounds as a child and got even fatter after developing a penchant for comfort eating as a teenager.

Happier: Lorraine, who won Kent slimmer of the year, is now on the waiting list for a new season ticket

By the time she reached her late 20s, she weighed 21st and needed a walking stick to follow her team around Europe.

But over the last two years, Lorraine, who says her favourite players are Marc Overmars and Thierry Henry, has slimmed from a size 34 dress to a trim size 12.

She was named Kent Slimmer of the Year 2013 and is now taking part in a national competition to be Slimming World's slimmer of the year.

Lorraine has also started going back to see her beloved Arsenal - and is on the waiting list to become a season ticket holder once again.
