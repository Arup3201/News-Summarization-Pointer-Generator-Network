A Texas man has lost his leg after becoming the latest victim of a flesh-eating bacteria that has ravaged at least six other victims across the South East in recent months.

Just days after returning from an annual fishing tournament in Port O'Connor, Keith Korth, 44, found himself in a life-saving surgery that amputated his left leg from just two-inches above the knee.

'It's very fast. This bacteria can go about an inch an
hour,' Dr Luis Ostrosky of UT health and Memorial Hermann told KPRC.

Victim: Keith Korth, 44, is the latest victim of a flesh-eating bacteria that led to the amputation of his left leg

Called necrotizing fasciitis, the bacteria that thrives in
both salt and fresh water can consume its victim’s body from even the smallest of
wounds. According to Dr Ostrosky, that opening can be as minimal as
a paper cut.

'The wading boots rubbed a blister on his foot. Eventually
the water got in there,' Mr Korth's mother-in-law Lynn Reynolds told KHOU.

'He was just unlucky. It could have happened to anybody else. There was people 
in the water just like he was and it just got him,' a friend of Mr Korth told KHOU.

Mr Keith was wearing a brand-new pair of hip-waders causing the footwear to rub.

'I've seen patients where they go on a fishing trip, they go
to sleep and they wake up in the morning and all of their leg is red,' Dr
Ostrosky who is not treating Mr Korth himself said.

'Ninety-nine per cent of the people are not going to get the
fresh eating bacteria ... but when it's happening, you need to be fast,' he
said while advising people to carry an antiseptic with them for such occasions.

Mr Korth's contraction was not the first in the Port
O'Connor area, with a similar incident occurring in 2004. Nor was it the first in the U.S.

Recently a string of contractions have popped up across
the South East, with at least six others requiring amputation after contracting the bacteria - some while in hospital
for child birth or minor surgery.

Growing concern: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) lost her leg, foot 
and both hands while Lana Kuykendall, 36, (right) had just 
given birth to twins before afflicted by the bacteria

Life saving surgery: Paul Bales, (left) had his leg amputated in Georgia after cutting himself in some water while Bobby Vaughn, (right),  also in Georgia had two-pounds of infected flesh removed after cutting himself cutting weeds

The aggressive disease made 
headlines in May when it struck Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student 
from Little Tallapoosa River, who cut her leg when she fell from a 
homemade zip-wire.

Lana Kuykendall, 36, noticed the infection on the back of her 
leg just hours after being released from Emory University Hospital in 
Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins.

Bobby Vaughn, 33, was a third Georgia
victim. He has been upgraded to good condition after doctors removed two
pounds of flesh from his groin. 

He became infected after he cut his thigh while cutting weeds in Cartersville. 

Paul Bales of Lake Sinclair, Georgia became infected after he cut his leg while installing a new dock at the lake on May 1.

was a very small cut that didn’t stop the grandfather playing golf the 
next day but within four days the cut had swelled and he was forced to 
have his leg amputated.

In Tampa, Florida Lisa-Maria Carter contracted the bacteria in surgery when her small bowel was mistakenly sliced, releasing what she said was the naturally occurring bacteria in the body's intestine that can be detrimental when pierced.

She lost her hands and feet and has filed a lawsuit against the hospital.

According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr Korth and the others like him, are extremely rare cases with just less than 1,000 cases reported every year.

'It's just one of those crazy things that happens,' Mr
Keith's neighbour Maxine Schwarze told KPRC.

After speaking with Mr Keith's daughter, Ms Schwarze told
KPRC: 'It sounds like he’s doing better and hopefully they’ve stopped the
bacteria.'

Symptom include redness, heat and intense pain.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
