Italian fashion brand Missoni have confirmed that their autumn/winter 2013 menswear show will go ahead in Milan on Sunday, despite the ongoing search for missing family member, Vittorio Missoni.

The Missoni family said the show would 
give 'continuity to the brand', although fashion industry magazine WWD has reported that no member 
of the Missoni clan will be present.

The brand's executive marketing director and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni, were among six people on board a twin-engine plane that disappeared last Friday morning off the coast of Venezuela.

The 58-year-old, who co-owns Missoni 
with siblings Luca and Angela, was travelling home from a holiday in the
Los Roques archipelago.

The alarm was raised after the plane failed to land as scheduled at Simon Bolivar international airport, 12 miles from Venezuelan capital, Caracas.

Along with the Missoni heir and his wife, four other people are missing, including the couple's friends, businessman Guido Foresti and his wife Elda Scalvenzi, and the two pilots, German Mechan, 72, and Juan Fernandez, 45.

Luca Missoni, the Italian label's creative director and Vittorio's younger brother, is currently in Venezuela helping with the search.

In a recent development, Venezuelan newspaper El Universal reported yesterday that a body had been found floating close to the alleged crash site although authorities later said that the corpse was not that of Vittorio Missoni.

Despite the report, Vittorio's son, Ottavio Jr. is hopeful that his father will be found alive.

'My uncle Luca, in Venezuela, has confirmed that these planes are capable of sea landings in case of emergency,' he told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

'My father will come back; we are waiting for him. I am not speaking with my head, but with my heart. A plane cannot vanish in this way, on a short route, without leaving any trace.'

One the few major fashion houses to remain family-owned, Missoni was founded by Vittorio's parents, ex-Olympian runner Ottavio, 92, and his wife Rosita in 1958, and is famous for its signature zig-zag stripes.

Fans of the brand include the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Moss and Sophia Vergara.
