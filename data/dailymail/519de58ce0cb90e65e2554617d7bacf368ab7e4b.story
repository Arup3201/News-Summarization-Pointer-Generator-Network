Cheat: Dean Ahmed, 49, claimed he needed income support and disability living allowance while earning substantial amounts of money from his properties

A benefits cheat who built up a £1million property empire while claiming to be too ill to work has been jailed.

Dean Ahmed, 49, had a secret luxury property empire while posing as a single, disabled man who deserved state handouts.

While receiving the benefits - income support and disability living allowance - he banked more than £100,000 while also collecting rent from at least ten houses across Europe.

A court heard Ahmed had three houses in Spain and seven in Wales which he rented out.

He was jailed for two years and eight months after the court heard he was also paid disability living allowance for being too ill to get a job.

All the while the illicit property entrepreneur had lived in a plush apartment in Cardiff Bay - and bought another six in the same waterfront area.

Cardiff Crown Court heard he used a false identity to obtain mortgages  and had built up a hidden property portfolio worth close to £1million.

Recorder Paul Hopkins told him: 'You were professional, well-organised and ruthlessly dishonest.'

Ahmed was jailed after admitting 15 charges: four counts of money laundering, three of mortgage fraud and eight of benefit and council tax fraud.

Forensic investigation of his finances found he was 'actively profiting as a property landlord, and had pocketed substantial rental income from his portfolio.'

He he had three luxurious apartments in Murcia, Spain, and regularly transferred large amounts of money to banks in the country.

The financial investigation also uncovered the sale and purchase of properties, many within the Cardiff Bay area, sourced by false mortgage applications.

Chief Inspector Gary Phillips said Ahmed now faced losing his properties after 'amassing a considerable amount of wealth by illegal means.'

He said: 'Our focus now shifts to taking away the wealth and assets he has amassed under Proceeds of Crime legislation.

'The case should also serve as a warning to others who may be involved or tempted to commit these kinds of offences.

'Working together we will find you, and as well as putting you before the courts we will also look to regain every penny which has been obtained by illegal means.'

Russell Harvey, of the DWP Fraud Service, said: 'A small number of criminals view our welfare system as free money there for the taking and we are determined to catch them.

'These benefit thieves cost hardworking taxpayers over £1billion a year and steal funds that should help the most vulnerable.'
