A former hotel manager with a ‘Jekyll and Hyde personality’ strangled his mother after researching the meaning of the word ‘garrotte’ on Wikipedia, a court heard today.

Paul Stones, 38, allegedly killed accounts clerk Marian Stones, 58, as she lay in bed during a weekly argument after they repeatedly rowed about her calling him a ‘failure’ and ‘not a proper dad’.

The divorced father of one moved in with his mother at her home in Sharples, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, after his relationship crumbled and he lost his job following a drink driving conviction.

Investigation: Police at the scene in Sharples, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, in June 2012 where former hotel manager Paul Stones allegedly strangled his mother Marian

But Stones drank white wine and following another row knelt on Mrs Stones and strangled her as she lay in her bed, Manchester Crown Court was told.

The next day he allegedly walked into a police station to tell officers he had killed his mother and gave them the house keys. Mrs Stones was found dead in bed, lying on her back under the duvet.

Stones - who had been on anti-depressants - told police in a statement: ‘Your main relationship is with your mum. When she is nice and treats you like an adult you feel like you are in the top position.

He added: ‘But when she is not nice you feel like you are in the bottom position.’

Stones’s laptop was seized and it was found just three days earlier he had visited Wikipedia and searched for the definition of ‘garrotte’ and used the word in a post on Facebook, the court heard.

John Shorrock QC, prosecuting, said: ‘He said he had been sat watching TV with his mother but said his memories were hazy that evening.

‘He said that he was aware he had argued with his mother but was unable to recall the topic. He states that his mother would argue and she knew what buttons to press.

‘He stated that he recalls being in his mother’s bedroom knelt on top of her holding her down with his hands around her neck. He was asked why and said “I still don’t know”.

‘He did say he realised he did it with his own hands and was having to live with it for the rest of his life and “I want to be punished for it”. The computer had been used to search the word “garrotte”.

‘At about the same time he used this word to post something on Facebook. It is an odd word, “garrotte”. Why was the defendant interested in that word?’

John Shorrock QC, prosecuting

The court heard that Mrs Stones had brought up her son single-handedly after divorcing from her husband in 1977 when he was aged two.

In adult life he was said to have anger management issues with ex-wife Emma Hindsley describing him as having a ‘Jekyll and Hyde personality’.

Mr Shorrock added: ‘She said he would be kind and charming and the loveliest man and other times someone she was scared and frightened of - a man who could lose his temper in drink, kicking doors and pulling wallpaper off.’

The marriage crumbled in 2005 when he allegedly kicked and punched Miss Hindsley during a row when she was in bed.

He started a relationship with another woman Claire Nichols and they had a baby daughter in 2008, but the romance ended when he assaulted her too, it was claimed.

He also lost his job after drink driving and moved in with his mother, the court heard.

Mrs Stones made a 999 call in 2010 reporting that her son had punched her in the face after returning home drunk, the jury was told.

She told the operator she was ‘really scared’ but allegedly did not make a complaint for fear it would jeopardise her relationship with her granddaughter.

Mr Shorrock said: ‘The defendant is a man who has a drink problem. When in drink he becomes aggressive and loses his temper and as a result three people closest to him during that period have been assaulted.’

'I thought I ought to say something. I said I did it - I strangled my mother. I realised what I had done and went to the police. I am totally remorseful and regret what I have done'

Paul Stones

Jurors heard that Mrs Stones could have died from a number of possibilities - including from the use a broad, soft ligature or fabric, a forearm being pressed against the throat, a chokehold or by manual strangulation through a thick fabric like a duvet.

There were also injuries to her nose and eyelid and bruises to her upper arms consistent with restraint.

In police interview, Stones told officers in a statement: ‘I thought I ought to say something. I said I did it - I strangled my mother. I realised what I had done and went to the police.

‘I am totally remorseful and regret what I have done. I confirm I have financial difficulty. My mother was fully aware and helping me with the letter from creditors. I have made all my creditors aware of my intention to become bankrupt.'

In meeting with a psychiatrist, Stones said: ‘She would call me a failure and not a proper dad, she knew how to hurt me but it was water off a duck’s back.’

Stones denies murder. The trial continues.
