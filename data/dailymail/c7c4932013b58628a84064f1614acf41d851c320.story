Walking the dog can be a test of endurance at the best of times.

But Phill and Liz Kirby face an even greater daily challenge taking out their beloved pet - a North American raccoon.

The pair, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, can barely move for the endless interest their unusual companion provokes from those with more ordinary animals.

'Funny looks': Mrs Kirby says that people often stop to ask about Zella in Harrogate, North Yorkshire

Unusual pet: Liz Kirby and Phill Kirby pose with six-month-old Zella, a North American raccoon

Mr Kirby, 44, and Mrs Kirby, 48 - the two have the same
 surname but are not married - bought six-month old Zella over the 
internet to complete their extensive animal collection.

The couple, who used to run a pet shop together, live apart, but Phill often brings Zella round to play with their 20 other pets, including a skunk, an owl and a monkey.

Mrs Kirby, 48, said: 'She's a bit like a dog - she needs to be walked, although we never get very far because we get stopped all the time.

'We get some funny looks and a lot of people ask what on earth is she but normally people think she's really cute.

'She's a bit nervous of strangers but we take her for walks to socialise.

'We took her to Scarborough once and tried to take her to the beach but we couldn't get near the sea because she was stopped by so many people.

Menagerie: Zella is the latest addition to the 20-pet collection that Mr and Mrs Kirby keep between them

'Very loving': Mrs Kirby told how Zella is affectionate to her owners but nervous when out in public

'Some people think she's a dog and others say they want a raccoon of their own but I tell them owning one is hard work.

'It's like having a baby who's just learning to walk. You can't leave ornaments out because she'll knock them all over. She loves shiny things and is very tactile.

'She's very loving and she likes sitting on your knee and having her tummy tickled.'

Mrs Kirby, who has three children to care for as well as the miniature menagerie, added: 'She eats mainly dog food, although she has fruit and veg too.

'She loves chocolate and if she smells it we have to run in to another room. We give her some chocolate as a special treat, but not too often because it's not good for her.

'She loves playing with my Jack Russell Toby and they just run around and play with each other which is good because they both burn off a lot of energy.

'Raccoons are very intelligent animals and she's very clever. She can get into everything, jam jars, drawers.

Popular: Zella draws comment from passers-by wherever she goes

Enterprising: The pair told how Zella can hunts around for food if left unwatched, and can even open jars herself

'You have to have eyes in the back of your head, or she'll be going through your pockets. If you have money in your pocket she'll put her hand in and take it.

'She squeaks, barks, purrs, makes all sort of noises.'

Mr and Mrs Kirby now jointly run a party firm - called Noah's Ark - where they bring their exotic animals to birthday parties and corporate events.

Mrs Kirby lives with 20 pets including a skunk called Pebbles, an owl called Nigel, a monkey called Taboo and a tortoise called Catch-Up.

The collection also includes bearded dragons, geckos, a tarantula, Toby the Jack Russell and three cats.

Urban dweller: Raccoons have thrived in cities across the U.S. and Canada

Raccoons are on average 24 to 38 inches long, and can weigh as much as 23lbs. In the wild the mammals only live for around three years, but can survive until 20 in captivity.

Some experts think the dark â€˜maskâ€™ which covers their eyes may reduce glare from the sun and help them to see at night.

Their five-fingered paw has been likened to a human hand and, as Liz Kirby attests, makes them very capable of getting round the house and into unexpected places.

Raccoons are considered pests in their native USA, and states with large populations have issued advice on how to keep them out of properties.

In urban environments, much like foxes, they can take to rooting through rubbish bags for food. Raccoons can eat almost anything, though their main diet tends to be insects and plantlife.

The first written record of the raccoon comes in a journal entry from pioneer Christopher Columbus.

The species is especially fond of water and swimming, thought it can run as fast as 15 miles per hour on ground.

Raccoons are thought to be intelligent animals, and studies have shown they can remember solutions to tasks for as long as three years.
