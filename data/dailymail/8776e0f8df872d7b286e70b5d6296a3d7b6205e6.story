This is the real face of a pensioner who was beaten to a pulp with a pottery doorstop by a thug in her home.

Jean Taylor, 76, was left unrecognisable after the horrific attack at her house in Totterdown, Bristol, on January 28.

She was repeatedly struck on the head with the cat-shaped doorstop - leaving her with severe cuts, bruises and covered in blood.

Shocking: She was left unrecognisable after the horrific attack at her house in Totterdown, Bristol, on January 28. But the pensioner has now made a remarkable recovery - aided by more than £2,000 worth of donations

The thug then threw rubbish at her as she lay bleeding on the floor, before ransacking her home and fleeing with £100 cash.

A shocking photograph of Ms Taylor's bloodied face hit the headlines when it was released by police last month.

But now, the pensioner has made a remarkable recovery - aided by more than £2,000 worth of donations from friends and neighbours.

And today, the retired teacher, who lives alone, said the 'overwhelming' support had lifted her spirits in the wake of the 'pure evil' attack.

Scene: The assault happened at the retired teacher's home in the Green Street area of Bristol (pictured)

'I am amazed people have raised so much - I am a bit overwhelmed,' said Ms Taylor, who still suffers from headaches and memory loss.

'I have never been given money. The messages I have received have been lovely. I wasn’t expecting it.'

During the attack, the thug knocked on Ms Taylor's door just after 2pm, before making 'pleasant' conversation about her pet cat.

But when the pensioner's back was turned, he pushed her to the floor and repeatedly hit her on the head with a pottery doorstop.

Appeal: This CCTV image has been released by police of a male suspect walking near Ms Taylor's home

Wanted: The man is described as being white, in his late thirties or early forties and of medium build

He then threw rubbish at her and ransacked her home, before escaping with a bundle of cash notes.

Ms Taylor, who walks with a stick, said she seemed to be suffering from 'delayed shock' from the attack - saying: 'I feel worse than I did when it first happened.'

She added: 'It was really vicious what he did. It was his face while he did it - it 
was awful and pure evil. If I close my eyes I can still see him.'

Ms Taylor was taken to hospital following the assault, where stitches and glue were used to treat her numerous head wounds.

Smiling again: Ms Taylor, who worked as a teacher at Keynsham Grammar School for 40 years, said she planned to spend the donations on a washing machine, so that she no longer has to hand wash her clothes

The pensioner also received treatment for bruised ribs and a bruised hand.

Today, Benjamin 
Davies, landlord of local pub The Shakespeare, said: 'Everyone around here was shocked and sickened that someone
 could do something like that to an elderly lady.'

Ms Taylor, who was teacher at Keynsham Grammar School for 40 years, has received £1,900 from former pupils at the school.

She has also been given a further £600 from four local pubs, including The Shakespeare, Star and Dove, The Oxford and The New Found Out.

The pensioner said she planned to spend the money on a washing machine, so that she no longer has to hand wash her clothes.

Avon and Somerset police are still searching for the thug, who is described as being white, in his late thirties or early forties and of medium build.

A CCTV image has been released of a suspect walking near Taylor’s home - and a £3,000 reward is being offered by Crimestoppers.

Police Investigator Paul Hopes said: 'This was a vicious and prolonged assault on an elderly lady in her own home.

'The incident has left her traumatised and she is undergoing  treatment for the injuries to her head.

'I would appeal to people to look at the description we have issued and think about whether they saw or heard anything suspicious in the area around the time  of the incident.

‘If you think you know who  may be responsible, please do the right thing and call us as soon  as possible.’

He added: 'It is very heart-warming to know Jean has such support after going through such a horrible ordeal.'
