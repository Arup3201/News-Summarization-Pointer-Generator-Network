The two American doctors battling the Ebola virus are entering a ‘critical’ phase of their treatment, the head of the charity which sent them to Liberia has revealed.

Bruce Johnson, President of SIM USA, told MailOnline that within the next few days we will know if Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol are likely to survive.

He said that Ebola could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal.

Waiting for an answer: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, is entering a critical stage of her Ebola treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death

Mr Johnson also warned that unless the international community does more to stop what has become the most serious outbreak of Ebola in history then it will spark a ‘tsunami of destruction’ in Africa - and maybe beyond.

Last week Dr Brantly, 33, from Forth Worth, Texas, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects.

Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second.

The condition update will be agonising for both their families - not least Dr Brantly’s wife Amber who is in the US with their two young children.

Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were in Liberia with SIM USA and Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid charity.

Dr Brantly was treating the sick whilst Mrs Writebol was disinfecting medics as they left isolation wards.

Hoping to survive: Dr. Kent Brantly is fighting Ebola to the best of his ability and will know whether or not he'll live sometime in the next few days

Mr Johnson told MailOnline that both were being treated in isolation private houses at the SIM compound near the Liberian capital Monrovia.

Mrs Writebol was still in her home and her husband David has had to move out.

Mr Johnson said he spoke to Dr Brantly on Monday and that he ‘wasn’t as good as he had been’.

He said: ‘The situation is so fluid. One day it’s up, one day it’s down. He was up working on his computer, talking with people this is not a bed ridden situation.

‘He is moving, he is active. He is interactive and we are pleased with that’.

Mrs Writebol is suffering from diarrhea but is talking and in touch with family via her computer on Skype and via email.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Her husband David seems strong. He is handling this with faith but he is also realistic with Nancy and Kent.

‘This is not a light situation. This is a very serious situation but we are encouraged by how they are doing so far.

‘The next few days are critical in assessing the recovery of both of them’.

Days may be numbered: If the doctors reach stage two of the disease blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red

SIM spokesman Palmer Holt said that the coming days are so important because symptoms would start to show that would indicate that the disease had entered its second, more serious phase.

The first stage is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea.

The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body.

Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death.

Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive.

Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control.

He said: ‘Our hearts just break for them’.

So far more than 600 people have been killed in the outbreak across West Africa that has infected more than 1,200.

Liberia has closed its borders to help stop the disease amid fears that it could spread after a patient suffering from Ebola took a flight to Lagos in Nigeria.

Mr Johnson said: ‘What we have here really is the potential for this to become a tsunami of destruction for the country of Liberia and that why we are calling on the international community to now respond.

‘It’s grown to such proportions that it’s overwhelming Samaritan's Purse and SIM and it needs others like the US to help.

‘It’s like a wildfire in the Western US. It’s like what happens to a small fire that continues to grow and no-one is trying to put it out.

‘This is preventable but right now SIM is the only care center for Ebola patients in Liberia and that has to change’.
