It may be a long held dream for many car enthusiasts' to put their foot down and hit top speed in a classic Ferrari.

But here's one motor made by the Italian car manufacturer that's not for the speed freak.

One of the first ever Ferraris ever made, and possibly the slowest, went on sale today with a price tag of £750,000.

Collector's item: This 1950 Ferrari 166 Inter Vignale Coupe has gone on sale for £750,000

Classic: The car is understood to be the 37th car to have left the sports car firm's factory in Italy

Slow: With a top speed of just 105mph and a 140bph engine, this car is not one for the speed freak

One of a kind: The car is the third oldest Ferrari in the UK and the earliest model by the firm for sale anywhere in the world

The 1950 Ferrari 166 Inter Coupe is a one-off model believed to have been the 37th road car to have left the car maker's factory.

The third oldest Ferrari in the UK, the car is sure to appeal to collectors who don't mind shelling out a pretty penny on it.

While it may be a collector's item its engine is more akin to the modern Mondeo as it has a modest 2-litre V12 140bhp engine and a top speed of just 105mph.

It's 0-60mph time is a less than impressive ten seconds.

Built for style not speed: The car has a 2-litre V12 engine and goes from 0-60mph in a less than impressive ten seconds

Beautiful: With its maroon bodywork and beige interior, Talacrest boss John Collins describes the car as a great investment

Traveller: The car has been based in the UK, U.S, France and even Zimbabwe with its most recent owner being a Japanese businessman.

It's being sold by Ascot-based Talacrest, with boss John Collins describing it as a 'great investment'.

The 1950 Ferrari 166 Inter Coupe's specs:

He sold the car in 1998 for £129,000 but the price of classic Ferraris has shot through the roof since then.

He added: 'The design of this coupe was the collaboration of Alfredo Vignale and the up and coming stylist of the time, Giovanni Michelotti.

'Together they made many special bodies for Ferrari and these cars were loved by connoisseurs, as they continue to be to this day.

'This model is unique and unmolested and would be perfect in a museum or in a private collection.

'It is truly lovely and is because of its age it is eligible for all classic car events.'

Ferrari built its first road car, the 125, in 1947 with this model delivered new to Italian Inico Bernabei in September 1950.

Since then it has been based in the UK, U.S, France and even Zimbabwe with its most recent owner being a Japanese businessman.

Compared to Ferrari's F12berlinetta - the most powerful road legal car the Italian manufacturer has produced to date - the 166 Inter Coupe's specs look particularly modest.

The F12berlinetta, part of Ferrari's current collection, has a 6.3-litre 730bhp engine and is capable of reaching speeds of 211mph. The car can get from 0-60mph in just 3.1 seconds.

Place your bid: The car is the oldest Ferrari on sale in the world
