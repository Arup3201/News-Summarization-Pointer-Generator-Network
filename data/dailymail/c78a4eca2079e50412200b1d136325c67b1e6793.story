A free school which has received more than £3million in Government funding has attracted just 11 new pupils this month, it has emerged.

The Leeds Jewish Free School, in the Alwoodley area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, opened with just eight pupils in March and now has less children across two year groups than many secondary schools have in a single class.

It has prompted teaching union officials to question why public money has been put into a scheme 'which is in such low demand' at a time when the city is facing a school places crisis.

Patrick Murphy, the National Union of Teachers branch secretary in Leeds, said: 'It is not just that this is such an awful waste of public money - which I think it is because there is so little demand for it - but it's that this is taking place against the backdrop of a city which is having to work hard to find the resources to create new places and which is facing major shortages in the primary school sector which will work up to secondary schools over time.'

However the school's headteacher Jeremy Dunford said there was a larger cohort of Jewish pupils in the primary school system and said the secondary school expected its numbers to increase 'significantly' over time.

He said that starting any new school was challenging and claimed the free school should not be judged on whether it has achieved value for money over two years but over the next ten years.

He also said that before the free school opened, parents were having to send their children to Manchester in order to receive a Jewish secondary education. He said this was 'unacceptable'.

The Leeds Jewish Free School is situated on the same site as the Jewish Brodetsky Primary School, with Mr Dunford serving as head of both.

The £3.1million expansion and refurbishment of the free school, which saw it fitted with state-of-the-art science labs, a food technology kitchen and a design and technology studio, was completed in March this year.

However, the school's capacity is only for 25 pupils per year meaning it is already almost half full.

The free school, which is situated on the same site but adjacent to Brodetsky Primary School, was given £3m in Government funding which it used to fit state-of-the-art science labs, a food tech kitchen and a design studio

Apart from its religious studies, all of the teaching at the school has been contracted out to another Leeds academy - Rodillian - which sends its teaching staff to the school to deliver subjects in double lessons.

Mr Dunford said this model allowed the school to deliver a full curriculum.

He also said that year groups at Brodetsky Primary were increasing in younger years and he anticipated attracting more pupils to the secondary free school in future.

Currently around 60 per cent of the secondary school's pupils are Jewish.

The Department of Education backed the school and said it was 'perfectly normal' for a new school to take time to establish itself.

A spokesman said: 'Free Schools are a crucial part of our plans to help young people fulfil their potential and succeed in modern Britain. 

'Once fully up and running, Leeds Jewish Free School will deliver 175 high quality secondary school places.

'It is perfectly normal for any type of new school to take time to fully establish itself and we fully expect pupil numbers to grow with the school over time.'
