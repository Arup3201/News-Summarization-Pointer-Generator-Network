A Pittsburgh dog owner was horrified when she received a call from her local PetCo to inform her that her beloved dog was about to undergo anesthesia for wounds she sustained during grooming.

Carissa Luther dropped her dog Lucy off at the Greensburg Petco to have her fur groomed on Thursday afternoon.

A few hours later, she received a call from a veterinarian to tell her that the dog was about to be anesthetized before having two separate injuries stitched up.

Injured: Lucy went for a haircut and came home the following day with 20 stitches

Wounds: Lucy has a nasty gash on her belly and most of the skin on her front leg had to be removed, says Luther

Trainee: Luther says she would have thought twice about leaving her dog at PetCo if she'd known an inexperienced groomer would be handling her dog

'For her to be in such harm and be in so much pain from something like that, I think it's just appalling,' Luther told WTAE.

'For anyone to drop their pet off and get a call they're at the animal hospital, nobody should have to get that call, especially from a groomer,' Luther said.

The small dog had to have 20 stitches on her abdomen and front leg and is on medication for the pain.

More than anything, Luther wants to know just how her dog could have sustained such serious injuries from a simple grooming session.

Angry: Luther says she didn't even know that such serious injuries could be caused by grooming tools

Pain: Lucy had to stay overnight at the vet and is now on pain medication for her injuries

Ongoing: Lucy has to return to the vet for further treatment next week

'The vet said this is one of the worst cases they've ever seen, for this to happen not only on her stomach but to most of the skin to be taken off her front leg, I think is completely ridiculous,' Luther said.

PetCo has accepted responsibility for the injuries Lucy sustained and told WTAE that it was an 'unfortunate incident.'

The company has also committed to paying for Lucy's vet bills.

Luther said staff at the Greensburg PetCo told her the person who injured her dog was a trainee pet groomer.

'I was told yesterday it was somebody who was learning how to do this, which I think should’ve been mentioned to me before I left the dog in their care. Had I known that, maybe I would’ve taken her away if I knew it wasn't a trained professional,' she told WTAE.
