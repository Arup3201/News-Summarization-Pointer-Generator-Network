The clocks have gone back, the weather has turned ... and now we can bring you an exclusive look at the feel-good fest that is the Marks & Spencer Xmas advert so the Christmas excitement can officially start.

Ahead of the seasonal TV campaign which will hit our screens on November 6th the brand has released a sneak preview of this year's offering.

Starring a stellar cast of British talent including Rosie Huntington-Whitely, David Gandy and Helena Bonham Carter, the 2013 ad takes viewers on a spectacular seasonal journey inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is one of the stars of this year's M&S Christmas advert

For the first time the brand is using social media channels to debut its' multimillion pound advert, releasing a teaser on Instagram from Wednesday 30th October, before the full two minute version is available
 on YouTube as well as the M&S website on Monday 4th November.

Set to an enchanting orchestral 
soundtrack, the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers 
into a world of 'magic and sparkle' from Alice in Wonderland to the 
Wizard of Oz.

Rosie 
Huntington-Whitely is - of course - the leading lady, first seen 
pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from 
the real world into a snow dusted enchanted forest, seated at a 
fantastical feast.

The ad 
then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house 
scene, an Arabian Nights flight and finally a walk along the yellow 
brick road, with a little help from the ever handsome David and a 
bewitching Helena Bonham Carter, whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer.

The Daily Mail's Liz Jones - often the High Street's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review when given a peek on Sunday.

She said: 'From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree?

'For
 M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an 
escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash 
registers burst into song.

'This time, I think M&S has done 
its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known 
for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with 
flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon.

'Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce.

'Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, 
unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, 
being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable.

'The
 product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and
 there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar 
truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between 
Rosie and Gandy, super sexy.

'Rosie
 is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label 
lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And 
the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the 
ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy 
indeed.'

The ad, directed by Swedish music video maestro Johan Renck, who has made shorts for Madonna, Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams will be unveiled in full to fashion press at a red carpet screening on Tuesday night.
