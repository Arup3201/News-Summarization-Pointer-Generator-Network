Did Anheuser Busch lift the work of an independent artist to use in its Colorado town-takeover campaign?

They did if you ask the clever mind behind a t-shirt of a Vanilla Ice Ice Cream truck.

At a seemingly similar real life truck, the 90s pop-rapper personally handed out ice cream this past weekend at Bud Lite's Whatever USA pop-up party town in Crested Butte.

Artist Ben Douglass says someone in the Bud Lite marketing campaign swiped his design and hired the 90s star to come help drum up publicity, all without paying him a penny.

Similar? Bud lite's version: Here is Vanilla Ice giving out ice cream at the Bud Lite Vanilla Ice Cream truck in Crested Butte, where Anheuser Busch built a pop-up party town over the weekend

Plagiarism? Here is the graphic artist Ben Douglass says he created for a t-shirt company before the weekend's festivities in Crested Butte

Winners and losers? Revelers packed the town of Crested Butte for WhateverUSA, which was a boon for Anheuser Busch, but Douglass believes he's lost out

On Douglass's t-shirt, a rendering of Vanilla Ice holds a cartoon cone beside a truck emblazoned with the words 'Vanilla Ice Ice Cream.' Beside it floats the original white pop-rapper's head.

On the 'Vanilla Ice Cream Truck' at this past weekend's Whatever USA party, that same head of Vanilla Ice, or one that looks eerily like it, floats on the side of the vehicle.

'It’s pretty clearly exactly what I drew,' Douglass told Fortune. 'I don’t know if it was by accident or what.'

Douglass initially took his frustrations out via social media. 

'No problem,' the graphic designer tweeted bitterly. 'Feel free to steal my work. I'm sure times are tight for @AnheuserBusch #whateverusa'

He maintained his bitter tone in a September 7 Facebook post that has since gone viral.

'Thank you to Bud Light for liking my work (and idea) so much they decided to steal it,' wrote the New Jersey-based artist. 'Why should a little mom and pop company like Anheuser Busch pay artists for their original property?'

Anheuser Busch has since issued a statement on the matter:

'Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light respect the property and creativity of artists, and we’re looking into the situation'

As has Vanilla Ice himself, in his own way.

'Now I see it,' Ice tweeted, presumably in reference to the similarity between t-shirt and truck. 'Looking good.Big pimpin, luv your artwork.'

While Douglass may have months or years of legal battles ahead, things aren't looking all bad for the graphic designer.

'On the bright side Vanilla Ice now follows me on twitter,' Douglass said.

Bright side: Douglass would later complain that he was angry about Bud Lite's alleged uncredited use of his work, but gush that at least it got Vanilla Ice to follow him on Twitter
