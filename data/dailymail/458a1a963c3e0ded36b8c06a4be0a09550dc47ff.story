One of the thugs who killed ten-year-old Damilola Taylor has been sent back to prison for a third time.

Ricky Preddie, 25, has been recalled to custody after police allegedly found a stolen motorbike at his bail hostel.

Preddie served just four years of an eight-year sentence imposed in 2006 after he and his brother Danny stabbed Damilola in the leg with a broken bottle as the schoolboy walked home from a library in Peckham, south London, in November 2000.

Habitual offender: Preddie has already breached his parole terms twice having only served half his 8-year jail term for the manslaughter of Damilola

Last night Damilola’s father Richard, 64, called the justice system an ‘embarrassment’.

He said: ‘Preddie has proved he cannot be rehabilitated. He should now stay in prison.

‘If he had been jailed for life for killing my son in the first place,  we wouldn’t have this prison merry-go-round.

‘What will it take before the 
Probation Service realises he is hooked on a life of crime? I hope they 
act before it is too late.’

Preddie was first released in  
September 2010, but recalled to custody in March 2011 after returning to
 Peckham from his west London bail hostel in breach of his licence 
conditions.

Then in October 2011 he beat up 
another prisoner, but a Parole Board hearing on December 23 decided he 
should be released on January 25, 2012.

He lasted just 16 days before being 
taken back to prison for again violating his parole by going to areas he
 was banned from and visiting friends from his old gang.

He was let out in July 2012, which 
means he has lasted just five months on early release before being 
hauled before the authorities again.

South Western Magistrates’ Court, 
south London, heard on Monday that police found him in possession of a 
red Suzuki motorbike worth £800 that had been stolen in a burglary.

Anger: Damilola's father Richard, 24, says that Preddie should never have been released from prison after what he did to his son

Preddie – who was sporting a bandage 
over his left ear, which had been hacked off in a prison fight – pleaded
 not guilty to handling stolen goods.

He was remanded in custody and will stand trial on February 6.

Police said he was charged with the latest offence in December.

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘The re-release of serious offenders is directed by the Parole Board.

‘They will be subject to controls and if they fail to comply they can be returned to prison.’
