Google today admitted that it had received - and complied with - a record number of requests from governments to reveal information about its users.

The latest edition of the search giant's Transparency Report shows governments around the world made nearly 21,000 requests to access its data in the first six months of 2012.

The U.S. government made the most demands, asking for users' details 7,969 times between January and June this year. The UK came sixth - behind Germany and France - with 1,425 requests.

What does Google know about you? The latest Transparency Report from the search giant showed it had received more requests than ever before to share information about its users with governments

'This is the sixth time we’ve 
released this data, and one trend has become clear: Government 
surveillance is on the rise,' Dorothy Chou, a senior policy analyst for 
Google, said in a blog post.

'In
the first half of 2012, there were 20,938 inquiries from government 
entities around the world. Those requests were for information about 
34,614 accounts.'

In
common with other technology and communications firms, Google is 
regularly asked by courts and government agencies around the world to 
hand over information about its users.

As
well as search histories, it holds data on users' contacts and 
communications through Gmail, viewing preferences on YouTube, photos on 
Picasa, documents stored on Google Drive, and information about authors'
identities on Blogger.

'Government surveillance is on the rise': This graph shows how the number of requests Google has received from governments has steadily increased since it began releasing its bi-annual reports

The 
company has published its Transparency Report twice a year since 2009 
and each time has revealed a steady rise in government demands for data.
In its first report it revealed 12,539 requests.

Google does not always comply with 
demands to reveal user data, and its report also revealed what 
percentage of requests were accepted.

Unsurprisingly, the U.S. again topped this list, with Google complying with 90 per cent of requests from agencies in its home jurisdiction. The company was notably less cooperative with UK authorities, accepting 64 per cent of requests.

Google also revealed a spike in the number of requests by governments to remove content from its services, after this figure remained largely flat from 2009 to 2011.

In the first half of 2012, there were 1,791 requests from government officials around the world to remove 17,746 pieces of content from Google-run services, up from 1,048 requests in the second half of 2011.

Google revealed the number of requests by UK authorities in particular had nearly doubled since its previous report, with many relating to criticism of the police.

The most frequent reason authorities worldwide offered in requests to take down content was that it was defamatory, with privacy and security coming in second, and the catch-all 'other' coming in third.

A spokesman for the company told the 
BBC that the Transparency Report acts as a bellwether for government 
behaviour around the world.

'It
reflects laws on the ground. For example in Turkey there are specific 
laws about defaming public figures whereas in Germany we get requests to
remove neo-Nazi content,' she told the broadcaster.

'And
in Brazil we get a lot of requests to remove content during elections 
because there is a law banning parodies of candidates.'

This pair of bar graphs breaks down the requests to remove content by source and by reason. Defamation was the most popular reason given for content to be removed, followed by privacy and security

Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It should trouble everyone that as the Home Office is trying to justify monitoring all our emails, website visits and social media messages there are hundreds of requests for data every year being refused by Google.

'The existing system is failing to 
provide proper checks on when our personal information is handed over to
the authorities and it is madness to take a bad system and massively 
increase the amount of data being captured without first fixing the 
existing rules and protections.

'Other companies should follow Google’s lead and publish details on the requests they have to establish the true scale of the current surveillance powers.

'It highlights how governments already access data from these companies, making it even more suspicious that they are seeking to make it easier to be able to snoop on us under the current proposals.'

In her blog post commenting on the report, Ms Chou added: 'The information we disclose is only an isolated sliver showing how governments interact with the Internet, since for the most part we don’t know what requests are made of other technology or telecommunications companies.

'But we’re heartened that in the past year, more companies like Dropbox, LinkedIn, Sonic.net and Twitter have begun to share their statistics too.

'Our hope is that over time, more data will bolster public debate about how we can best keep the Internet free and open.'
