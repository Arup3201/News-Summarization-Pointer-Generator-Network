She's more used to the balmy Spanish sunshine but Queen Letizia has proved that she's no slouch when it comes to stylish winter dressing - even if the wind did get the better of her hair.

Dressed in a stylish cherry-red coat, the 42-year-old was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived in German capital Berlin alongside her husband King Felipe, 46.

The Spanish royal couple are beginning a two day tour of the country, where temperatures - in Berlin at least - are currently hovering around a chilly -2 degrees Celsius.

Breezy: The chilly gusts of wind outside the Bellevue Palace got the better of Letizia's hair. She joined her husband King Felipe, 46, in the German capital Berlin for a two day tour of the country

Holding on: Undaunted, the Spanish queen, 42, did her best to keep her coiffed locks in place. The couple have spent much of the past month travelling, with trips to Luxembourg, Belgium and Austria

Wrapped up: She kept warm in a pretty cherry-red coat and a matching wool scarf. In Berlin temperatures are currently hovering around a chilly -2 degrees Celsius

Tour: They were joined for the visit by outgoing Berlin mayor Klaus Woweriet at the Brandenburg Gate

Despite the frosty weather, Letizia was all smiles as she was welcomed by German president Joachim Gauck and his partner Daniela Schadt.

She and King Felipe chatted happily with the couple before being taken into the Bellevue Palace, where Letizia shed her coat to reveal a tailored black jacket and a chic striped pencil skirt.

Later, a visibly cold Letizia and her husband were taken to visit the Brandenburg gate where they were given a guided tour by Berlin mayor, Klaus Wowereit.

The 18th century triumphal arch is one of the best-known landmarks in the German capital and is built on the site of a city gate that once marked the beginning of the road to the town of Brandenburg an der Havel.

After the partition of Germany following the Second World War, the gate was marooned in a section of the no-man's land around the Berlin Wall and became a focus of protests in the run-up to the end of the Soviet Union in 1989.

Wrapped up: All four were well wrapped up but Letizia appeared to be feeling the cold. Since ascending to the Spanish throne in June, the couple have made a point of meeting as many fellow heads-of-state as possible

Despite the cold, the Spanish royal couple appeared to enjoy the experience, listening intently to the mayor's explanations.

The two have spent much of the past month travelling, with trips to Luxembourg, Belgium and Austria all taking up significant portions of their schedule.

In Austria, Letizia even revealed a facility with German, making a speech during a visit to a Vienna art museum partly in the language.

Since ascending to the Spanish throne in June, the couple have made a point of meeting as many fellow heads-of-state as possible, with trips to Morocco and France made just weeks into their reign.

In September, Letizia and Felipe travelled to New York, where Felipe addressed the General Assembly, while Letizia looked on from her perch beside Queen Maxima of the Netherlands.

The pair were reunited a few weeks later when the Spanish royals travelled to The Hague to meet with the Dutch royal couple, Maxima, 43, and Willem-Alexander, 47.
