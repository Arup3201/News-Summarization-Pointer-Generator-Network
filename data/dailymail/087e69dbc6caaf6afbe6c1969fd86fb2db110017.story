Languishing near the bottom of the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund are looking for something to spark their season into life.

But perhaps Jurgen Klopp would be happier with a new signing who could offer a bit more on the pitch than the man his club have offered a job.

The Champions League side took to Facebook to try and entice Robbie Williams to join them, after the pop star claimed he was looking for work in Germany.

Jurgen Klopp's team have been struggling in the Bundesliga, but is Robbie Williams the answer?

Robbie Williams says he is looking to move away from the pop star lifestyle and is looking for work in Germany

Williams claimed he was 'getting a little bit bored of the pop star/rock star thing' and wanted a 'proper job'.

The former Take That star said he 'thought about soccer in Germany, and then I thought no, I'm too old,' before considering fashion or working with cars.

And Dortmund stepped in to offer him all three, posting a picture of the Westfalenstadion underneath his video, and promising a relationship with Puma and Opel.

Borussia Dortmund posted on the pop star's facebook with the offer of the Westfalenstadion as an office

'Robbie Williams, to be honest: We got all of it!' the club wrote. 'If you don't want to play it yourself, at least you're able to watch some intense football in the most beautiful stadium of the world. 

'On the fashion side, we got some nice PUMA jerseys (they come in various sizes) and, since you're obviously into it, some lovely Opel cars. Ultimately, how about this as your office?'
