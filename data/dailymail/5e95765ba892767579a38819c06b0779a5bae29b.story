The Duchess of Cambridge and her cousin Zara Phillips have never been one to rock the boat when it comes to their wardrobe choices.

Despite her style icon status Kate is actually a rather conservative dresser for a woman of her age, while sporty Zara is more at home in jodhpurs and a fleece than a glamorous dress.

This week the two girls and Kate's younger sister Pippa Middleton attended the chilly Cheltenham racing meet in a selection of smart and stylish winter coats from designers including Paul Costelloe and Katherine Hooker. So far, so good (if a little sensible).

But underneath the elegant double-breasted coats style-watchers were horrified to spot one of fashion's biggest fashion faux-pas on display: frumpy brown tights.

Bafflingly each of the women had chosen to finish their various Cheltenham outfits with the chocolate-coloured style no-no.

For most grown women, brown opaque tights are a vague memory associated with bad Brownie outfits, but here are three of the country's most photographed women striding confidently around the Gloucestershire countryside as though cladding your legs in cocoa-coloured 60 deniers is the most normal thing in the world.

31-year-old Kate arrived at the course today with husband William wearing a peachy pink Joseph coat teamed with head-to-toe brown accessories.

Her hat was a £240 Betty Boop style from milliners Lock & Co, the boots a pair of Stuart Weitzman suede knee-highs. Even her gloves and clutch bag matched.

And on Ladies Day yesterday, both Zara and Pippa chose to show off hazel-hued legs underneath their winter coats.

The queen's granddaughter Zara teamed hers with a navy funnel-necked coat, sensible shoes and a khaki-coloured hat by Karen Henriksen.

The 31-year-old's Tom Ford sunglasses were the only nod to current fashion trends.

Meanwhile 29-year-old Pippa set out to dazzle her eligible racing date Tom Kingston in a bespoke bright yellow coat by British designer Katherine Hooker.

But finishing the look with brown tights, brown knee-high boots and a cocoa-coloured Cossack hat gave the overall look an unfortunate 'bananagirl' effect.

In fashion terms, they say that three's a trend, and the 
freezing temperatures at Prestbury Park have meant practical outfits all
round, but will the the royal seal of approval make chestnut hosiery 
appropriate outer wear for the masses?

Nicole Mowbray, editor of the Daily Mail's Life & Style section hopes not. She says: 'You can see how it happened. Sloaney brown boots aren’t an easy shoe to accessorise.

'Black tights look too, well, black; sheer have too much sheen; navy invoke memories of the school librarian… But brown?

'As every style maven knows, brown tights are the least stylish hosiery known to womankind, rendering skinny pins twig-like and leaving larger legs looking similar to tree trunks.

'So what could the royals have worn instead? It’s a tough one, but if the weather is too cold for bare legs (which would be my preference with that footwear), I’d plump for something matt black, preferably with a high denier (so one over 70).

'Kate may have single-handedly (inexplicably) brought flesh-coloured "nude" tights back from the fashion graveyard last year, but she should abandon all hope she’s going to do the same for brown ones.'
