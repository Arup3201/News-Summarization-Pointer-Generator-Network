The manager of a busy restaurant Melbourne's CBD has taken to social media to poke fun of a dining demand that left the staff bewildered.

Nestled in the heart of the city's food district, well-loved eatery Henry and the Fox has experienced a fair share of interesting food requests, but none quite as bizarre as an order for poached eggs, with no yolk- and extra hollandaise sauce, which is made almost purely from yolk.  

'I think that fact may have come as a bit of a surprise to her,' said manager Salla Elkman, who posted a photograph of the 'super weird' receipt on Twitter.

'What!? Poached eggs with no egg yolk..with extra hollandaise sauce. Oh dear!' said the caption. 

'She said she didn't like the taste of egg yolk, which makes no sense, and our chef refused to do it,' Salla said.

'How do you make a poached egg with no egg yolk? It looks disgusting, it's just a white mess on the plate. In the end we made scrambled eggs for her.'

Salla, who has been the manager at Henry and the Fox for two years, said that the order was the first she had thought to post a photo of, despite the many odd food requests the restaurant has received.

'Lots of customers might not realise what hollandaise sauce is made from,' Salla said.

'She was very happy, and left with a smile. The staff just have to smile too, because if we were to list all the weird requests we get, it would be too long,' she said.

'I often wish that there could be a website for hospitality staff to rate customers, instead of the way it is now. Boy, would we have some stories.'  

Stacey, Henry and the Fox's resident barista, said that she can always tell when someone is going to order something odd.

'They've always got a certain look. I can always pick the ones that will ask very specifically for an 'extra hot' coffee,' said Stacey.

'I had one customer who would come in and ask for an extra hot, soy, decaf, latte that was seven-eights full,' she said.

One customer would often come in and ask for butter to be melted into her coffee instead of milk, 'as part of some weird diet,' said Stacey.

Stalla said that the restaurant loves their customers, and that all the staff are very close-knit and enjoy working there

'We have a very good team, which is good because it means we can laugh together when something like this happens'

The restaurant is a fixture in the corporate business district of the city, catering to a wide range of clients from law and accounting firms

'Sometimes it's just items on the menu that people don't understand, like streaky bacon, which is streaked with fat. People would send it back asking for us to cut out the fat,' she said.

'Sometime lunch hour is painful because everyone is on a deadline, they're very busy and expect everything to happen immediately,' she said.

'It's just a very relaxed vibe, we love throwing parties and celebrating with our customers,' she said.
