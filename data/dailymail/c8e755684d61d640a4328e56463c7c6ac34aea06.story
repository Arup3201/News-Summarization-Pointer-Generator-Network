Shamed Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping in October, is finally ready to publicly admit that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his disgraced cycling career.

Armstrong, 41, is reported to have told anti-doping officials that he will make a public admission of guilt in the hope than he can persuade them to restore his eligibility to compete in triathlons, which have replaced cycling as his sporting passion.

For more than a decade, Armstrong has vehemently denied ever doping, even after anti-doping officials laid out their case against him last October in a report which accused him of  running 'the most 
sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport
has ever seen.'

Flying the flag: Armstrong cheated his way to seven Tour de France titles

All Armstrong's results from August 1, 
1998 were expunged from the record books, including his seven 
consecutive Tour de France 'wins' from 1999 to 2005, and the 41-year-old
was banned from cycling for life.

Up
until now Armstrong has refused to cooperate with the investigation and
has consistently denied wrongdoing, but he has been under pressure from
various fronts to confess.

Wealthy
supporters of Livestrong, the charity he founded after surviving 
testicular cancer, have been trying to persuade him to come forward so 
he could clear his conscience and save the organization from further 
damage.

Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong is finally ready to publicly admit that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs

According to The New York Times, Armstrong has been in discussions with the United States Anti-Doping Agency and met the agencyâ€™s chief executive, Travis Tygart, in an effort to mitigate the lifetime ban he received for playing a lead role in doping on his Tour-winning teams.

Armstrong is also seeking to meet with David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Since
quitting cycling, Armstrong has hopes of competing in triathlons and 
running events, but those competitions are often sanctioned by 
organizations that adhere to the World Anti-Doping Code, under which 
Armstrong received his lifetime ban.

Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing although that could be about to change

According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping.

Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation.

In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii. The holiday island has become a regular destination for Armstrong to seek refuge, as he throws himself into training for Ironman Triathlon events.

An Ironman Triathlon consists of a 
2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run, 
raced in that order and without a break. Most Ironman events have a 
strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race.
