Google's Glass could have an unexpected use for soldiers - allowing them to fire 'blind' around corners.

US firm TrackingPoint has revealed a smart rifle that can show a live sight on Google's head mounted display.

It works by sending a live video feed from the rifle's sight to Glass or even an iPad - allowing soldiers to simply point their rifle without needing to be in a position to see their target.

A live video feed from the rifle's sight to Glass or even an iPad - allowing soldiers to simply point their rifle without needing to be in a position to see the sight.

The Precision Guided Firearm (PGF) can even help soldiers aim by take into account wind, elevation and air pressure on the virtual sight.

'When paired with wearable technology, PGFs can provide unprecedented benefits to shooters, such as the ability to shoot around corners, from behind low walls, and from other positions that provide exceptional cover,' the firm said.

'Without PGF technology, such positions would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fire from.'

Through the PGF's ShotView video stream on the HUD, the shooter can easily see such important variables as range to target, shot angle, rifle cant, compass direction, battery life, and zoom setting, all without looking away or diverting their attention.

The live feed can also be sent to other soldiers or commanders to help with aim.

'PGF technology makes use of a bevy of sensors to make highly accurate ballistic calculations, taking into account wind, elevation, pressure, and more in real time,' the firm said.

'TrackingPoint's PGFs enable shooters to lock on and accurately hit moving targets at up to 1200 yards,'

The app, called ShotView, streams video in real time from the Heads Up Display of a TrackingPoint rifle to a smart phone or table, or Glass.

'The technology allows collaboration or mentoring among hunters, communication between guide and hunter, and mentoring and spotting in target shooting applications.'

The smart target target system can even take wind into account automatically
