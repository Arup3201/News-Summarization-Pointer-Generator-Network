Following the incident, Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway, from Scotland Yard's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'This is a very busy part of London frequented by both commuters and those on a night out.

'My team is keen to hear from anyone who was in the area or passing by at the time of this incident and may have witnessed what occurred or seen something that could assist the investigation.

'I would urge all witnesses and anyone with information to contact the incident room on 0208 721 4005 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'

The station, which serves as the central London terminus for South West trains, saw 98.4 million entries and exits from passengers in 2013-14, according to figures from the Office of Rail Regulation.
