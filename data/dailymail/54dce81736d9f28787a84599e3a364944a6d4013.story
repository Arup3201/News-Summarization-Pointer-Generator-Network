The number of stay-at-home mothers is dropping at a rate of 450 a day and is about to fall below two million for the first time, official figures reveal.

The Office for National Statistics said just 2.005million women are full-time mothers, compared to three million in 1993.

Many say they have been forced to return to work by rising household bills at a time when their partner’s wages have been frozen, or have hardly increased, for six years.

A thing of the past: The image of the house-bound housewife was once ingrained on the national consciousness, such as in this 1963 advert. Nowadays the number of stay-at-home mothers is falling rapidly

Meanwhile more women are employed than ever before, the ONS said, with 67.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 64 in a job.

The figures represent an extraordinary social change. When ONS records began in 1971, only half of women worked.

Lynne Burnham, of support group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘More than 80 per cent of parents recently cited financial difficulties as the main factor in pressurising them or their partner to return to work.

‘Current house prices and the high cost of rent are also factors pushing more stay-at-home parents back into the workplace.’

Family expert Jill Kirby said mothers 'would like to have more time for their families'

The way in which the tax system recognises marriage has been the subject of furious debate at Westminster.

A long-awaited tax break for married couples, which comes into force next April, will allow a parent to  transfer £1,000 of their personal tax-free income allowance to their spouse.

Around 3.4million couples are expected to benefit, but it means a saving of only £200 a year, or £3.85 a week. David Cameron, who has promised a tax break for married couples since 2005, says he would like to make it more  substantial if he is re-elected.

Next year, a far more generous perk is being introduced for couples who both work.  Parents will be able to get up to £2,000 per child off annual childcare bills.

More than 14million women aged 16 and over have a job, and that number is growing by around 1,800 every day.

For many higher earning families, the loss of their child benefit in January last year has added to the pressure on women to go back to work. Around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their eligibility for child benefit when the Government changed the rules.

Many mothers opt for self-employment, which allows them to control the hours that they work and to fit them around family life, such as not working during school holidays.

One mother on the Netmums website wrote of the emotional torture of working full-time with very young children. She said: ‘I work full-time and my daughter is in full-time  nursery 8am to 6am. Life is chaotic. I feel incredibly guilty. We spend the weekends not enjoying our time off, but trying to catch up on housework. It is not a life.

‘I get seriously stressed and then worn out and ill. It is horrible, isn’t it? But when you need to earn money to live, it is not possible to be at home.’

Jill Kirby, a family expert and the author of The Price of Parenthood, said recently: ‘The pressure continues to increase for mothers to work to support the family finances. Yet we know from so many surveys and studies that mothers would like to have more time for their families.

‘The Government and the Opposition are totally focused on childcare, but nobody stops to question if this is what women really want.’
