South Sudan's army battled rebel forces on Wednesday in one key town while troops flushed out insurgents in another after its recapture, as the UN moves to double its peacekeeping force to stave off civil war.

Late 
on Tuesday, the UN Security Council voted to send nearly 6,000 extra 
soldiers and police to South Sudan, nearly doubling the UNMISS force to 
12,500 troops and 1,323 civilian police.

But
 UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who requested the reinforcements, warned the 
force ‘will not be able to protect every civilian in need in South 
Sudan’.

The US military 
deployed a ‘platoon-sized’ Marine contingent to neighbouring Uganda, 
while nearly 100 US troops are already on the ground in South Sudan. 
Four were wounded on Saturday when their aircraft was shot at during an 
evacuation operation.

Thousands
 are believed to have been killed in more than a week of violence, with 
reports of bodies piled in mass graves amid escalating battles between 
troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and those backing his rival Riek 
Machar, a former vice president who was sacked in July.

Government
 forces celebrated late Tuesday the recapture of Bor from forces loyal 
to Machar after the army stormed the strategic town, but battles raged 
elsewhere including in Malakal, capital of oil-producing Upper Nile 
state.

Overwhelmed: At least 20,000 people are sheltering at two UN bases in the capital Juba, while 17,000 are taking refuge in the UN base in the rebel-held town of Bor

Information Minister Michael Makwei denied rebel claims that they had seized it.

‘There
 is fighting now in Malakal since morning between the government forces 
and the rebels,’ Makwei told AFP. ‘It is not true that the rebels have 
taken over.’

An AFP 
correspondent who visited Bor on Wednesday said that bodies littered the 
streets and stores were looted, with occasional gun shots still ringing 
out even as civilians poured back into the town to return home.

Fighting
 has spread to half the country's 10 states, the United Nations said, 
with hundreds of thousands fleeing to the countryside and others 
flooding UN bases seeking shelter.

The
 UN humanitarian chief in the country, Toby Lanzer, said on Tuesday there 
was ‘absolutely no doubt in my mind that we're into the thousands’ of 
dead, the first clear indication of the scale of the conflict engulfing 
the world's youngest country.

Earlier,
 UN rights chief Navi Pillay said a mass grave had been found in the 
rebel-held town of Bentiu and cited reports of at least two more in 
Juba.

However, the United Nations mission in South Sudan denied this.

The
 Berlin office of Navi Pillay had said on Tuesday that a grave of 75 
bodies was found in Bentiu, Unity State. Later, the office revised that 
figure to 34 bodies and 75 people feared missing.

The
 U.N. mission in South Sudan said the erroneous report was an inflation 
of a ‘skirmish’ in which 15 people were killed. UNMISS said it is still 
deeply concerned about extrajudicial killings and is investigating those
 reports.

The official toll nationwide has stood at 500 dead for days, but aid workers have said the number killed was likely far higher.

Pope Francis called on Wednesday for ‘social harmony’ and warned the violence was ‘threatening peaceful coexistence’.

Witnesses recount a wave of atrocities, including an orchestrated campaign of mass killings and rape.

‘There
 are now people who are targeting others because of their tribal 
affiliation,’ Kiir said in a Christmas message to the country, where the
 population is roughly divided between Christians, Muslims and 
traditional beliefs. ‘It will only lead to one thing and that is to turn
 this new nation into chaos.’

Government
 forces have also said they are preparing to take back the town of 
Bentiu, capital of South Sudan's most important oil region Unity state, 
now in the hands of a powerful army commander who mutinied last week to 
join Machar.

Oil production,
 which accounts for more than 95 percent of South Sudan's fledgling 
economy, has been dented by the violence, with oil workers evacuated.

Bor's
 recapture, without major resistance by the rebels, lifted a nearly 
week-long seige of the town, where some 17,000 civilians fled into the 
overstretched UN compounds for protection, severely stretching limited 
food and supplies.

‘Most of the rebels who were in the town are on the run,’ Makwei said.

UN
 peacekeepers had spent days bolstering fortifications ahead of the army
 assault, after militia gunmen last week stormed a UN compound in the 
Jonglei outpost of Akobo, killing two Indian soldiers and about 20 
ethnic Dinka civilians sheltering there.

The unrest has taken on an ethnic dimension, pitting Kiir's Dinka tribe against Machar's Nuer.

Machar
 said he was ready to accept Kiir's offer of talks, following days of 
shuttle diplomacy by African nations and calls from Western powers for 
an end to the fighting.

‘We want democratic, free and fair elections. We want Salva Kiir to call it a day,’ Machar said, listing his demands on Tuesday.

Turmoil: The UN said at least 45,000 civilians have sought protection at its badly overstretched bases amid brutal fighting that has spread to half of the nation's 10 states

US
 Secretary of State John Kerry called both men and urged them to ‘accept
 a cessation of hostilities and begin mediated political talks’, the 
State Department said.

South 
Sudan gained independence in July 2011 to become the youngest country in
 the world, born out of a bloody decades-long struggle for independence 
from Sudan. It remains a fragile state with deep ethnic divisions.

Kiir
 has accused Machar of starting the fighting by attempting a coup, while
 Machar says the president has exploited tensions within the army to 
carry out a purge.
