This adorable video shows the moment a playful pooch literally had his tail between his legs when his owner confronted him over her chewed up glasses.

After a few days and countless searches for her missing glasses, dog-owner Stephanie Lynn decided to check her back garden.

She found the two plastic arms from the frame of her spectacles hiding in the grass, which would surprise most people.

But not Stephanie, because one of her dogs, Rooney, has a habit for eating bizarre household items.

Did you do this? Rooney the dog realises he is in trouble when he is confronted by Stephanie with her broken glasses, which she found in the garden

I didn't do it: Rooney tries to back away as his owner asks him whether he ruined her glasses

In the past Rooney has eaten a sofa, a recliner and a pile of wood, but he has a particular taste for plastic.

In the video, Stephanie calls out Rooney's name and he comes bounding over with another dog.

But when she holds up the remnants of her reading glasses, he turns back and walks away, casting a sheepish look back at his owner. 

Stephanie asks: 'Did you do this?', as Rooney backs away with his tail literally between his legs.

Tail between his legs: The glasses are not the first household item Rooney has eaten. He has nibbled a couch, a recliner and a pile of wood, but he has a particular taste for plastic.

Scooby snack: The dog braces himself for a telling off, but Stephanie seems to find the situation funny

Sorry: Rooney looks apologetic and ashamed with himself after slinking back to his bed in his cage

Luckily for the dog, whose tail is still wagging despite being in trouble, his owner seems to find the situation funny.

Rooney slinks off to his bed in his cage and sits down, looking very sorry for himself.

Stephanie then laughs as her dog gives her his best puppy eyes.

'I'll take that as a yes,' she adds.
