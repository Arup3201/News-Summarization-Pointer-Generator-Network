Newcastle were rewarded with a trip to Tottenham after dumping out Premier League champions Manchester City on Wednesday night - but Bournemouth nicked the tie of the round. 

Alan Pardew's side found themselves in the quarter-final hat after Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko's goals either side of half-time stunned City. 

And they will travel to north London - the scene of their Premier League win on Sunday. Eddie Howe's Bournemouth have a glamorous tie to look forward to as Liverpool travel to the south coast.

Sheffield United vs Southampton

The pair are familiarly foes having faced off in last year's FA Cup, while Derby - who thrashed Fulham at Craven Cottage on Tuesday - will welcome Chelsea to the Midlands. 

Steve McClaren's Rams top the second tier with many tipping them for promotion to the Premier League this season.  

Meanwhile, the Graziano Pelle-inspired Southampton - off the back of their last-gasp win at Stoke - will travel to Bramall Lane to play League One Sheffield United.

The ties will take place the week commencing December 15.
