England slumped to their fifth successive defeat against the All Blacks and a fourth in five months. Amid a monsoon at Twickenham, this was a demoralising wash-out for Stuart Lancaster’s national team.

Following a summer tour of near-misses in New Zealand, this was a step back. The result was entirely justified. While a late penalty-try ensured respectability on the scoreboard, this QBE series opener became a grim mis-match after half-time. England simply ceased to exist as an attacking force, until the horse had bolted.

The world champions took an iron grip on proceedings and displayed all their experience and nous. Steve Hansen’s men played the conditions far more shrewdly as England floundered deep in their own half. There was all the usual white-shirted courage and endeavour, but when it came to clever decision-making and composure under pressure, they were exposed and out-classed.

This was not the outcome or the performance Lancaster and his assistants would have wanted to ignite their autumn campaign and their long-range countdown to the World Cup. 

They will have to quickly lick their wounds and prepare for a daunting clash with the mighty Springboks next Saturday. 

The management will be desperate to avert the dreaded prospect of another defeat, meaning the wait to generate precious winning momentum goes on.

In the build-up to this match, much had been made of the fact that the All Blacks had been together for months and would thus come to Twickenham armed with momentum and cohesion. Yet, it was England – in action for the first time in five months – who exploded into life at the start of this Test.

Within four minutes, the hosts were ahead and their opening score was a wondrous try. The ball came to Brad Barritt in midfield and the Saracens centre’s superbly-judged pass released Jonny May at full throttle. 

He surged past Conrad Smith and then backed his pace to burst along the left wing, outside a diving Israel Dagg, to race over in the corner.

It was a blistering strike which raised the roof. Although Owen Farrell missed the wide conversion, England were up and running – in every sense – and they so nearly extended their lead just three minutes later. 

A box-kick by Danny Care into the New Zealand 22 bounced up awkwardly and May won the leap to claim the ball, but he was just unable to off-load to Farrell who was alongside in support, with the line clear in front of him.

Lancaster’s team kept coming, storming forwards in waves of bold intent. They should have had a second try in the 10th minute when Kyle Eastmond’s audacious, flat, cut-out pass picked out Mike Brown on the overlap on the right, but the full back fumbled.

It was a costly error, as the All Blacks were soon on terms. Ben Smith brilliantly re-gathered Aaron Cruden’s high kick near halfway and the visitors pounded deep into enemy territory. 

Julian Savea broke through Care’s tackle then the ball was shipped across to the right and the imposing Jerome Kaino smashed his way past Courtney Lawes in the 22.

From the ruck, Aaron Smith’s short pass sent Cruden lunging for the line and referee Nigel Owens awarded the try, even though replays suggested there was some doubt about the legitimacy of the try. Cruden missed the conversion and the scores were level.

The initial drama gave way to a relative lull, as England used their rolling maul to telling effect and two Farrell penalties re-established their advantage before Cruden struck back at the other end to make it 11-8. The kicking duel continued as Farrell missed a drop-goal shot six minutes before the break, but after Cruden briefly levelled the contest at 11-11, England’s No 10 struck his third penalty to send his side in 14-11 up at the break.

Yet, home rule was short-lived after half-time. A 43rd-minute Cruden penalty attempt hit the post, but the Kiwis were cranking up the tempo and intensity, and they took the lead six minutes into the second half. 

They were building steadily on the left when England’s debutant lock, George Kruis – on for Lawes – raced out of the defensive line but failed to make his tackle and the space he left behind was clinically exploited. Owen Franks rumbled forward and quick ball to the left allowed Richie McCaw to score from Dagg’s pass, even though he had to take the ball behind him before scoring.

Cruden couldn’t add the extras from an awkward angle, but the world champions were firmly in the ascendancy and England were reeling. Eastmond had a kick charged down and Semesa Rokoduguni had to scramble back to cover. 

At the ruck, Sam Whitelock tried to stretch through to ground the loose ball over the line, but he was judged to have knocked on. Seconds later, a scuffle in the corner led to New Zealand hooker Dane Coles being sin-binned for kicking out after having his shirt pulled.

The numerical advantage presented England with a prime opportunity to hit back, but they squandered the 10-minute window – striving to attack from deep in a haphazard fashion, in deteriorating conditions, while their rivals played a smart territorial game to keep their noses in front.

Beauden Barrett missed a penalty shot in the 64th minute but the Kiwis just kept up the onslaught. Sonny Bill Williams stormed clear into the 22 but ignored team-mates in support and was tackled short. However, the All Blacks won another penalty and Barrett struck it to increase the lead to five points.

As the rain became torrential, England were washed away. New Zealand struck again eight minutes from time as a patient assault through countless precise phases culminated in Charlie Faumuina burrowing over. The home side rallied in the closing moments to snatch a penalty try from a strong scrum – which George Ford converted with a drop kick – but it was too little, too late.
