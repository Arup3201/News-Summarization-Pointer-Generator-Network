Rihanna’s video for her new single ‘Pour It Up’ hasn’t even been released yet and it’s already causing a stir.

The singer had been sharing behind the scenes footage with her legions of fans, and now an audition tape from a pole dancer who eventually featured in the video has gone viral.

The clip of Nicole ‘the pole’ Williams, a legendary dancer, was posted on Rihanna’s YouTube account just three days ago and has already been viewed over one million times.

The video of Nicole 'the pole' Williams showing off her amazing skill has taken off online

Some of the positions held by Nicole in the video are truly spectacular, here she balances upside down with her feet flat on the ceiling, using just the strength of her legs

As Nicole effortlessly flings herself up and down the poll to the Pour It Up track, appreciative onlookers can be heard whooping.

And you can understand why: the dancer performs moves that seem to almost defy gravity. The strength needed to hold herself perpendicular to the pole, or to seemingly sit on the ceiling is mind-boggling.

But despite the power needed to perform these incredible aerial acrobatics, Nicole is tiny, both in height and frame.

Shots of the audition are spliced with shots of Nicole filming for the actual music video.

It was, in fact, Nicole ‘the pole’ who gave Rihanna lessons in preparation for the video.

Despite her sexy demeanor, Nicole says the performance side of pole dancing was not something that came easily to her

Rihanna
was clearly proud of what she manage to achieve in the lesson, posting 
pictures on Instagram of herself posing in silhouette against a smoky 
green background while Nicole can be seen by her side giving her 
pointers.

Nicole, who 
runs her own pole dancing and fitness centre Allure in Los Angeles, pioneered pole dancing as a fitness trend - branding the pole 
the ‘new dumbbell.’

The
personal trainer is passionate about her skill, but admits that while 
the athleticism needed came easily to her, the sexy performing side was 
something she had to work at.

'Sexy movement was not something I actually felt comfortable doing. I had to teach myself how to relax, slow down, feel my body and be graceful,’ she says.

'Pole dancing is a powerful movement and I absolutely love how empowered and confident my clients feel after their first class,' Nicole says on her website.

'Pole Dancing is no longer a hidden art form. We're taking it out of the strip clubs and bringing it to the average woman in a classier, sexier, and intimate environment where any woman can feel comfortable with herself.'

Rihanna slid and sashayed on the pole wearing snapback, stilettos, and plunging leotard, while Nicole looks on giving advice in preparation for the Pour It Up video
