Cronyism row: Former Labour MP James Purnell has hired Godric Smith, a former Balir spin chief, to the BBC

The BBC was accused of ‘stuffing its senior ranks with ex-Blairites’ yesterday after it hired one of the former prime minister’s spin chiefs as a key PR adviser.

Godric Smith – Tony Blair’s official spokesman between 2001 and 2004 – was handed a contract thought to be worth at least £100,000 by former Labour minister James Purnell, who himself joined the BBC in February.

The latest appointment reignited concerns over the corporation’s links with the Left leaving it open to charges of political ‘cronyism’ and prompting one Tory MP to brand the BBC the ‘Blairite Broadcasting Corporation’.

Mr Smith’s public relations agency Inc – only founded in April – has been hired  to ‘provide external perspective and expertise’ to the BBC’s own communications team.

The deal was signed off by the corporation’s new strategy chief Mr Purnell, a government whip under Mr Blair before becoming culture secretary and then work and pensions secretary.

Former Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz was also appointed editor of Newsnight in May.

Last night MPs warned that Blairites are ‘very rapidly infiltrating’ the BBC and criticised the corporation for failing to run an open recruitment process.

It is also believed Mr Smith’s agency, Incorporated London, was hired without a formal tender.

In February, the BBC came under fire for handing Mr Purnell his £295,000 job without interviewing any other candidates. Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, warned the new appointments would exacerbate political bias.

He said: ‘The BBC is indulging in Blairite cronyism. Lord Hall [director general] has recruited his New Labour friends and they are recruiting their New Labour friends. The BBC is biased enough as it is.

Now it is becoming the Blairite Broadcasting Corporation. It’s a joke. The only problem is it’s not funny.’

John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the same Commons committee, said Mr Smith’s contract ‘looks like another old pal appointment’, adding: ‘When there have already been concerns expressed about the left-wing leanings of the BBC, I do think this appointment certainly adds to the impression that the BBC is staffed by a centre left, Blairite clique.

‘It was an unwise appointment for the BBC to make.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson added: ‘It is deeply worrying the BBC is stuffing its senior ranks with ex Blairites and Labour sympathisers.’

Although Mr Smith was a civil servant rather than a Labour Party employee, he was a key figure in Downing Street during Mr Blair’s time in office. After succeeding Alastair Campbell as the PM’s official spokesman, he became head of strategic communications.

His appointment follows a string of recent top jobs for left-wing officials at the BBC. When Mr Purnell was appointed in February, critics said it was ‘unprecedented’ to hand such a job to a partisan figure.

A BBC spokesman insisted that  the contract to Mr Smith’s agency complied with its own guidelines.

He added: ‘The BBC has appointed Inc to provide external perspective and expertise on a number of marketing and communications projects. This is a vital part of the way in which the BBC manages its reputation.’
