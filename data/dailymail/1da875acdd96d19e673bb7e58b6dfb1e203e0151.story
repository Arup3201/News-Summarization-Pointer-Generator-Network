Many of us have been forced to tighten our belts in recent times.

And it seems the squeeze has finally become too much even for David Cameron.

Speculation that fresh cuts have been implemented in the prime ministerial wardrobe emerged after a tailor whose bespoke suits cost around £2,000 was photographed entering No10.

Geoffrey Golding, 70, whose customers also include the Duke of York, had an 8am appointment and was seen entering with a tape measure around his neck and a suit bag draped over one arm.

Mr Cameron announced he was on a post-Christmas diet sparking speculation that Mr Golding had been called in to alter the waistline of the PM'S suits

Later the same day Mr Cameron announced he had given up bread and snacks as part of ‘a great patriotic struggle’ to lose weight, prompting speculation that Mr Golding had been called in to alter the waistline of the Prime Minister’s suits. The tailor, the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants who settled in the East End of London, opened his first shop in St Albans, Hertfordshire, at the age of 19 in 1963.

His workshop was awarded the Queen’s Royal Warrant for services to the Royal Household in 2001. Prince Andrew has been a customer for two decades and Mr Golding has fitted diplomats, military officers and business leaders.

His presence at No10 also sheds new light on Mr Cameron’s preferred outfitters.

It was previously known that he wears suits from the Savile Row tailor Richard James, which can cost up to £3,500.

In contrast, Ed Miliband reportedly favours ready-to-wear suits from British tailor Hackett, which cost around £600, while Nick Clegg sports suits from designer Paul Smith, with prices starting at £615.

Yesterday, Mr Golding was unavailable to comment about his visit to No10 on Tuesday.

Later that day Mr Cameron told BBC Radio Sussex of his battle with the post-Christmas bulge.

He said: ‘I’m trying hard. It is a great patriotic struggle. It is difficult when you’re on the road a lot.

‘My downfall is, when you get hungry in the middle of the day, having a snack. I think that’s the thing you’ve got to cut out, isn’t it.

‘I’m giving up bread. Bread’s off at the moment. Cut the carbs and go for a run.

‘It worked before, maybe it will work again, who knows.’
