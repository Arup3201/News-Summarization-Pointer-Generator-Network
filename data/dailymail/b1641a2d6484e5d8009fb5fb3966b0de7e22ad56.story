Assault: Rolands Brize, pictured, tried to rape the unnamed 24-year-old. She was left with scars

The victim of a brutal sex attack has been refused NHS funding for ‘cosmetic’ treatment of her injuries.

The decision comes less than a year after an aspiring glamour model revealed her cosmetic breast enlargement had been paid for by the National Health Service.

A 24-year-old graphic designer was walking home from a nightclub in Hull when she was followed by a stranger, dragged under a bridge and assaulted.

She managed to make a brief 999 call and police sent to the location found the man attempting to rape her.

The terrified woman, who cannot be identified, suffered bruising and grazes to her legs, knees and back in the attack last March, which left her needing hospital treatment. She still has painful purple scars on her knees and marks on her ankles.

She remains traumatised by her ordeal but was told that treatment to remove the scars – a permanent reminder of the assault – cannot be funded by the NHS because they are ‘cosmetic’.

There were no such qualms about paying the £4,800 bill for Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, to have a breast enlargement operation.

Funding was recommended by her GP after she complained she had been bullied since her teenage years for having a flat chest.

Miss Cunningham, an unmarried mother-of-two, was condemned when she showed off her figure in downmarket newspapers in the hope of launching a modelling career. She later said she wanted the NHS to pay for a reduction and even threatened to sue the Health Service for making her breasts too big.

The funding decision caused outrage, particularly as NHS guidelines state that cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect a person’s health’.

A sex assault victim's injuries weren't treated on the NHS because they are 'cosmetic'. But Josie Cunningham, pictured, won funding for breast implants last year. She has since said she regretted billing the NHS

Similarly, there are a range of methods to reduce or remove scars – including laser treatment – which are not widely available on the NHS as they are regarded as purely ‘cosmetic’.

The sex assault victim has been given steroid cream for the scarring on her legs, back and hands, but said yesterday she would like to have laser treatment to remove them. However, her GP told her there was little chance of approval.

Priorities? Josie Cunningham, pictured, had the operation last year. She now wants to pay for a reduction

Months have passed, nothing has been done and no NHS laser treatment offered, but she is yet to be told her application has been formally rejected.

She asked: ‘Why can people have boob jobs on the NHS?

‘Fair enough if I had fallen over, but I had no control over what happened to me. It frustrates me when I see people getting surgery through the NHS when they don’t really need it.’

To make matters worse for the  24-year-old, her Latvian attacker is costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds while he awaits sentence, receiving the best psychiatric care in a £500-a-day private hospital.

Rolands Brize, 25, pleaded guilty last April to attempted rape. He is currently being assessed by psychiatrists and has appeared in court 11 times.

When he is next up before the judge, the bill for his treatment, legal and prison costs will have reached an estimated £90,000.

Speaking after the latest hearing at Hull Crown Court, his victim said: ‘There is all this fuss about his care and how much it is costing, but what about my care? I have to see my injuries every day, yet my surgery is considered cosmetic. It is appalling that I get left behind.’

Her attacker is spending 12 weeks in Chadwick Lodge, a secure psychiatric hospital in Buckinghamshire owned by the Priory Group. It is reported to cost around £500 a day, though the company will not discuss fees charged to local authorities.

The victim said she never goes out any more, adding: ‘I am not the same as I used to be.’

But the scars will not be treated on the NHS because they are 'cosmetic'

Yet funding for similarly 'cosmetic' treatment - 36DD breast implants - was approved last year for Josie Cunningham from Leeds to 'boost confidence'
