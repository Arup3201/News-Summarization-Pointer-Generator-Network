An outspoken, liberal multimillionaire congressman from Florida believes his 24-year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife 'committed bigamy'.

Rep. Alan Grayson, 56, whose pretrial hearing was likened to an episode of the Netflix drama 'House of Cards', is set to make claims in court on Monday that his wife, Lolita, was still married  when they wedded in Virginia in 1990.

The outspoken liberal gained national attention during the debates over health care reform when he said the Republicans' opposing plan was 'don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.'

Alan, a Democrat and highly successful trial lawyer, said his wife's marriage to Robert Carson was not dissolved until 1994 in Broward County, Florida.

However, she claims she divorced Carson in Guam in 1981, and she also disputes that she was divorced in Broward County.

If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita  alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers.

Besides bigamy, the divorce has featured mutual allegations of battery, accusations by Lolita of financial abandonment by the congressman and a trial delay caused by her leaking breast implants.

Last year, it was reported that Lolita was approved for public assistance by the state of Florida to help feed her four minor children that she has with Alan, according to WFTV.

It was shortly after he was named the 17th richest man in Congress.

Lolita has claimed she is not the 'Lolita B. Carson' cited in a dissolution of marriage final judgment that Alan said is proof that she was still married to Carson when they wed. Neither side has found Carson. 

During a recent pretrial hearing, when attorneys were arguing over who had access to the couple's financial documents, Circuit Judge Bob LeBlanc likened the scenario to the well-known Netflix political drama.

He said: 'This is starting to sound like 'House of Cards".'

If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers (above 2005 picture of Alan Grayson with his daughter, center,  Lolita, right, and John Edwards, left)

Attorneys at the hearing suggested that politics, in part, may be preventing any effort to reach a quiet, confidential settlement that the judge hinted is the best option for the Graysons, who are the parents of five children.

'When lies are told about you and you're in the media, your detractors are going to use it and use it forever more. You have to neutralize that and the only way to do that is to get the truth out,' said Mark NeJame, one of Alan's attorneys.

When the judge said that both sides had 'calmed down' from the initial acrimony of last year's divorce filing, NeJame shot back, 'except the Republican Party.'

Lolita' attorney, Mark Longell, said the congressman was going to 'drag her through the mud' so that he does not look bad.

Longwell, who only got the case within the past month, is her third attorney. 

He requested a trial delay so he could have more time to prepare, and the judge will consider another delay Monday. 

The trial will move ahead if the judge decides against it.
