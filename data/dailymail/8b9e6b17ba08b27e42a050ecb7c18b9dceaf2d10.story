The most common surnames in Sydney have been revealed, and thanks to modern Australia's European origins the English name Smith still reigns.

Lee, with both western and Asian origins was the second most prevalent, as it is common as an English, Chinese or Korean surname.

Popular Vietnamese family name Nguyen, which also has roots as a Chinese name, rounded out the top three. Last year Nguyen was the 13th most popular in Australia.

Smith has been ranked the most common surname in Sydney, a name Dick Smith shares with thousands of Australians

The ranking came from an analysis of the new White Pages directory, but social demographer Mark McCrindle told The Sunday Telegraph within a few decades Smith will have been toppled as the top surname.

Sydney's rich multiculturalism is on display in the list, with Korean name Kim coming in fourth and Chen, Li and Wang making up the final three places in the top ten.

Surnames such as Jones which ranked fifth, Williams in sixth, and seventh most popular Brown, are also among the most popular family names nation-wide.

Mr McCrindle told the publication the trends emerging in Sydney often give an insight into the way the rest of Australia is headed.

'You really get a heads up on the trends by looking at the White Pages in Sydney... It really follows the patterns of settlement and Sydney is the gateway to Australia,' he said.

The demographer also revealed that an insight into what were previously the most popular names in Australia could be found by opening a White Pages directory from a regional area.

Last year, Australia's most popular names were Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Wilson, Taylor, Lee, Johnson, Anderson and White.
