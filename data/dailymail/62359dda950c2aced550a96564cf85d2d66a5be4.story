A man who shook his two-year-old stepdaughter so violently she fell into a coma and died, has been charged with her murder. 

David Adams, 25, had been charged with assault and child endangerment in November after acknowledging having shaken Thaiya Spruill-Smith, according to the authorities.

He had recently been released from prison after four when his family posted a bail bond but he was rearrested on Wednesday after the Brooklyn district attorney upgraded the charges against him, according to the New York Times. 

Yesterday he appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on a charge of second-degree murder. He hung his head during his 15 minute appearance.

Assistant district attorney Frank DeGaetano said in court: 'He shook her several times.

Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Stepfather David Adams, 25, has now been charged with her murder

'He made her hit her head. She had multiple abrasions and contusions, 17 on her head, and she had damage to the axons and neurons in her brain consistent with massive brain damage.'

Thaiya had been declared brain-dead in November after Adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain, retinal hemorrhaging and bruises.  

The incident leading to Thaiya's death occurred on November 12 when her mum Teoka Spruill left her Brooklyn apartment for about an hour, leaving Thaiya with Adams.

According to a criminal complaint, Adams told police he held Thaiya off the ground, causing her head 'to rotate forward and back rapidly several times,' and the girl's body then went limp. 

He again shook her, so hard her head swiveled again several times, and then her body went rigid.

Thaiya was asleep when Ms Spruill returned, she said, and the child woke once during the night to ask for juice.

Ms Spruill called an ambulance next morning when she heard Thaiya struggling for breath.

The youngster was rushed to Brookdale Hospital shortly before 7am and despite numerous operations, doctors concluded her injuries were too severe to overcome and she was eventually taken off life support.

It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of Adams that was investigated by New York City social services.

Ms Spruill and Thaiya's father Terrell Smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident.  

A judge ordered Brookdale  to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl's parents resolved their dispute.

'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. 

Thaiya's father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband

'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.'

Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' 

As organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members, it was eventually ruled Thaiya's organs would not be donated.

The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. 

Relatives made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl at the time of Adams' first appearance in court.

'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable.

'She was very smart - very, very smart.'

According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned.

And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. 

At his first appearance Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died.

'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. 

Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse.

She was returned and the case was dropped, he said.

The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions.
