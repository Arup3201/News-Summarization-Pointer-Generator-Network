Felix Magath claims he is the only man to lead Fulham back to the Premier League, despite seeing his winless start in the Championship extend to five games.

The German manager was met with cries of ‘out, out, out’ at the final whistle as Kenywne Jones levelled for Cardiff after Tim Hoogland had given Fulham the lead in the first half.

But Magath, whose side are second from bottom, remained defiant and still believes he is the right man for Fulham.

‘It is a difficult situation and I understand the fans who are afraid,’ Magath said. ‘Last season we were relegated and this season we are towards the bottom. I am not glad about it, but we have made changes and it was necessary for the club.

‘I have a lot of young players in the team and I know that is a problem and I live with this problem.

‘But don’t just look at the results, look at what I have done for the club. I have taken six players out of the academy.

‘I am trying to bring the players from the academy to the Premier League, I am the right man to do it. No one else. I am not the Special One, I am the only one.’

Fulham put in their best performance of the season in the opening 45 minutes and took the lead midway through the first half.

Big-money signing Ross McCormack combined with Scott Parker and crossed for Hoogland, whose glancing header flew past David Marshall. Fulham were in the ascendancy after the goal and had two good chances to extend their lead from free kicks through Dutch midfielder Chris David — but he over-hit both of them.

Magath added: ‘It was a very good first half, it was the best performance of the season. I was disappointed not to score more goals. We played well and had chances. But it happens all the time, you can be playing well but if you not scoring then you concede a goal then they sat back and made it very difficult.’

Fulham were made to pay for their missed chances early in the second half when Jones fired Cardiff level.

Peter Wittingham launched a long ball to Jones, who played a neat one-two with Mats Daehli before beating the offside trap and firing past Marcus Bettinelli.

Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was pleased with his side’s second-half performance and believed they deserved to leave London with a point.

‘We had to move quicker and bring more enthusiasm in our play and move the ball faster,’ said the Cardiff manager, whose side sit ninth in the table.

‘Fulham played well in the first half and deserved to be in front, but I felt we earned our point in the second half.’
