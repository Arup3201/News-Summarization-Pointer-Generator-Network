This is the chilling moment a teenager was caught on CCTV following a rising music star from a nightclub just seconds before stabbing him to death in a row over a girl.

Armani Mitchell, 18, became enraged after he saw Joshua Ribera, 18, at a memorial with his arms around Rudie Lee, the mother of his 17-month-old daughter.

The two can then be seen arguing inside a nightclub before up-and-coming grime artist 
Joshua is caught on camera leaving on his own at 10.41pm.

Just
 seconds later, Mitchell strides out purposefully and follows his love rival across the car park.

He then pulled out a four-inch flick knife and plunged it into Joshua's chest - piercing his heart - before sprinting 
away.

A court heard as the teenager lay dying, he managed to whisper 'Switch' - the 
nickname of his attacker - to paramedics who were treating him.

Shouting
 broke out in court as Judge William Davis QC convicted Mitchell of murder - prompting two members of the public gallery to be arrested on suspicion of 
contempt of court.

Sentencing Mitchell a 
minimum of 18 years, Judge Davis QC told him: 'You did not 
intend to kill Joshua Ribera.

'Whatever it was that caused you to quarrel that night had built up over a matter of minutes.

'Neither of you had intended really serious harm to each other until the fatal moment.

'I
 accept there was a lack of premeditation. Before you used the knife you
 had already been struck once by Joshua Ribera in an earlier incident.

Finally, CCTV captured Mitchell (circled foreground) following Joshua into the carpark (circled far right) where he was fatally stabbed

'Immediately before you used it you were struck by him again.

'Your
 criminal activity really only lasted for about 30 seconds, from the 
time it took to leave the club, when you took out the knife to the 
moment that you used it.'

The pair had both been paying their respects to 16-year-old Kyle Sheehan - who was stabbed to death in 2012 - at a memorial service on September 20 last year.

But an argument between the teenagers escalated throughout the night which led to Mitchell threatening Joshua saying 'Do you want me to wet you up?' - a street term for stabbing.

He was then ejected by security staff but CCTV shows him returning to the TC's nightclub in Selly Oak, Birmingham 15 minutes later wearing a different set of clothes.

After the attack, Joshua was taken to the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery but he died in the early hours of September 21.

Mitchell, of Birmingham, handed himself in to police later that day and admitting attacking Joshua but claimed he had never intended to kill him.

He pleaded not guilty to murder but was found guilty on Thursday following a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Tragic: Tributes were paid to 'kind-hearted' Joshua Ribera, 18 (left). Armani Mitchell, also 18, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, a minimum of 18 years, at Birmingham Crown Court

Detective Inspector Gary Plant, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Joshua Ribera needlessly lost his life, he was just 18 years of age and had a very promising future in the music industry, he had everything to live for'

During the trial, the court heard the two had previously been friends and Mitchell had even appeared in one of Joshua's rap music videos.

But there had been recent 'jealousy and bad blood' between the pair over Mitchell's ex-partner and the mother of his young daughter.

One 16-year-old witness who saw the fatal attack on the night told the court: 'I saw Armani swing at Josh upwards. He lunged at him. I could not see anything in his hand.

'I ran straight away to Josh who had backed off. He was saying, "What are you doing?"

'He took off his top and showed me. Then I saw lots of blood. I put my arm around him.'

Giving evidence, Mitchell claimed he had only intended to scare Joshua and was unaware he had stabbed him until the following day.

Paying tribute to her son after the hearing, Joshua's mum Alison Cope, 40, said: 'I have never known anyone loved as much as Josh.

'He was truly a genuine and unique person, so kind-hearted, so full of life and he had blossomed into a beautiful young man that anyone would be very, very proud of.

'He was an amazing and special person. No one had the right to take him from this world as he didn't want to go, he wanted to live, to love and to be successful.

'He was ambitious and truly beautiful inside and out. I loved him with all my heart and soul and now my heart and soul are broken without him.

'Josh loved life and had matured so much in the last 12 months, he knew exactly where he wanted to be with his life and to be an honest positive member of society.'

Detective Inspector Gary Plant, from West Midlands Police, added: 'Joshua Ribera needlessly lost his life, he was just 18 years of age and had a very promising future in the music industry, he had everything to live for.

After his death, Joshua's album 2 Real, recorded under the name Depzman, topped the iTunes hip-hop chart

'Armani Mitchell has been convicted of his murder, after inflicting one single stab wound to the heart.

'This murder has impacted greatly upon a lot of people, not only the friends and family of Joshua, but those of Armani too.

'Both families are devastated, as both have lost someone close to them. Albeit in different ways, both families are victims to knife crime.

'I hope that in time the pain that is being felt from Joshua's death will ease, but for certain it will not totally go away.'

Rapper Joshua was a talented grime artist better known by his performing name 'Depzman' and pals said he was on his way to fame.

He already had an album available on online music stores and several of his videos regularly attracted thousands of hits elsewhere on the internet.

After his death, friends and fans pushed his album '2 Real' to top the iTunes hip-hop chart as they downloaded it in tribute.

Star rapper Wretch 32 also tweeted: 'R.I.P depzman. A young talented mc.'
