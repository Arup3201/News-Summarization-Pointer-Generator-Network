When an Alabama dealership hired street dancers to jazz up a TV ad, little did they know they already had a star in their ranks.

Keen to show off what he 'used to do in the day', middle-aged Eastern Shore Hyundai's car salesman Joseph Barzelay busted a move.

His colleague Charles Matthews expected the worst.

'At that point, I pulled out my phone, because I was expecting something bad,' Matthews told AL.com. 'We had no idea he was going to break out and do what he did that day.'

Barzelay shocked his workmates with an impressive dance routine which included a Bangles-esque Egyptian walk, an interesting twerking-style gyration and his own take on the Moonwalk.

The entertaining video has had more than 105,000 views since Matthews uploaded it to YouTube on October 18.

Now the dealership wants to include the 20 second clip in its final TV ad. Joe, it's a good time to ask for a pay rise!
