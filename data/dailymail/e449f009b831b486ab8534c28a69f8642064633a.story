Placard: Josie Russell brandishes a Welsh slogan

After almost 20 years of trying to live out of the public gaze, hammer attack victim Josie Russell joined a public protest yesterday against quarrying near her picturesque home.

Josie, 27, was one of 40 protesters who wore dust masks at a planning meeting to campaign against the removal of 150,000 tons of slate waste from a quarry in Snowdonia.

The textile designer – who made headlines in July 1996 as the sole survivor of a hammer attack in which her sister Megan, six, and mother Lin, 45, were killed as they walked home from school – joined the campaign against the quarry over concerns about noise and dust, fearing pollution could cause the lung disease silicosis.

Yesterday, after brandishing a poster in Welsh urging Gwynedd planners to say no to ‘sound and silicosis’ she celebrated as they voted against the scheme at Talysarn, adding: ‘Our lives would have been ruined.’ 

Gwynedd councillors rejected an amended application for permission to remove 150,000 tons of slate waste from a tip at Talysarn in the Nantlle Valley over eight years.

Nearly 300 objectors had signed a petition with fears about the impact on the landscape and wildlife and about noise and dust. 

Josie added: 'I'm really, really glad. It would have been terrible. I work at home almost every day and the view from my window would have been horrible and dusty.

'There is loads of wildlife, untouched, and it's how it should be kept.'

Andrew Owen-Smith added : 'We need to move away from harming the environment. I run an outdoor centre 100 metres from the proposed development. 

'It's that close we would have lost customers. All it takes is a few bad reviews.'

But councillor Eurig Wyn urged at Caernarfon support for the application to provide jobs for locals. 

He was worried about protecting the Welsh language. 

He said: 'Unless we develop businesses and promote the economy with this sort of plan, the language will deteriorate permanently. This development ticks the appropriate boxes.'

Councillor John Pughe Roberts also backed the plans. 

He said: 'What hope does a deprived area such as Dyffryn Nantlle (the Nantlle Valley) have to prosper while every objection is made to helping the economy.'

Local councillor Craig ab Iago said the plans had split the rural community. On one side a farming family wanted to diversify but on the other neighbours were worried about noise and disruption.

It was claimed that five jobs would be created. But planning officers advised councillors to refuse permission.

Previously Josie had warned: 'If the proposals go ahead it will destroy local wildlife, ruin the peace and air quality of our valley, and cause no end of destruction to the environment so dear to my heart.

'My father Shaun brought me back to the Dyffryn Nantlle area following the terrible events of 1996 which changed my life forever. 

'It has always been a place of great safety and peace, and for many years provided me with a much-needed retreat from the larger world.'

She added: 'The slate tips are home to many varieties of trees and plants, which form the habitat of birds, bats, and other small mammals such as squirrels. It is abundant in amphibians such as frogs, toads, lizards and newts, as well as countless insects and invertebrates. 

'All these animals will either be displaced or killed, either by the workings, or in their endeavours to find a new habitat.'
