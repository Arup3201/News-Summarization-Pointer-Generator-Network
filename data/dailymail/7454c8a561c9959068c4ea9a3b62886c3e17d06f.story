Dave Whelan saw in the new year at his holiday home in Barbados and the Wigan chairman no doubt reflected on a tumultuous 2014.

But there seems little chance he will stick to his promise, issued in the wake of his racist comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities, to stand down if found guilty by the FA.

Sportsmail understands Whelan could remain in the Caribbean for three months, returning to Britain only after his ban has been served. The FA have removed him from ‘all football and football activity’ for six weeks and fined him £50,000. Further to that, Whelan has been warned as to his future conduct and ordered to undertake an education programme.

But Wigan officials were quick to highlight what they view as the key part of the FA independent commission’s written reasons — due to be published in full on New Year's Day — which state that their owner is not racist.

Indeed a club spokesman, asked why the 78-year-old chairman would not resign given what he had said to ITV, insisted Whelan only offered to stand down ‘if he was found guilty of being a racist’.

That is not true. No such distinction was made to ITV, with Whelan saying: ‘If the FA look into my affairs, and they were to find me guilty — which I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist — however, if they have any questions, I’m willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I’m guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan.’

The same club spokesman said it would be wrong to read too much into the appointment of Whelan’s grandson, David Sharpe, to the Wigan board. While he might well succeed Whelan eventually, that move does not appear imminent.

Three years to the day since the FA published the reasons for the conclusion they reached in the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra racism affair, Whelan was punished for his comments.

In trying to justify his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as manager at a time when Mackay remained the subject of an FA investigation into an exchange of racist, sexist and homophobic messages — an investigation that, amazingly, remains ongoing despite the fact this newspaper published details of the messages in August — Whelan talked himself into trouble in an interview with The Guardian.

He said it was ‘nothing’ to call a Chinese person a ‘chink’ and stated: ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.’

He then compounded the situation in an interview with the Jewish Telegraph when he said he used to refer to Chinese people as ‘Chingalings’. 

Whelan has seven days to appeal but a club spokesman said last night that he was being urged by the club not to do so.

An FA spokesman explained Whelan’s ban prevents him from any form of ‘League contact, or contact with other clubs, involvement in transfers, attendance at games or at Wigan’s training ground’.

In their own statement, Wigan responded: ‘The FA hand Latics chairman Dave Whelan a ban and fine following media comments but confirm they are satisfied that “he is not a racist”.

‘In summary, the FA Commission concluded that: “We are satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan is not a racist. We are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan did not intend to cause any offence by his comments. It is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise, plead guilty and begin to make amends”. 

‘However, the commission explained that it had a duty to “view the comments objectively and Mr Whelan’s subjective intentions were irrelevant as far the ruling was concerned”, hence the punishment announced today. Mr Whelan admitted the charge relating to abusive and/or insulting and/or improper conduct and/or bringing the game into disrepute, plus a further breach relating to a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’

It was not the task of the independent regulatory commission to establish if Whelan was a racist. They were only supposed to focus on the comments Whelan made. But Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, welcomed the outcome. ‘Dave Whelan accepted the disciplinary charge after making racist comments and the FA have imposed an appropriate penalty,’ he said.

Now Wigan, second from bottom in the Championship table, must brace themselves for the FA’s verdict on their manager Mackay’s offensive messages.

The FA hope to conclude that investigation as quickly as possible, aware of the damage a further delay could do to the credibility of the governing body.
