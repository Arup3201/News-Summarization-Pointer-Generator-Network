Great Britain's Fed Cup team secured a place in the play-off to regain a spot in the World Group with a 3-0 victory over Ukraine in Budapest.

Singles wins for Johanna Konta, who beat higher-ranked opponent Lesia Tsurenko 6-3 6-2, and Heather Watson, who saw off world number 26 Elina Svitolina 2-6 7-5 6-4 in a tense encounter, set up the success.

However, it needed an heroic fightback by doubles pair Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith to ensure the team finished top of their group in the Europe/Africa Zone Group I tournament, as they won three games in a row from being match-point down in the second set to prevail 6-7 7-5 6-4.

They pipped Turkey to top spot and face Belarus in Saturday's play-off, with the victors progressing to the World Group II play-offs in April.

'It was an amazing day. We had such a disappointing day yesterday (losing to Turkey) and everyone was very flat leaving the courts,' said captain Judy Murray.

'Jo got us off to a great start with a convincing win and Heather had to dig so deep to get past Elina Svitolina, who made the last 16 of the Australian Open last week.

'To top it off our dream team doubles pair came back from losing the first set.

'It really was a fantastic performance form the girls and sets us up nicely for the play-off tomorrow and we will throw the kitchen sink at it.'
