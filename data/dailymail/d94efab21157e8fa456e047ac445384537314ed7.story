A man was sentenced to 40 years in prison for stabbing his mother to death and pouring chemicals over her body because she would not buy him Avril Lavigne tickets.

Robert Lyons, 39, from Chicago, got into an argument with his mother Linda Bolek, 61, in March 2008, after she refused to obtain skybox tickets for him to an upcoming Avril Lavigne concert.

Prosecutors said he then hit her with a cognac bottle, stabbed her repeatedly and poured chemicals like Tile-X, Drain-O and Rapid insecticide over her body.

He then went to a book store and bought a book, drove around for hours and then called police. They found him several hours later at Hooters.

Lyons became angry when he learned he couldn't attend an Avril Lavigne concert

State Attorney Robert Berlin said in a statement: 'Today, Mr Lyons learned that he will spend the next 40 years of his life behind bars for the vicious murder of his mother.

'Linda Bolek did not deserve to die that day by the hands of her own son. She did not deserve to be beaten, stabbed and have chemicals poured over her as she lay helpless on the floor.

'Mr Lyons however, deserves this punishment. He has earned it and he deserves to spend what likely amounts to the rest of his life removed from society.'

Lyons was known to have a history of mental illness and at the time of the murder was suffering from bipolar disorder, according to the Chicago Tribune.

It was first suggested he receive 65 years in prison but DuPage County Judge Kathryn Creswell cited Lyons' record of psychiatric hospitalizations and treatments in handing down the 40-year sentence, which comes with no chance for parole.

In a statement to the court on Friday, Lyons said he had not been taking his medication when he attacked his mother after another in a regular series of arguments between them.

Lyons told the court he 'snapped' when he saw his mom pick up the kitchen knife and then attacked her, stabbing her nine times in the back after bashing her head in.

He said it was not his plan to murder her.
