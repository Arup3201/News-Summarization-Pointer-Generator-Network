Egyptian police have arrested four students who stripped to their underwear and publicly danced the 'Harlem Shake' - a convulsive dance style made popular by an online video which has gone viral. 

The four pharmaceutical students shocked residents in Cairo when they removed most of their clothes and filmed themselves performing the thrusting moves, a police official said.

Neighbours started to assault the students who are accused of committing a 'scandalous act'. Egypt has strict public indecency laws.

Meanwhile, a new video by a different group of 
Egyptians has been posted online showing people doing the Harlem Shake 
in front of the pyramids.

One of them, dressed in white underwear and a bow tie, dances while riding a camel.

The dance craze was sparked by a group of Australian teenagers who uploaded the 31-second clip called The Harlem Shake v1 (TSCS original) onto YouTube earlier this month. 

It has since been viewed more than 16million times and has taken the internet by storm similar to the dance craze Gangnam Style.

Earlier this month a University of 
Alabama student was facing possible expulsion for his attempt to create 
the largest Harlem Shake video ever. 

Freshman
 Nojan Radfar gathered hundreds of students on a central part of campus 
called the quad to stage a version of the latest internet meme, which 
features videos of people dancing in costume to the tune of 'Harlem 
Shake' by American DJ and producer Baauer.

The first 15 seconds of the videos feature just one person dancing and then the videos jump cut to  more people dancing and doing wild demonstrations.

He spent days trying to organise the event by visiting classrooms and concerts with 400 flyers and spreading the word online.

The Harlem Shake, originally called the albee, is a dance introduced in 1981 by a Harlem resident and street dancer named Al B.

It became known as the Harlem Shake due to its popularity in the neighbourhood.
