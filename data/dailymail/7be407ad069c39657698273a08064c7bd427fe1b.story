Over 180 Australian Defence Force members have been dismissed in the last year for unacceptable behavior including sexual offences, using prohibited substances and civil offences.

Australian army personnel made up 138 of the members dismissed, while another 26 people where Navy members and a further 18 from the Air Force.

A total of 114 of the dismissals were 'in relation to prohibited substances', 51 were due to charges of 'misconduct or unacceptable behaviour ' and the final 17 were because of 'civil convictions'.

Former army commando Hastings Fredrickson is set to face a Sydney court on Tuesday, with six charges of using a carriage service to offend

The revelations have come on the same day that former army commando Hastings Fredrickson is set to face a Sydney court with six charges of using a carriage service to offend.

Fredrickson is believed to be the ring-leader of a sex ring, made up of Australian Defence Force personnel, who named themselves the Knights Of The Jedi Council.

He allegedly circulated explicit emails of women without their consent, to other army personell often via the ADF's email system.

The content of the emails, aside from naked images and videos, also involved demeaning comments and 'challenges' for other members to have sex with the same women.

The ADF also terminated the contracts of six other men in November last year for their involvement in the sex ring.

Cadet Daniel McDonald, who was involved in the Skype-sex scandal in 2011, is also among the ADF members who was officially dismissed in the last year

However, the Daily Telegraph reported earlier this week that the six men were treated unfairly and have had their lives turned upside down since having their contracts terminated by the ADF.

The article claims the men were recipients of the emails but took no part in forwarding them nor taking part in similar behaviour.

Cadet Daniel McDonald, who humiliated a colleague by secretly filming their sexual acts and broadcasting them over Skype in 2011, is also among the ADF members who was officially dismissed in the last year.
