Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis have backed fellow Chelsea new boy Diego Costa to take the Barclays Premier League by storm.

All three players arrived from Spain this summer for a combined £48million and are expected to form the spine of a new-look Blues side.

And Costa, who scored 35 goals for Atletico Madrid last season, has been tipped to be the best of the bunch.

'Diego is an unbelievable player – you are going to love him, because he gives everything for the shirt,' Luis told the official Chelsea magazine. 'If he isn't already the best No 9 in the world, he will be very soon. 

'He's a brilliant player with a big heart and I'm very happy he's here with me because he'll help me grow as a Chelsea player.

'I know him very well and I know he fights for every ball. If I have won the ball in a forward area of the pitch, I know I have to look to give it to him because he is better than me in front of goal. 

'So, I always try to find him, look where he is and get the ball to him, because I know he is going to score.'

Luis and Costa were part of the Atletico team that won the La Liga title last season before losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Lisbon.

Fabregas, meanwhile, played with Costa at the World Cup in Brazil as defending champions Spain embarrassingly crashed out in the group stages. 

The former Arsenal midfielder returned to London after a three-year spell with hometown club Barcelona.

And the 27-year-old told the magazine: 'Diego has been progressing a lot in the last two years, especially the last year. He was immense, a real threat in every game. 

'He was playing every three days but he was consistently really strong. He goes behind the defence, making the kind of run players like me are really happy with because it gives you an option to play the killer ball. He will do superbly here.'

Chelsea complete their pre-season campaign against Real Sociedad at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday before travelling to newly-promoted Burnley next Monday.
