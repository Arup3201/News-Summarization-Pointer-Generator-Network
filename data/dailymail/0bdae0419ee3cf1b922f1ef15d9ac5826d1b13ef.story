A man broke his neighbour's arm in three places with a four-foot scaffolding pole after a long-running parking feud reached a head.

Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places by neighbour Andrew Chamberlain on their busy terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales.

Chamberlain, 50, used the metal pole as a weapon on Mr Morgan after the pair argued over him leaving his car outside their homes.

A court heard parking was a 'contentious issue' on the street and residents had agreed to only park outside their own homes in Greenfield Terrace.

But when Mr Morgan parked outside Chamberlain's home, he became 'abusive and threatening', Cardiff Crown Court was told.

He took the large metal pole from his garden, allegedly raised it above his head and tried to batter Mr Morgan - who blocked the blow with his arm.

Mr Morgan told the court the impact made a 'hell of a thud'.

He said: 'It was excruciating pain as I am sure you can imagine.

'He then brought the bar back as if he was going to hit me again.'

Chamberlain told the court he had been threatened by Mr Morgan and used to pole to protect himself.

Chamberlain told the jury: 'He was looking for ways to punch me.

'When I lifted the pole up he punched out at me with his left hand.

'As I was bringing the pole down, it made contact with the side of his arm.'

But he was found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent.

Chamberlain lives wiith his 82-year-old mother who suffers from arthritis and says he needed regular access to assist her.

Mr Morgan said he did not know about her poor health and would not have parked there if he had known but said he was not aware of any parking restrictions.

Recorder Peter Griffiths QC freed Chamberlain on bail - but warned: 'You have been convicted of a very serious offence. It will inevitably mean custody.'
