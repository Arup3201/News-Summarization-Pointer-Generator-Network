Students in the UK could be paying up to £90,000 over three years on university halls of residence.

One student block in London is charging just under £30,000 for a year - or close to £90,000 overall should students stay for three years.

Another in Paris Gardens, near London's South Bank, charges more than £60,000 over three years offering views of the Shard and Big Ben.

Students at Paris Gardens accommodation, on London's South Bank, would have to pay £60,000 for three years

The digs offer spectacular views over London, including of the Shard and Big Ben

It also has a penthouse communal lounge and a roof terrace as well as sun loungers, flat screen TVs and a bar serving drinks and ice cream.

Flats at this hall cost up to £409 per week, which works out at £20,859 a year or £62,577 for three years.

This year just two of its 250 or so rooms were left empty, with company Victoria Hall claiming students of 50 different nationalities are represented in the building.

The firm has a more modest accommodation blocks nearby - where students pay a mere £339 a week (£17,289 a year).

Luxury - but at a cost. Students at this South Bank accommodation could be paying up to £409 a week

As well as the Paris Gardens accommodation, the company offers cheaper living nearby - at £339 a week

North of the river in London, meanwhile, deluxe studio rooms at Mansion Bloomsbury are offered for 51 weeks at a rate of £575 a week. 

This means a monthly bill of £2,443.75, more than double the average rent for a private sector property in the capital.

The total cost for the year is £29,325 - nearly £3,000 more than the average salary in the UK - while a three-year stay is just shy of £90,000.

The rooms include a fridge freezer, flat screen television, and internet access, private showers and toilets, with 24-hour security inside the building.

The company also has accommodation around the country, including Oxford, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Bristol and Manchester.

At the South Bank accommodation just two of 250 rooms were not taken up this year despite the price

Student Rebecca Chow, 22, from Singapore, who is studying language and cultural studies at Kings College and staying at the Paris Gardens flats, said: 'It is a great place to live, the facilities are excellent.

'I don't think the price is unreasonable. It is quite expensive but it is similar to the private sector, the facilities are excellent.'

Jochen Viegener, 21, from Germany, has jumped ship from the university halls where he had been staying the previous year.

The graphic and media design student also staying at Paris Gardens, said: 'The accommodation was just not up to scratch but here everything is new and well-organised.

'I share with another student so we can divide the cost that way and it makes it much more affordable - I've found you get what you pay for.'

'Incredibly, there is no shortage of those willing to cough up such prices, with the building almost full.'

Best years of their lives: A student relaxes in a communal area, complete with huge television

Lucky: The students pay prices much higher than their counterparts who stay in ordinary halls
