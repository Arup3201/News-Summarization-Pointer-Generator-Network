A family who paid more than £4,000 for a dream holiday at a luxurious hotel arrived to discover a derelict building in the middle of a rubbish tip.

And the family, who had spent a year saving for their big trip, were offered just £35 compensation by Thomas Cook, who they had booked the holidy through.

Michelle and Ian Byford from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, took their three children and brother on a dream trip to Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia.

But the family claim their four star resort was surrounded by rubble, broken toilets and cracked furniture.

It was meant to be a trip of a lifetime, but the family say they were forced to beg tour operator Thomas Cook to transfer them to a different hotel after claiming to have seen human excrement in the hotel's pool

Heartbroken: Michelle and Ian Byford with their children Jack, 17, Charlie, 10 and Sam, 16, were all disgusted when they were greeted with reality of their Thomas Cook holiday

They also say they were forced to beg tour operator Thomas Cook to transfer them to a different hotel after claiming to have seen human excrement in the hotel's pool.

But the couple, who both work for retailer Next, were stunned when Thomas Cook charged them £300 to move to a different hotel.

And after one of the family suitcases - containing nearly £2,000 of valuables - was lost during a coach transfer, the Byfords have spent months complaining to Thomas Cook and have finally been offered compensation for their holiday from hell - a £35 voucher.

Michelle, 34, said: 'It was an absolute nightmare and we are disgusted with Thomas Cook. We are not snobs, we are just a normal family and £4,000 is a lot of money.

'All we expect is cleanliness and the actual holiday that we were sold.

'I can't put into words how angry I am and I will never ever use Thomas Cook again.

'What
hurt me most of all is that it was meant to be our last holiday all 
together as a family and the place was just disgusting.

Hellish holiday: This was the family's walk to the private beach after they thought they had bought a luxurious trip set in beautiful surroundings

The family say this was their walk to the private beach - and claim that staff at the resort charged them to move

'My young daughter was really shaken up and crying, and she couldn't enjoy her holiday because she was so upset.'

Ian, 43, took his family to Tunisia in 2011. While on holiday, his sons Jack, 17, Sam, 16, and daughter Charlie, 10, and the family planned to return to the area the following year - but wanted a hotel with spacious grounds and thrilling water slides.

Michelle went into Thomas Cook's 
Barnsley shop the following year and paid nearly £4,000 to book her 
family's last holiday together.

Michelle said: 'We explained to the in-store rep that we wanted to stay in the Soviva hotel because it was next to the port.

'She said she knew which hotel we meant, showed us the brochure and booked us two rooms for two weeks.

'We were told there was a sea view and that the door of the hotel lead onto the beach, which was privately owned by the hotel.'

But when the hotel transport took the
Byford family miles past the port, it began to sink in that their 
luxury break was not all it seemed.

This was the view that greeted the Byfords, and Thomas Cook have only given them £35 compensation

The advertised Soviva Resort on the Thomas Cook website boasted an 'extensive and spacious resort' that was popular with families

The Byfords claim when they arrived at the hotel, they were shocked to see stray cats wandering through the hotel.

Michelle said: 'The rugs in the hotel
corridor were wet through and as we walked in, the stench of cat wee 
hit us. It was so strong that it made our eyes stream.

'The hotel's pool was filthy. The water was black and there was all sorts of mud and rubbish in it.

'That's when we saw the poo floating in the pool.'

'We then went to look at our private 
beach and were horrified. We came out of the hotel and we had to walk 
through all of the rotting toilets and rubbish. Charlie was really 
distraught.

'There were dirty nappies and a sewage pipe on the beach, spilling out onto the sand.

'There was no way that I could have my kids staying there. It was obvious that I had been sold a false holiday.'

The Byfords reported their disgust to the Thomas Cook rep who tried to get them moved to another hotel.

They claim that the rep told them 
that another family had been moved after complaining that morning - but 
allegedly refused to move the Byfords unless they paid £300 for the new 
hotel and £10 for a taxi to take them there.

Michelle said: 'We were so angry, we should have been moved for free.

'The rep told us that all we could do was wait until we got home and go and make a complaint to the Barnsley shop staff.

'We managed to get a complaints form eventually after another rep listened to our story.

'She said it was disgusting that we had been charged to move hotels.'

Michelle and Ian Byford, with their sons children Jack and Sam, say their luggage was lost and they have spent an extortionate amount ringing Thomas Cook

Michelle and Ian Byford say that they have spent weeks trying to get a refund from the holiday operator

Incredibly, in an email sent from 
Thomas Cook in response to the family's complaint in December, they 
state: 'We are careful to document that the areas surrounding your 
holiday accommodation do not form part of your package holiday and are 
therefore not inspected.

'As this is that case, we are unable to accept any responsibility for the condition of these areas.

'After reviewing your case and all of
the information available to me, I would like to offer you a 
compensation payment in light of the disappointing conditions you were 
greeted with on arrival at the Soviva Resort.'

The Byfords tried to enjoy the rest 
of their stay in the new hotel, but the money they had spent moving 
meant they did not have any money for activities.

The Soviva resort is rated as a 
four-star establishment and is described on Thomas Cook's website as: 'A
popular choice for families with children or those seeking a lively 
holiday, this extensive and spacious resort enjoys a wide range of 
facilities as well as a varied animation programme.'

On the day the Byfords were due to 
leave, the family went to reception to wait for their airport transfer 
bus which was due to arrive at 7.30am.

By 8.30am they said the transport had not arrived and the Byfords began to panic.

After more calls to Thomas Cook and 
complaints to the reps, a 48-seater coach arrived at 9am to take them to
catch their 10am flight back to the UK.

'All we expect is cleanliness and the holiday that we were sold'

Michelle said: 'We could not believe 
it when this massive coach arrived. The driver was really rude and 
rushed us all onto the coach and threw our suitcases on.'

But when the family arrived at the airport, sons Jack and Sam could not find their suitcase.

The suitcase contained a £399 
camcorder, three £30 toothbrushes and hundreds of pounds worth of new 
clothes that the two boys had saved up to buy.

The Byfords were forced to fly home on the 10am plane without the missing suitcase, or face paying for new flights.

Michelle said: 'We made our first 
complaint on 16 September and it wasn't until the end of November that 
we found out we wouldn't be getting the suitcase back.

'We had to provide receipts for 
everything in the case or we wouldn't get our money back. Luckily I had 
the receipt for the camcorder, but who keeps receipts for clothes?

'We claimed £1,700 back for the case and only received £1,100 so are yet again, another £600 out of pocket.'

As well as the charge for changing 
hotels, the taxi and the lost items, the family have also spent huge 
amounts on phone bills calling Thomas Cook every day to claim their 
compensation.

The family had an email confirmation of their complaint on 6 December which offered them £35 in compensation.

Michelle said: 'We are absolutely 
disgusted, our holiday was ruined and we are out of pocket by hundreds 
and hundreds of pounds. It's been a living nightmare.'

Initially Thomas Cook offered the couple £35 compensation for their ordeal.

After the MailOnline contacted them, the tour operator said they contacted the family to arrange compensation and were investigating the issue.

A Thomas Cook spokesman said: 'The hotel is closed for the winter and undergoing refurbishment.

'The family have this afternoon agreed to a refund of the £288 and a goodwill gesture of compensation of £500.'
