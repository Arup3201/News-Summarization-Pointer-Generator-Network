MH370 searchers have said electronic 'pings' initially thought to have come from missing Malaysian Airlines flight may not have emanated from the plane at all.

A senior Australian naval officer said he 'increasingly suspects' some of the signals detected last month didn't come from the jetliner's black-box flight recorders, piling further doubts over the search effort.

Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said of four 'pings' picked up by the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, two were too weak to have been from a man-made device.

Sonar 'pings': U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, that picked up the signals last month, is lowered into the Indian Ocean once more

Too
 weak: A total of four signals, two on Saturday April 5 and two on Tuesday April 8, were detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the 
search for flight MH370. But two of them now appear to have been too weak to
 have been from a man-made devic 

Search teams picked up two signals on April 5 at a frequency of 33.5kHz before two more were received three days later at 27kHz.

While both are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions'.

Cmdr Lybrand, captain of the Ocean Shield vessel, said: 'As far as frequency goes, between 33 kHz and 27 kHz is a pretty large jump.'

He did say the authorities still believe that the two April 5 signals, one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black-box locator beacons.

So what was it? Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment

Cmdr Lybrand did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the April 8 'pings' if they did not indeed come from MH370.

Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment.

Experts say dolphins' lower frequency vocalizations (between about 0.2 and 50kHz) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz) are primarily used for spacial awareness.

Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the 
black box on MH370.

'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said.

'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time.

'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires.

'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.'

The British firm whose satellites helped track the final route of missing Malaysian Airlines airliner MH370, is to offer a free, basic tracking service to prevent other flights from disappearing.

Inmarsat said today that the service would be offered to all 11,000 commercial passenger aircraft which are already equipped with Inmarsat satellite connection, comprising virtually 100 percent of the world's long haul commercial fleet.

It's launch comes two months after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing without a trace on March 8 with 239 passengers on board.

It still has not been found despite a multi-agency, international search effort, including fruitless analysis by Inmarsat's own network of satellites.

Nerve centre: The control room at Inmarsat. MH370 automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to the British firm after the plane's transponder and all communication systems had shut down. Yet, not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found, not even after a new analysis led investigators to change the focus of their search yet again

It was very brief electronic 'pings' from Inmarsat equipment on the lost plane that prompted investigators to look for wreckage in the Indian Ocean.

'In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do,' Chief Executive Rupert Pearce said.

'This offer responsibly, quickly and at little or no cost to the industry, addresses in part the problem brought to light by the recent tragic events around MH370.'

It said at its results last week that it would make available free data transfers for a position reporting service.

It would see a plane determine its location using GPS and then 
transmit that data - together with a heading, speed and altitude - over 
Inmarsat's global network of satellites every 15 minutes.

The Malaysian Airlines jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on March 8 and data from Inmarsat's satellite network was analysed to deduce the airliner's flight path.

But it has still not been found and investigators appear no closer to finding it as they were two months ago when the plane mysteriously vanished from the world's radars.

Not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found, not even after a new analyses led investigators to repeatedly change the focus of their search. The latest search area is based on extremely limited satellite data combined with radar data taken some five hours before the plane is believed to have gone down. It is, as one search official said, 'a very inexact science.'

The aircraft could indeed still be in the area planes and ships from several countries have been combing in recent weeks.

Each unsuccessful day, though, adds to the skepticism.

Disappeared: The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 which vanished two months ago without trace

A source told the New Straits Times that if they were to find debris from the jet it would be down to 'luck' and they might need to expand the search

Sources said that while the plane could be on land, the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane was 'absurd'

'Without any kind of proof, uncertainty rules the day,' said Tim Brown, a satellite imagery expert at GlobalSecurity.org in Alexandria, Virginia. 'People still can't wrap their head around how a modern airplane that big could just go missing in the modern world.'

The focus of the search has changed repeatedly since air traffic controllers lost contact with the Boeing 777 between Malaysia and Vietnam. It began in the South China Sea, then shifted toward the Strait of Malacca to the west, where Malaysian officials eventually confirmed that military radar had detected the plane.

Then came evidence that the plane had continued flying for at least five hours after contact was lost.

The plane automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to Inmarsat after the plane's transponder and all communication systems had shut down.

The 'pings' did not include specific location information, but the team of experts who studied them said they must have come from one of two vast arcs that ran through both the Southern and Northern hemispheres.

Days of costly and fruitless searches off the coast of Perth since then have employed satellites, advanced aircraft and ships, but so far there have only been dead ends.

'The problem is, we're dealing with probabilities — estimates,' Brown said of the Inmarsat data. 'It's where they THINK the plane went down.'
