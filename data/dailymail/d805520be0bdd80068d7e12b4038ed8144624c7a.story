At the time, the model, who reportedly turned down the chance to pose naked for Playboy revealed that, while she had some reservations about the shoot, she was 'honored' to have been asked to take part.

'I never would have guessed getting naked  would be so challenging,' Dylan told the magazine.

'It feels pretty strange. I'm honored to be on a cover of a magazine like Treats and was so excited to work with Tony Duran, that was definitely an experience I will never forget.' 

For her latest cover, Dylan modeled a slightly more modest look, however still managed to show off her undeniable beauty and striking features.

Passionate: Dylan revealed to Vogue Italia earlier this month that she has inherited her father's 'passion and hunger'

Wearing minimal make-up, the fresh-faced fashion star showcases a number of low-key fashion looks and warm knitwear designs, which were styled for the publication by celebrity stylist Gaelle Paul.

Earlier this month, Dylan revealed to Vogue Italia that she has inherited very different traits from both of her parents - but it is her father, two-time Oscar winner Sean, who taught her the 'passion and hunger' that have helped to make her so successful in the fashion industry.

'As a child I was very attached to my mother,' she said. 

'She was always with us, and dad instead was often away on business. I started to get close to him later, when I left home. We are very similar, and I saw reflected in him everything that I hated in myself.

'Today I can recognize the values that he gave me: strong will, curiosity, passion and hunger.' 

Romance rumors: Last year, Dylan was reported to have enjoyed a romance with Twlight star Robert Pattinson

Big things: The cover marks the end of an incredible year for the young model 

Happy families: Dylan admits that she was much closer with her mother throughout her childhood, but has recently begun bonding with her famous father 

And while her determination and drive have certainly helped her to succeed in the fashion industry, she admits that she has had to sacrifice aspects of her personal life in return for her career. 

'I have gone from one relationship to another because I didn't want to be alone, but now that I'm single I'm fine,' she explained. 'There is no time for love.'

Ironically, it was 'love' that first catapulted Dylan into the spotlight, after she was reported to have enjoyed a brief romance with Twilight star Robert Pattinson in September 2013. 

However, Dylan later insisted that pair are just friends, telling Italian Vanity Fair of photographs published showing the duo together: 'They photographed us in a place where there were other people and cropped the picture. 

'Silly. I laughed about it... We're just friends.'
