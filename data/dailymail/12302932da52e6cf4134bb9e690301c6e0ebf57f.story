Drug dealers quite literally framed themselves after brazenly posing for photographs while kissing and counting their dirty money.

Gang leader Michael Adegoke and mule Peter Cavanagh were part of a mob who netted £30,000-a-month from selling heroin and cocaine.

Adegoke - nicknamed Flakey - used Cavanagh to deliver the drugs to the West Country and return to London with the profits.

Trail of evidence: Michael Adegoke, who led a gang which netted £30,000 a month from selling Class A drugs, counts his ill-gotten gains

Cavanagh, 26, took photos of himself brandishing a wad of cash on one of his train journeys back to the capital.

They were caught when two of their female dealers were busted on the streets of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

Addicts Tracey Carter, 37, and Isabel Cristiano, 46, were caught with cocaine hidden in their underwear and private parts.

Police linked them to Adegoke and Cavanagh and found the damning photos on their mobile phones.

All four pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine.

Adegoke, 21, from London, was jailed for five years. Sentencing of Cavanagh, of no fixed abode, was adjourned.

Carter and Cristiano, both from Weston-super-Mare, were given two-year suspended sentences.

Judge Julian Lambert told them: 'Each of you played a different role in what is a highly corrosive trade.

'Those of you who are addicts know the degradation that accompanies addiction. All of you bear a heavy burden of responsibility.'

Charles Thomas, prosecuting, said the gang distributed Class A drugs into Weston for two months at the end of last year.

He said: 'The drugs would be delivered from London to members of the conspiracy who lived in Weston.

'Once sold at street level, the profits generated would be returned to the suppliers in London, either in cash or by the money being paid into specific accounts.

'Adegoke was the leading figure of the conspiracy, giving orders and instructions to others involved and receiving much of the cash that was generated.

'Carter and Cristiano, who were both drug addicts at the time, were street dealers in Weston.

'Cavanagh’s role was to act as a go-between from London to Weston and was the general factotum of Adegoke.

'He brought drugs to Weston and collected cash to take back to London and passed instructions to others.'

Robin Shellard, mitigating for Adegoke, said he was an intelligent man 'in conflict between right and wrong.'

Paul Cook, for Carter, said her beautician business foundered and she was looking for cash to buy Christmas presents for her children.

Harry Ahuja, for Cristiano, said she was now drug-free.
