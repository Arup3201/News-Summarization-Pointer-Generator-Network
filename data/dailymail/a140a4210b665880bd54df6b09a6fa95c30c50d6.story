A team of explorers has discovered the wreck of a British submarine that sunk off the Maltese coast during the Second World War.

HMS Olympus struck a mine in the early hours of 8 May, 1942 shortly after she left Malta Harbour under the cover of darkness.

Nearly 90 men perished in what was one of the worst naval disasters of the war. Only nine of the vessel's 98 crew members survived after swimming seven miles back to shore in cold water.

Pristine condition: A sonar image of the wreck of HMS Olympus, which lies seven miles off the coast of Malta. The submarine's exact location had been a mystery for 70 years

The exact spot where the 283ft-long submarine sank in the Mediterranean Sea remained a mystery for 70 years.

But now a marine archaeology survey 
team has confirmed that they last year discovered the Olympus' resting 
place using side-scan sonar to survey the seabed.

Timmy Gambin, the archaeological 
director of Florida-based Aurora Trust, told the Guardian: 'We had 
suspicions it was the Olympus.

'Armed with our research on the 
features of the submarine, where the guns were, the placing and types of
 the rudder and propeller, we were able to identify her.

'Except for the damage from the mine she was in pristine condition, sitting upright as if she'd been placed on the seabed.'

Olympus is in the best condition of any wreck found by the Aurora Trust with almost no underwater growth on it.

The team twice visited the wreck last
 year. On the second trip in September, they used deep-sea robotic 
vehicles to film the wreck.

The footage confirmed that Olympus' 
propeller remains intact and her hatch open. The hole caused by the mine
 is located on bottom of the submarine.

Also visible are canons, radio antennas and machine guns.

The site is now expected to be formally designated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

Mr Gambin said that the site is being treated with 'every sensitivity possible' as it remains a mass grave.

Keen to protect its cultural history,
 the Maltese authorities only this week gave the Aurora Trust permission
 to announce their discovery.

Malta was of huge strategic importance during World War II.

Between 1940 and 1942, the British 
Navy fought a German and Italian blockade to keep the island supplied 
with food rations, war supplies and fuel.

By November 1942, the Allies had 
triumphed and this victory is credited with paving the way for eventual 
Allied success in North Africa.
