Ben Foster has been ruled out for at least a month after suffering a damaged knee cartilage during his side's 1-0 victory over Stoke.

Scans revealed the extent of the injury after the West Brom goalkeeper limped off on 56 minutes having hurt himself challenging Peter Crouch for a high ball.

It means Roy Hodgson will be unable to select Foster for England’s forthcoming internationals against Lithuania and Italy at the end of March.

Deputy goalkeeper Boaz Myhill will step up during Foster's absence, with Jack Rose, 20, expected to be named on the bench.

Tony Pulis said: 'It's rotten news for Ben because he's been so consistent.

'He kept seven clean sheets in 10 games but we have a very able man to step forward in Boaz, who has performed well when he's come into the team.

'We've got the international break coming up which I hope will give our medical team the chance to work on Ben's rehab and we will reassess later.’
