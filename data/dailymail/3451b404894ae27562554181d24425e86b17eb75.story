One of Britain’s biggest family house builders is moving into the retirement market to cater for the UK’s rapidly aging population.

Barratt Homes - the firm that has epitomised property-owning Britain got the last three decades - is changing the way it designs and builds homes to try and tempt older homeowners.

The company typically builds four-bedroom homes aimed at young families. It is now going to offer homes designed with a larger master suite and two more flexible bedrooms or studies.

Barratt Homes, which typically builds family-size homes, is now going to design homes aimed at the over 55s

This is to try and tap into the growing market of over-55s who own their own homes but whose children have now fled the nest.

At the same time, one of the largest specialist builders of sheltered accomodation and retirement homes, McCarthy & Stone, is also launching a ‘lifestyle range’ aimed at the over-55s - yet to retire but looking at more convenient, smaller accomodation.

Homes in Britain are increasingly owned by older generations.

Three-quarters of people aged 60 and over own their own home, whereas less than a third of those aged 25 to 34 do, according to the Office for National Statistics.

And the younger group struggling to get a foot on the property ladder is forecast to grow by just 5 per cent over the next 20 years, while the number of those 60 and over in the UK is expected to double to 21m.

Barratt is the first mainstream UK house builder to move into the retirement market.

The over-55s housing market in Britain is dominated by a handful of specialist providers.

However, these usually cater for the more elderly and infirm and there is not many alternatives for healthy people.

Mark Clare, Barratt chief executive, told the Financial Times: ‘There is a growing segment of non-mortgage-constrained affluent downsizers – people who don’t need a mortgage in order to move house.

‘But if they thought for one minute you were trying to sell them retirement housing they would run a mile. They are not aged and infirm, they’re likely to be fit and active. They are not elderly, they’ve got full lives.’

The government has been trying to encourage downsizing to free up family homes but progress has been slow because of a lack of appealing alternatives for the over-55s.

While some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free, or have plans to downsize from a larger property, many people in their 50s will still have a mortgage.

And with mortgage rates near record lows, it could be a good time to remortgage and reduce the cost of paying off your home before retirement - and even save the extra money into a pension if you want to.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.

First, read Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money's regularly updated What next for mortgage rates? This outlines the current state of the market and highlights the current best buy deals.

Then also check the top mortgage deals on offer currently in our best buy mortgage tables, or click through by using our helpful table (right).

You should now be armed with some knowledge about what is on offer and you can use our True cost mortgage calculator to compare how different deals stack up.

You should also talk to a mortgage broker.

There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. 

Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way
