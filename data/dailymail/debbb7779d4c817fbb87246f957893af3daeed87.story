Controversial data collected from NSA eavesdropping on U.S. citizens may have been used by intelligence officials in order to make a deadly drone strike on Somali militant leader.

That’s what the defense is arguing in a California terrorism funding case that’s focused on al Shabaab, the same group that recently carried out a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.

Four San Diego men of Somali extraction were convicted of conspiracy to finance and support the Somali militant group in February. Now they argue that data illegally collected on one of them was used to justify the lethal strike and want a new trial.

Illegal? Somalians walk through what remained after a U.S. strike that killed militant leader Aden Hashi Ayrow in 2008. Four men accused of helping fund his group now say intel obtained illegally by the NSA led directly to the strike

The revelation came Thursday from a court filing in which lawyers allege said an FBI email they obtained under disclosure rules constitutes evidence which, though cryptic, suggests that data collected by NSA eavesdropping on U.S. citizen Basaaly Moalin was used for the missile targeting in 2008.

Questions about whether the data may have been collected illegally will likely fuel fresh controversy over NSA spying on U.S. citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used. Defense lawyers assert there may be legal grounds for a new trial for four men convicted in the case.

The email, from an unnamed FBI official to an unnamed recipient at another agency, talks about how Aden Hashi Ayrow, the senior al Shabaab leader based in Somalia killed in the May 2008 missile strike, tried to call Moalin in January 2008 but failed to reach him.

‘We just heard from another agency that Ayrow tried to make a call to Basaaly today, but the call didn't go through. If you see anything today, can you give us a shout ? We're extremely interested in getting real time info (location/new #s) on Ayrow,’ the email says.

Target: Senior al Shabaab leader Aden Hashi Ayrow was killed in the strike. U.S. citizen Basaaly Moalin's lawyers now say he was illegally wiretapped for info that led to the strike

Retrial? The militant leader was one of around 30 killed in the strike (aftermath pictured), which lawyers for Moalin say was justified with illegally obtained intel. They now want a retrial

One of the defense lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear if the information was legally obtained with a warrant. The new court filing calls for a new trial and for the U.S. government to turn over other evidence which may have been withheld at the original trial.

Historically, it has been rare for the U.S. government to release, either through evidence-sharing rules or under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, internal government documents relating to counterterrorism armed drone operations.

The email in question was uncovered during the lengthy government investigation and court proceedings about the four defendants and turned over to defense lawyers.

Revelations this year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have provoked a major political debate in the United States on the extent of snooping on U.S. citizens and residents and its legality.

In their court filing, the defense lawyers argued that the use of NSA eavesdropping authority employed in their case ‘would be beyond the scope of anything authorized by Congress or approved by the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) - unless of course that is the subject of another set of secret procedures and protocols yet to be exposed and subsequently acknowledged.’

‘Given that the U.S. government had previously attempted to target Mr Ayrow via missile attack (unsuccessfully), and ultimately did so successfully May 1, 2008... the implications of 'real time' information on Mr. Ayrow's whereabouts are obvious, if not altogether ominous,’ it said.

In congressional hearings following the Snowden revelations, law enforcement and intelligence officials publicly cited the San Diego prosecution as one of a handful of unclassified examples of how NSA surveillance had been a key tool in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, but gave only limited details.

The NSA had no immediate comment and the CIA, which has conducted lethal drone operations against militants in Somalia and other countries, declined to comment.
