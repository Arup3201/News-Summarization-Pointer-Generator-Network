The Dalai Lama has revealed his favourite foods during a bizarre appearance as a guest judge on the Australian version of MasterChef.

The Buddhist monk was served several dishes but refused to judge any of them, saying it was against his principles.

However he revealed that he was a big fan of cheese, he liked bread, tofu, mushrooms and desserts, and 
'especially' coriander.

Spice of life: The Dalai Lama tastes one of the offerings on the Australian version of Masterchef. He enjoyed a Sri Lankan curry with roti bread

In a special episode of the programme, the 76-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader was presented with several sweet and savoury vegetarian dishes from the contestants as he took time out from his official duties on a visit to the country.

He enjoyed roti bread with a Sri Lankan curry but gnocchi was his least favourite.

His most critical comment about the gnocchi was that the contestant 'tried their best'.

Blessing: The Dalai Lama said that as a Buddhist 'whatever I get I accept'

Speaking about fine dining, the Dalai Lama told the contestants: 'My knowledge of these things is very limited; whatever I get I accept.

'As a Buddhist monk it is not right to prefer this food or that food.'

He said of the dishes he was offered: 'They all had a special taste and beauty.'

The Dalai Lama was today on the final stage of a visit to the U.S. and spoke to crowds in Chicago about the importance of overcoming religious intolerance.

Earlier, he defended a meeting with President Barack Obama, saying he was gratified 'to show an old friend's face'.

Handshake for the contestants: The Dalai Lama stressed that all the dishes had a 'special taste and beauty'

The Chinese government criticised the President for the meeting on Saturday, saying it would damage Chinese-American relations.

China considers the Dalai Lama a 
separatist, intent on ending Chinese rule over Tibet. The Dalai Lama 
fled Tibet in 1959 after the 
Chinese invasion and has led a government in
exile in India since then.

However President Obama emphasised in
his meeting with the Dalai Lama that the United States does not 
support Tibetan independence.

In an interview on NBC's Today show, the Dalai Lama said he 
considered it his duty to meet the President 'to show my respect. 
We really have a feeling of reunion'.

He also urged Americans to not get discouraged by the protracted national debate over the country's debt problems.

In the interview, the Dalai Lama said he believes 'a lot of resentment' is building within China toward the government.

And he said he doesn't think China can buck the trend toward democracy around the world, saying the 'whole world is turning in one direction'.

'China cannot go against that trend,' he said, adding he believes the 'voice of openness' is sweeping over China.
