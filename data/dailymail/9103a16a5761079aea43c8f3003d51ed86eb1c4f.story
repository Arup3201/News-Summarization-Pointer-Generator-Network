An Oregon baker has refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, allegedly calling them 'abominations unto the Lord.'

Aaron Klein, owner of Sweet Cakes in Gresham, is the subject of a state investigation after one of the brides-to-be filed a complaint.

The woman, who said she'd been served by the owner before without issue, claims Klein refused to take an order from her partner when he learned the cake was for a gay marriage.

Oregon Attorney General's civil enforcement office is now looking into the case to determine whether the baker broke the law by discriminating against the couple.

The Oregon Equality Act 2007 outlaws discrimination by an individual or a business against people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.

Klein denied calling the women 'abominations' but admitted to rejecting their custom.

'I apologized for wasting their time and said we don't do same-sex marriages,' he told KATU.

'I honestly did not mean to hurt anybody, didn't mean to make anybody upset, (it's) just something I believe in very strongly.'

He told the news station his religious beliefs were more important than making money and the state law.

'If I have to be, I guess, be penalized for my beliefs, then I guess, well, that'll be what it is,' he said, adding that, in his view, his constitutional rights should override Oregon law.

'My First Amendment rights allow me to practice my religion as I see it,' Klein said.

The case will likely fall to a judge to decide. The women said they didn't want to talk about the complaint until they received further legal advice.
