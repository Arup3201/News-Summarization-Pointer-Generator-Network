Suspicious: Former chief of police in Northern Ireland Sir Hugh Orde said Cregan's ability to hide for five weeks 'worrying', especially as there was a £50,000 reward

One of Britain's top police officers has condemned the 'worrying' conspiracy by a minority in Manchester who aided and protected suspected murderer Dale Cregan while he was on the run.

Sir Hugh Orde said the situation mirrored what he experienced in Northern Ireland, where he ran policing for seven years, whose communities had in the past protected terrorists and criminals.

A culture of fear was used to stop people with information speaking to police, no matter how high the cash rewards for information were, the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers said.

Cregan, who was wanted in connection with two murders, was in hiding for five weeks in Manchester before allegedly killing officers Pc Fiona Bone and Pc Nicola Hughes yesterday.

It is rumoured that he was seen drinking in pubs but this was not reported to police by people who allegedly witnessed it.

And a £50,000 reward and dozens of armed raids across the city failed to uncover the wanted man.

A candle and a pillow were found in a shed behind the White Hart pub in Hyde and he must have had help from people in the community to get food and drink as well as avoid detection, experts say.

When asked what he thought about the Cregan's ability to hide for that long without the police being told Sir Hugh said:  'Of course it is worrying'.

'If people are terrified of an individual then I can understand why people feel that they don't want to step forward. It is something that I had to deal with day in day out in my time in Northern Ireland where fear was the key.

Hideout: Dale Cregan, pictured left, was being sought by 
police offering a £50,000 reward and may have been hiding out in this outhouse at the rear of the White Hart 
pub in Hyde, Greater Manchester with help

Going underground: Staff at the pub discovered a pillow, blanket and candle on top of a pile of newspapers in a shed at the back of the White Hart pub

Overflowing: The disused outhouse was overflowing with newspapers when staff went to inspect it, but it appears bizarre that he could have been undetected for so long

'But you only have to look at the response of the people of Manchester to this awful event to see the majority are behind the police.'

His views echo those of Sir Peter 
Fahy, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, who said he was sure Cregan was protected by a 'criminal conspiracy'.

'We believe he has been protected by a criminal conspiracy to 
harbour him. We are determined to find the people behind that and bring 
those responsible to book,' he said.

Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information about the murders of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23 and huge posters of Cregan, with his distinctive face and one eye, were plastered over the city to find him.

Statement: This graffiti on a brick wall in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has the message: 'PSNI/RUC (Police Service of Northern Ireland/Royal Ulster Constabulary) unwelcome out'

Protest message: This mural painting in west Belfast has the slogan: 'Collusion! It's not an illusion!'

The longer it took to track him down the more police ubecame convinced he was being aided by a criminal conspiracy and 'web of intimidation' set up by criminals.

The fugitive was held at Manchester Airport in June after returning on a flight from Thailand.

But he was allowed home pending further inquiries. Cregan had been questioned over the murder of Mark Short, who was gunned down in a Manchester pub on May 25.

By the time the police finally had him under lock and key on Tuesday, he was suspected of three more – the two policewomen and Short’s father, David, in a gun and grenade attack in August 10.

Tragic: Constable Ronan Kerr was killed when an explosive device detonated under his car at in Omagh but despite a large reward his killers have not been traced

Journalist Carl Fellstrom, the author of Hoods, the story of the Nottingham-based organised crime family told the Guardian 'It is a double-edged thing,' he said. 'People are not only fearful they also don't trust the police with the information. They are not perceived to be part of the community.'

Similarly in Northern Ireland over the decades, large sums of money and great pressure from police have failed to convince people to tell the authorities about the whereabouts of offenders or who they believe committed crimes.

More than 30 years ago Joanne Mathers, then 29, was shot dead by an IRA gunman as she chatted to someone on a doorstep.

She was collecting census forms when she was ruthlessly killed as Republicans believed the forms were being used by the British government to gather intelligence.

A masked man dashed forward, snatched
the clipboard she was holding and shot her dead, before stealing all the census documents.

The murderer sustained
cuts in the attack, wounds that would have been easily spotted by someone who knew him, but no one has ever been 
brought to book for the heartless killing.

Her husband even offered a reward of £20,000 of his own money but the murderer has never been found.

Police Constable Ronan Kerr was killed by a booby-trap car bomb planted outside his home in April near Omagh by dissident republicans last year. A £50,000 reward has also failed to bring the murderers to justice.
