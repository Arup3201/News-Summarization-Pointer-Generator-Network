Newcastle United’s signing of Remy Cabella was confirmed during Sunday’s World Cup final.

His £12m arrival from Montpellier slipped under the radar somewhat given the timing.

But worry not, Sportsmail is here to tell you everything you need to know about the highly-rated newcomer to the Premier League…

New boy: Remy Cabella poses with his Newcastle shirt inside St James' Park after sealing his £12million move

In a nutshell, who is he?

In short, he’s a 24-year-old French international who plays as an attacking midfielder. He came through the ranks at Montpellier and left having scored 28 times from 115 outings.

France international? Sounds like a bit of coup for the Magpies?

It certainly is and it’s surprising there wasn’t more of a scramble for his signature. He was included in the France World Cup squad as a late replacement for the injured Clement Grenier and we suspect Newcastle were praying he didn’t get on, for he might just have alerted others to his talents.

Thankfully for Alan Pardew – who had been tracking the schemer for some time - Cabella remained on the bench in Brazil and France eventually exited at the quarter-final stage against Germany.

So he isn’t established in the France squad yet?

He made his debut in a World Cup warm-up fixture against Norway as a second-half replacement for former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye – who persuaded him to move to St James’ Park - but he missed out on the initial squad for Brazil.

He still just has the one cap to his name but time is on his side and he will be more involved when France begin preparations for the European Championships in September.

Don’t forget, 26-year-old Adam Lallana wasn’t an established England international until earlier this year and he’s just joined Liverpool for £25m.

You mention Lallana, is he similar in style?

Well, they’re about the same size (Cabella is 5ft7in, Lallana 5ft 8in), both boast no shortage of skill and operate in the same areas. Only one cost more than twice as much as the other.

But I hear he models his game on Cristiano Ronaldo?

True, his idol is the Real Madrid and Portugal forward. He even styles his hair in a similar fashion. 

And Cabella himself told nufcTV: 'I loved to learn how to dribble like him and do the tricks, but now I am on the professional stage, I have my own way.

'I am looking to improve all the time and Newcastle is a well-known, very good club. I just love to improve and that's what I'm here to do.'

The Toon Army will be hoping the comparisons with Ronaldo extend beyond his haircut.

So what is his game all about?

Like a younger Ronaldo, Cabella has, at times, been criticised for too many step-overs, flicks and tricks.

Last season, however, he honed his abilities and the upshot was a 14-goal return in Ligue 1, no mean feat for a midfielder.

He can create as well as score and there have been comparisons drawn with former Magpie favourite David Ginola.

He has a turn of foot to compliment his craft and was Montpellier’s star player last season.

Excited: Cabella says he is hoping to become 'one of the best' at Newcastle after leaving Montpellier

Sounds exciting?

He is and that’s exactly the word which has been used to describe him. French journalist Julien Laurens told the Chronicle: ‘The most common thing that is said about him is that he’s very much like Ginola. This is because it’s true and because he gets the fans excited.

‘He is very similar to what Ginola was when he was 24. He is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching.’

So where will he fit into Newcastle’s side?

With French compatriot Hatem Ben Arfa currently out of favour on Tyneside, Cabella could well operate in the attacking domain he once populated.

Ben Arfa was used in an advanced role on either flank or, on occasion, through the middle, and that is where Pardew is likely to deploy his new signing.

Sounds too good to be true, so when will he be following Cabaye to PSG?!

Let him get his debut out of the way first…
