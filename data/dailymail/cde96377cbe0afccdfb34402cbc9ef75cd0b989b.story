'Damaging': Jean-Claude Juncker, whose candidacy for president of the European Commission is being strongly challenged by David Cameron

David Cameron today warns Angela Merkel her controversial candidate to head the European Commission would be ‘deeply damaging’.

In a hard-hitting article placed in leading European newspapers, the Prime  Minister makes public for the first time his opposition to arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker.

The German Chancellor has openly backed Mr Juncker, who is the candidate of her party’s group in the European Parliament.

But Mr Cameron says he has no legitimacy – and warns that his selection would be a slap in the face for millions who voted for Eurosceptic parties in last month’s European elections.

He describes Mr Juncker’s claim to have a democratic mandate as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘Nowhere was Mr Juncker on the ballot paper.

‘Even in Germany. . . only 15 per cent of voters even knew he was a candidate.’

Mr Cameron says Europe ‘must either change or accept further decline’, and needs ‘bold leadership – people ready to heed voters’ concerns’ rather than a federalist who wants greater integration.

The high-profile intervention suggests Mr Cameron’s bid to persuade Berlin to drop its support for Mr Juncker has reached an impasse.

It came as Downing Street indicated he is ready to use the Parliament Act to pass legislation requiring an in/out referendum on Europe by 2017.

This would allow him to force changes through against the wishes of the House of Lords. The legislation, which ran out of time in the Lords this year, is to be reintroduced by former Tory minister Bob Neill.

But with both Labour and Liberal Democrats opposed, it still faces major hurdles.

Labour last night said it ‘does not support’ the legislation. However, using the Parliament Act means Labour MPs will have to actively vote it down, rather than abstaining, in order to stop it becoming law.

Today, Mr Cameron argues EU leaders, not the European Parliament, should choose the next Commission president.

He accuses the Parliament of a ‘power grab’, adding: ‘To accept such a claim would be deeply damaging for Europe and would undermine, rather than strengthen, the EU’s democratic legitimacy.’

The European Parliament yesterday stepped up pressure on EU leaders to accept Mr Juncker. Socialists and the centre-Right EPP group, which includes Mrs Merkel’s party, said they would form a grand coalition to support the former Luxembourg prime minister.

The Prime Minister’s article appeared in a range of papers, such as Suddeutsche Zeitung in Germany and the Irish Times.

Downing Street officials were also trying to place it in half a dozen papers across Europe, including in Austria, France and Belgium.
