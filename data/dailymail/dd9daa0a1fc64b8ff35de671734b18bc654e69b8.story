A Picasso painting of his ‘golden muse’ has fetched more than £28.5 million at auction.

The impressionist's 1932 piece, Femme Assise Pres d'une Fenetre (Woman Sitting Near a Window) of his companion Marie-Therese Walter was the first of a series of sales held in London this month by Sotheby's, Christie's and smaller auction houses.

Prices for the most sought-after works have soared in recent years despite broader economic concerns, with collectors in China, Russia and the Middle East joining more established patrons in Europe and the United States.

What recession? Prices for the most sought-after works have soared in recent years despite broader economic concerns

Subtracting the buyer's premium of more than 10 percent, the amount realised for the 1932 Picasso was at the lower end of pre-sale estimates of £25million to £35million.

Helena Newman, from Sotheby's, said: ‘We are delighted that this stunning and monumental portrait, which is part of the defining series that introduced his “golden muse” to the public eye, fetched such a strong price.

‘In recent years in particular we have witnessed the remarkable allure of Picasso's portraits of Marie-Therese to collectors, with La Lecture selling for £25 million - double its pre-sale estimate - in Sotheby's February 2011 sale, and Nature Morte aux Tulipes selling in Sotheby's November 2012 sale for 41.5m US dollars (£26.5m).

‘This particular portrait is a striking and notably modern-looking work from one of the artist's most celebrated periods.’

Nonetheless, it was comfortably the top lot of an evening when a series of works on paper by Austrian artist Egon Schiele arguably stole the limelight.

Schiele's 1914 piece, Lovers (Self Portrait With Wally) fetched £7.9million, an auction record for the artist for a work on paper.

Also sold by the Leopold Museum in Vienna was his Self Portrait in Green Shirt with Eyes Closed, which sold for £5.1million, well above expectations of between £1.8million and £2.5million.

The combined tally for Schiele works, sold by the museum to help settle a long-running restitution case involving art deemed to have been stolen by the Nazis in the 1930s, was 14 million pounds.

Other lots fared less well, notably Max Beckmann's Before the Ball - Two Women With a Cat which went unsold despite pre-sale estimates of £5million to £8million.

Overall the evening brought in £121.1million in sales, within expectations of £103million to £149million. Sotheby's said it was their second highest total from an equivalent sale in London.

Helena Newman, chair of Sotheby's impressionist and modern art in Europe said: ‘Bidders, both new to the market as well as seasoned buyers, reacted with great enthusiasm, in particular to the selection of impressionist works that were considered to be the strongest offering in many years.
