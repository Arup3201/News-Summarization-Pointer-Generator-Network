Cyclist Mark Cavendish tonight capped a remarkable year when he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

The 26-year-old, who was world race champion and winner of five stages at this year's Tour de France, saw off competition from distance runner Mo Farah and golfer Darren Clarke to land the top prize at the glitzy BBC ceremony in Salford.

Cavendish had long been the odds on favourite to scoop Sports Personality of the Year 2011 following an extraordinary 12 months.

Landmark: Mark Cavendish hailed the award as 'an honour' before paying tribute to the other nominees and his pregnant girlfriend

Personal triumph: Bookies' favourite Cavendish won this year after previously winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008 but not even getting nominated

The Isle of Man rider achieved the two huge goals he set for himself in 2011, becoming the first Briton to win the green jersey in the Tour de France and then clinching gold in the road race at the World Championships.

A tearful Cavendish, who joins Tommy Simpson and Sir Chris Hoy as cycling's winners of the award, said: 'I'm absolutely speechless.

'A few of my team-mates here will say that's a rare thing. Without those guys this wouldn't even be close to possible.

'I had a group of guys in (the World Championships in) Copenhagen who rode incredible and that brought a rainbow jersey back to Britain after more than half a decade, and that's a massive thing.'

Cavendish, whose girlfriend Peta Todd is expecting their first child next year, has established himself as one of the best sprinters in the history of cycling and this year took his tally of Tour de France stage wins to 20.

He went on to describe the award was 'an honour', as he accepted the trophy in front of an audience of sporting celebrities, as well as his pregnant girlfriend Peta.

The award will be a personal triumph for Cavendish, who despite winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008 and six in 2009, has yet to land one of the most prestigious prizes in British sport.

After winning four stages in 2008 he was not even nominated, and described the four seconds air time he got from host Sue Barker that year as 'four daggers through my heart'.

But the cycling star was not to be denied in 2011 and scooped the prize ahead of Darren Clarke in second and Mo Farah in third.

Veteran Clarke was an emotional and surprise winner of the Open Championship this summer, five years after his wife Heather died of breast cancer.

Farah starred at the athletics World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, becoming the first British athlete to win the 5,000 metres title and also taking silver in the 10,000m.

After receiving the award, Cavendish said: 'I would like to thanks everyone who 
supported me, my girlfriend Peta and her little bump, and obviously well
done to all the other people who were nominated.

'Nervous': He may have turned up knowing he was the favourite to walk away with the Sports Personality of the Year Award, but cyclist Mark Cavendish still looked nervous when he arrived at the Salford ceremony

'In an incredible year for British sport....where we can produce champions from such a small place, and to be yo against nine inspirational people - I'm lost for words.'

'It's a landmark in cycling.'

Elsewhere at the glitzy award ceremony hosted by Gary Lineker and Sue Barker, Coach of the Year award went to England cricket team director Andy Flower, who guided England to a first Ashes win in Australia in more than 20 years.

The Zimbabwean, who beat Manchester 
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland to 
the award, said: 'This is a very proud moment for me to stand here, 
England has been very good to me and my family.

'I'm very proud to be part of the England cricket team. They have done some wonderful things over the last couple of years.

'I think everyone in this room realises it's the players that make the hard decisions, play under pressure and have to deliver. It's great to have a good bunch of players and a good bunch of people to work with.'

England's cricket achievements were also honoured with the Team of the Year award, which was collected by captain Andrew Strauss, also a nominee for the individual award.

Dressing up: Paula Radcliffe and Jane Torvill enjoyed dressing to impress in heels and frocks

Still going strong: Former Personality of the Year, boxer Joe Calzaghe, and his dancer girlfriend Kristina Rihanoff turned up the glamour at the event

He said: 'This is a very special award for a couple of reasons. First there's so many great teams who have won this in the past. 'But also if there's one thing we've all bought into it is the idea the team is more important that the individual. It's the real basis of why we've done well and makes it even more special to win this accolade.'

Meanwhile, tennis world number one Novak Djokovic won the Overseas Sports Personality of the Year gong following a year in which he went 41 matches unbeaten and won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

Steve Redgrave, the former rower and arguably Britain's greatest ever Olympian, was honoured with the lifetime achievement award.

Redgrave won his first gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, and unforgettably won his fifth in Sydney at the 2000 Olympics.

Golfer Lauren Taylor, 17, was named Young Sports Personality of the Year.
