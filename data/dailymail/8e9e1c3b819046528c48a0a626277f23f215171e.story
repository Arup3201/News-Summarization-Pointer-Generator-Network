James Anderson, England’s leading international wicket-taker, talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. 

WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? 

Boris Becker. I played a lot of tennis when I was younger and I just admired his athleticism and charisma around the court.

WHAT WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WEREN'T A SPORTSMAN?

No idea really. I did business and finance at school so maybe something to do with that. I would certainly have tried to go to university if not for sport. I have dabbled in a few things off the pitch such as clothes designing (613collection.com) and radio presenting - it’s been interesting trying new things outside of cricket.

WHAT OTHER SPORTSMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE? 

Rory McIlroy. I love golf and there’s nobody better than him right now.

WHAT IS YOUR CAREER HIGHLIGHT?

It’s a toss up between winning the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 and defeating India away as both are pretty rare. From a personal point of view taking four wickets against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup in Cape Town.

Anderson said if he could be another sportsman it would be Rory McIlroy

Anderson ended the match with four wickets for just 18 runs as England cruised to victory

AND THE WORST MOMENT? 

Losing 5-0 to Australia twice. Don’t have to look any further than that!

IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN WHAT POSSESSION WOULD YOU SAVE? 

Once my family and dogs were safe I’d save my golf clubs and also the mementos I’ve collected throughout my career.

WHAT'S THE BEST ADVICE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN? 

There isn’t one bit of advice that sticks out. I’ve been fortunate to work with and meet some very experienced cricketers and I have tried to learn what I can and apply it to my game. I think it’s important to try and keep learning all the time no matter how much you have played.

WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE KARAOKE SONG? 

Sweet Child of Mine by Guns and Roses. I’m much better in the shower or car than I am with a microphone in my hand!

Anderson revealed that his sporting hero was German tennis star Boris Becker

THREE MOST LISTENED TO SONGS ON YOUR IPOD? 

Right now it’s Royal Blood, Alt-J and Kasabian’s new album. I love music and am proud to be ambassador of the music charity Nordoff Robbins.

LAST FILM YOU SAW? 

Last time I went to the cinema was to see Inbetweeners 2, which was okay but they’re never as good as the original are they?

LAST BOOK YOU READ?

I’m not a regular book reader. I do a bit on tour so I’m looking forward to reading Roy Keane’s autobiography this winter.

WHICH THREE FAMOUS PEOPLE WOULD YOU WANT TO DINNER AND WHY?

Boris Becker and Rory McIlroy for the reasons I’ve mentioned and Bob Willis because I’ve heard he’s got a wicked sense of humour and would love to see that side of him.

The England bowler said that the last film he had seen  was The Inbetweeners 2

FAVOURITE PRE-MATCH MEAL?

Spaghetti with olive oil and garlic. I try and be healthy before a game so I can enjoy a post match burger!

CAN YOU COOK AND WHAT'S YOUR BEST DISH? 

Yes I can cook a bit. I like doing a Sunday roast but my best creation is lamb chops and mashed potatoes.

FAVOURITE HOLIDAY DESTINATION? 

I loved the Maldives when I went there but I holidayed in Tahiti once and that’s a bit different so I’ll go for there.

IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY YOU?

Colin Farrell - or Jim Carrey.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought? My house I guess! I’m a tight northerner so I don’t spend money too often.

TELL US A SECRET? 

I’m a Burnley lad and am delighted that my team are back in the Premier League but when they were in the lower divisions I did have a brief spell supporting Arsenal instead....

Anderson admitted that although he was from Burnley he also supported Arsenal
