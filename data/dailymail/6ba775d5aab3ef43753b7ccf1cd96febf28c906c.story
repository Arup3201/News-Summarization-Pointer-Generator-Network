A New York state trooper has been caught on camera telling two bikers that the SUV driver beaten up last month had powerful connections in the police.

A helmet cam, belonging to one of the two motorcyclists who had been pulled over, recorded the cop claiming that a high-ranking officer related to Alexian Lien had ordered a crackdown on bikers.

The trooper said that because of the attack on Mr Lien, who was pulled from his car by a group of bikers, police had been instructed to come down hard on motorbike offenses.

Traffic stop: This New York state trooper was recorded claiming cops had been ordered to ticket bikers

He went on to claim that Mr Lien had a state trooper uncle who 'sent the word down' that bikers should be ticketed for even minor offenses, according to Gothamist.

After asking if the helmet cam was turned off, the unidentified trooper said: 'I'm gonna give you a fair warning,' before making his claim.

'You guys are going to get written,' he can be heard telling the bikers. 'After what happened in New York City, 
this is what they're doing.'

He added: 'The guy who was assaulted - his uncle
 is one of our bosses on our job. So he sent the word down, that all 
these bikes are getting stopped, and they're going to get written.'Â

Claims: The bikers were told the SUV attack victim had an uncle who is a high-ranking trooper

It has not been confirmed if what the trooper said is true, but his comments comes after the arrest of several off-duty undercover cops who allegedly took part in the attack of Mr Lien, which happened in front of his wife and baby.

The video, taken from the helmet cam of one of the bikers, who has not been identified, was uploaded to YouTube.

They were pulled over on the Palisades Parkway, about 15 minutes drive from where Mr Lien was attacked. Despite being stopped for speeding, the bikers were let off with a warning.
