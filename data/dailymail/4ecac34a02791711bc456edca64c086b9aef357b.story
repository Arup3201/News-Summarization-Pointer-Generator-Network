Arsene Wenger needs to learn to adapt his Arsenal team when they face top opposition in order to mount a serious Premier League title challenge, according to former Manchester United right-back Gary Neville.

Neville believes Arsenal were very fortunate to escape with a point at Goodison Park after battling back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.  

'They’ll be delighted to get out of there [Goodison Park] with a draw,' said Nevile on Sky's Monday Night Football. 'They’ve got out of jail in the last ten minutes. They continued to keep going but that’s the least a Premier League team can do.

'Arsene Wenger does not seem to adapt in any way shape or form for opposition teams in the Premier League. And even with his signings, you’d think that they’re crying for presence. Monreal against Lukaku is a mismatch. 

'It happened last year where they had problems in that situation,' Neville added. 'So you think to yourself that they’d need a presence in midfield to support them in these type of games. He doesn’t seem to adjust his principles for any opposition team. He only thinks about what Arsenal are going to do and that they’ll always come out on top, but it’s not working now year after year against the bigger teams.

'Arsenal’s problems are always against the biggest teams, the best teams. They bully the other teams when they out football them, but generally I would say they’re going to have to change if they’re going to want to go that extra mile that they need to get to the championship. They’re not going to do it with that type of player all the way through the team. You need two or three but not seven or eight of them.

Neville also spoke about Arsenal's Champions League qualifier against Besiktas on Wednesday.

'I hope they qualify,' he said. 'We want our teams to be in the Champions League, we need our teams to be in the Champions League because it’s great for English football.

'We want our teams to do well because our league improves through it. I think there are signs now that were are getting better in the past couple of years but we still have some way to go to catch up with the very best in Spain and the very best in Germany.'
