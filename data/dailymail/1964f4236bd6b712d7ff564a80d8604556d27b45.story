A team of tricksters raked in thousands of pounds by overcharging a pensioner for odd jobs and gardening.

Edward Dolan and his teenage son, Michael, were both jailed today for the scam, in which they charged their 84-year-old victim up to £1,250 a time for small, substandard jobs.

The ruthless travelling gang's activities did not come to light until after the cancer sufferer, from Marske, east Cleveland, died in late 2011.

Over more than two years, they took a total of £17,500. One entry in the OAP's chequebook was £700 for a coat of gloss on a garage door, while there were also payments for house repairs and cleaning.

The pair, both from Stokesley, North Yorkshire, were jailed after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering.

The scam came to light following the pensioner's death. The day after he died, his son was sorting through his belongings when Edward Dolan turned up at the house looking to make more money.

Prosecutor Richard Bennett told Teesside Crown Court that the 47-year-old 'left in a hurry' when he was told of the pensioner passing away.

But the victim's son was easily able to describe the 31-stone conman, while neighbours of the OAP later told police they had seen him there regularly.

Convicted: Michael Dolan also admitted a second conspiracy with friend William McElvaney, pictured, both now 19, which involved fleecing an 89-year-old out of £180

Michael Dolan, who was 15 when the scam started, claimed after his arrest the gardening and repair business was his, and his father was just his driver.

His father tried to shift the blame onto the teenager when quizzed - but trading standards chiefs believe he ran it until his son reached 18.

Michael Dolan also admitted a second conspiracy with friend William McElvaney, both now 19, which involved fleecing an 89-year-old out of £180.

The woman, who suffered from dementia and lived alone like the first victim, twice called her son to say she had no money after the pair took her pension.

Mr Bennett said a diary entry she made said 'gardeners have been to cut the edges' and she later told her son that they had taken all of her cash.

Because she had been tricked out of money earlier in the year, her family installed a security camera which caught the pair knocking at her door.

The following day, Dolan returned to the bungalow in Hutton Rudby, North Yorkshire, looking for further work and cash for 'work', said Mr Bennett.

McElvaney, of  Whitby, was locked up for nine months after he admitted conspiracy to defraud over two days with Michael Dolan.

His barrister, John Harrison, admitted the pair did not intend to finish the job for which they had been paid, but said his involvement was limited.

Nigel Edwards, for Michael Dolan, who was jailed for two years, said the teenager accepted he overcharged for work but had no real empathy or insight.

Emma Bennett, for Edward Dolan, jailed for 15 months, said his asthma, obesity and knee and toe pains, would make any prison sentence hard to cope with.

Judge Armstrong heard that building and gardening experts said the £17,500 work on the home of the first victim was worth no more than £1,800.
