Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said Russia should not be dictated to by liberal Western values

The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  

The demand comes less than a month before the start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi when a number of participants and visitors are expected to stage protests against laws banning the promotion of homosexuality to young people.  

President Vladimir Putin - who signed the legislation into force - has promised to make sure that gay and lesbian 'athletes, fans and guests feel comfortable at the Olympic Games.'

The spokesman for the church - which 
is seen as close to Putin - said Russia should not be dictated to by 
liberal Western values, and urged a referendum on a return to a Soviet 
law enacted by Stalin which criminalised homosexuality.

'There is no question that society should discuss this issue since we live in a democracy,' said Vsevolod Chaplin.   

'For this reason, it is 
precisely the majority of our people and not some outside powers that 
should decide what should be a criminal offence and what should not.'

He
 urged in an interview with pro-Kremlin Izvestia website:  'I am 
convinced that such sexual contacts should be completely excluded from 
the life of our society.

'If we manage to do this through moral pressure, all the better.

'But if we need to revert to assistance from the law, then let us ask the people if they are ready for this.'

Chaplin is seen as a powerful figure within the church and his call has been echoed by MPs.

The Kremlin did not immediately respond.  

'If you stage a referendum in Russia,
 90 percent would back both the death penalty and the idea of shooting 
all homosexuals,' said gay pride parade organiser Eduard Murzin.  

'By discriminating against minorities, the authorities want to deflect attention away from other problems.'

Clergyman Chaplin recently accused Western governments of being out of touch with values elsewhere in the world. 

'Western
 civilization still cannot realize that its model of social order is 
shared by the minority of people in the world,' he said.  

The demonstration in a Moscow cathedral by Pussy Riot was linked to the church's alleged close ties to Putin.  

Two singers were jailed after the protest which Putin branded 'hooliganism'.
