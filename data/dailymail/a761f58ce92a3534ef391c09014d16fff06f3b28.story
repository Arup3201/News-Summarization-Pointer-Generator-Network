The Los Angeles International Airport shooter accused of killing a federal security screener and wounding three others last month appeared in court for the first time Wednesday sporting cuts on his face and a tracheostomy plug in his throat cut.

A federal judge ordered Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, held without bond pending trial, saying the alleged shooter posed a danger to the community and was a potential flight risk.

Ciancia, who was critically wounded by police during the shooting incident at one of the world's busiest airports, is charged with killing a Transportation Security Administration officer and committing an act of violence at an international airport.

Because of his injuries, he was prevented from making an initial court appearance in the days following his arrest.

But he appeared at a hearing on Wednesday at a jail in Rancho Cucamonga, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.

Ciancia
is accused of walking into Terminal 3 at the airport, removing an 
assault-style rifle from a bag and opening fire on an unarmed TSA agent 
standing at the entrance to security checkpoint.

Authorities
say he then went past metal detectors through the checkpoint and into 
the airplane-boarding area, shooting and wounding two other TSA 
employees and a traveler before he was critically wounded in a gunfight 
with airport police.

Checks: The FBI was granted a warrant to search the cellphone of Paul Ciancia, 23, on Monday

The
court appearance comes after it was revealed federal agents are 
investigating the possibility that the alleged gunman believed in a 
conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government.

The
FBI were given a warrant in early November to search Paul Ciancia's 
cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or 
activities of the United States government, including the existence of a
plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents.

Ciancia, an unemployed motorcycle 
mechanic, got a ride to LAX on November 1, walked inside and began 
targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities 
said.

By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured.

A
note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent
reference to the new world order belief that holds an international 
cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms 
of Americans, authorities said.

Perceived
masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several 
generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. 
Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression 
for the gunman remains unclear.

The TSA does not regularly feature as a
target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied 
extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

More
typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans
to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said.

Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups.

The rant in his note also spoke of how
TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar 
term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA.

A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting

Conspiracy: A long note found in Ciancini's bag mentioned the New World Order, authorities have said

Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims.

One of those officers, Tony Grigsby, spoke for the first time publicly, saying he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him in the right foot.

He hobbled with a cane outside his South Los Angeles home, where he fought back tears recalling Hernandez as a wonderful person who will be missed.

'Only now it has hit me that I will never see him again,' Grigsby said.

Co-workers, friends and others gathered Monday night for a tribute to Hernandez at a beach near the airport.

'He was loved,' Jose Araujo, one of hundreds of people who gathered at Dockweiler State Beach, told KNBC-TV. 'He's going to be missed and he's never going to be forgotten.'

The other wounded TSA officer has been released from the hospital, the agency said, and the condition of high school teacher Brian Ludmer, who was shot in the calf, was upgraded from fair to good.

Ciancia remained in critical condition and any court appearance on charges of first-degree murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport will depend on when his doctors say he's ready, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
