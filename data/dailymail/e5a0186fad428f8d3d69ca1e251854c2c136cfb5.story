For families planning a ski trip in Europe this Christmas, they are being urged to compare costs before they book.

Doing so could save a family of four as much as £328 on a week's ski passes - simply by opting for Germany as opposed to France.

The latest research shows substantial savings in other countries, as well: €58.50 (£46) will buy a six-day pass for a child in Italy, but in France, the same child's pass will run €200 (£159).

Outside of the Eurozone, the best bang for your buck can be found in Pamporovo, Bulgaria (pictured)

The latest research from leading travel money provider, International Currency Exchange (ICE), has also found that a family of four (two adults and two children) could wind up paying just €486 (£385) for six day ski passes in Germany.

A great deal, when compared to the €900 (£713) it would cost in France for the same time period.

This is a saving of €414 (£328) or 85 per cent.

Germany comes out on top for value within the Eurozone, while Pamporovo in Bulgaria, though outside the Eurozone, is the cheapest of all resort costs studied.

France is the priciest of many European ski resorts with six day ski passes for a family of four topping €900

By opting for Germany instead of Courchevel (pictured), a family of four could save up to 85 per cent

In Pamporovo, a six day ski pass will come in at just €114 (£90) - less than half the cost of a pass in France or Switzerland. 

Koko Sarkari, chief operating officer of ICE said: 'Ski pass costs are simply part and parcel of any skiing holiday but can make a big dent in the holiday budget.'
