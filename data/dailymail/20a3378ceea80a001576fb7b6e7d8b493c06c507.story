The man who attacked Michael Bay with an air conditioner was an extortionist who was trying to disrupt filming on Transformers 4, according to the director.

He told TMZ Live that he paid local businesses to shut down while she shot the action film in their neighbourhood but this particular man held out for more money.

According to the director he then allegedly tried to ruin scenes by turning on an electric saw and making other noises when the cameras rolled.

Victim: Michael Bay claims the man who attacked him on the Hong Kong set of Transformers 4 was an extortionist hellbent on disrupting filming

48-year-old Bay revealed on his blog on 
Thursday what happened, and filled in details about the violent assault 
by the 'drugged up zombie,' saying: 'The story being passed around is 
not all true!'

'Yes, some drugged up guys were being belligerent a**es to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong,' explained the Pearl Harbor director on MichaelBay.com

'One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks.

'Every vendor where we shot got paid a fair price for our inconvenience, but he wanted four times that amount. I personally told this man and his friends to forget it we were not going to let him extort us,' he further explained.

'He didn’t like that answer. So an hour later he came by my crew as we were shooting, carrying a long air conditioner unit.

'He
walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked, threw 
the air unit on the floor and pushed him away,' explained Bay about the 
attack that was first reported by TMZ.

'That’s when the security jumped on him. But it took seven big guys to subdue him. It was like a Zombie in Brad Pitt’s movie World War Z,' he exclaimed, describing the man's drug-induced strength.

'He lifted seven guys up and tried to bite them. He actually bit into one of the guards Nike shoe, insane. Thank god it was an Air Max, the bubble popped, but the toe was saved.

'Then it took fifteen Hong Kong cops in riot gear to deal with these punks. In all, four guys were arrested for assaulting the officers. After that, we had a great day shooting here in Hong Kong,' he added.

TMZ claims that there was only one 
attacker and reports of two men involved are false, despite authorities 
naming two brothers as the main perpetrators.

A police spokeswoman had earlier said that two 
brothers, surnamed Mak, aged 27 and 28, approached Bay on the set for 
the American science fiction film and the younger brother demanded 
payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900, £8,000).

As a discussion ensued in a busy area 
of Hong Kong island, the elder Mak reportedly walked up and assaulted the director,
the spokeswoman said, adding that the elder brother attacked three police officers who tried to intervene.

The
younger brother was arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault, 
while the elder Mak was also arrested on suspicion of assault, she said.

Bay
sustained injuries to the right side of his face, although he declined 
to seek treatment, the spokeswoman said, adding she did not believe his 
injuries were serious.

When Reuters visited the scene after the assault, the film crew and others working on the set declined to comment.

The three police officers were treated in hospital for minor injuries, while it was reported that the younger Mak asked to be taken for treatment, saying he did not feel well.

According to reports, also arrested at the scene was a third man surnamed Chan. All three are in custody and police are investigating.
