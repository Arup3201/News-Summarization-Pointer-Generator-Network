A group of care home staff have been sacked after allegedly mimicking elderly residents and trying on their clothes then posting the pictures on Facebook.

Five workers at Bramble Hollow care home, in Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne and Wear, have been dismissed following the ‘appalling’ incidents.

It is understood they posed for photographs while dressed in the elderly residents’ clothes before posting the pictures on the social networking site.

Residents and relatives at the purpose-built home for over 55s have told how they have been left shocked by the incident.

A Bramble Hollow resident said: ‘I keep myself to myself, but I’ve heard things. I heard rumours of staff wearing old people’s clothes, I think in the home.’

A visitor to the home, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We heard that people had been sacked.

‘Apparently it was for messing round, which isn’t very nice for the people here.’

Housing 21, which runs Bramble Hollow, confirmed an investigation has been carried out into the allegations, which resulted in five members of staff being dismissed.

Victoria Barclay, regional operations director for Housing 21, said: ‘A recent investigation led to the dismissal of five members of our care staff at Bramble Hollow.

‘Housing 21 has a strict social media policy in place to protect customers and staff and any breach of this policy is taken very seriously.’

Age UK Sunderland boss Alan Patchett has slammed the behaviour of the staff involved.

He said: ‘I am shocked that this type of behaviour should go on in care premises in Sunderland.

‘It’s absolutely appalling that care workers should display such a lack of respect towards the residents in their care.’

Bramble Hollow was opened in 2011 and consists of 48 purpose built apartments - it also has on-site care and support services.
