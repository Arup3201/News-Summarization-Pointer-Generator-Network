This is the moment a rescue operation was launched after a swimmer narrowly missed being hit by a 4,000 tonne cargo ship in the River Blyth because he said it  was a 'cheaper' swim than the local pool.

Volunteers from Blyth RNLI, police and the local coastguard team all attended the scene. It is believed the man was drunk when he risked his life and entered the water.

The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon and it prompted a safety warning from the RNLI’s volunteer crew at Blyth who urged people not to risk their lives.

The swimmer was observed by a port employee and a person on the shore as well as a port employee who was involved in the berthing of the Karla C.

The two observers said they had seen a person swimming in the river near the cargo ship just after 3pm as it was being ferried by a local pilot vessel to Battleship Wharf in the Port of Blyth.

The video and pictures of the rescue operation were taken by on-board cameras moments after the near fatal collision with large cargo vessel Karla C.

The cargo ship had just travelled from the port of Vilanova in Spain and it was nearing the end of its voyage and travelling at a relatively slow speed when the swimmer was first spotted near the ship. 

A lifeboat was subsequently launched from Blyth and three volunteers were sent to attend the scene. Despite their presence and their warnings about the dangers involved the man refused to get into the lifeboat and rejected their assistance.

The swimmer, who appeared to be drunk, then told the volunteers, 'I'm coming for a swim in here because its cheaper than the local pool.'

The man was informed of the presence of a plethora  of smaller boats which were working on the river and he was warned that they could pose a threat to his safety. 

After some discussion between the volunteers and the swimmer the man eventually took their advice and he swam towards a ladder and made his way to safety.

Immediately after the incident the police and the local coastguard team spoke to the swimmer.

Blyth RNLI Deputy Launching Authority (DLA) Paul Raine told ChronicleLive: 'Is it really worth risking your life going swimming in the cold water of a working harbour to save paying a few pounds to visit the local heated swimming pool?'
