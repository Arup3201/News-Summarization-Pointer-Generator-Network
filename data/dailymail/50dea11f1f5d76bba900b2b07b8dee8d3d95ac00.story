OJ Mayo led the way with 22 points from the bench as the Milwaukee Bucks thrashed the New York Knicks 95-79 in front of a sold-out crowd of over 18,500 at the O2 Arena.

The 27-year-old guard was one of five Milwaukee players in double figures as they cruised past the Knicks on Thursday night in London.

Brandon Knight also had 20 points, while Giannis Antetokounmpo (16), Khris Middleton (14) and Zaza Pachulia (11) also reached double figures in another impressive team performance by Jason Kidd’s side.

The defeat for the Knicks was their 16th in a row and 26th in their last 27 matches. It was also a third straight loss against the Bucks this season.

‘It’s not good enough and we have to get better,’ New York Knicks head coach said. ‘We have to work harder than what we are and put more time and effort in to get the results that we want.

‘We have played against this team four times including pre-season and they’re just better than us.’

Thursday night’s game was the fifth regular-season contest to be staged at the arena in south London since 2011, and one of the most one-sided.

Two years is a very long time in basketball. In January 2013, the Knicks came to London and brushed aside a Detroit Pistons side 102-87 on their way to finishing second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference.

This team is not even a shadow of that side, and they return home with their league-worst record at a dire 5-36 with their next win seemingly a world away.

Even the return of Carmelo Anthony - their superstar player – from injury couldn’t keep things close against a young, dynamic Bucks side that moved to 21-19 for the season and remained well and truly on course for a play-off spot in the Eastern Conference.

London fans will at least be happy that Anthony was on the court after making the long trip over having missed the previous six games with a knee injury.

Anthony played 27 minutes and scored 25 points, but they were all in vain for the London 2012 Olympic basketball gold medallist.

It was a superstar’s performance from Anthony in a losing effort in front of some football superstars, including Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba, Cesc Fabregas and Jack Wilshere.

But Anthony’s efforts were nowhere near enough for this struggling New York team on Thursday at the O2 Arena.

For the Knicks, the damage was done early, very early, and there was no way back.

Just three minutes into the game, an alley-oop pass from Knight to ‘Greek freek’ Antetokounmpo had the Bucks off to a 12-0 head start, and with just give minutes played, New York head coach Fisher had already burned two timeouts with his team 14-0 behind.

‘It is just a recurring act,’ Anthony said. ‘The same things are happening over and over again. I wasn’t expecting to be 14 points down but it happened and we are the only people who can control that.

‘We have dug ourselves in a deep hole right now, so the only thing we can do is keep trying to get better.’

Tim Hardaway Jr finally got the Knicks on the board midway through the first quarter and it sparked a 7-0 run that got New York back within touching distance.

But a 12-0 run towards the end of the period propelled the Bucks into what seemed like an already unassailable 31-13 lead at the end of the first quarter.

Already, at that stage, it was just a matter of how many the Bucks would win by.

The Knicks did at least manage to put up a better fight in the second period, but Milwaukee still edged it 25-24 to take a dominant 56-37 lead into half-time.

To have any chance of getting back into the game, New York needed to start the second half fast and eat away at Milwaukee’s big lead.

But it was the Bucks who kept their foot firmly on the accelerator, scoring the first six points of the third quarter, by the end of which their lead had stretched to 82-56.

Coach Fisher decided enough was enough for Anthony on his return for injury. After playing 27 minutes in three periods, his night was done with the Knicks’ chances of victory gone.

‘He hadn’t played for a couple weeks and with the knee situation we were trying to be as smart as possible there,’ Fisher said about pulling Anthony. ‘With the game where it was I thought it was a good time to give him a rest.’

Anthony added: ‘I feel my body responded very well. I had a chance to get some rest and the two-week programme we implemented at the beginning of the year really paid off.’

‘It was regular rotation at the end of the third quarter and then it was a coach decision but overall I felt pretty good.’

A three-pointer from Langston Galloway brought New York within 11 points, but that was as close as they got, and the Bucks pulled away once more to claim a London victory.

It was a third straight win for Bucks head coach Kidd at the O2 Arena having been a Knicks player in 2013, and coach of the Nets in 2014 for their victories in London.

‘I love the international atmosphere,’ Kidd said. ‘As a player and a coach I’ve had some success and been very fortunate. Coming international I’ve always enjoyed being able to showcase my talent as a player and also watching the greatest players play basketball.’
