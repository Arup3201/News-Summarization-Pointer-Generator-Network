Super League bosses hope to stage a one-off fixture in London as early as 2016 as they aim to raise the profile of rugby league in the capital.

Rugby league chiefs have seen their union counterparts successfully stage club matches at Twickenham in recent seasons and they hope to follow suit - albeit on a smaller scale initially.

'I suspect it will be a long time before we're doing it on the scale that Premier Rugby does,' Super League general manager Blake Solly told the Yorkshire Post.

'But I am reasonably confident that we'll have two big Super League sides playing in London in 2016 or, if not, certainly 2017.

'A Wigan v St Helens or Leeds Rhinos v Hull FC match would be attractive there; I don't see why in the future we can't see a game like that which draws huge amounts of people to it as a one-off event.'

Wembley, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, West Ham's Olympic Stadium, Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road and Fulham's Craven Cottage have been mooted as potential venues.

The capital, of course, is without a Super League presence for the first time since its inception in 1996 after the London Broncos were relegated at the end of last season.

The Challenge Cup final has been staged at Wembley every year since 2007, with the 2014 showpiece between Leeds and Castleford attracting a crowd of 77,914.

The Emirates Stadium is said to be among a host of stadiums which could host rugby league in London
