A family home was left covered in tumbleweeds this week after wind storms swept through west Texas.

Frustrated homeowner Josh Pitman was expecting to spend the entire week clearing away the debris, which had piled up to the roof on one side of his house.

Mr Pitman said it was the 'most ridiculous thing' he has ever seen, with the giant balls of dry plants also covering a large part of his garden.

Clean up: Mr Pitman had to clear away the plants on his own because the fire service classes it as yard waste

'Ridiculous': Mr Pitman was alerted to the build up of tumbleweed at his home in a text message from his wife

But he has been left removing the tumbleweed by himself, with the fire service arguing that because it was on his land, it is classed as yard waste.

Tumbleweeds can be formed by a number of plants that break away from their roots when mature and are carried by the wind.

The plants curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moist and are a common sight in steppe and desert areas, such as large parts of Texas and Arizona.

It is because of the abundance of tumbleweeds in the more barren parts of North America that they have become a symbol of isolation.

One of most common tumbleweeds in the U.S. is the Russian thistle, which is not native to North America.

It was brought over by accident by migrants from the Ukraine, who settled in South Dakota in the 19th Century.

Tumbleweed seeds, foliage and stems are eaten by a number of desert dwellers, including quail, ground squirrels, pocket mice, prairie dogs, kangaroo rats and mule deer.

He also revealed the problem could have been averted, where it not for the fact that he had pulled down a fence, which would have blocked the unwelcome visitors.

Mr Pitman said: 'You live here, the risks you take I guess. We're definitely in West Texas, where the wind blows.'

The bizarre sight in Midland came on Monday as 60mph winds wreaked havoc across the Permian Basin area.

Emergency services were called into action as roofs were ripped off buildings and vehicles flipped onto their sides.

Mr Pitman was alerted to the tumbleweeds on Monday by his wife, who had sent her husband a text message.

Speaking at the house, Mr Pitman told News West 9: 'It's just completely covered with tumbleweeds, most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I didn't even know this many tumbleweeds existed

Mr Pitman cleared the tumbleweeds by pushing them into a ditch behind his house, having been told he would have to deal with the problem on his own.

He added: 'I called the fire department and they said that since it was on my yard, it was considered yard waste and that I had to take care of it.

Unexpected: The homeowner had knocked down a fence which would have kept the tumbleweeds out

'They or the city wouldn't be able to do anything. So I figured, I got to do what I got to do.'

Tumbleweed is the name given to a number of plants which detach from their roots at maturity, and are carried by the wind. They form balls when they are dry and uncurl when moist.

The plants are mostly associated with isolated desert areas of the United States, largely thanks to their regular appearances in Westerns.

But North America's most common tumbleweed, the Russian thistle, is not native to the continent. It was instead brought over by accident by migrants from the Ukraine in the 19th Century.

The strong winds also brought problems in Stanton, where a grounded helicopter was flipped upside down, while a motorist had to be freed from an overturned truck in Martin County.
