Target is under fire from angry consumers over its use of predominantly white models to promote a new clothing line inspired by the recent remake of hit musical Annie, which is led by an African American actress. 

A Change.org petition issued by motivational speaker L'Sean Rinique Shelton, based in Bear, Delaware, calls for the retail giant to remove the 'disrespectful' in-store displays and apologize to the movie's 11-year-old star, Quvenzhané Wallis.

'In the current stench of racism and division amongst Americans, why would Target singlehandedly disrespect Quvenzhané Wallis and add more pain to injury as it relates to race relations?' poses Ms Shelton, a mother-of-three.

'Being African American is not ugly, it is not bad and we are sellable!' Ms Shelton states.

The petition, which has gathered over 3,000 signatures in a matter of hours, concedes that Target's online ads do include 'one token black girl in random Annie gear.'

The in-store displays, however, cast a Caucasian girl as the star model, who happens to be wearing the collection's main piece; the same $29.99 red dress worn by Quvenzhané at Target's collection launch.

'That special "Red Dress" is synonymous to Annie - not a random model that does not look like her!' Ms Shelton insists.

Taking issue: The petition concedes that Target's online ads do include 'one token black girl in random Annie gear' (left) but that the in-store posters focus around white models

Flop: Annie, which was produced by Will Smith and Jay Z among others, was released on December 19 to a largely negative critical response

Original: The petition points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of Annie was released - starring the pale, freckled redhead child star Aileen Quinn (pictured) - its marketing centered around Aileen's aesthetic

Backlash: It also mentions the 'major uproar' from those who were against an African American being cast in the movie in the first place. Pictured, a Tweet from March after Quvenzhané landed the role

Negativity: In response to such reactions (pictured) the petition poses, 'Is the reason why Target maliciously hid Quvenzhané Wallis or refused to use an African American girl to depict Annie in their ads?

Ms Shelton, herself a former actress raised in Queens, New York, points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of Annie was released - starring the pale, freckled redhead child star Aileen Quinn - 'everything was about Aileen Quinn or a character/person that emulated her.'

She argues: 'Why does African American actors have to beg for respect, especially as it relates to advertising? [sic]

'Despite most beliefs, African Americans are capable of portraying more than drug dealers, pimps, and other bastardized portrayals of our culture.

'Quvenzhané Wallis earned that role and we demand your respect.'

Lastly, the petition points to the 'major uproar' from those who were against an African American being cast in the movie in the first place.

Indeed, after Quvenzhané landed the role and appeared in the trailer for the film last March, hordes of people took to Twitter to voice their displeasure.

'Black Annie...? No... Annie always will be always should be a ginger! #notracist just traditional', wrote one.

'So this #Annie movie is all wrong. I wanna live in a colorless world but I will not stand for a black Annie. #EnoughSaid', lamented another.

Ms Shelton poses: 'Is the reason why Target maliciously hid Quvenzhané Wallis or refused to use an African American girl to depict Annie in their ads?'

Annie, which was produced by Will Smith and Jay Z, among others, was released on December 19.

Its critical response has been largely negative, earning it a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

'The new-look Annie hints at a progressive take on a well-worn story,' Rotten Tomatoes' consensus reads, 'but smothers its likable cast under clichés, cloying cuteness, and a distasteful materialism.'

In a statement made to Daily Mail Online, Target representative Jessica Carlson declined to issue an apology, stating instead: 'We had conversations with [Quvenzhane Wallis'] team about being in the campaign, but ultimately it did not come to fruition. 

'Fortunately, we had the pleasure of working with Ms. Wallis a number of times, including at a launch event in New York City in November. We had a great experience working with Ms. Wallis and appreciate her efforts in promoting this collection.'

Ms Carlson added: 'With regard to the marketing of the collection, girls from a variety of backgrounds were featured within the campaign, reflecting that anyone can embody the spirit and character of Annie.'
