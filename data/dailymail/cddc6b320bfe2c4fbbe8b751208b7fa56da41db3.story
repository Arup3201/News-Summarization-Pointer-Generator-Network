Germans are often considered to be more at one with nature than us prudish Brits.

And now residents of the country's third-largest city have been given the go ahead to strip off for all over sunbathing sessions in six designated spaces.

According to a report in TheAtlanticCities.com the six Urban Naked Zones are located in parkland, offering privacy, but also only minutes away from the busy city centre.

All over tan: Munich has introduced six Urban Naked Zones in the city for nude sunbathing

The 'zones' were introduced following the expiry of statewide laws controlling nude sunbathing last year.

The city's huge public park The Englischer Garten has been a nudist hang-out since the 1960s, with it's Schonfeldweise ('beautiful meadows') area being earmarked by nudist travel site naturisttravel.net  as one of the must-visit places in the country.

They say: 'From the origins of the modern-day naturist movement to naked airlines and naked hotels, a lot has been written about the Germans’ fondness for taking their clothes off in public. For much of the population of Munich, it’s almost part of their DNA.

No inhibitions: People Sunbathing at the Englishcer Garten

'Whenever the sun is out, you’ll find Münchner of all ages, shapes and sizes catching some rays as nature intended. It’s considered as much the perfect lunchtime escape from the stresses of a busy day for office workers as it a place for friends and families to gather at weekends, and the atmosphere is always convivial and laid-back.

'This being Germany, there’s no embarrassment whatsoever about the fact that everybody is naked - the park is named the English Garden because of the original style of the horticulture, not as an ironic way of poking fun at traditional British prudery.'

AtlanticCities.com reporter Feargus O'Sullivan said: 'What Germany does have is a strong cultural tradition that seeks to escape artifice and the pressures of city life to return to something supposedly more natural. Seen in this light, stripping off in public is the voluntary removal of a heavy mask, a return to unvarnished honesty rather than some titter-worthy peek-a-boo. Places where this is allowed to happen are spaces of truce, where there is a generally observed agreement that people will spare each other physical scrutiny and appraisal.'

Clothing-optional sun-seeking has been a common practice across Germany since the first fully naturist beach was set up in 1920.
