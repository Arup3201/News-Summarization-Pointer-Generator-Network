Modern-day Rasputin: Thierry Tilly, pictured today at the court of Bordeaux, southwestern France, persuaded 11 relatives to sell off their chateau and possessions

A British conman who brainwashed three generations of an aristocratic French family into handing over their £3.6million fortune was today jailed for eight years.

Thierry Tilly used mental manipulation to convince the Vedrines clan of a secret plot to kill them, leaving the 11 relatives so scared they locked themselves in their chateau near Bordeaux for years.

Over the course of almost a decade, the 48-year-old from Oxford persuaded the family - aged from 16 to 89 - to sell off their possessions and their turreted mansion.

Tilly has been nicknamed 'the guru' by local media and compared to Rasputin, a Russian mystic thought to have influenced Emperor Nicholas II.

Tilly became a confidante of the landed Vedrines in 2000 and gradually persuaded them to pour their money into a fake Canadian charity he claimed was set up to pay their 'protectors'.

In a case that has fascinated France, Tilly was accused of using mental manipulation and violence to convince them that they were in mortal danger from a cabal of freemasons, a European secret society and paedophiles.

The family claims he brainwashed them into believing they were the lost descendants of an ancient society called 'The Balance of the World'.

For five years, they barely left their castle in Monflanquin, 100 miles east of Bordeaux, terrified they would be killed.

Prosecutors called Tilly, who told the family that he could protect them, the 'Leonardo da Vinci of mental manipulation'.

The court in Bordeaux was told that Tilly used his 'superior intelligence' to ingratiate himself with the family.

French-born Tilly was today convicted of 
arbitrary detention, using violence against vulnerable people and 
abusing people weakened by 'psychological subjection'.

Manipulated: Christine de Védrines, pictured today with husband Philippe, says she was locked in a room for several months, deprived of food and beaten for resisting Tilly's lies

His accomplice, Jacques Gonzalez, 65, was sentenced to four years in prison.

Christine de Vedrines, who first alerted police to Tilly's actions, said today: 'Eight years is a small price to pay for
what he did to our family and children. The trial is behind us and 
we will do everything to rebuild.'

His lawyer Alexandre Novion had argued that the Vedrines, from 13th-century village of Monflanquin in southwestern France, had acted willingly.

'These 11 family members aren't ill, 
have their feet on the ground, a level of self-awareness,' he said. 'Eleven people 
manipulated by mysterious forces by a single man? The legal basis for 
case is weak.'

Despite the conviction, Tilly remained 
defiant, invoking his right as a British citizen and saying he would 
take his case to the European Court of Justice, news agency Sipa reported.

His lawyer, however, said he was not aware that his client was a British citizen.

Tilly was deemed mentally stable during 
his trial, and French media have reported that he has a history of lies and 
exaggerations.

Mind control: When Jean Marchand, left, denounced Tilly as a fraudster, his wife Ghislaine and son Francois, behind, branded him an 'agent of evil'

He claimed before the Bordeaux court that he was a 
member of the Habsburg dynasty, that he once almost played football for 
Marseille and that he knew former French President Francois Mitterrand.

His victims included Guillemette de Védrines, who died in 2010 aged 97, her three children Philippe, Ghislaine and Charles-Henri, the two brothers' wives, Brigitte and Christine, and five adult grandchildren.

Tilly's first victim was Ghislaine de Védrines, 66, who he met when he worked for her Paris secretarial college in 1999.

After barely registering the 'uncharismatic' man for the first year, she gradually found herself drawn to him, and introduced him to her family, the court heard.

Tilly claimed they were protected by a global network of secretive grandees, whose head, Mr Gonzalez, was a cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain.

As scrutiny intensified in France, Tilly convinced most of the family to decamp to Oxford, where they often failed to pay rent and were taken to court.

Anyone who resisted was punished severely. Christine de Védrines, 62, says she was locked in a room for several months, deprived of food and beaten.

She says he insisted she knew the number of a bank account that would lead to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar.

When Ghislaine's husband, Jean Marchand, a journalist, denounced Tilly as a charlatan, his wife and two children branded him an 'agent of evil'. Mr Marchand alerted the authorities, who refused to act because there were no legal complaints from the rest of the family.

Tilly was finally arrested in Switzerland in 2009 following a complaint by Christine, who escaped after confiding in her employer in Oxford.

When Mr Gonzalez was arrested in 2010, police found a BMW 645 with €86,000 in the boot, as well as expensive watches, bottles of fine wine and an 'opulent wardrobe'.

The case raises echoes of another 
controversial trial involving France's richest woman, 90-year-old 
L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, who was swindled by a French tax 
lawyer into giving him a private Seychelles island.
