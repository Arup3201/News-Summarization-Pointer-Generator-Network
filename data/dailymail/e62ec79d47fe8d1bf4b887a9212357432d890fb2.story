Sam Ellicott’s life changed last year, on November 9, when he turned on his car radio.

‘A specialist was on talking about aneurysms,’ recalls the 73-year-old grandfather.

‘I’d never heard of them before but he described them as a swelling in an artery that can cause fatal blood loss.

Lucky to be alive: Sam Ellicott had a dangerously large aneurysm

‘I wasn’t listening too intently at first. But then he said men aged 65 and over could be at risk — and that you wouldn’t know you had one as there were no symptoms'.

The presenter gave out a contact number for the local NHS aneurysm screening programme. Sam scribbled it on the back of his hand at the next set of traffic lights and called later that day.

The retired NHS administrator, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was booked to have an ultrasound scan in hospital the following Monday.

‘I just lay down on a couch and lifted my shirt, and they rubbed some jelly on my tummy. It only took about 15 minutes in all and they gave me the results immediately,’ says Sam.

It was bad news. He was told he had a large aortic aneurysm. That meant a section of his aorta — the largest artery in the body, which carries blood from the heart down to the bowel, liver, kidneys and legs — was weak and bulging, and could rupture at any time.

Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body, but the aorta is most prone to the problem.

Sam had been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — Britain’s fourth biggest killer in men over 65, after cancer, heart attacks and stroke.

Killer: It is estimated that 6,000 people die from aneurysms every year

An estimated 6,000 people — mostly men — die from them every year. Frighteningly, the condition often has no symptoms. ‘There’s usually no warning,’ says Jonothan Earnshaw, consultant vascular surgeon at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, and director of the NHS screening programme.

‘Generally speaking, you don’t know you’ve got one until it bursts. Most people die from a loss of blood. You can be perfectly well one day and dead the next'.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm may develop when the aorta wall loses its elasticity, he adds.

‘The aorta wall can stretch with age. That means the aorta can develop a bulge — an aneurysm. It usually takes a few years for the aneurysm to grow, but once the bulge is more than 5.5cm wide there’s a significant risk of it bursting'.

Although some aneurysms will never swell to that red alert of 5.5cm, about 50 per cent of people with the condition will eventually need treatment.

Sam Ellicott’s aneurysm was 6.5cm when he went in for his scan.

Four weeks later, surgeons at Heartlands Hospital, in Birmingham, carried out the life-saving operation.

The swollen section of his aorta was cut open and replaced with a synthetic tube. Tissue from the artery was then wrapped round the new tube and stitched into place.

‘I had to take it extremely carefully at first after the operation,’ says Sam.

‘But in a few months, I was completely back to normal'.

Not all aneurysm operations involve major surgery such as Sam’s. Sometimes the condition can be treated with keyhole surgery to insert a stent — a man-made narrow tube — inside the aneurysm itself, which reduces pressure on the artery.

High cholesterol, smoking and being overweight can all contribute to developing an aneurysm, as they all encourage fatty deposits in arteries.

These deposits cause inflammation, which makes artery walls lose their elasticity and bulge as a result.

The NHS is running a screening programme to cut deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms. Already available in 40 per cent of England, it started to roll out to the rest of the country last month.

All men in screening areas will receive a letter inviting them for a scan when they turn 65. Scotland also has a programme. Wales and Northern Ireland plan to start theirs from 2012.

‘Many of the men we see will have nothing to worry about,’ says Jonothan Earnshaw. ‘But we’ve found 130 men with a large aneurysm in the first two years of the programme.

‘Any of those could have burst and killed them'.

Sam is well aware this could have been his fate: ‘If I hadn’t been listening to the radio that day last November, there’s a real chance I might not have been here today. I really do feel incredibly lucky'.
