A man with an American police car has fallen foul of real police after parking on double yellow lines while he went to McDonald's for a snack.

Mark Knight, 33, parked the squad car - complete with the iconic NYPD badge emblazoned on the bonnet - in the centre of Guildford, Surrey, and went to the restaurant yesterday afternoon.

However, Surrey Police came to investigate the unusual scene and when they opened the boot of the blue and white car - which is authentic and has been used in Hollywood films - they discovered replica firearms and police equipment.

Out of his jurisdiction: Police search the replica NYPD squad car in Guildford, Surrey. It was parked on a double yellow line

Weapons: Police searched the vehicle and discovered numerous pieces of police equipment

A police armed response team were called to the High Street and officers with guns handcuffed Mr Knight, who hires the car out for special occasions, before placing him in the back of a police van.

Three Surrey Police cars and a transit van rushed to the incident as shoppers looked as the officers searched the powerful American Ford Crown Victoria.

Mr Knight, who lives in Churt, near Farnham, Surrey, has now been released without charge.

He claimed he had reported both the police equipment and the car when he bought them and said he was 'humiliated' by the experience. He has now made an official complaint.

He said: 'People were recording it, they were coming out of shops to see what was going on.

'The police are aware I have that vehicle and the stuff in the boot was checked five weeks ago.

'I wasn't impersonating anyone, it's part of my business, NYPD Cop Car Hire. I use it for charity events and don't charge them.'

Mr Knight says he normally gets a positive reaction from police, and has even been stopped and asked by officers who want to be pictured with it.

The man was arrested on suspicion of impersonating a police officer, possession of an offensive weapon and being in possession of items of police equipment

A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said: 'A 33-year-old man arrested in Guildford town centre yesterday on suspicion of impersonating a police officer has been released with no further action.

'The man was arrested around 2-30pm after police came across his vehicle, a replica police car with NYPD Police written on the sides, parked illegally in the High Street.

'Armed officers were called to the scene after the vehicle was searched and police equipment, including firearms, were found in the boot of the car. The firearms were examined and found to be decommissioned.'

She added: 'The man was also arrested on suspicion 
of possession of an offensive weapon and being in possession of items of
 police equipment after a canister resembling CS gas and a police baton 
were found in the car.

'However, further examination revealed that the canister contained dye and the baton was one used for training purposes.'

Surrey Police also confirmed it has received
 a complaint relating to this incident and it is being dealt with by 
the force's Professional Standards Department.
