Teen star-turned-bad girl Miley Cyrus has shocked the world again, this time appearing in the form of a twerking Michele Bachmann, mocking the federal government shutdown on Saturday Night Live.

Miley's skit featured the 20-year-old pop singer dancing in skimpy clothing in parody of her new song, 'We Can't Stop' - portraying the conservative Tea Party politician for a video titled 'We Did Stop The Government.'

SNL castmember Taran Killiam played House Speaker John Boehner and pranced around with Cyrus in his tightie-whiteys and a white wife-beater shirt.

Miley sang lyrics like 'If you're not ready for healthcare can we get a hell no, cuz we're gonna keep it shut down, DC is a closed town'

Offensive? Miley didn't skimp on the raunchy dance moves, even though she was portraying a vocal social conservative Congresswoman

They are both singing lyrics like ‘this is our House, this is our rules and we did stop (the government)’ and 'if you're not ready for healthcare can we get a hell no, cuz we're gonna keep it shut down. DC is a closed town.'

The former presidential candidate Bachmann was involved in a scandal earlier this week when Iowa state Senator Kent Sorenson resigned after a special investigator found it likely he violated ethics rules by taking money from political entities connected her, and then denying he'd done so.

She won't stop twerking: Miley wowed with two impressive musical performances on Saturday Night Live but her sketches mostly fell flat

Democrats say Speaker Boehner and his Republican colleagues in the House forced government shutdown in an attempt to defund ObamaCare, the health care law passed almost entirely by Democrats in 2009. 

The controversial music video parody shows Cyrus and Killam twerking wildly with tongues out, the new Miley Cyrus look, and throwing dollar bills around the room.

Elephants are featured throughout in the shape of costumes and statues, representing the Republican party. But the show didn't stop there.

Earlier on SNL, during her monologue, Cyrus appears on stage, saying: ‘I don’t apologise for my VMA 
performance. If I owe anyone an apology is the people who make the 
bottom halfs of shirts.'

She says her performance generated 'a lot of letters from angry mothers, turned-on fathers'.

Cyrus adds that she also got a complaint from the inventor of the giant foam finger.

‘There will be no twerking tonight. I used to think it was cool but now that white people are doing it, it seems kinda lame.’

Cyrus also offers some information on her former teen image.

‘I can give you an update on Hannah Montana… she was murdered.’

Cyrus starts her appearance on the SNL show in the green room getting ready, wearing the controversial onesie outfit she wore at the MTV VMAs, held in August in Brooklyn.

She is joined by singer an SNL cast member playing Robin Thicke, who performed with her on stage at the VMAs.

He walks in and says, ‘What’s up kid, are you ready to start grabbing at my junk while I half sing?’

An actor portraying Will Smith appears, saying: ‘My family and I are so excited to see you perform tonight. I just hope it’s G-rated. They are shocked by anything remotely sexual.’

Cyrus ends her green room appearance saying she is only 20 years old and needs the ‘freedom to grow up and make mistakes’.

‘And no matter what happens, I promise to always stay true to old Cyrus.’
