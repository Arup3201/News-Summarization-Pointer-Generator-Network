A couple that started a candy business from their kitchen have caught the eye of national retailers by making treats that look almost too good to eat. 

The delicacies, including candy mushrooms, buttons keys, have been put together by Andie and Jason Moore in their home in Dallas, Texas. It started out as a hobby, but a huge number of orders have meant that to them, it has become a full time job. 

Martha Stewart, Lonny, and Apartmenty Therapy have started selling Andie's Speciality Sweets online.  So many requests have come in that the pair now plans to expand their business.

Despite their success, the pair have never had any professional culinary training. 

The products available on Etsy range from $37.50 for a 50-piece set of realistic, peppermint-infused candy buttons, to $360 for a collection of 100 psilocybin mushrooms.

Breaking out of their shells: Andie and Jason Moore from Dallas, Texas, started Andie's Speciality Sweets as a shop on Etsy. Their unique technique to create the delicacies, such as these vanilla-infused shells, has caught the eye of top food retailers 

Mushrooms: The incredibly crafted sweets, such as these colorful fungi put together for St Patrick's Day, are completed at their home

Colorful variety: The couple, who dropped out of art school and have four kids together, make an assortment of shapes including owls, keys and buttons

Tree-like treats: These edible candy leaves fetch $150.00 for every 60 and were designed for Halloween 

Similarities: Included are these white and brown chocolate bears, complete with textured skin 

Secretive: In an interview with Yahoo Food, Andie wouldn't fully reveal her candy-making process  - but said they use complicated molds

Detail: On their website they say each product is 'hand sculpted, hand molded, hand poured, and given a special artistic tinkering'

Realistic: These edible feathers go for $59.00 for a dozen. They featured in the winter edition of Brides Magazine in 2013

Mixture: One of the quirkier items are candy mushrooms, which are packaged in bow-tied boxes 

Gold rush: A 15 piece box set of Chocolate Gold Druzys sell for $42.50. They are made with real, fair trade, 70% dark chocolate, vanilla, and sea salt

Neatly presented: The sweets are packaged up in boxes and distributed around the United States from their base in Dallas

Production line: The pieces are made on a table that was set up during 'nap time' - when their four children were asleep - but they are now looking to expand their sweet-making business 

Mentality: The pair's philosophy is: 'To Give Treats Unto Others As We Would Want Treats Given Unto Us'

Pricing: This set of 50 peppermint candy buttons is on sale online for $37.50
