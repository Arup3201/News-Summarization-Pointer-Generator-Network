The trial of alleged honeymoon killer Shrien Dewani is more likely than ever to collapse after a string of blows to prosecution evidence, a legal expert has claimed.

The South African Law Society's William Booth said he still believes Dewani's lawyers could apply to have the case discharged within days, after fresh claims it is 'short on evidence'.

South African law allows defendants to have their trial dismissed - without having to take the stand - if a judge decides prosecutors have presented a flimsy case.

Collapse: Lawyers for Shrien Dewani (pictured leaving the Western Cape High Court this week) could ask to have the case dismissed without him taking the stand after blows to the prosecution case, an expert said

'Many observers' now agree the trial has been 'rather short on evidence', according to a report today in the Sunday Telegraph.

Mr Booth previously said the millionaire's lawyers had 'strong reasons' to try and have the case discharged when the prosecution case closes - likely to be this week.

Today he repeated his view in an interview with MailOnline.

'It's probably more likely to be withdrawn the longer the case goes on,' he said.

'The high water mark of the state's case has still been the evidence of the three main witnesses, and based on their testimony the state would certainly struggle to secure a conviction.'

The first two of the witnesses were driver Zola Tongo and hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, both of whom were jailed for the murder of Anni - and Mr Booth claimed their evidence was 'riddled with inconsistencies'.

The third, hotel receptionist and 'middle man' Monde Mbolombo, has now admitted lying under oath during a previous case.

The hotel worker, who has been granted immunity in exchange for giving evidence, admitted doing so in the 2012 trial of fellow hijacker Xolile Mngeni - who died in jail of a brain tumour last month.

'You lied in the State v Mngeni?', prosecutor Shareen Riley asked earlier this month. 'That’s correct,' he replied.

Mr Booth, who is the chairman of the South African law society's Criminal Law and Procedure Committee, added: 'The court can look at the credibility of the witnesses - whether their evidence has been so poor it cannot be relied on.

'Certainly a strong case can be made out that the three main witnesses have given very poor evidence.

'The main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices so you must treat the evidence with caution. The last of the accomplice witnesses has already admitted lying previously.'

If the case is dismissed it would happen after all the prosecution evidence - which many expect to end this week.

Dewani's lawyers have declined to confirm whether they plan to make the application under section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

For it to succeed the judge would have to be convinced there is not enough evidence for a 'reasonable person' to convict Dewani, Mr Booth said.

That would be a tougher test for Dewani's lawyers than leaving it to 'beyond reasonable doubt' - but would save him from taking the stand.

'How's he going to be called as a witness?' said Mr Booth.

'There's the problem of his health - he's in a very fragile emotional state. It's quite something to get into that witness box'.

'Riddled with inconsistencies': Mr Booth criticised the evidence of driver Zola Tongo (above), who was jailed for Anni's murder. 'The main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices,' he added

He added previously: 'Although it is not down to him to prove his innocence, a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence.' 

The prosecution case was dealt a previous blow when evidence of Dewani's bisexuality was ruled irrelevant.

Presiding judge Jeanette Traverso ruled she would exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the 'German Master' gay fetish escort paid by Dewani, 34.

She said that Dewani's gay affairs despite his conservative Hindu background were not enough of a motive for murder - and besides, he had already disclosed his sexuality at the start of the case.

Mr Booth's is not the first warning that the case could collapse. Last month the judge had to warn reporters after Dewani suffered a 'panic attack' outside court as photographers allegedly surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses.

Judge Traverso told reporters: 'We want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done'.

She added that the media should 'treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity'. 

Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride Anni almost four years ago during their honeymoon to South Africa.

The state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000).

The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand  – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010.

But during gruelling cross-examination, Dewani's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in Tongo's story, highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after Mrs Dewani suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck. 

Francois van Zyl, who heads the defence team, also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating Dewani in the murder. 

The trial in Cape Town adjourned for the day on Thursday so Anni's family could grieve on the fourth anniversary of her death.

Grief etched on their faces, her parents Vinod and Nilam and brother Anish made a pilgrimage to the township street where her body was found slumped in an abandoned car. 

They were led in prayer by a Hindu priest as sympathetic onlookers began singing hymns, while passing buses slowed down to watch. 

The trial continues.
