George Zimmerman’s parents are suing 
Roseanne Barr, claiming that they’ve been unable to return to their home
 since the comedienne posted the address on Twitter two years ago.

Robert
 Zimmerman Sr. and Gladys Zimmerman filed the suit on Monday in state 
circuit court in Florida. They accuse Barr of trying to incite ‘a lynch 
mob to descend’ and carry out ‘vigilante justice.’

According
 to the suit, Barr published their Lake Mary address on March 29, 2012, a
 month after their son George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, the 
unarmed black teenager in Sanford, but before he was arrested.

Their son did not live with them and they didn't they have anything to do with the shooting, they point out.

The
 lawsuit alleges that Barr's tweets forced them to leave their home in 
the middle of the night and go into hiding. They are seeking unspecified
 damages, accusing her of intentionally inflicting emotional distress. 

However the Orlando Sentinel
 has reported that the date in the lawsuit - March 29, 2012 - does not 
correlate with what Zimmerman Sr. told them in a March 15, 2012, 
interview.

In that 
interview he said that he and his wife had already moved out of their 
home and gone into hiding because of death threats.

Actress Roseanne Barr published the Zimmerman's Lake Mary, Florida, address on March 29, 2012. She later tweeted: 'If Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt (re-tweet) his address again - maybe go 2 his house myself'

The
 suit also alleges that Barr violated Twitter's terms and conditions 
prohibiting publication of addresses and other confidential information.

After the first 
tweet, the suit alleges, Barr followed up with others, including: 'If 
Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt (re-tweet) his address again - maybe go
 2 his house myself.'

In
 July 2012, the couple launched a website asking for donations to help 
pay their 'greatly increased living expenses' after fleeing their home.

On the site, the couple said their lives had been turned upside down after their son's arrest - but that their real problems started when Roseanne had tweeted their names, address and phone number.

Zimmerman Sr. said: 'Almost immediately, threatening phone calls and letters were received.

'However, one in particular was 
alarming because it threatened to kill anyone with George’s DNA - it was
 not mailed, but was left at our front door. These threats were in 
addition to the constant media calls and visits. It was time to go.

'Literally,
 as I was helping Cristina into the car to leave, media representatives 
and others were not ringing our bell, but beating on our front door.

'We
 took a couple changes of clothes for each of us, medicines, and a few 
personal belongings and fled. However, when the media learned our new 
location, we were no longer safe there. At that point, we went from one 
location to another.

'It
 has been an extremely difficult existence. It’s been a challenge 
getting hotel rooms when we cannot provide our correct names, use credit
 cards, or produce any valid identification. Today, that is very much 
what our existence is.'

A jury acquitted Zimmerman of second degree murder in July 2013.
