The burned bodies of two dead women were found in the boot of a flaming car just a week after two other dead bodies were found in another vehicle.

Three of the four black victims found in Detroit, Michigan, were linked to escort services on classified adverts website Backpage, police said.

Demesha Hunt, 24, and Renisha Landers, 23, were found last Monday before two more women aged 28 and 29 were discovered on Sunday.

Ms Hunt and Ms Landers were found at 3pm on December 19 in the boot of a 2009 Chrysler 300C, reported the Detroit Free Press.

The other two women, who have not been identified, were burned beyond recognition and found at 1am on Christmas Day in a 1997 Buick LeSabre.

Police told the Detroit Free Press a tie that the killer might be targeting escorts is ‘disconcerting’ but they are not calling it a ‘serial pattern’.

‘We must continue to be vigilant in identifying any website which may potentially pose a threat to individuals,’ a police spokesman said.

Backpage hosts adverts for cars, flats and musicians amongst other things - as well as adult services such as strippers and chat lines.

Police spokesman

A lawyer for the website, which is owned by Village Voice Media in Phoenix, Arizona, has not yet commented on the incidents.

Earlier this month police said a woman sent a 16-year-old girl on hundreds of trips for sex and took 40 per cent of what she earned.

Satoria Youngblood allegedly posted a Backpage ad and police found out the girl was in a minor in an undercover sting in Southfield, Michigan.

Meanwhile a child sued Backpage for allowing her pimp to post naked photos of her, but a court ruled against her. The pimp was still jailed.

'The ads are what bring two people together. To start holding everyone liable for what happens in response to that ad would be quite an extension of liability'

‘The ads are what bring two people together,’ escort legal expert Paul DeCailly, of Tampa, Florida, told the Detroit Free Press.

‘To start holding everyone liable for what happens in response to that ad would be quite an extension of liability,’ he added.

A research group claims Backpage is the leader in adverts for adult services and has made $24million from them over the last year.
