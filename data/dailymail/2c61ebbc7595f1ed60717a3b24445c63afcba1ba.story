Family, friends and former co-stars came together to honour the 'generous thoughtful and fabulous' Lynda Bellingham at a touching memorial service in London today.

Her husband, Michael Pattemore, was joined by actresses Amanda Redman, Lesley Joseph and actor Christopher Biggins, at St Stephen's Church this afternoon.

Bellingham, best known for her long-running role as the mother in the Oxo TV adverts, died in her husband's arms in October after losing her battle with colon cancer.

The service of thanksgiving was held at the church that Bellingham and Pattemore married in 2008.

Mr Pattemore, who has spoken of his struggle to cope with his wife's death, arrived at the church with her sons, Michael and Robbie Peluso.  

Actors Christopher Biggins and Lesley Joseph, who read a poem Bellingham had written to her husband called Remember, were among the guests.

Actors Robin Askwith, Amanda Redman, Patricia Hodge and novelist Lynda La Plante were also among those who came to say a fond farewell.

Guests were given simple programmes for the service, with a photo of Bellingham printed on the front and a collage of personal pictures with family and friends on the back. 

Loose Women star Bellingham made headlines before her death when she announced she had decided to end her treatment to limit the amount of suffering her family would witness.

In her final weeks, she spoke openly about her illness and its effect on her family.

Her book - There's Something I've Been Dying to Tell You - discussed her illness in detail and spent weeks at the top of the best-seller lists.

One of the few tearful moments in the service was when Mr Pattemore told the 300-strong congregation that he clearly remembers his wedding day when 'my heart was bursting with happiness and now we are here again and my heart is bursting with sadness'.

He fought back tears and added: 'It breaks my heart that the one thing I could not protect her from was this disease called cancer.'

To warm applause Gyles Brandreth told the congregation 'love, laughter and friendship, those are the gifts Lynda gave us. Haven't we been blessed?'   

She was remembered as a thoughtful, maternal, generous and fabulous woman who was also a natural clown.

To more laughter Mr Brandreth also insisted that she could also dance no matter what the judges on the TV show Strictly Come Dancing said.

He spoke of Bellingham's career, which spanned TV and stage including Shakespeare, Calendar Girls, the sitcom Faith In The Future, All Creatures Great And Small and '16 years on the Oxo gravy train'.

Despite her successful comedy roles, it should not forgotten that Bellingham was a good actress and writer, he claimed.

'Her control and artistry would take your breath away,' he said. 

He jokingly described the bubbly actress as 'so sexy that even gay men fancied her, and she fancied them too'.

Mr Brandreth added: 'She fancied Biggins - I think that is why Michael has come in one of Biggins's cast-offs. 'She showed us how to live and then how to die with such grace and kindness.'

Biggins said that the laughter is the thing that he would always remember about her.

He said: 'She would have loved this full house and would have loved the laughter we have had. God bless you Lynda. We love you.'

Peter Delaney, who conducted the service which was joking dubbed as the second meeting of the Lynda Bellingham Appreciation Society after her funeral, noted that she had handpicked the details of how the event was to play out.

He joked: 'The contents of this service are Lynda's wishes because she planned her farewells. She was not a control freak but she like to know what was going on.'

Bellingham's charity work was recalled and there was also a call to help the oncologist who treated her.

Through the order of service Bellingham's family asked for donations to be made to Action Against Cancer 'so the wonderful Professor Justin Stebbing, who we both admired and loved, may carry on his great work'.

The tune There's No Business Like Showbusiness brought smiles to those who had come to pay their respects as it was piped out over the organ and brought the service to an end.
