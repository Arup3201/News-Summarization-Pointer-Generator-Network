A young nurse has hit out at a remorseless driver after he killed her brother while ploughing through a red light at double the speed limit.

Painting a heartrending picture of her family's pain, Hollie Butcher, 20, told 40-year-old Michael Moore: 'You've ruined my perfect family.'

Her brother, Jamie, 22, was hurled more than 40 metres when Moore's 
powerful Chrysler Cruiser hit him on a pedestrian crossing while traveling at 58mph in a 30mph zone. He died instantly.

Moore, who had previous convictions 
for speeding and burglary, showed no emotion as he was jailed for just 43 months.

Moore, of Parson Drove, near Wisbech, Cambs, admitted causing death by dangerous driving after the horrific crash in Wisbech in February 2011.

Devastated Hollie said after he was sentenced: 'Mr Moore has ruined the most perfect family he could have ruined.

'Jamie was my big brother. I'm never going to have that again, I haven't got a brother, he's taken that from me through his recklessness.

'Sitting at home, seeing your parents crying all the time. He doesn't realise we've got to go through this forever, there's only so much moving on you can do.

'It's impossible for us, it's not going to happen.'

Choking back tears, the distraught veterinary nurse added: 'Mr Moore's going to come out of prison and we're still going to be sitting here grieving.

'We have got to live with this for the rest of our lives because we knew him.

'When I have children they'll never get to meet the best uncle they could have known.

'We knew his laugh, we knew his voice and that man has destroyed that.

'He has destroyed a lovely person.'

As impassive Moore was led away to start his sentence Jamie's outraged stepfather, Stephen Green, screamed at him: 'Do you understand what you have done?'

Mr Green, of Wisbech, said last night: 'I did lose control a bit at the end of the case because he just showed a blank expression. There was no remorse.

'We had been warned that it was likely to be three or four years.

'I know nothing's going to bring Jamie back but Mr Moore could be out in a few months.'

'Christmases, birthdays, family holidays - we're never going to have that again, every Christmas there's going to be an empty chair.'

Jamie's shattered mum, Tina Butcher, said outside court: 'I have often said that Jamie was too good for this world. Our loss is heaven's gain.'

Moore changed his plea to guilty on the eve of his trial at Cambridge Crown Court.

David Matthew, prosecuting, said Jamie was 'a happy, friendly man', who had been accepted by Manchester University for a post-graduate course just the day before he died.

Mr Matthew said he was the son of a close, hard-working family who had left home at 4pm to walk into Wisbech town centre to withdraw Â£20 from a cash machine.

Popular Jamie was killed instantly.

CCTV showed that the crossing lights had turned to amber 3.2 seconds, and red 0.2 seconds, before the crash, the court heard.

Moore had been 82 metres from the crossing when the lights turned amber but he had not braked until after he hit his tragic victim.

Sentencing Moore, Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told him: 'This is indeed a tragic case.

'It's tragic in one sense for you because you will, I have no doubt, have this on your conscience and memory for the rest of your life.

'But it's even more tragic for the family of the deceased whose lives have been shattered.

'Nothing I can do, in terms of the sentence, can bring him back.'

Jamie graduated from De Montfort University, Leicester, last summer with a degree in psychology.

The former Neale Wade College student's great ambition was to work for highly-respected human rights organisation Amnesty International, his grieving family said.
