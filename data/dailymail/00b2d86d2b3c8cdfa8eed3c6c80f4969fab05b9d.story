At 2.20am today, a 36-year-old woman was arrested Central Railway Station after a call from a member of the public.

She has been taken to Sydney City Police Station where she is assisting police with their inquiries. 

The woman somehow managed to evade ushers and security inside the building to gain access to the eternal flame - which is roped off.

Sydney City Police superintendent Mark Walton said the woman stole one of three flags inside the building and burned on of them

Mr Walton said penalties for vandalising war memorials are 'open to interpretation' depending on the significance of the damage.

Malicious damage in NSW carries a maximum penalty of five years jail. 

Minister for Veterans Affairs Victor Dominello and RSL NSW President Don Rowe have condemned the incident.

'Not only is this criminal behaviour, it's deeply disrespectful of the memorial and all it represents,' Mr Dominello said in a statement.

'It is deeply concerning that any person would seek to desecrate the Australian flag.

Police arrived at the scene of the war memorial at 1.15pm after reports a woman had burned the flag

The flag was set on fire in Hyde Park, in Sydney's CBD

'Doing so on this sacred site makes it all the more reprehensible.'

Mr Rowe urged members of the public to come forward with information.

'Veterans and their families will be outraged by this attack on a sacred monument dedicated to thousands of Australians who have fought and died for their country,' he said.

She was wearing a black and white dress with black long sleeves and ballet flats.
