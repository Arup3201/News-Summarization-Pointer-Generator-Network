Sol Campbell has backed former England team-mate and QPR defender Rio Ferdinand to defy his critics and prove his worth after a disappointing start to life at Loftus Road.

Ferdinand joined Rangers on a one-year deal in July, linking up with his former West Ham boss Harry Redknapp in the process, after 12 successful years at Manchester United.

However, things haven’t entirely gone to plan for the 35-year-old, with him coming under a barrage of criticism for his performances so far this season as the R’s sit rock-bottom of the Premier League.

Rio Ferdinand has received the backing of Sol Campbell as he struggles for form in QPR's defence

Campbell, who played alongside Ferdinand for England, said he can still cut it in the Premier League 

Campbell, who built up a formidable partnership with Ferdinand at the heart of the Three Lions defence in the 1990s, still believes the former England captain has plenty to offer at the highest level.

When speaking to Sportsmail at the London Sports Writing Festival he said: ‘I have no doubt in my mind that Rio can still compete at the top.

‘I came back to Arsenal when I was 35 and played at the highest level for six months so why can't he?

‘At that time I felt I was the best defender around in the second half of that season (2009-2010) too and should have gone to the World Cup, so there’s no reason why Rio can’t have a similar impact to that at QPR.

Ferdinand went on The Jonathan Ross Show to announce he would be retiring at the end of the season

Ferdinand was dropped by manager Harry Redknapp to the bench for QPR's defeat to Liverpool last Sunday 

‘Once Rio gets what QPR are and the club understand him, everything will be fine.’

Considering QPR’s current plight, supporters wouldn't have been entirely pleased to have heard Ferdinand reveal his intention to hang up his boots at the end of the current season on The Jonathan Ross show aired on Saturday night.

However, Campbell has backed Ferdinand to win over the R’s faithful, and says they must remain patient with him as he adjusts to surroundings at the club.

He added: ‘I don’t think anyone can question Rio’s hunger and desire for the game – he’s a top professional. I think people have to remember that he is getting on now - he’s not a 21-year-old anymore.

‘Once you go into the latter stages of your career you have to take extra care of yourself. There’s a completely different way of approaching the game.

Ferdinand and Campbell were rock solid at the heart of the England defence for many years

‘There’s a way of playing, resting, looking after your body - it’s totally different. Harry (Redknapp) will know that.

‘When Arsene Wenger brought me back to Arsenal he had to manage me in a completely different way to when I was at the club before.

‘I was obviously getting fit in pre-season, but I wasn’t training every day. I would play and then rest and have a warm down. As long as you’re ready for the game it’s fine.

‘If you need your rest period you need it at the end of the day. There’s always a way of working around it though and I’m sure QPR and Rio will realise that and reap the rewards in the end.’
