A woman searching for April Jones on the morning after she disappeared saw Mark Bridger on a hill close to his home clutching a black bin bag.

Carwen Sheen was driving with a friend at around 9am on October 2 looking for the five-year-old when she saw the former abattoir worker holding the bag close to his Land Rover, which he had left by the side of the road with its door open and the engine still running.

The bag was rolled up in his hand, with the end hanging down, and today the witness told the court: 'There was something in it, not very big,'.

April vanished while playing with her friend near their homes in Machynlleth, Powys, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year. The prosecution say April was abducted by Mark Bridger, 47, who drove her off in his Land Rover and murdered her

She recognised Bridger and added: 'I was driving down and I came round the corner and I've seen his vehicle with the door open.

'I was with a friend. She made a comment: "What's he doing there?"

'I've seen him coming down the side of the bank. He was holding a black bin bag. It was like it was wrapped up.

'It was rolled up. It was wrapped like a sausage. There was a bit at the end hanging down like it hadn't been tucked in properly.

'We spoke in the car and then Mark just drove past and that was the last I'd seen of him.'

Mrs Sheen saw Bridger on a road close to Ceinws, where he was living at the time.

The defendant nodded in the dock as the black bin bag was discussed and mouthed the word 'yes' when his barrister, Brendan Kelly QC, confirmed with the witness that she had seen the black bin bag in his hand.

The court also heard from a neighbour who saw Bridger reversing into his drive after April went missing the previous evening.

Paul and Coral Jones arrived today at Mold Crown Court to hear more evidence in Mark Bridger's trial

His employer Cheryl Harper also gave evidence, saying she met him on the following morning.

They discussed the fact that the community was out searching for the schoolgirl, who suffered from cerebral palsy, she added.

A local postman also spoke to Bridger, telling the court he 'asked him if he had seen and heard about the news'.

'He [Bridger] appeared quite shocked. He asked me what sort of vehicle they were looking for,' the postman added.

A witness to the conversation said Mark claimed not to have seen the news because he did not have a television.

'Mark looked genuinely surprised,' the man added.

The heartbroken parents of April, Paul and Coral Jones arrived in court today to hear more evidence in the trial, both sported pink ribbons that they had begun wearing when their daughter disappeared.

The evidence comes after a schoolgirl told how alleged killer Mark Bridger asked her for a sleepover on the day April went missing.

The murder trial jury heard how the 10-year-old girl said she was approached by Bridger just hours before April vanished outside her home.

Former abbatoir worker Bridger allegedly asked the girl - a friend of his daughter - if she wanted to sleep over at his house.

In a taped police interview played to court she said she was speaking to her mother about going on her bike when Bridger approached.

She said: 'Mark drove up and put his window down and started talking to me.

'My friend was there with me and watching him talk to me, he wound down the window and heard what I said to my mum about going on a bike ride.

'He asked me if I could go and have a sleep over with his daughter at his house, his daughter is a friend of mine, she is 10 as well.

'It was odd that he offered me to come for a sleep over, I said: "Oh that would be great".

'And he said: "Well that's sorted then".

'He didn't say anything else to me and didn't ask what time or day. He drove off the estate and we went on a bike ride.'

The girl said she spotted Bridger 10 minutes later lying down in his LandRover with a newspaper over his lap and talking into a walkie-talkie.

The girl said: 'He was lying down to his side, not hiding, you could see him.

'He was in the driver's seat and I walked past on the pavement on the other side.

'He didn't say anything but he put his thumbs up to me, he carried on lying down.

'He was speaking into the walkie talkie but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

'He was looking at the newspaper, he wasn't trying to hide the walkie-talkie but it was really odd.

'I smiled at him and rode really fast home - because he was acting really odd.'

The jury were taken by coach to visit the white cottage named Mount Pleasant, the former home of defendant Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales who is on trial for the abduction and murder of the five-year-old

The schoolgirl told the officers she had never slept over or played at his house.

She said it was 'odd' that he asked because she had never stayed at Bridger's daughter's house before.

The schoolgirl said she saw April playing on her bike before she vanished.

She saw her cycling down a hill with her friend and playing by the garages where she was last seen alive.

The 10-year-old - who was sat in a school uniform - wept as she was interviewed by officers.

At the beginning of the interview a specialist police officer told her: 'You are not in any trouble at all but we really need your help.

'We are trying to find your friend April Jones. So thank you for helping.'

Mold Crown Court also heard from the 10-year-old's mother who heard Bridger in the background while she talked to her daughter on the phone.

She said: 'My daughter phoned me from her mobile phone at 5.47pm I asked her where she was and she said she was by the garages with her friend.

'It was during this conversation I heard a man's voice in the background.

'I thought it could be my husband, I asked my daughter: "Who are you talking to? Is that daddy?"

'She told me it was Mark Bridger at this point I didn't think any more about this.'

The mother told the court how on the evening April vanished children knocked at her door to say she had been kidnapped and could they help search.

April, who suffered from cerebral palsy, was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, when she was allegedly snatched by father-of-six Bridger

Elwen Evans QC, for the prosecution, read the statement of Eleanor Holt, deputy head at Machynlleth Junior School, who saw the defendant at a parents' evening hours before April was allegedly snatched.

She said she spoke to Bridger regarding his daughter, who was a pupil at the school.

She said: 'I think something gave me the impression that he might have had a couple of drinks due to his manner but I couldn't be sure of this.

'I couldn't smell any alcohol on his breath.'

Another teacher, Sian Calben, said she saw Bridger talking to a teenage girl and two younger girls while he was at the parents' evening.

She said: 'Mark seemed very chatty and full of himself on Monday - as if he wanted to make his presence felt more than usual.'

The court also heard from numerous witnesses who had seen Bridger and his car 'to-ing and fro-ing' around the estate around the time that April disappeared.

April was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, when she was allegedly snatched by father-of-six Bridger.

The jury has heard that April's blood was found in Bridger's his cottage in the village of Ceinws, three miles from Machynlleth, with the DNA of a child's skull in ashes taken from the woodburning stove.

April's body was never found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police.

The prosecution claims Bridger snatched and murdered the youngster, who had cerebral palsy, in a sexually motivated attack.

The defendant claims he knocked her down in his car by accident and cannot remember what he did with her body because he was drunk.

Bridger, 47 denies murder, abduction and perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
