Chanel No.5: The only thing Marilyn Monroe ever wore in bed

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

It is famously the only thing Marilyn Monroe ever wore in bed.

But having recruited both her and several other female personalities to front campaigns for their most famous scent, No.5, French fashion house Chanel is set to mix things up.

For the first time in its 91 year history, the perfume is being endorsed by a male celebrity.

And Brad Pitt, 46, has been chosen as the man for the task - though we're pretty sure the reported $7m (£4.32m) paycheck will have sweetened the job.

To get us all in the mood (and rather hot under the No.5-scented collar), the luxury brand have  released a selection of campaign teaser shots of the advertising campaign, due to hit the glossies in full in the November issues.

Chanel have also released a number of mini videos - a maximum of just eight seconds each featuring father-of-six Mr Jolie.

Director Joe Wright - whose previous works include two Keira Knightley movies Atonement and Anna Karenina - shot the full commercial, which premieres in full on 15 October.

Wright was also behind the recent cinematic Coco 
Mademoiselle commercial featuring Knightley haring around Paris on a motorbike.

In one sneak preview black-and-white photographs for the new campaign, artist Sam Taylor-Wood has captured the actor and director in a contemplative, mid-shoot mood.

And although we don't get to see Pitt
in action in the teaser video, we do get a rather mysterious recording 
of his whispery voice, asking 'Do you feel lucky? Why?'.

The vocal snippet is set against a 
still of Pitt's shirted upper back and the back of his head, an image topped with the No.5 logo and split with the printed 
phrase 'Do you feel lucky?'.

In another video the Hollywood star asks 'What’s the mystery?', 'Are you going somewhere?', then 'Where?'.

It was revealed back in May that 
Hollywood star was going to front Chanel's new campaign, and Andrea 
d'Avack, a spokesman for Chanel, said: 'To keep a legend fresh, you always have to change its point of view. It is the first time we've had a
man speaking about a women's fragrance.

'We think very much that the perfume 
is a seduction between a man, a woman and the perfume. No.5 is our 
leading fragrance, and we are willing to make the investment to keep it 
on that level.'

The actor follows in the footsteps of actresses including Monroe, Nicole Kidman, Audrey Tautou and Catherine Deneuve.
