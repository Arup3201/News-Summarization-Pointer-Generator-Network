A Norwegian teenager who had a McDonald’s receipt tattooed onto his arm has done it again - and this time he has had the bill for his first inking permanently etched on to his other forearm.

Stian Ytterdahl, 18, from Lørenskog, southwest Norway, got the first tattoo 'as a punishment' after his friends told him that he had been 'too active on the ladies front'.

Despite news of his first piece of 'body art' reportedly 'giving his mother a breakdown' the student has done it again, and had the receipt for his tattoo etched on to his other forearm.

'Punishment': Stian Ytterdahl, 18, had been a little too successful with the ladies for his friends' liking and was ordered to tattoo the receipt from his trip to McDonald's

Mr Ytterdahl revealed the new body art on Wednesday morning on his Facebook page under the post 'new tat!'.

It
 appears he decided to plump for the second unusual inking, after 
Sabelink Tattoo offered to inscribe the receipt for the tattoo on to his other arm for free.

After his first tattoo, the teenager said: ‘Some of my mates thought I had been a bit too active on the ladies front recently and wanted to punish me.

'When we were in the restaurant on Monday, they said I had to tattoo a Barbie doll on my bum, or the receipt on my arm,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Romerikes Blad.

The student’s first tattoo covers most of his lower right arm.

‘I got an email from my dad that wasn’t entirely positive, saying “What on earth have you done?! Do you think you are coming home with that!? Your mother has had a break down”,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Expressen.

Eternal memory: The teenager's tattoo shows time and date of his visit on Monday night, as well as the franchise's address and phone number

McFan: Although his friends have applauded his new tattoo, his parents are less than pleased and his mother 'broke down' when she saw the tattoo in the local newspaper

Burger or Barbie: The receipt for three cheeseburgers, a happy meal, a coke and a McFlurry was the lesser of two evils, Mr Ytterdahl says, as the alternative was tattooing a Barbie doll on his bum

The artist at Sabelink Tattoo raised an eyebrow, but carried out the task, posting the result on Facebook captioned ‘my strangest tattoo so far’.

‘It’s funny to think that I have a tattoo which no one else even has the likes of. Even the date and time is on it,’ he says.

The VG newspaper filmed the 18-year-old receiving his newest artwork at the Sabel Ink studio in Lillestrøm on Tuesday.

Mr Ytterdahl's dinner on Monday night, now forever etched onto his skin:

1 x 0.5litre Coke3 x Cheeseburgers1 x Cheeseburger Happy Meal1 x McFlurry NonStop, with three extra toppings1 x Extra Happy Meal toy

Mr Ytterdahl said: ‘I might not find it as funny when I am 50 or 60 years old, but it’s my choice.’

McDonald’s Norway has denied that it is a PR stunt, saying they have never heard anything like it before.

‘This is clearly a loyal customer,’ McDonald’s Norway told Romerikes Blad.

Mr Ytterdahl says he has no problem being seen as a walking advertising board.

'I might even get a job at McDonald's now,' he joked.
