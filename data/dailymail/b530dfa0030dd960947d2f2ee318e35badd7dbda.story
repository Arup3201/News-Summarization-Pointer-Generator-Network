If even the sight of a slithering snake makes your body contort into painful angles you may want to look away now, as a two-metre Eastern brown snake, believed to be the largest one ever caught in Australia, has been picked up in a suburban backyard.

The reptile, which has been dubbed the largest of it's kind in the world, was caught by the Australian Reptile Park on the Central Coast in NSW, after being found in a nearby garden.

The snake, which has been named Gigantor due to it's massive length and weight, is almost triple the weight of an average Eastern brown snake, weighing in at 2kg. 

Gigantor, a deadly Australian Eastern brown snake, is prepared to be measured  and milked for it's venom by handlers Tim Faulkner and Billy Collett

The average Eastern brown snake is 1.5metres long and weighs 700g. Gigantor's venom yield is said to yield an insane 30mg per milking, compared to a normal Eastern brown which produces 11-12mg. 

Giagantor is the biggest Eastern brown ever seen at the Australian Reptile Park and will play an important part in the park's life-saving venom milking program. 

While the park was unable to confirm whether Gigantor was the largest Eastern brown to have ever been caught in Australia, the Australian Museum say the largest Eastern brown snake  reliably measured and recorded had a total length of 1.8 metres. However it is believed that they can grow up to 2.4 metres in length.

The museum said the snakes 'seem to prefer open landscapes such as woodlands, scrublands, and savannah grassland,' They said they are frequently found in many large towns and cities.

The park's general manager, Tim Faulkner urged caution at this time of year, claiming brown snakes thrive in the type of weather we have been experiencing in Sydney. 

'He's well over the average size of an average Eastern brown, with twice the girth – that's one big snake' Tim said.

Gigantor was found in a suburban backyard and was caught by the Australian Reptile Park rangers

Eastern brown snakes are attracted to the wet and humid conditions being experienced in Sydney

'It's the height of summer – a humid summer – which snakes love. Mix that with the rain we're experiencing and you're more likely to see them out and about' he said.

Around 3,000 people are bitten by snakes in Australia each year, mainly in regional areas. Brown snakes account for three quarters (76%) of all snake bites, tiger snakes account for 18% of all bites and black snakes account for 6% of cases. 

Eastern brown snakes are the second deadliest in Australia after the Inland taipan.Their fangs are very small (about 3mm long), but their venom contains potent neurotoxins and pro-coagulants, which cause progressive paralysis and incoagulable blood.

Eastern brown snakes are commonly found in mainland Australia and are the most common cause of snake bite deaths in Australia. They can vary from very pale brown to reddish or almost black in colour

More than 200 snakes are 'milked' fortnightly to provide venom to companies who then produce snake anti-venom

The Australian Reptile Park is home to wombats, platypus, Tasmanian devil's, echidnas, dingoes and some of Australia 's largest reptiles.

It is the only zoo in Australia committed to saving lives with a venom-milking program in place for the past 50 years.

Billy Collett from the Australian Reptile park said Gigantor is the biggest Eastern brown snake they've had at the reptile park and he’s an 'absolute asset to the venom programme'

Billy Collett from the Australian Reptile park said Gigantor is the biggest Eastern brown snake they've had at the reptile park and he’s an 'absolute asset to the venom programme'.

'The Eastern brown snake has become more and more common in the urban areas because people populations are exploding, which brings lots of rodents, which also brings snakes,' Billy said. 

'We've got snakes out and about again at the moment, we've just had a week of rain here in Sydney and now things are warming up again the snakes are hatching and some snakes are also feeding up because the winter months are only a few months away.' he said.

The keepers tried to contain the gigantic reptile

A brown snake gave swimmers and sunbathers on a NSW north coast beach a bit of a scare last week when it came slithering out of the surf between the red and yellow flags at One Mile beach..

When lifeguards started blowing on their whistles to evacuate people out of the water, beach goers initially thought the snake was a shark.

But as it swam closer to the shore it soon became clear it was a 1.5-metre brown snake, the Great Lakes Advocate reported.

Still amazed at his size and weight, the keepers said they had never seen an Eastern brown snake that big

The snake, which has been named Gigantor due to it's massive length and weight, is almost triple the weight of an average Eastern brown snake, weighing in at 2kg

Great Lakes  supervisor for lifeguards Simon Lee told Daily Mail Australia in the 20 years he had been with the Surf Life Saving organisation he had not seen anything like it before.

He has been a lifeguard for the last six years. 

Mr Lee said the snake was just metres from the shore, which was 'very unusual for the snake'.

'I've never seen a snake rock up like that,' he said.

The average Eastern brown snake is 1.5metres long and weighs 700g. Gigantor's venom yield is said to yield an insane 30mg per milking, compared to a normal Eastern brown which produces 11-12mg
