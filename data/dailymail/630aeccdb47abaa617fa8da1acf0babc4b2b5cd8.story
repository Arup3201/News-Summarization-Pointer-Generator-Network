In what is being dubbed a last-ditch attempt by BlackBerry to crawl back market share from its rivals, the Canadian firm has officially launched its Passport phone.

After being unveiled at an event in June, chief executive John Chen has been teasing the square phone's features ever since.

And at a launch event earlier today, BlackBerry revealed that the 4.5-inch device is now available in the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada - and will run Android apps from the Amazon Appstore.

At today's launch event, BlackBerry revealed that its 4.5-inch Passport phone (pictured) is now available in the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada - and will run Android apps from the Amazon Appstore. Prices are £529 in the UK, $599 in the US, 649 in France and Germany, and $699 in Canada

Prices in the various regions are £529 in the UK, $599 in the US, €649 in France and Germany, and $699 in Canada, when bought from ShopBlackBerry.com.

The
 BlackBerry Passport has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen, which is said
 to offer a similar viewing space to a 5-inch phone, but ‘an even better
 viewing experience’ because of the screen’s width.

It has 1440x1440 pixel resolution display with a pixel density of 453PPI.

Other
 specifications include a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB
 of RAM and 32GB of storage plus expandable storage via microSD card up 
to 64GB.

There is also a 13MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera.

The touchscreen is accompanied by a physical keyboard, and the Passport runs BlackBerry 10 OS 10.3.

This
 software features BlackBerry Blend, which lets users BlackBerry content
 to other devices including PCs and Android phones, as well as the 
Amazon Appstore.

This means that Android apps from the Amazon store can be installed on the BlackBerry device. 

Prices in the various regions are £529 in
 the UK, $599 in the US, €649 in France and Germany, and $699 in Canada,
 when bought from ShopBlackBerry.com.

The BlackBerry Passport will also be available through Amazon.com, and the retailer will be announcing its pricing 'soon'. 

'As we set out to design BlackBerry Passport, we were guided by a simple yet challenging idea - to set aside the limitations of traditional design and to instead simply build a device that fundamentally changes the way business professionals get work done on their smartphone,' said Mr Chen.

'The BlackBerry Passport was created to drive productivity and to break through the sea of rectangular-screen, all-touch devices.'

In addition to the large, 1440x1440 pixel square screen, the device has a 3450 mAH battery which BlackBerry claims will last up to 30 hours. 

It has a quad-core 2.2 GHZ Processor, 3GB RAM as well as a 13MP rear camera, and 32GB memory.

The touchscreen is accompanied by a physical keyboard, and the Passport runs BlackBerry 10 OS 10.3.

This software features BlackBerry Blend, which lets users BlackBerry content to other devices including PCs and Android phones, as well as the Amazon Appstore.

This means that Android apps will run on the device, but only those available from the Amazon store, installed on the BlackBerry device.

The device wil be available in more than 30 countries around the world, including the Middle East, France, India, Singapore, Austria, Germany, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, Vietnam, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Mexico, Venezuela, Philippines, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Romania, and Colombia.

Earlier this week, Mr Chen told the Wall Street Journal that the price of the flagship device should be in the region of $799, but his firm dropped the price to 'get the market interested.'

The BlackBerry Passport (pictured centre) has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen and shows 60 characters of text, compared to 40 on a rectangular 5-inch device (Samsung's Galaxy S5 5.1-inch device is pictured right). Apple's iPhone 4S is pictured left to show scale. There is also a 13MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera

Other specifications of the Passport (pictured) include a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage plus expandable storage via microSD card up to 64GB

By comparison, Apple's latest iPhone 6 handset starts at £539 ($649), while the iPhone 6 Plus costs £789 ($749) - both are also available on two-year contracts.

Samsung's Galaxy S5 costs around £580 ($650), and the South Korean firm is yet to release price details for its Galaxy Note Edge.

The
 BlackBerry Passport is the first time the firm has launched a new device, globally, since its BlackBerry 10 devices in 2013.

Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'This latest handset launch shows that it’s back to business for BlackBerry - and what a smart move that is.

'After a year away from the UK market, a return to Blighty with a keyboard-based smartphone is a move that plays to BlackBerry's strengths, and shows it has finally understood what people liked about its early phones.

'In a twist, Amazon's Android AppStore comes preloaded, showing either the versatility of the OS - or that the BlackBerry app store needs help.'

The Passport combines a large touchscreen with a physical keyboard. BlackBerry chief executive John Chen first revealed the square phone (pictured) during the Canadian company's annual general meeting in June

In June, BlackBerry announced it was offering 
240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with 
Amazon.

The
 deal lets BlackBerry add a selection of consumer apps to its 
devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity 
applications.

For example, BlackBerry customers will be able to access popular 
Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and 
Minecraft.

The
 apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from autumn, when 
the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the 
statement said.

While Ben Wood, Chief of Research, CCS Insight added: 'This
 is definitely a marmite product – based on our experience so far people
 either love the design or are a little perplexed by the size and shape.

'One
 thing is certain – it’s a distinctive product that will definitely 
stand out from the monotonous stream of similar looking touchscreen 
smartphones that currently characterise the market.

'After
 18 months of disruption the strategy that new CEO John Chen has laid 
out seems to be taking hold. The business has stabilised and the 
Passport device is a critical milestone in efforts to rebuild the 
business.'

The Passport was first revealed in June by BlackBerry boss John Chen during the company's quarterly earnings report.

The project
 was previously known as Windermere, and Mr Chen said at the time that 
Passport would be officially announced at an event in London in 
September.

Further details were unveiled by Matt Young on the Inside BlackBerry blog
 in July: ‘Consider how IMAX movies begin with the screens set to a more
 traditional 16:9 aspect ratio projection for conventional movie 
trailers, before expanding to their true dimensions.

'The Passport is like the IMAX of productivity, and you don’t have to sacrifice screen real estate, vertically or horizontally.'

Academic research has shown that the optimal number of characters on a line in a book is 66 characters.

Most
 rectangular smartphones show approximately 40 characters per line, 
while the BlackBerry Passport is said to show 60 characters.

The Passport (right) was unveiled alongside Blackberry's touchscreen phone the Z3 (left), and the Classic (centre) in a slide, earlier this year. It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example

This makes the Passport ‘the ideal device for reading e-books, viewing documents and browsing the web.’

It also solves the problem of having to switch between landscape and portrait mode when taking a photo or filming a video.

‘We’ve
 been living in a rectangular world for quite some time and know it’s a 
great ergonomic design that drives content, media consumption and quick 
communications,’ continued Mr Young.

‘However, the rectangle has become a defacto approach to smartphone design, perhaps limiting innovations.

‘Just as a passport is the universal symbol of mobility and was the inspiration for the size and form factor of this device, your BlackBerry Passport becomes your ticket to open new doors of opportunity.’

It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example, and BlackBerry has not released any details about the price.

The blog post did, however, position the device more towards businesses than consumers.

For example, it stated architects and mortgage brokers could use it to look at full designs and schematics on the go. While medical staff could view X-rays and medical documents in the office with a patient

Mr Young
 concluded: ‘The BlackBerry Passport will take you to new places on the 
best business trip you’ve ever had. We want you to imagine the 
possibilities.’

The
 move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as
 it attempts to reinvent itself under new chief executive John Chen.

BlackBerry phones have recently lost ground to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices.

Chen
 wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused 
on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine 
communications.

The
 company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automobile 
industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars.

BlackBerry
 already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients including 
corporations and government agencies to manage and secure mobile devices
 on their internal networks.

Chen
 intends to build on those ties and BlackBerry's touted security 
credentials to allow these enterprise clients to build and customize 
in-house corporate and productivity applications for their employees.
