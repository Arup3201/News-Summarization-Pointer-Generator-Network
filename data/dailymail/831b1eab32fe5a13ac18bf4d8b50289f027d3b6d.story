A church in Mississippi has released stunning video from a security camera showing a massive tornado ripping through its playground on April 28, destroying nearly everything in its path, except a slide.

A series of twisters devastated several states in the Southeastern United States late last month, killing at least 35 and leaving behind millions of dollars in devastation.

'It really kinda brought things back, seeing it a week later,' Brad Bullock, technical director for St. Luke’s United Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi, told NBC News.

As winds begin to whip up, the camera goes from color to black and white

'The building was really damaged,' Bullock added. 'About 50 percent of the front of the building is gone.'

After the tornado that struck Tupelo, many church members were left without power and some, unfortunately, lost their homes. 

As the tornado begins to subside, the massive damage caused by it becomes evident

The aftermath of the twister shows nearly ever piece of playground equipment is destroyed, except for the slide in the background.

'A lot of folks are displaced,' Bullock said. 'Right now you can’t even see the houses. This is a neighborhood that has huge beautiful oak trees that survived the 1936 tornado and a lot of those are gone.'

As the cleanup continues, Bullock is optimistic that the church will open its doors to worshipers again.

'We have a pastor that went through Katrina so he has experience in this,' he said. 'We’re looking from 18 months to 2 years to reopen. We have people out there now looking to assess the damage.'
