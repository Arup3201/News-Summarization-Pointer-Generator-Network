Norwegian killer Anders Breivik may have been driven to carry out his massacre because of an incestuous relationship with his own mother, a new book claims.

The 36-year-old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island.

At his trial, Breivik sought to rationalise his actions by saying he wanted to recreate the dominant Aryan race, claiming the killings were 'necessary' to protect Norway from Muslims. 

But a new book suggests that Breivik's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother Wenche Behring, perhaps even before birth.

She is said to have sexualised her son from the age of just four and slept in the same bed with him with 'very close bodily contact', according to psychiatric reports compiled before his trial. 

Mrs Behring also revealed to police that he once bought her a sex toy to console her after she broke up with a boyfriend.

Breivik, who was then in his 20s, proceeded to ask her a number of times whether she had used it, an interest she described as 'weird'.

In One Of Us, The Story Of Anders Breivik And The Massacre In Norway, author Asne Seierstad even suggests that his dysfunctional relationship began in the womb. 

‘It’s as if he kicks me almost on purpose, to torment,’ complains Mrs Behring, who admitted that she had considered having an abortion.

She was later heard telling her young son that 'I wish you were dead' in a relationship that was described by social services as 'profoundly pathological'. 

It was recommended that he be taken into care, but that never happened.

Mrs Seierstad, who interviewed Mrs Behring in March 2013, six months after his conviction, said: 'Among many other things, he resented his mother. There's an aspect of revenge.'

Mrs Behring died of breast cancer shortly afterwards. 

When Mrs Behring was informed of her son's atrocity, she replied coldly: 'How could he do this to me?'

Mrs Seierstad believes that response suggested his mother felt she may in some way be to blame.

'It was clear their relationship was dysfunctional,' the author told Grazia magazine, explaining that Mrs Behring had traits of an abused child herself from her own mother. 

Breivik’s mother was a paranoid schizophrenic as was her mother, while his father was a cold and distant Norwegian diplomat, offering Breivik little comfort or protection. 

When Breivik was six months old, the family moved to the Embassy in London.

But after another six months Mrs Behring had had enough of their  lifestyle and returned to Oslo with her baby and his half-sister.

Breivik’s childhood might have been specially designed to create an adult monster. 

Deciding that she couldn’t handle her child seven days a week, Mrs Behring farmed him out to a young couple at weekends.

‘She asked if Anders could occasionally touch his weekend dad’s penis. It was important for the boy’s sexuality,' the book says.

'He had no father figure in his life and Wenche wanted the young man to assume that role... the young couple were speechless.’  

Aged 13, he took up graffiti, and briefly became part of a gang. The name he gave himself – and which he spray-painted on every available wall – was Morg, after an executioner in a Marvel comic who murders his own people.

But Breivik soon fell out with the rest of the gang and switched his allegiance to Norway’s Progress Party, a more strident version of our own Ukip – anti-immigrant, anti-socialist, anti-tax.

By the age of 18 he had risen to the post of deputy chairman of the Oslo West Youth Wing. 

After five years, he graduated to anti-Muslim websites, full of conspiracy theories about Muslims taking over Norway, raping and murdering Scandinavian women.

In his blogs, he awarded himself increasingly grand titles, all of them fostering the illusion that he had friends and followers: Knight Commander Of The Knights Templar, Distinguished Destroyer Of Cultural Marxism, Commander Of The Norwegian Anti-Communist Resistance Movement.

He also posted tips for murdering socialists, such as acquiring a police uniform so you can move around unchallenged with weapons, and getting a job at a political youth camp. 

On July 22, 2011, he first killed eight people after setting off a bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo.

He then shot dead 69 teenagers attending at Workers' Youth League summer camp on the island of Utoya, indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range as he trampled over corpses

It was to became the largest killing spree by a single person in history.

Later, awaiting trial, he was to be diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. 

Breivik, a right-wing, anti-Muslim extremist, was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012. 

Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands.

In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3.

Despite the finite prison term, he is expected to remain in jail for the rest of his life.
