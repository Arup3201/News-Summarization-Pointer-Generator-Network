Valencia earned a hard-fought La Liga victory over Sevilla at the Mestalla on Sunday in an entertaining clash where there were three penalties awarded int he first half.

Dani Parejo was the first to convert from the spot, giving Valencia the lead after 18 minutes after Diogo brought down Manchester City loanee Alvaro Negredo. 

Valencia doubled their lead in the 32nd and it was with Parejo's second of the game, sliding a low shot beyond Sevilla goalkeeper Beto.

But Sevilla were handed a route back into the game on 36.

Parejo was this time the offender, bringing down Diogo and Carlos Bacca fired the penalty past Diego Alves.

Incredibly, Sevilla had a second penalty only four minutes later when Joao Cancelo barged into Vitolo.

Bacca stepped up again, but this time Alves kept the ball out with his legs after diving to his left.

Valencia extended their advantage after 56 minutes.

Rodrigo was the creator, weaving into space and picking out Javi Vuego, who clinically found the bottom corner for 3-1.

The win moves Valencia above Unai Emery's side and into fourth place in the Primera Division.
