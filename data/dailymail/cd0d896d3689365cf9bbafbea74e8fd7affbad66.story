As a child growing up in North Carolina, Donald Morgan dreamed of joining the military and hoped one day to become a paratrooper and Special Forces soldier.

But earlier this year the 44-year-old was arrested at JFK International Airport on his way home from Lebanon after trying and failing to join ISIS terrorists fighting in Syria.

According to U.S. officials, Morgan spent eight months in the Middle East where he tried to sell military-grade guns and ammunition online.

In an NBC interview, he openly admitted he wanted to join ISIS and said he would fight any enemies of Islam - be it the Syria's Bashar al-Assad or President Barack Obama.

He also posted messages on Twitter under the name Abu Omar Al-Amreeki in which he pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS, and told 'brothers' in Iraq that he was coming to join them. 

He wrote: 'Mujahid pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Islamic State commanding good and forbidding evil.'

ISIS, which is now known as Islamic State, controls a large area of Iraq and has gained a reputation for appalling brutality after videos appeared of fighters performing mass executions and crucifixions.

It is now responsible for the beheading of two U.S. journalists. The first, James Foley was killed last month, while the second, Steven Sotloff, was executed on Tuesday. 

So how did Morgan go from being a Catholic child with dreams of serving his country, to a radical Islamist hoping to help destroy it?

Morgan
 travelled to Lebanon earlier this year to be with his second wife, and 
while there he tweeted about his loyalty to ISIS and tried to join the 
group in Syria. He was arrested coming back to the U.S. in July

According to an interview with NBC, Morgan's journey began after he took part in a bootcamp which would have seen him deployed with the National Guard in Kuwait during Desert Storm.

He failed to pass the grade, and with his childhood dream in tatters he turned instead to a career in law enforcement, becoming a sheriff's deputy.

He said: 'My entire life growing up was surrounded by the idea that I would be 82nd Airborne, I would be Special Forces, I would serve dutifully – duty, honor and country. 

'Later I thought that I would make this [law enforcement] my substitution for what I thought was going to be, in the beginning, a military career, an achievement, leadership.' 

But when he lost this job after a year and a half, Morgan began drinking heavily and partying. He got into several fights, before eventually being jailed for just over two years for firing a gun into a crowded restaurant. 

After being released Morgan attempted to turn his life around and took up bodybuilding, marrying fellow bodybuilder Tangela Horne in 1999 and having a son with her in 2001.

However in 2008, a year after he and Tangela divorced, Morgan converted to Islam, and in 2012 friends began to notice that the religion was becoming all-encompassing.

Morgan stopped going to the gym, grew his beard, shaved his head, opened an Islamic Center near to where he lived in Salisbury and began tweeting extremists views.

Bryan Beaver, who had known Morgan for 15 years, said: 'His Facebook posts were a bit extreme at times. Derogatory statements toward Israel, some statements about infidels.'

In his NBC interview. Morgan admits  that his views could be viewed as radical by Westerners, but said that he considers himself to be just a 'practicing Muslim'.

He added that he was attracted to ISIS because he admired their devotion, and that fact that they put the worship of Islam above everything else.

In January this year he went to Lebanon to visit his second wife, and spent months trying to move across the border into Syria 'to join the most beautiful brothers on earth'.

However, it would seem his mission ultimately failed. It is not known why he returned to the U.S., but when he landed at J.F.K airport, he was arrested.

A judge has ordered Morgan to be held without bail after Attorney Nadia Moore suggested Morgan was too dangerous to return to North Carolina on his own. 

Judge Ramon Reyes agreed, saying that tweets by Morgan implied he was 'trying to go to Syria or Iraq as the next step and trying to be actively engaged'.
