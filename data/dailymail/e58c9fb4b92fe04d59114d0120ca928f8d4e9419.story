More access: Lord Younger told MPs that Google had better access to Number 10 than him

A Tory minister has complained that he has less access to Downing Street than Google’s executives.

Viscount Younger of Leckie’s admission is the latest demonstration of the internet firm’s political clout.

It emerged in a report from the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, which lambasted Google for its ‘flimsy excuses’ for not tackling online piracy. It also slammed the company for directing users to websites where they can illegally download material.

The committee said it has proved exceedingly difficult to introduce tougher sanctions for internet pirates, in the face of reluctance from web giants such as Google.

‘We have also heard complaints from across the creative spectrum about the perceived power and influence of Google in the Government’s inner, policy-making sanctum,’ the report said.

It went on to quote Lord Younger, the Intellectual Property Minister, who had given evidence to the committee.

‘The minister hardly dispelled this impression: “Google is one of several search engines,” he told us. “I am very aware of their power, put it that way. I am also very aware, I think, that they have access, for whatever reason, to higher levels than me in No. 10, I understand.”’ The Daily Mail revealed last year that Tory ministers had held meetings with Google an average of once a month since the General Election.

David Cameron has also been criticised for surrounding himself with Google cronies. Rachel Whetstone, the company’s global head of communications, worked with Mr Cameron at Carlton Television and the Prime Minister is godfather to her youngest son. She is married to Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s former policy guru.

Tory MP John Whittingdale, the CMS committee chairman, said it could not be ‘beyond the wit’ of Google engineers to block websites which offered illegal downloads of music, film and video games.

Illegal downloads cost the creative industries an estimated £400million a year. Creative industries worth more than £36billion to Britain would be ‘put at risk’ if creators could not rely on intellectual property rights being ‘robustly enforced’, Mr Whittingdale added.

‘We are unimpressed by Google’s 
failure to stop directing consumers to illegal, copyright-infringing 
material on the flimsy excuse that some of the sites may also host some 
legal content.

‘The 
continuing promotion of illegal content through search engines is simply
unacceptable, and efforts to stop it have so far been derisory.

‘There
is no reason why they cannot demote and ultimately remove sites hosting
large amounts of illegal material from search engine results.Google and
others already work with international law enforcement to block for 
example child porn from search results, and it has provided no coherent,
responsible reason why it can’t do the same for illegal, pirated 
content.

Copyright infringement is a serious crime that threatens our economic future.’

The committee called for those guilty of online piracy to face up to ten years in prison, a five-fold increase on the two-year limit they currently face.

A Google spokesman said: ‘We removed more than 20million links to pirated content from our search results in the last month alone.

‘But search is not the problem – according to Ofcom just 8 per cent of infringers in the UK use Google to find unlicensed films and 13 per cent to find unlicensed music.

‘Google works harder than anyone to help the film and music industry protect their content online.’

The company aims to remove pirated content from the web in less than six hours. In total, it received 57million notices from copyright owners and agents last year, demanding that it remove pirated content.

The internet giant also changed its computer code last year to recognise sites which had legal action taken against them for copyright infringement.
