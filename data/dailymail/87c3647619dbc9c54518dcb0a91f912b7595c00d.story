The Second World War had been raging for more than two years, with rationing in force and mounting fears of a U-boat blockade.

Faced with the prospect of food supplies being cut off, a pair of eminent scientists came up with a solution: Let them eat plankton.

They planned to harvest tons of the microscopic creatures from Scottish lochs.

Secret wartime letters just uncovered reveal that Professor Alister Hardy, a marine biologist at Hull University, told colleagues that plankton – the term for a range of drifting organisms found in fresh and sea water – were high in protein and could be ‘tasty’.

Plans were drawn up to harvest the microscopic sea creatures to sustain Britain if food supplies were cut off during World War Two. The text reads: Fig 1. Sketch of net proposed for full-scale collection of plankton. A is a rope net used to to enable rope B to be pulled inside out. A continuous cable (left) is used to lower or raise the nets to the desired depth. To the right is the line, attached to cork, for hauling up the catch

The idea was to capture tons of copepods - which the scholars described as 'tasty' - in the tidal areas of sea lochs along the west coast of Scotland

He convinced Sir John Graham Kerr, an
MP and regius professor of biology at Glasgow University, and they 
calculated that ten nets could catch enough plankton in 12 hours to feed
357 people.

In 1941 Sir John wrote to Richard 
Elmhirst, director of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, who 
appears to have been sceptical: ‘It is simply silly to brush the matter 
aside as of no importance, when one remembers the sea off our coasts is 
often soup-like in its richness with nutritive material.

The boffins calculated that nets anchored in Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton each day. The loch is seen here in 1933

The academics made diagrams of nets, explored areas on the west coast of Scotland where it could work and even carried out trials from 1941-43 to see if it was possible

‘No doubt you have tested for yourself the tastiness of some types of plankton.’

Scientists reckoned that nets anchored in
Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton
each day.

Hardy proposed: 'The plankton would be
emptied into containers and conveyed to the nearest pier where it would stand
ready to be conveyed by lorry or motor boat to the drying plant.

'Simple drying plants would be set up at
convenient points along the coast and the resulting dry plankton dispatched in
sacks to a headquarters factory for testing, sorting, mixing and final
preparation into meal...

'The anchoring and inspection of nets would
be done by motor boats which could also be continually cruising the area
investigating the richest regions of plankton.'

Trials went ahead in 1941, 1942 and 1943 but
it was found that the season was too short for the scheme to work.

By 1942 the first stockpiles had been
harvested, but the plankton proved trickier to catch than the 
scientists expected, and the project was quietly abandoned.

The letters were found by Geoffrey 
Moore, emeritus professor in marine biology at the University of London,
in the Association’s archive.

He said: ‘I know of only one  person who has tried plankton and he found it rather fishy  and gritty. 
‘He wasn’t terribly impressed, but I suppose it would depend on how hungry you were.’

Richard Kirby of the University of 
Plymouth, the author of a book about plankton called Ocean Drifters – A 
Secret World Beneath the Waves, said the idea of eating plankton is not 
so bizarre.

Copepods are known as 'the insects of the sea' due to their large numbers. There are believed to be around 10,000 different species.

Found in fresh and salt water, they measure no more than a few millimetres long.

One species, found in the cold waters off the UK, is the calanus.

During winter, it hibernates at a depth of 1,000m to avoid predators - and builds up lipid (fatty) stores in the process.

The largest is the Pennella  Balaenopterae, which lives on the finback whale and can grow to over a foot long.

Copepods are crustaceans - and the largest source of protein in the ocean.

They have two antenna, a shell and segmented 
bodies and graze on phytoplankton and zooplankton.

He added: ‘The Germans had similar plans during the war, and there are still people trying to do this today.’

Prof Moore, who is also president of the
Society for History of Natural History, said he was not surprised at what he
found.

He said: 'Marine biologists come up with a
lot of strange ideas.

But this scheme was not that odd - there are fisheries
for various plankton in Japan and Scandinavia.

'I've been interested for many years in the
history of marine biology and for the last ten years have been delving into
all sorts of historic marine biology archives.

'When I found these letters, I thought I
would write them up as an academic paper.

'Sir Alister Hardy thought it was a way he
could contribute to the war effort, because he wasn't in the forces himself.

'There was plenty of plankton around, but
there was the question of how easy it would be to catch. You would need a very
large net with a very small mesh.

Some societies eat plankton directly. The Japanese dish Okami is made from krill, a shrimp-like plankton

'There would be the problem of the pressure
of the water trying to push through a net, which would become clogged up with
debris - not to mention basking sharks.

'I only know of one person who has tried
plankton and he found it rather fishy and gritty. Unlike a prawn, which you can
peel, the exoskeleton was still intact.

'He wasn't terribly impressed, but I suppose
it would depend on how hungry you were.

'And I expect it was intended that the
plankton would have been added to other foods rather than eaten on its own.'
