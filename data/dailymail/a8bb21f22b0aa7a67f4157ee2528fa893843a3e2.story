Because they're dying: Dave Agema (R-MI) claimed that gays only wants free health care because they are dying of AIDS

A prominent Michigan Republican told a packed room last week that gays and lesbians want free health care because they are dying from AIDS.

Dave Agema, a former state representative and currently one of the state’s reps to the Republican National Committee, made the remarks at the Berrien County Republican Party’s annual holiday reception.

This is not the first time the gay bashing politician has found himself in hot water for homophobic comments, according to the Washington Post.

‘Folks, they (gay people) want free medical because they're dying (when they're) between 30 and 44 years old,’ he said, according to the Herald-Palladium.

‘To me, it's a moral issue, it's a Biblical issue,’ he continued. ‘Traditional marriage is where it should be and it's in our platform. Those in our party who oppose traditional marriage are wrong.’

The controversial stance, he explained, comes from his observations of gay co-workers at American Airlines claiming AIDS-infected people were their spouses so they could receive health insurance.

‘I stand for traditional marriage, no homosexual ones,’ he proclaimed.

Mr Agema’s remarks came during a speech urging the different factions of the Republican Party to come together.

In April, the conservative politician shared an article to his Facebook page accusing gays of living a ‘filthy lifestyle,’ as well as prodding Christians to help them ‘get out of it,’ the Post noted.

‘We ought to be saying to these people, ‘Hey, we don’t agree with your lifestyle and we’ll help you get out of it,’ he also told a conservative radio show the same month, according to the Post.

He continued, saying that children are being brainwashed in school to think homosexuality is okay, according to the Post.

‘The next thing that will occur is your kids will come home and say, ‘I think this is a good thing and I think I want to be one.’
