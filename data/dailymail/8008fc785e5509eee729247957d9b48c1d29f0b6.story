Google came out on top as the most popular website with US users this year followed closely by Facebook, according to market researchers.

Market research company, Nielsen said more than 153 million visitors clicked onto Google branded pages each month, while as Facebook drew nearly 138 million visitors.

Yahoo came third with about 130 million visitors each month.

But analysts warned the site's popularity could be at risk as more young people turn away from web-based email.

Popular: More than 153 million visitors clicked onto Google branded pages each month throughout 2011

The Nielsen study is based on data collected between January and October and involved a sample of 200,000 people worldwide.

Research by Comscore suggests 
US-based 12 to 17-year-olds spent 30 per cent less time using web-based 
email between November 2010 and the same month this year.

The same study showed that the number of people in older age groups using web-based email was up.

But people aged 18 to 24 fell by 21 per cent and was down by 1 per cent in the 25 to 34 age bracket.

Ian Maude from Enders Analysis told the BBC: 'Yahoo's basic problem is that people are no longer looking for an all-you-can-eat service and instead want best-in-breed.

Facebook was identified as the most popular social networking site

For social networks that is Facebook, for search it's Google.

'Email is a front door to Yahoo and if people are no longer using their service it will affect them more broadly.

'If Comscore's data is an early indicator of a growing trend they have a major problem.'

In terms of most popular social networking websites, Nielsen's research showed Mark
Zuckerberg's creation ranked as most favourite ahead of the search 
engine's Google+ which came eighth in the list attracting 8m visitors a 
month.

The site's number of visitors also 
set back Google's weblog publishing tool Blogger as well as Wordspace, 
Myspace, Linkedin and Tumblr.

However
Google's YouTube turned out to be the most popular destination for 
online videos - attracting more than three times the number of monthly 
visitors as the music video service Vevo.
