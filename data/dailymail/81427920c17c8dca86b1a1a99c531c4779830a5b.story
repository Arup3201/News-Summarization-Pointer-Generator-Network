Erik Lamela received all the headlines for his magnificent rabona goal against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday - and now Alex Song has got himself in on the act.

The West Ham United midfielder used the technique to whip in a cross against Manchester City on Saturday during his man-of-the match display.

Song was just inside the penalty area when he put his right foot behind his standing left leg and delivered the ball into the area.

Lamela's wonderstrike in the Europa League for Tottenham Hotspur was perhaps more impressive for the sheer power and direction he managed to generate in the rabona - and because it ended up in the back of the net.

But former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder Song's cross also showed exquisite technique.

Manchester United's Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo are renowned for using the skill - and former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne has also used it before in the past.

West Ham claimed a famous victory over City, with goals from Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano giving them the win.

David Silva netted a wonderful curling striker for the visitors but it turned out to be merely a consolation.
