Smiling widely Kim Jong-Un looks delighted as he tours a construction site, despite reports he is 'losing sleep' after the collapse of an apartment block last week which left hundreds feared dead.

The leader of the secretive regime is driving a construction boom and apartment blocks, roads, bridges are all being put up in line with his policy of finishing projects at lightning
 speed.

It comes as a Roman Catholic cardinal from South 
Korea travelled today to North Korea in the first such trip, at a 
time of rekindled animosity between the neighboring countries.

Cardinal
 Andrew Yeom Soo-jung went to the joint North-South factory park at 
Kaesong, North Korea, for a one-day trip to tour the complex and meet 
South Koreans working there, South Korea's Unification Ministry 
spokeswoman Park Soo-jin said.

South
 Korean Catholic officials denied media speculation that Yeom's trip 
might be aimed at preparing for a possible visit by Pope Francis to 
North Korea when he visits South Korea in August.

The
 pope plans to visit South Korea from Aug. 14-18 to participate in a 
Catholic youth festival, preside over a beatification ceremony for 124 
Korean martyrs and bring a message of peace to the war-divided 
peninsula. His visit will mark the first time in 25 years that a pope 
has visited the Korean peninsula.

Yeom
 is the third South Korean national who has become a Roman Catholic 
cardinal. His Kaesong trip marks the first time for any South Korean 
cardinal to visit North Korea, according to the Unification Ministry.

North
 Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but in practice 
only sanctioned services are tolerated by the government. Defectors from
 the country have said that distributing Bibles and holding secret 
prayer services can mean banishment to a labor camp or execution.

Tension
 between the two Koreas have risen in recent months, with Pyongyang 
conducting a series of missile and rocket launches and resuming harsh 
rhetoric against South Korea and the U.S.

The
 joint factory park, located just north of the heavily armed land 
border, is the last remaining cross-border rapprochement project between
 the two Koreas which are still in a technical state of war because no 
peace treaty was signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

The park 
combines South Korean initiative, capital and technology with cheap 
North Korean labor.

Meanwhile South Korea have said the building which collapsed last week was home to 92 families and hundreds are feared dead, although the May 13 accident happened in the afternoon and many residents would have been at school or at work..

Apartments in buildings taller than 20 stories are normally reserved for party officials, professionals, academics and managers at state agencies, and those recognised for contribution to the state, the Architecture Institute of (South) Korea said last year.

'They would be the kind of people who the state can't just choose to ignore and act like nothing happened,' a South Korean official with access to intelligence on the North said.

They are not the highest ranks of the North's ruling class but they are 'people who have power or money', said Kwak In-su, a North Korean defector who works at the Institute for National Security Strategy, run by the South's spy agency.

North Korean officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in Pyongyang, which a South Korean official said was believed to have caused considerable casualties that could mean hundreds might have died

The collapse follows a period of political upheaval and intrigue and raises questions about the safety of other buildings going up in the same area

'People have mobile phones and talk,' Kwak said. 'Angry public opinion can become a boomerang so the regime wants to prevent it early.'

Kim, who rose to power when his father died in December 2011, has removed most of Pyongyang's old guard during his comparatively short rule, replacing ageing generals and cadres.

He has changed his Korean People's Army chief of staff four times. Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, considered the second most powerful man in North Korea, was executed in December.

The scale of Kim's construction projects had puzzled outside analysts as to how the impoverished state was able to supply the materials and equipment needed, and some suggested the North may be doing without, or using fewer, crucial materials like steel.

Accidents like last week's collapse 'happen all the time', the South Korean official said, adding only that the location was different. Phyongchon is within walking distance of Kim's office.

The word of the collapse in the secretive nation's capital was reported by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which gave no death toll but said that the accident was 'serious' and upset North Korea's leader

'This case is unusual in that unlike most apartment blocks, for working people for example, they would have used better materials ... and followed (safety) standards, and still this happened,' he said.

Access to North Korea is severely restricted, but satellite images show the collapsed building as having had balconies. As is the case in South Korea, this is where families would store their kimchi pots through the winter, or put out fake flowers during festivals celebrating the birthdays of the Kim dynasty if facing the road.

There are 17 or more high-rise buildings that are new or under construction in the same area, Curtis Melvin, of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, said.

An undercover article published by Asia Press International in 2011 showed pictures of buildings under construction in Pyongyang, reporting a shortage of building materials and food for the workers.

One picture showed an apartment block of more than 20 storeys with the location and size of windows changing slightly from floor to floor.

Many of the buildings going up also do not have elevators, a Reuters witness said, because of the frequent power outages.

'The collapsed building was neither the first finished nor the most prestigious,' said Melvin, who analyses satellite imagery. 'This raises serious questions about the safety of the other buildings.'
