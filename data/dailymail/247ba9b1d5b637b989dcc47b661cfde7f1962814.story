A clash between two Sydney private boys' schools at the weekend saw records broken and spirits crushed as the victors trounced their rivals 101-0.

The rugby union game took place between Scots College, located in Bellevue Hill in Sydney's eastern suburbs, and Newington College from the inner-western suburb of Stanmore, on Saturday.

Scots College completely annihilated their competitors - preventing Newington from scoring a single point.

The smashing was so substantial that even the scoreboard couldn't cope - the highest number it could display was 99, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Scots scored 15 tries in the match, and converted 12 of them.

Aamzingly Newington College were the 2013 joint premiers and six of their players are currently representing New South Wales in the sport. Only four of the Scots College players are doing the same.

Last year the premiership was shared with the opponents that absolutely dominated them at the weekend. The match was played as part of the fourth round of the Greater Public Schools (GPS) 1st XV competition.

Rugby Union in Australian has its roots in private schools and variations of this particular competition have been running since 1892.

The GPS 1ST XV currently has only six schools that take part in the round-robin tournament: Scots College, Newington, Saint Ignatius' College at Riverview, St Josephs College in Hunters Hill, The Kings School in Parramatta and Shore - Sydney Church of England Grammar School in North Sydney.

The 2nd XV includes the same six colleges, while the 3rd XV brings in Sydney Grammar School, The Armidale School and Sydney Boys High School.

The Scots College Old Boys Union sent their congratulations to the winning side on their Facebook page, and one man commented on the post 'did it for Teague boys! #clap for James'.

He was referring to the tragic death of former Scots College student and rugby union fanatic James Teague, who who died in a New Zealand hospital after falling 10 metres from a hotel balcony at ski resort in Queenstown three days ago.

A tribute to the Sydney teenager was read out at the Saturday night game between the NSW Warratahs and the ACT Brumbies which took place in Sydney, and Teague was supposed to attend.
