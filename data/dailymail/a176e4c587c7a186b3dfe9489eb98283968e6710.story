ISIS are infamous for publishing gruesome videos of beheadings or footage of soldiers training - but it seems they have now taken a softer tact in an attempt to appeal to women.

The militants have begun publishing guides for Islamic State wives on how to be 'ultimate wives of jihad' complete with cartoon illustrations on a pink background.

The videos include guides on how to perform basic first aid, what to cook for Islamists after battles, and how to stitch up damaged clothing.

ISIS have published videos trying to encourage more women to join their cause by outlining 'feminine manual labour' they can do to help the jihadists, instead of joining in the fighting

Among the tasks listed are basic first aid and cooking - along with 'quick and simple' recipe suggestions including date balls which 'will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen'

The videos were published on Twitter and Facebook by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq.

Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far.

Among the tips given out are some 'quick and simple' recipes, such as one for 'date balls' that are made by mixing dates, flour and butter together.

As ISIS's strict religious code forbids women from fighting, instead they are told to assist jihad by sewing clothes and editing propaganda videos

The guide says: 'This is a quick recipe that can be served to the mujahedin [IS militants] with coffee or can be eaten at any time with water, especially during breaks in battles. They contain significant calories and will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen, Allah willing.'

Charlie Winter, of the anti-extremist group Quilliam Foundation, told The Independent: 'I haven't seen anything like this before. 

Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British jihadi, is thought to be leading the all-female al-Khanssaa brigade which operated in the de-fact ISIS capital of Raqqa

'There will probably be forums doing similar things online, but this is the first time I've come across an actual media organisation giving guidance to women on their role.

'The phenomenon of women going over to Syria or Iraq is not new and it is not a purely Western phenomenon. There are more women going from countries like Saudi Arabia.'

ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'.

Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further.

It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them.

There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi.

The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK.
