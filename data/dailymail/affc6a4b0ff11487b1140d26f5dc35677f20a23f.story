A species of rat has been discovered that cannot gnaw or chew and represents a new step in rodent evolution.

The shrew-like animal, Paucidentomys vermidax, has fang-like upper 
incisors which are useless for gnawing and no back teeth.

It lives 
exclusively on earthworms which it sucks out of the ground at the foot of the jungle with its long snout.

A rat with no back teeth: Its discovery represents a new step in rodent evolution

P. vermidax was found in a remote rainforest on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

It shares some characteristic with insectivorous shrew rats from the 
Philippines but has taken an evolutionary step further by completely 
dispensing with chewing molars.

Dr Kevin Rowe, from Museum Victoria in Australia, a member of the 
discovery team, said: 'There are more than 2,200 rodent species in the 
world and until this discovery all had molars in the back of their mouth
and incisors at the front.

'This is an example of how species, when faced with a new ecological 
opportunity, in this case an abundance of earthworms, can evolve the 
loss of traits that were wildly successful in previous circumstances.'

P. vermidax is described today in the latest issue of the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

The creature has a rat-like tail but a long, thin nose similar to a 
shrewâ€™s. Its only teeth are its incisors, which in the upper jaw end in 
twin points.

The Latin derived genus name Paucidentomys means 'few-toothed mouse' and the species name vermidax means 'devourer of worms'.

Co-author Anang Achmadi, from Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense in 
Indonesia, said: 'The specialised incisors of rodents give them the 
distinct ability to gnaw - a defining characteristic of rodents 
worldwide.

'In having lost all teeth except a pair of unusually shaped incisors 
that are incapable of gnawing, this new rat is unique among rodents.'

Dr Rowe said the find was a reminder that wild habitats can still harbour undiscovered species.

He added: 'In the mountains of Sulawesi, where we discovered 
Paucidentomys, healthy forests still nurture rare and remarkable 
species, however, they are isolated patches imperilled by expanding 
logging, mining, plantations and other human activities.'
