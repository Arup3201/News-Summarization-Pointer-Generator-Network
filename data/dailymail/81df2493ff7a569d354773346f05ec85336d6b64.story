A chokehold used by a white police officer on a black New York City man during his arrest for selling untaxed, loose cigarettes last month caused his death, the medical examiner announced Friday, ruling it a homicide.

Eric Garner, 43, whose videotaped confrontation with police has caused widespread outcry and calls by the Reverend Al Sharpton for federal prosecution, was killed by 'the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,' said medical examiner spokeswoman Julie Bolcer.

Asthma, heart disease and obesity were contributing factors, she said.

Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York Police Department. The case is being investigated by prosecutors on Staten Island, though Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department is 'closely monitoring' the investigation.

For Eric Garner's widow, there is some small relief that the truth about her husband's death is out.

'Thank God the truth is finally out,' Esaw Garner told the New York Daily News. 'Thank God for that.'

Video from after Garner has become unconscious shows him lying on the ground as police look over him.

Almost seven minutes pass before paramedics arrive and no one had attempted CPR before Garner was loaded into an ambulance.

The NYPD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the medical examiner's ruling. The officer who put Garner in the chokehold was stripped of his gun and badge pending the investigation, and another was placed on desk duty.

Two paramedics and two EMTs were suspended without pay.

Police Commissioner William Bratton has said the officer appeared to have placed Garner in a chokehold and has ordered a top-to-bottom redesigning of use-of-force training in the NYPD.

In provocative comments Thursday, 
Sharpton called for the officers to be charged criminally. Sharpton 
believes chokeholds are used disproportionately on minorities.

A
 video shot by an onlooker shows Garner telling the officers to leave 
him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. One responded by appearing to 
put him in a chokehold, which is banned under police policy.

Garner is heard gasping 'I can't breathe,' repeatedly and is ignored by police. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

'We want justice for my son. ... I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy,' said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr.

Police also confirmed Saturday that another officer has been placed on restricted duty after an amateur video surfaced that appears to show him stomping on the head of a Brooklyn drug suspect during a recent arrest.

In a statement, the president of the powerful Patrolmen's Association, cautioned against reading too much into the videos.

'Videotapes never present all of the facts in a situation,' said Patrick Lynch. 'They never capture the criminal act or offense that brings police action to the scene. They present an isolated period of a police interaction but never the entire scenario.'

The Garner family was joined Saturday by the fiance of Sean Bell, an unarmed man killed by NYPD officers in a 50-bullet barrage in 2006 on what would have been his wedding day. Three officers were cleared of manslaughter charges, but the city was forced to pay more than $7 million to settle a wrongful death claim.

'Seeing this family is like looking in the mirror,' said Nicole Paultre Bell, who legally took his name after his death.

Sharpton told the audience he's planning to rally support for a federal probe by inviting activists from across the country to join in a march across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.

'We are not going to let this go,' Sharpton said. 'Can you imagine? A chokehold on videotape? If we can't get justice here, we can't get justice anywhere.'
