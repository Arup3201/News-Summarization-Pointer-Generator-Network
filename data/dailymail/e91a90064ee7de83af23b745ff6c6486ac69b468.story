A contractor has emerged as a possible suspect in the murder of a Brooklyn slumlord whose charred corpse was found in a dumpster earlier this month.

The suspect has been linked to a Dodge minivan that was used to abduct Menachem Stark outside his real estate firm in Williamsburg during a blizzard on January 2.

Police said on Thursday that they suspect Stark may have been killed over a single $20,000 debt that he owed to one individual. The landlord owed millions to various creditors.

It was suggested by investigators that Stark's death may have been accidental with the kidnap intended to scare him into coming up with the money.

A contractor who allegedly murdered slumlord Menachem Stark was owed $20,000 by the Brooklyn developer, it has been claimed

In the days before his brutal death, Stark had begged business associates to lend him a six-figure amount and had a Borough Park developer put up half a million dollars for him.

The contractor suspect has also been connected
 to a cellphone which investigators found attached under Stark's car. The phone is believed to have been used to track Stark's whereabouts before he was 
snatched off the street.

Police told the New York Post that associates of the individual that Stark owed money may have grabbed him.

On Tuesday, police
 found the 2002 Dodge minivan with Pennsylvania plates which was caught 
on surveillance footage during Stark's abduction.

The van was found in Brownsville, Brooklyn but appears to have been washed and wiped clean, police sources said.Â 

Murdered: The charred body of Menachem Stark, a father-of-seven, was found in a Long Island dumpster in early January. A man has now been arrested over his killing

Detectives seized the vehicle as a man got in and tried to drive off. The man was questioned by police but not charged.

Footage released last week showed one of the suspects walking
 from the van past Mr Stark's office, before returning to the vehicle 
where he remained for hours.

Stark was abducted on January 2 and found dead the next day in a dumpster behind a convenience store in Great Neck, Long Island.

Finding
 the van was a major breakthrough in the disturbing kidnapping and 
killing of Stark, a 39-year-old father of eight children.

Moses
 Strulowitz and Abraham Buxbaum, brothers-in-law of the victim have 
offered a $25,000 reward to find his killer. No arrests have yet been 
made.

Stark - who rented out properties riddled with violations - is believed to have been targeted by someone he owed money.

A suspect in the kidnap and murder of Stark is seen on security camera footage on the night of January 2. The man arrived at the scene in the minivan at 5pm and allegedly abducted Stark at 11.35pm

Grief: Hundreds of mourners carry the coffin of Menachem Stark through the streets of Brooklyn during his funeral. Stark was a member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect, which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah
