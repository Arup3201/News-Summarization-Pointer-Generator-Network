Hours after his ex-wife was found dead in her bathtub, a frantic doctor asked whether he was a monster and if he was responsible for her death, according to the couple's daughter.

Malkie Wall, now 19, testified on Thursday at her father's murder trial in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Uta von Schwedler, a 48-year-old University of Utah biologist, was found dead in her Salt Lake City bathtub in September 2011 with knife wounds on her body and a fatal level of Xanax in her system. 

Miss Wall said that Dr John Brickman Wall had a mental breakdown when he returned from a police interview.

'He said,"Yes, I don't think I did it, but maybe I did. Maybe I did do it. Am I a monster? I could be a monster,"' Miss Wall told jurors.

Prosecutors allege her 51-year-old ex-husband killed her during a bitter custody battle, but defense attorneys say she could have killed herself. 

A medical examiner ruled she drowned, but stopped short of ruling whether her death was a homicide or a suicide.

Lawyer Fred Metos has said aggressive police questioning made Wall question his own sanity. and he was treated at a psychiatric facility shortly after the police interview.

Malkie Wall said her parents fought about how to raise the children and money, and on one occasion her father physically removed her mother from his front yard.

The last time she saw her mother was Sept. 26, 2011, before Wall picked her up along with her three siblings to go back to his house.

Ms Von Schwedler wanted to talk to Wall about an upcoming trip to California she was planning to take with the two younger children, but he ignored her and drove away.

Wall was questioned the following night by police  after his ex-wife was found dead.

He returned home after 3am and told his daughter 'Your mom's dead and they think I did it.'

'He was crying. He was not with it,' Malkie Wall said, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The young woman testified that her father never admitted to killing her mother. 

When Ms Wall had woken up in his house that morning, she went looking for him to find medicine because she'd stepped on a bee at cross country practice the day before.

Wall was nowhere in the house, and she couldn't reach him by text or phone call. 

Eventually, she walked to the train station and went to school and he picked her up from piano lessons in the afternoon.

Prosecutors say Wall had the interior of his car shampooed that morning, and he told car wash employee Anthony Izarras to pay special attention to light pink drip stains behind the driver's seat.

Mr Izarras testified that he thought the request was a little odd because the car was otherwise clean.

Wall also had cuts on his forearms and an eye bleeding internally, but told both his daughter and police that they were from the family dog. 

Thursday's testimony came during the final day of the second week of Wall's murder trial.

Ms Von Schwedler's death was initially treated as a suicide, but family and friends, including their oldest son, called for more investigation. 

Wall was charged more than a year after her death in a largely circumstantial case.

Malkie Wall said Thursday that her mother did not appear depressed or suicidal leading up to her death.
