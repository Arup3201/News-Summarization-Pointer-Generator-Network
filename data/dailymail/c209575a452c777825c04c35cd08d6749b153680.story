Cheat: Havering Council worker, Cheema, 23, abused his position to fraudulently claim benefits

A crooked benefits adviser teamed up with his mother to cheat the council where he worked out of £30,000 in housing and council tax benefits, using insider knowledge of the welfare system.

Havering Council worker Manjit Singh Cheema, 23, and his mother Balbir Kaur, 46, both of Romford, Essex, were spared jail after admitting fraud by abuse of position.

Since 2009, Kaur claimed £29,500 as a single mother, while she and her two young children shared a home with a man and her elder son, Cheema.

Following a tip-off in 2011, investigating officers discovered that the house was co-owned by Cheema and the other male occupant, and arrested mother and son in November that year.

Cheema, whose job was to answer housing 
and council tax queries, told council bosses he lived at another house and failed to tell them he was his mother's landlord.

Judge William Graham told Cheema and 
Kaur: 'This is serious, not only as it is a fraud of public funds, but 
as it makes the situation for genuine claimants more difficult'.

An examination of Kaur's fraudulent claim forms  revealed it was 
Cheema who had filled them in.

The investigation discovered that a deposit of £60,000 had been paid on the £210,000 house in Romford, with monthly mortgage payments taken from Cheema's account.

The deposit was described in the mortgage agreement as a family gift. 

Judge William Graham told Cheema and 
Kaur: 'This is serious, not only as it is a fraud of public funds, but 
as it makes the situation for genuine claimants more difficult.'

Councillor Roger Ramsey of Havering Council
said: 'They were acting as if they wanted to help the poorest people in 
our society, when really the fraud meant they were stealing from their 
pockets.

'Our benefits 
system is meant for the most vulnerable members of our community so 
anyone taking advantage should be well aware that we will do our utmost 
to find you, take you to court and get our money back.

Basildon Crown Court sentenced them yesterday to nine months in jail suspended for 18 months, and ordered them to do 150 hours of unpaid work.

Havering council said it would pursue them both for the return of the money they stole.

Scene of the crime: Collier Row Road, Romford, where Cheema, 23, owned a house and secretly acted as landlord to his mother, Kaur, 46, who claimed £29,500 in benefits from Havering Council
