When a five-month-old baby stopped breathing while being driven along a Florida highway on Thursday there was plenty of help at hand.

As Pamela Rauseo pulled over and screamed for someone to help her nephew, Sebastian, a police officer and two firefighters who were stuck in traffic rushed to her aid.

In a twist of fate, award-winning photojournalist Al Diaz was also in the traffic hold up, and captured a series of dramatic pictures showing the emergency crews saving the baby's life.

Sebastian, who suffers from respiratory problems after being born prematurely, had started to turn blue as Ms Rauseo drove along a highway at 2.30pm.

She quickly pulled over and lifted him from the car, screaming for help.

Diaz, who works for the Miami Herald, said he heard a woman 'screaming that the baby can't breathe'.

The photographer then took a series of dramatic pictures showing fellow motorists and emergency workers who were on their way to work rushing to save the baby.

One of the first on the scene was Lucila Godoy. Leaving her three-year-old son in her car, Godoy rushed to help as Rauseo performed CPR on her nephew.

As the women tried to resuscitate baby Sebastian, Diaz ran through the stopped traffic to try to search for more help.

Diaz alerted police officer Amauris Bastidas, who rushed in to take over performing CPR.

'He started breathing and crying. Then he started not breathing again,' Bastidas said.

Just as the baby started to breathe again, more help arrived after Anthony Trim and Alvaro Tonanez from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue heard the emergency call while stuck in traffic.

The rescue workers were able to keep Sebastian breathing until paramedics arrived. The baby is said to be in stable condition in hospital.
