After winning the support of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Mitt Romney now has the support of legendary quarterback John Elway, ahead of the first presidential debate tomorrow.

The former Denver Broncos quarterback hailed the Republican candidate as a 'proven leader' and called Romney and his vice-president hopeful Paul Ryan as a 'comeback team'.

The executive vice president of football operations for the Denver Broncos said: 'Governor Romney is a proven leader with the experience and background to turn around our struggling economy,' The Weekly Standard reported.

Owner: Woody Johnson spoke candidly about everything from politics to the NFL referee lockout that was resolved last week when he appeared on Market Makers on Monday

'In these tough economic times, we 
need a president who understands how to get America working again – by 
standing on the side of taxpayers and small-business owners who do the 
real job creating.

'I am endorsing Governor Romney and 
Congressman Ryan for President and Vice President because I know having 
the courage to make decisions and tackle challenges is what leads to 
results and real change. America needs a comeback team - Mitt Romney and
 Paul Ryan are that team.'

A delighted Romney said he was thrilled to have the Hall of Fame footballer, who retired in 1999 and was statistically the second most prolific passer in the history of the NFL, backing him.

He said: 'Leaders come in many forms,
 and John Elway has always exemplified leadership, first as a 
quarterback for the Super Bowl champion Broncos, and now as an executive
 vice president for the team.

'He's had to overcome challenges during his career, and he knows what it takes to turn things around when things get tough.

'I'm proud to have him on my team as we campaign to lead the comeback this nation desperately needs.'

Elway was joined by Woody Johnson - whose priorities go beyond the football field in an election season.

Appearing on Bloomberg TV's Market 
Makers on Monday morning, Johnson wore the Jets team colors on his tie 
as he candidly spoke on everything from politics to the recent referee 
lockout.

But at the 
conclusion of the interview, Market Makers co-host Stephanie Ruhle asked
 Johnson which was more important - a winning season for the Jets, or an
 election victory for Mitt Romney?

Johnson responded: 'Well I think you 
always have to put country first. So I think it's very very important - 
not only for us but in particular our kids and grandkids - that this 
election come off with Mitt Romney and [Paul] Ryan as president and vice
 president.'

Johnson, the Johnson & Johnson 
heir who also serves as one of Romney’s campaign finance co-chairs, is 
no stranger to the Republican cause.

In the past two days, Johnson held three major fundraisers for the Romney/Ryan ticket in New York.

Business Insider reported
 last month that Johnson donated $2,500 to Romney's campaignin 2012, but
 has raised millions in recent years for GOPers like Romney, George W. 
Bush and John McCain.

And if Johnson is putting more 
support behind Romney, it's certainly showing on the football field, as 
the Jets suffered a heartbreaking blowout loss on Sunday at home.

The injury-plagued team was stopped dead in their tracks by a superior San Francisco 49ers, who won 34-0.

Always
 slow to keep his temper under control, head coach Rex Ryan told 
reporters after Sunday's game: 'I was going to say we got our butt 
kicked, but really, we got our ass kicked. There's no two ways, ins or 
outs about it.'

Quarterback Mark Sanchez’s measly 13 completions in 29 attempts have some fans calling for him to take a seat on the bench and allow back-up Tim Tebow much more playing time.

Tebow said after the game: 'Me and Mark have a great relationship and we're not worried about that. We're not worried about what others are saying.'

Johnson, who called the loss 'absolutely unacceptable,' said it didn’t mean Tebow will start next week, but admitted 'it's a question that’s going to be asked more frequently.'
