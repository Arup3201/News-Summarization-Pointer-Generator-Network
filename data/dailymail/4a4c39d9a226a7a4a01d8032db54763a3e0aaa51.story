Tottenham are closing on an £8million move for Sevilla defender Federico Fazio.

The 6ft 5ins centre-back is wanted by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who has seen his move for Villarreal centre-back Mateo Musacchio fall through due to third-party ownership issues.

Having identified Fazio, 27, as an alternative to Musacchio, the White Hart Lane club are growing increasingly confident of concluding a deal for the defender, who has two caps for Argentina.

Show me the money: Tottenham have been told they must pay £8million to sign Federico Fazio from Sevilla

Pricey: The defender is under contract at Sevilla and they insist on Spurs paying his £8m release clause

Tottenham are willing to sell Michael Dawson and Vlad Chiriches. Dawson is an option for West Ham while Chiriches is among the defenders being considered by Roma. 

Manchester City's Matija Nastasic is another but is more expensive. Roma have also enquired about Arsenal target Kostas Manolas of Olympiacos. 

Experienced: Fazio stands at 6ft 5ins tall and he has made 179 appearances for Spanish side Sevilla

International: The 27-year-old Fazio has played for Argentina, representing his nation on two occasions
