David Moyes may have only been manager of Real Sociedad for a matter of weeks, but the Scottish boss seems to have picked up at least four Spanish words already.

They may be the four most well known words in the language, but the former Manchester United manager seemed keen to show off his skills during his latest pre-match press conference.

Moyes was asked a question about Sociedad's B team before deciding to count in Spanish rather than his native tongue.

Despite the language barrier, Moyes is already beginning to get his message accross

Moyes said: 'I know about the B team. I know some of the players. They have been training with me uno, dos, tres, cuatro times, but I have not seem them play.'

Despite the language barrier, Moyes has made a bright start to his time in Spain with a win and a draw in his first two games.

The 51-year-old didn't quite go as far as Steve McClaren's Dutch efforts in 2008 which saw the former FC Twente boss speak with a bizarre Dutch accent.

QPR midfielder Joey Barton has also been guilty of falling into the foreign language trap, by feigning a French accent while on loan at Ligue 1 side Marseille.
