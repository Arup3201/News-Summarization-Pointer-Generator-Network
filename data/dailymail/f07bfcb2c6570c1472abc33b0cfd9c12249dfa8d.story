Labour was in turmoil last night as members of the Shadow Cabinet, party donors and businessmen united to condemn Ed Balls’s plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p.

Insiders said the Shadow Chancellor has left Ed Miliband’s top team divided over the wisdom of ramping up tax after refusing to consult his senior colleagues about Labour’s biggest economic announcement in a year.

Former Labour City minister Lord Myners accused Mr Balls of using ‘GCSE economics’ to justify a return to the ‘politics of envy’, while other critics said the move would deter investors from coming to Britain and damage economic growth.

With his credibility under fire, Mr Balls then used an interview yesterday to deny that the deficit left by Labour was a problem. He even boasted that if he had his time in power again he would have spent even more money in some areas.

And he refused to say what blend of spending cuts and tax rises he would adopt to balance the books – raising the spectre of further tax raids on middle England.

In a speech to the Left-wing Fabian Society on Saturday, Mr Balls revealed that Labour will increase the income tax rate from 45p in the pound to 50p for those earning over £150,000 until 2020 if the party wins power next year.

He also said Labour would eliminate the deficit by 2020 – two years slower than George Osborne has planned.

A senior Labour figure told the Mail that Mr Balls sprung the plans on the Shadow Cabinet last week and also revealed that several shadow ministers think the decision is a mistake.

‘It wasn’t discussed with us,’ a member of the Shadow Cabinet said. ‘We were told in advance but we didn’t get to have a say. Frankly we’re pretty divided over whether it is a good idea. There is no unity on that.’

In his speech, Mr Balls claimed that the plan could bring in £15billion over five years.

But Government figures, backed up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, show that cutting the top rate is only set to cost the Government £100million.

In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr yesterday, Mr Balls admitted that he has no idea how much money the tax rise will bring in. ‘The question is how much,’ he said.

The plans were roundly denounced by two of Gordon Brown’s ministers.

Lord Myners said: ‘The economic logic behind his thinking would not get him a pass at GCSE economics. Ed Balls takes us back to old Labour and the politics of envy. We need to encourage productive enterprise and effort rather than resort to predatory taxation.’

Lord (Digby) Jones, a former trade minister who now sits as a crossbench peer, accused Labour of devising an ‘if it creates wealth let’s kick it’ policy.

He predicted Mr Balls would ramp the top rate even higher, to 55p or 60p, if he gets his hands on power – a claim Mr Balls denies.

Those questioning the move yesterday included Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, who warned that the swingeing tax rate could deter foreign investors from coming to the UK.

Labour left Britain with a deficit 5.3 per cent of GDP at the start of the financial crisis – the highest in the G7 group of the world’s biggest economies.

But Mr Balls told the Andrew Marr Show: ‘Do I think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for Britain? No, I don’t.’

Sajid Javid, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘Labour got us into a mess by spending and borrowing too much in the good years.

‘But Ed Balls thinks the deficit was not “too high” at the time, and says he would do it all over again. It’s the same old Labour.’

Should we need confirmation that Labour was returning to type as the party of high taxes and state intervention in business we now have it.

The pledge by Ed Balls to lift the tax paid by the very highest earners to 50 pence in the pound looks like a return to the bad old Labour of the 1970s when Chancellor Denis Healey vowed to tax the rich until ‘the pips squeak’.

Until Saturday, when the burly Shadow Chancellor unveiled his new script, the City and the business community had drawn a distinction between ‘Bad Ed’ and ‘Good Ed’.

Bad Ed was Miliband, with his hugely damaging threats of intervention in the markets – starting off with his promise to freeze energy prices – undermining not only the energy sector but banking, house-building and out-sourcing companies as well as the safety of the FTSE 100 as a place to invest.

Believe it or not, Good Ed was Balls, who from his days in the Blair-Brown government had bought into the Anglo-Saxon economic model of free markets, low taxation and soft-touch regulation of the financial community.

Clearly, though, Labour now feels so desperate to develop a winning narrative in the face of the stupendous gains in employment over recent months and the International Monetary Fund’s endorsement of the British recovery that it has decided to play the class card.

By seeking to revive the 50 per cent tax band for people earning over £150,000 a year, it is endeavouring to portray the Tories as the party of the rich. In so doing it has abandoned New Labour and Lord Mandelson’s famous dictum that he was ‘intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich’.

Only in the dying days of the 1997-2010 Labour government did the party increase taxes on higher earners in a revenge attack on the perceived role of the bankers in bringing the financial system crashing down.

Until then Labour had been more than happy to keep a top rate of 40 per cent – less than the 45 per cent introduced by George Osborne – for almost its whole period in office.

The biggest criticism of the high taxation of big earners is that it stifles entrepreneurship and drives the most talented individuals overseas.

Top executives at some of our most successful exporters, such as drinks giant Diageo, have told me that many of their best managers sought overseas postings because Alistair Darling introduced the 50 per cent rate as Chancellor under Gordon Brown.

Britons do not have to look far to see the sheer economic vandalism caused by high taxes.

Long before President Hollande of France’s love life became the story, he was in deep trouble because of his decision to introduce tax rates for the most wealthy of up to 80 per cent.

Entrepreneurship ground to a halt, the economy stuttered and there was an exodus of executives to London.

It is an inexorable law of economics that the lower the tax rate, the more the income that is generated for a country. High taxes act as a disincentive to hard work and business creativity.

Figures from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that the Exchequer will raise £49.3billion from the 45 per cent tax rate this year, against £41.6billion in 2012-2013 when the 50 per cent rate was in place.

This is partly because the higher the tax level, the more those earning the highest incomes look for ways to avoid paying tax.

The dangerous aspect of the schoolboy economics of the two Eds is that it damages the very people they claim to represent. By aiming an arrow at the heart of enterprise they damage economic confidence and the willingness of business people – from the smallest corner shop to the big corporations – to invest and to create jobs.

Labour appears set on a path of wanton economic and financial destruction that undermines growth and the value of all our savings in pensions and ISAs.

The very idea that any of this can end the pressure on living standards – a consequence of the mess Labour left behind – is sheer, unadulterated fantasy.
