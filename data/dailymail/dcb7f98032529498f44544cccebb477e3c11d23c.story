Rio Ferdinand met with Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night to thrash out his protracted transfer to the newly-promoted Premier League club.

The veteran-central defender held talks with Harry Redknapp at a central London hotel in bid to agree a 12 month contract.

Ferdinand is a free agent following his release from Manchester United last month. Sportsmail exclusively revealed in June how Rangers had agreed a deal with Ferdinand to join ahead of next season.

But the move has been shrouded in doubt over a wage disagreement after QPR had a last-minute rethink on Ferdinand's personal terms.

However, Redknapp believes he can still lure Ferdinand to Loftus Road and hopes to conclude a deal this week.
