Robin Williams did not have any illegal drugs or alcohol in his system when he committed suicide, the coroner's report has revealed.

The troubled comic was found hanging from a belt at his home in Marin County, California, on August 11. He was 63.

On Friday, authorities formally ruled the star's death as suicide as it was revealed he was struggling with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, anxiety, depression and paranoia.

'Very difficult and emotional': Robin Williams found filming the scene in World's Greatest Dad hard. He played the father of a son who killed himself accidentally through auto-erotica

The report states the Mrs Doubtfire star - who had battled drink and drugs in the past - had four drugs in his system at the time of his death. 

Toxicology reports found two anti-depressants and two caffeine compounds and there was no alcohol in his system.

When authorities found Robin's body, the reports states they saw a closed bottle of Seroquel, a drug that treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression. It was prescribed a week before he died. 

Robin, a dad of three, was found dead in a bedroom at his Tiburon home. Most poignantly, the report tells how Susan wanted to see her husband's body before it was taken away, and that she was joined by Sheriff's deputies as she prayed over him.

She was also asked by authorities if her husband was interested in auto-erotica, which she said he was not.

But she added that he was left troubled by his work on his 2009 movie, World's Greatest Dad, in which his character's son died after hanging himself for sexual gratification.

The scene where Robin discovered his son's body was 'very difficult and emotional for Mr Williams', according to the coroner's report.

In the film, Robin tries to cover up the manner of death by making it look like a suicide. 

The legendary comic battled paranoia, according to the report, and the night before he died, he placed several wristwatches in a sock and gave them to someone because he was worried about their safe keeping.

Talented: Robin Williams, pictured in World's Greatest Dad, was found hanging at his home. Today, the coroner ruled his death as suicide 

Today, a statement issued by the Marin County Sheriff's Office said: 'On August 11, 2014 the Marin County Sheriff’s Office Investigations and Coroner Divisions began investigations into the death of Robin McLaurin Williams who had been pronounced deceased at 12:02 pm at 95 St. Thomas Way in unincorporated Tiburon, California. 

'The investigations into Mr. Williams’ death have concluded with the Coroner Division issuing the following findings: Cause of Death: Asphyxia due to Hanging, Manner of Death: Suicide.

'Toxicological evaluation revealed the absence of alcohol or illicit drug. Prescription medications were detected in therapeutic concentrations.' 

The report says the last outgoing call from Robin's phone was at 7.08 PM the night before he died. He had called his wife Susan, and it lasted 38 seconds. 

Susan told authorities he called because he was picking up magazines for her at a bookstore.

When asked about his behavior, Susan said he seemed well and had taken his iPad from their closet which she took to be a good sign because he hadn't watched TV or read anything in about six months. 

The web browser had several tabs open to websites discussing medications, including Lyrica, an anti-seizure drug, and propranolol, which treats blood pressure and tremors.

Tragic: One of the last pictures Robin Williams posted on his Instagram account. Posing with Crystal the monkey, who had co-starred with him in the Night at the Musem films.  Williams posed with his furry friend on his 63rd birthday on July 21, writing, “Happy Birthday to me! A visit from one of my favorite leading ladies, Crystal'

Heartbroken: Fans lay flowers as a tribute to Robin Williams outside his California home following his death

The couple were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Susan admitted, because Robin was having trouble sleeping and would talk loudly in his sleep.

The last time she saw him was around 10.30pm on Sunday night and said he seemed 'excited'. 

According to the report, Robin had experienced Parkinson's symptoms since 2011. He had a tremor in his left arm and movement in his left hand had slowed. 

He had recently started taking Levodopa to treat the symptoms.
