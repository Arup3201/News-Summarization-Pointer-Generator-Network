Silicon Valley-based Tesla Motors unveiled a new system on Thursday that allows drivers to change the batteries in their electric cars in about 90 seconds.

Tesla Motors already provides free charging stations to Tesla drivers, but the recharging process can take up to an hour to fully charge a 85-kwh battery.Â 

The new system uses a machine based on Tesla's factory robots that quickly removes the old battery and replaces it with a new one.

Road tripping: The lack of range and too few charging stations have discouraged drivers from considering electric cars for long-distance travel in the past, but Tesla is seeking to change all that with its new 90-second battery swap system

The system was revealed in a demonstration on Thursday night during 
which the automated battery-replacement system was pitted against a 
traditional gas car fill-up to measure for speed.

On stage, a Tesla Model S had its battery switched out while on screen, the gas car was being filled at an LA gas station.

The gas car was filled up in four minutes and cost $99.83 to fill up the
23 gallon tank, while two Tesla cars had their batteries changed during that time.

According to Quartz.com, battery replacement will cost at least $50.

The new system, says Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, is to encourage people to consider electric cars for long-distance drives.

'The only decision you need to make when you come to one of our Tesla stations is, do you prefer faster or free,' he said on Thursday.

'Our goal here was to eliminate the objections that people have. We want to show that [Tesla] can actually be more convenient than a gasoline car. Hopefully this is what convinces people that electric cars are the future.'

He also guaranteed that charging at a Tesla station 'is and always will be free'.

Tesla Supercharging stations are currently in eight locations on the East and West coasts. In May, Tesla announced plans to greatly expand the network, tripling the number of Tesla Supercharging stations by the end of this month.

Pricey: A Tesla model S will set you back $62, 400, but according to CEO Elon Musk, use of charging stations 'is and will always be free'

By fall, the company plans to have stations in most metropolitan areas,  and to have a corridor of stations equipped with battery-swapping technology from LA to New York by the end of this year. By 2015, the plan is to have 98 per cent of the U.S. and Canada covered.

Drivers who swap batteries will eventually have to return to the station of the swap to get their original battery back, according to CNN, and pay to have it replaced in their cars again.

If they don't return to the station, they can pay to have the 1000lb battery shipped back to their local service station, or just keep the new battery that's been installed.

The battery-swapping robots will service the Tesla model S and all future models, but not Tesla's original car, the Roadster.
