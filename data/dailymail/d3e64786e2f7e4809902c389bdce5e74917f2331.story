While most young mascots accompanying players onto the pitch appear wide-eyed and slightly overwhelmed, there is occasionally one cheeky scamp who doesn't play by the rules.

Ahead of Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat to West Ham at Upton Park, one Hammers mascot staked his claim to be handed legend status during the pre-match handshake ritual.

The youngster walked along the line politely shaking hands with the officials and City captain Vincent Kompany - but, just as keeper Joe Hart stretches out his hand, he pranks England's No 1 with a classic playground thumbing of the nose.

It is, of course, not the first time a 'fake handshake' has been used by a small child at the expense of a millionaire footballer.

In 2006, a five-year-old Chelsea fan endeared himself to an audience of millions by making a fool out of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard in the Stamford Bridge tunnel.

The former England captain later said in his autobiography: 'The only time I smiled in the tunnel was when the Chelsea mascot played a trick on me. I went to shake his hand and he pulled a face at me. If it was an adult I would have wanted to wring their neck!'
