Soldiers serving in Afghanistan have become overnight internet sensations after filming a tongue-in-cheek dance video of Pharrell Williams' hit song 'Happy'.

The unlikely pop stars shimmy round the Sterga 2 base in Helmand Province, using the desert, concrete blocks and even the roof of a military truck as a dancefloor.

The men and women of the Highlanders, 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 Scots) also strut their stuff in the base's gym and while queuing for rations and fixing their vehicles.

A black labrador makes a cameo in the musical ensemble, waltzing around the sandy floor with its handler.

A 'casualty', lying motionless in a medical bay, is even brought back to life thanks to the power of music.

The British Army shared the fun footage on their Twitter page on Tuesday.

By this  morning and after just seven days, the cheeky tribute has more than 11,000 views, with a staggering 5,000 coming in the last 24 hours alone

A spokeswoman for the Army in Scotland said: 'It has got everywhere in the last few days'

The battalion is the modern day descendant of the Highlanders regiment - itself the successor of the Gordon Highlanders and the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons)

By this morning and after just seven days, the cheeky tribute has more than 11,000 views, with a staggering 5,000 coming in the last 24 hours alone.

A spokeswoman for the Army in Scotland said: 'It has got everywhere in the last few days.'

'This will probably be the last time in Afghanistan for 4 Scots, so they're making the most of it.'

The battalion is the modern day descendant of the Highlanders regiment - itself the successor of the Gordon Highlanders and the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons).

Based in Fallinbostel in Germany, they are due to return to the UK and move to Catterick in Yorkshire within the next couple of years.
