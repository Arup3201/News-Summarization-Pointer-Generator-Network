Oakland Raiders offensive tackle Menelik Watson is determined to fly the British flag higher than ever after being rocked by the news that compatriots Lawrence Okoye and Jack Crawford had failed to make the final cut.

Okoye was placed on the San Francisco 49ers’ practice squad while Crawford also failed to make the final 53-man roster at his team, the Oakland Raiders.

That leaves Manchester-born Watson as the only Brit left standing in the Bay Area, and the 25-year-old is determined to do his country proud.

Bay Area Brit: Menelik Watson is set to embark on another season with the Oakland Raiders

In his blog for nfluk.com, Watson said: ‘This Saturday (final roster cuts) really hit home! I got news that a few of my college teammates were waived. Past that I received news that my two fellow countrymen Jack Crawford and Lawrence Okoye, who both fly the British flag at every opportunity, were waived.

‘When I heard Jack got waived it hit me like a ton of bricks. Jack is more than just a fellow countryman, teammate, and neighbour (we live in the same building)… He’s a brother! I met Jack when I was 15. We played against each other in the England Basketball Under 16 Final Four. Jack was drafted to the Oakland Raiders a year before I was.’

Watson added: ‘I first met Lawrence Okoye last year in Atlanta, Georgia at the airport when I was reporting to rookie minicamp. He was headed to San Francisco for the 49ers rookie minicamp, and we somehow coincidentally managed to be on the same flight weighing down the plane.

‘Just like Jack he is a great representative for the UK, and he is a guy who I was definitely pulling for to make the team.

‘I’m going to miss having those guys in the Bay with me. It’s easy to fly the flag when you have two of the largest guys in the Western Hemisphere flying it with you, but I’m still going to do everything in my power to make sure that flag flies higher than ever out here.’

Manchester's Menelik Watson became the highest-drafted British NFL player when selected by the Oakland Raiders in the second round in 2013. He will be writing a series of blogs for nfluk.com throughout this season.
