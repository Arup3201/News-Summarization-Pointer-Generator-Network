A father-of-three serving in Helmand was shot dead by a rogue Afghan soldier just days before he was due to fly home.

Lance Corporal Michael Foley was one of two family men murdered when Lieutenant Gul Nazir went berserk with his semi-automatic rifle after being refused entry to the UK’s base in Lashkar Gah.

The 25-year-old from Burnley fell alongside father-of-one Sergeant Luke Taylor, 33, in the attack on Monday.

L/Cpl Foley, who served with the 
Adjutant General’s Corps, leaves his wife Sophie and their three sons 
Calum, Warren and Jake. He deployed to Afghanistan in September and was 
preparing to return to his loved ones.

Sgt Taylor, from Bournemouth, was 
serving with the Royal Marines and had been in the warzone just four 
weeks. He leaves wife Nicola and young son Roan.

Nazir was shot dead by British troops.

The shooting was the latest in a string of 'green on blue' attacks in which members of the Afghan security forces have opened fire on international allies.

Tragic: The shooting took place at the British HQ in Lashkar Gar in Helmand province

Lieutenant
Gul Nazir is said to have arrived in an army vehicle with several men 
pretending to be assigned to guard a delegation of VIPs visiting the 
base.

But when he was challenged by guards 
and told to wait outside, he opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic 
rifle, killing the two men and wounding a third.

Ghulam Farooq Parwani, deputy 
commander of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Helmand, said the gunman 
had told sentries he was providing security for government ministers 
from Kabul.

Tribute: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond led tributes to the 'true and devoted family men', saying they 'died in the service of their country'

Sgt Taylor, from Bournemouth, Dorset,
 leaves behind his wife Nicola and their son Roan, while L/Cpl Foley, 
from Burnley, Lancashire, leaves his wife Sophie and their three sons 
Calum, Warren and Jake.

It is understood that Sgt Taylor worked in intelligence. He had only arrived in Afghanistan four weeks before his death.

The Royal Marine’s commanding officer, who cannot be named because of the nature of his work, described him as 'a natural leader with inspirational flair who was devoted to his family'.

He added: 'Sgt Luke Taylor was one of those very unique ‘soldiers’ who combined the highest professional standards with a completely disarming and relaxed personality.

'Always an absolute pleasure to work with. You knew that Sgt Taylor would deliver first time, every time.'

Another colleague said: 'He had one of those infectious charismas, always able to talk himself out of a situation. For me, like so many, Luke was simply an inspiration.'

A joint British-Afghan investigation has been launched to try to discover whether Nazir was working for the Taliban.

The renegade soldier was a member of 
the Fourth Kandak of 3-215 Brigade and had been a soldier for four 
years.

The Taliban said he had been in close contact with them.

But a 
military insider in Whitehall said: ‘The Taliban often over-egg their 
involvement for propaganda.’

Their deaths came on the same day a mass suicide attack which was to target buses in the Afghan capital of Kabul was foiled.

Intelligence
 officials seized 11 custom made 'suicide jackets' in the country's 
ministry of defence, less than a mile from the presidential palace.

Several Afghans, some reportedly soldiers in the Afghan National Army, were arrested and taken in for questioning.
