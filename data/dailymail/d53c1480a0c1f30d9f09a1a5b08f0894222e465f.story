A former teacher at a prestigious all-girls boarding school who was charged last month with sexually assaulting a student made his advances on the girl when she was 15, an affidavit stated on Tuesday.

It was also revealed that Joseph Rajkumar may have had inappropriate conversations with five other teenage girls at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut.

The 42-year-old, who taught physics and coached soccer and track, had been employed
at the school since August 2009. He was fired on March 4 and charged on 
March 25 with two counts of felony second-degree sexual assault and one 
count of misdemeanor fourth-degree sexual assault.

Police said the allegations date back
to 2010 and involve a now-former student who said that Rajkumar started
groping her when she was 15 and that they had sex in his classroom closet after she turned 17.

The allegations came out after the former student, who is now in college, told her boyfriend who went to the police, according to the Hartford Courant.

The former student said that it had started when she was 15 and that Rajkumar would hug her and run his hands down her back when she was stressed about big tests.

The girl told police that the situation developed and that she and 
Rajkumar had sex several times during some weeks. They had sex 
in a closet in his classroom.

According to an arrest warrant 
affidavit released on Tuesday, a guidance counselor at the school 
learned about sexually inappropriate conversations and text messages 
between Rajkumar and at least five students ages 15 to 18 and alerted 
the state Department of Children and Families.

Police began investigating March 6, two days after he was fired.

Rajkumar declined to comment after a 
brief appearance in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday and hung up the 
phone when contacted at his Farmington home on Wednesday.

He has posted $500,000 bail and is due back in court April 22.

Rajkumar told police that he had a 
sexual relationship with the one girl and sent other students emails 
that authorities say were sexually inappropriate, the affidavit says.

Rajkumar signed a statement for police after confessing to his wife, according to the document.

Messages seeking comment were left with a spokeswoman for Miss Porter's School on Wednesday.

Miss Porter's is a girls-only, college preparatory school where tuition costs up to $52,000 a year.

Miss Porter's day and boarding school
was established in 1843 and is a small, private establishment with 306 
girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on 
the campus.

It takes pride in a vast array of 
extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater 
programs, pottery, painting and textile classes.

Tuition for this year costs $48,510 for boarding students and $38,510 for girls who attend day classes.

Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography.

The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens.

'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.'

Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947.

Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper.

Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include socialite and fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer who passed away on Sunday.
