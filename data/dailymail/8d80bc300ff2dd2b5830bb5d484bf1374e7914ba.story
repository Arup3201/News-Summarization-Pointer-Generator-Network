It was the biggest fashion event since the Oscars and saw the likes of Dior, Gucci and Chanel draped over some of the most beautiful and high profile celebrities in the world.

Now, fashion illustrators Hayden Williams and Yigit Ozcakmak have sketched the best outfits from last Monday's Met Ball, and they're as pretty as the real-life pictures themselves.

The annual fashion extravaganza, held at he Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, saw celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Blake Lively and Rhianna dressed to their finest - and photographed the world over.
