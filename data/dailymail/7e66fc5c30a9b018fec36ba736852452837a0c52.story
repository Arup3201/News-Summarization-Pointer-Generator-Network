A man was held at gunpoint by a police officer after he was caught speeding on his way home to see his heavily pregnant wife, who was going into labor. 

Samuel Taylor of Cleveland Heights in Ohio was approaching his home when he was spotted travelling at 38mph in a 25mph zone. 

Police officer William Robinson gave chase as Mr Taylor turned into his street and pulled over. 

Mr Taylor told Cleveland.com: 'I was literally about six or seven houses from my home. I froze. I did not know what to do or where to stop. I was afraid. Please let me go inside. You can follow me; just holster your weapon.'

According to Mr Taylor, Officer Robinson was far too aggressive during the traffic stop and should not have pulled his gun.  

Taylor – who admits that he was speeding – said he believes the officer was too aggressive by pulling out his gun.

Cleveland Heights City Manager Tanisha Briley defended Officer Taylor: She said: 'We're aware of the incident and complaint by the driver and the matter is currently under review. 'Upon initial review we are comfortable that the officer followed CHPD protocol appropriately and he conducted himself in a professional manner.'

However, Mr Taylor said he is considering taking a civil suit against the Cleveland Heights Police Department. 

He said that while he had been speeding and should have pulled in earlier. 

Mr Taylor's wife Katie was taken to hospital where she is being treated for complications related to her pregnancy.  

Several US police forces are currently under pressure after officers killed a number of men including Michael Brown in St Louis and Eric Garner from Staten Island. 

The US State Department has already heavily criticised Cleveland Police in a report which claims that its officers are too quick to draw their firearms.
