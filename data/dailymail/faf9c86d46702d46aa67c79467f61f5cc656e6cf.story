We have all heard about unusual marriage proposals, but this one takes the (carrot) cake.

At the weekend Pang Kun and 48 of his friends took to the streets of Qingdao in east China's Shangong province dressed as carrots and he proposed to his girlfriend, Zhang Xinyu, who was out on a shopping trip.

The wacky Chinese man danced away in a square in the suit, which was orange - his girlfriend's favourite colour - and when he finally did get down on bended knee, she gladly accepted his proposal.

Saturday August 6 was the Chinese version of Valentine's Day, and so Pang put some special thought and attention in to planning the proposal.

In all, the idea took three weeks to perfect and execute, and cost him over £9,300.

Pang, who had installed a microphone into his costume, began jigging and then caused shoppers - including his girlfriend - to become bemused by recounting the couple's first date, six months previous.

'Six months ago I met you,' he said as he danced. 'I still 
remember your shyness on our first date, my longing for the next date, 
and my excitement the first time I held your hand at the movie theatre.'

And when he began peeling off his costume the crowd chanted to his girlfriend 'marry him, marry him', which she promised to do so.

His proposal has led him to become an Internet sensation, and online users have nicknamed him 'carrot boy', which has temporarily become one of the most searched terms in China.

In recent years people have become more inventive about marriage proposals and here is a selection of the more eye-catching.

In November 2007 an American used computer game Halo to pop the question.

Moviesign (his username) customised a map in the game, and set up what his girlfriend of over two years believed was going to be a two-on-two match with his friends.

After they started the game, Moviesign led Furtive Penguin (here name) to a location where he claimed he'd left an energy sword. Instead it was a sign which asked: 'Will you marry me?'

Mateo Martinez asked his girlfriend to marry him at 20,000 feet - just as the pair were about to sky dive.

He said: 'There is no better way to get your heart rate up than jumping out of a plane and proposing to your girlfriend.'

Thankfully she said yes.

And an American named Josh asked his girlfriend to marry him on a roof top, where they were having drinks with their friends.

He asks someone to throw him the ring, it falls and, standing on the ledge, so does he, having said: 'Will you marry ...'

His girlfriend rushes over to the edge panicked, only to see that he has fallen several storeys and landed on a cushioned safety mat - and is accompanied by a huge sign which reads: 'Me?'
