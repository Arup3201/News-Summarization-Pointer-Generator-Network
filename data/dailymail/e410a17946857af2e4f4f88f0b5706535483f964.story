Daniel Sturridge was last night ruled out of England’s Euro 2016 opener in Switzerland with a thigh injury.

Sturridge pulled up during the morning training session at St George’s Park on Friday, reported discomfort in a thigh muscle and was whisked away for a scan.

England’s medics assessed the results and decided the 25-year-old Liverpool striker was not fit to travel to Basle on Sunday for the game on Monday.

Pain: Daniel Sturridge pulled up injured during a training session on St George's on Friday morning

Blow: Sturridge has been ruled out of England's first Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland

It is a blow for Roy Hodgson, who has now lost three of his original 22-man squad – Jack Colback and Ben Foster have also left the camp with injuries - but the manager has resisted the temptation to call in any replacements.

The loss of Sturridge is without doubt the biggest blow. He has five goals in 16 appearances for his country and has become Hodgson’s established centre-forward since hitting prolific form following his move to Anfield from Chelsea.

He would have retained his place up front against the Swiss but his absence provides the manager with the choice of making a simple straight swap, calling in Daniel Welbeck to partner captain Wayne Rooney in a 4-4-2 system, or making a slight reshuffle to move Raheem Sterling into a more central position.

Sterling started on the left wing against Norway on Wednesday but finished the game in the centre, where he plays for Liverpool. He could play there in support of Rooney with Welbeck asked to play wide on the left.

Gary Cahill also missed training on Friday. Cahill has a swollen ankle after aggravating a knock against Norway on Wednesday and worked alone in the gym, but he is confident of being fit for Monday.

'I should be fine,' said the Chelsea centre-half. 'I’ve got a bit of fluid on my ankle which they thought would be better rested.'

Goal threat: Roy Hodgson will miss the quality the Liverpool man brings up top 

Cahill missed out on another example of Hodgson’s new angry persona, as the England manager yelled at his players for failing to produce the tempo and intensity he wanted to see in a crossing and shooting drill.

It followed his x-rated reaction to questions in the post-match press briefings his team had only managed two shots on target during Wednesday’s 1-0 win against Norway in a friendly at Wembley.

'I’ve seen that side of him before,' said Cahill. 'When he is upset he expresses his opinion and gets angry. He is also good at calming situations. I’ve seen a bit of both.

'Everyone wants it to be better. We’re no different and the manager is no different. That’s what you’re seeing - adding more pressure for us to do better. That’s really good. It’s easy to tick along when you’re winning games.'

At 28 and with 28 caps, Cahill is one of the senior squad members since Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard retired, and is ready to be one of the team’s leaders.

'I realise I’m one of the more experienced or older lads,' he said. 'But, what is leadership? Is it shouting at everyone every two minutes or is it trying to be in the right position, trying to lead by example?

'I think it’s a mixture of both. Saying sometimes what needs to be said but at the same time when you’re on the field just trying to organise people, which doesn’t necessarily have to mean throwing your arms everywhere.

'The young lads in this group will become more vocal. You have to be vocal when you’re playing.

'We are physical and that was a big strength in the past of English teams. We need to have that as a young group moving forward. We need to have that nasty side to us as well.'
