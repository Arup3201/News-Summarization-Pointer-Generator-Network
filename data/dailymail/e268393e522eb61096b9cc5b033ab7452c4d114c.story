Neighbours heard screams in between gunfire on the night Oscar Pistorius killed his girlfriend, court documents claim.

A final volley of shots ‘extinguished’ the screams, according to leaked witness statements.

If true, they indicate that Pistorius knew who he was shooting – destroying his claim to have mistaken Reeva Steenkamp for a burglar.

Denial: Oscar Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year

Killed: Oscar Pistorius will stand trial on March 3 for murdering his girlfriend n Valentine's Day

Prosecution documents claim the 
27-year-old reassured security guards that everything was 'fine' at his 
home after he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

The
 security team at Pistorius' private Pretoria housing estate reportedly 
telephoned his home after they heard of gunfire coming from the house.

But
 rather than report Reeva's death - which the disabled athlete claims 
was an accident - Pistorius allegedly told the guards that everything 
was 'fine'.

He reportedly never asked for their help and did not report the Valentine's Day shooting to them.

The claims are made in a prosecution information document given to Pistorius' defence team but leaked to South African news television channel eNCA.

More details from the document have been revealed by the South African radio news service EyeWitness News.

The 13 witness allegations that state prosecutors will reportedly present in the murder trial next month.

1. Witnesses heard 'talking like fighting' and a woman constantly speaking in a tone that suggested an argument, which stopped after the shots were fired.

2. Two witnesses heard a woman scream before shots were fired.

3. Two other witnesses heard shots and then a woman scream, followed by more shots.

4. Pistorius's online activity at home undermines the picture of a loving couple spending time together. On Valentine's Day.

5. The number of shots, their grouping and their trajectory indicate Pistoritus intended to kill the person behind the closed bathroom door.

6. The position and condition of the gun in the bathroom.

7. Pistorius got a gun and shot through the closed door without finding out who was behind it or whether or not he was in danger.

8. Steenkamp was clothed when she was shot.

9. Steenkamp was standing upright facing the door when she was shot.

10. Steenkamp had something to eat hours before she was killed.

11. The presence of the cellphones in the bathroom militates against a version that Steenkamp innocently went to the toilet at the time.

12. The fact and the way in which Pistorius broke down the toilet door.

13. Pistorius's version 'is not reasonably possibly true and it is our case that if rejected by the court the objective facts will prove the murder with direct intent of the deceased'.

The radio news service disclosed how 
police plan to rely on the athlete's Internet browsing history to prove 
he intended to kill his model girlfriend.

Pistorius'
 website activity on the night Reeva died, the document reportedly 
claims, 'is in direct contrast to that of a loving couple spending time 
together'.

It comes as 
South African prosecutors who charged the Olympian with murder have 
admitted he may not have had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the 
shots that killed his girlfriend, removing the key argument the shooting
 was premeditated.

Pistorius, who goes on trial on March 3, denies the charge of murder and claims he mistook his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired a number of bullets through his bathroom door, killing her instantly.

Steenkamp, a South African model, was 29.

But documents obtained by South African television news channel eNCA revealed the state’s own ballistics expert said the 27-year-old was ‘most likely’ on his stumps when he pulled the trigger repeatedly.

During an extensive bail hearing, prosecutors argued Pistorius took time to put on his prostheses before firing the shots through the locked bathroom door, indicating he was not panicked by the prospect of an intruder.

Prosecutors believe security guards at Pistorius’ gated community called the athlete after the shooting to check if everything was okay, to which he replied he was fine and did not require assistance, eNCA reported.

Police also claim a neighbour who lives less than 100 metres away heard shouting on Valentine’s Day, the night of Steenkamp’s death.

The National Prosecuting Authority said it had not leaked the documents.

‘The defence has access to everything, to the docket and all evidential material we have,’ spokesman Nathi Mncube said.

‘We don't give anything to any other person other than the defence and if it gets leak(ed), it won't be us. We can't do that because it's damaging to our case.’

Known around the world as ‘the Blade Runner’ for competing on two fibre-optic blades and running against able-bodied athletes in the London 2012 Olympic Games, Pistorius has turned his official website into a noticeboard to post updates and messages of support relating to the case.

Last week, on the anniversary of Steenkamp’s death, Pistorius posted on his website: ‘No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva.

‘The pain and sadness – especially for Reeva’s parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow.

‘The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.’

Pistorius, who had his legs amputated below the knee when he was a young boy, became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.
