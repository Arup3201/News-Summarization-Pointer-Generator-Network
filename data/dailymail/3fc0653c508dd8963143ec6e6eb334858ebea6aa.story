Simone L. Brooks, 35, of Lower Paxton Township is facing a raft of charges after repeated incidents involving elementary school students at a bus stop on her block

A Pennsylvania woman was busted this week after threatening to bludgeon elementary school-aged children to death with a shovel at a school bus stop in the latest unnerving event to shock an already-jittery nation.

Simone L. Brooks, 35, of Lower Paxton Township, was reportedly charged with making terroristic threats, stalking, and harassment in connection with several incidents that occurred at a bus stop on her block.

Additionally, Brooks reportedly performed a 'simulated strip tease,' before the tykes while perched on her porch in nothing but a bath towel. She reportedly yelled at them during this bit of exhibitionism.

Brooks was taken into custody Friday morning outside her home on the 4100 block of Linden Street, authorities told Pennlive.com, and as of Friday was being being held in lieu of $50,000 bond at Dauphin County Prison.

The arrest comes exactly a week after the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adult teachers and staff were mercilessly massacred by gunman Adam Lanza. Lanza concluded the shooting by taking his own life.

The massacre - one of the deadliest school shootings in 
U.S. history - shocked Americans, prompting some lawmakers to call for tighter 
restrictions on guns and causing school administrators nationwide to 
assess safety protocols.

Numerous copycat threats have occurred in the Newtown shootings' wake, including a bomb threat at a Newtown Catholic Church last weekend that forced the evacuation of the house of worship during a noon mass.

The bomb threat came just hours before President Obama was to arrive in Newtown for a memorial service.

Two days later on Tuesday, another Newtown school, Head O'Meadow Elementary School, was briefly shuttered due to unspecific threats.

Head O'Meadow's closure happened on the 
very day that Newtown welcomed students back to school, although Sandy 
Hook Elementary remains closed as police sift through evidence at what 
is now a crime scene.

On the day of the killings, Lanza, 20, got into his car and left the house he shared with his mother, Nancy Lanza, who's lifeless body was now hidden after Adam had shot her dead.

Lanza entered the school shortly before 9:30 a.m. dressed entirely in black and carrying two automatic handguns.

Shortly after entering the school, he opened fire.

He shot the principle, five other adults, and twenty children in just two rooms of the elementary school.

Witnesses later described the scene as nightmarish.

One man described how his younger sister first became aware of the shooting spree after she heard bullets and screams coming through the intercoms in the buildings.

Children described hearing loud booms as the gunman let out as many as 100 rounds and as their teachers ushered them into corners away from his killing spree.

Five minutes after the start of classes, the first 911 call goes out.

Ten minutes after Lanza began shooting, police arrive at the school in response to a 911 call.

They began evacuating students and teachers to a fire station a little less than half a mile away. Images later showed the traumatized, crying students hand-in-hand as they left the buildings.
