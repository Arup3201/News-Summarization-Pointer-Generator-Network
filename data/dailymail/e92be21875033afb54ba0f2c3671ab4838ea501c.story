In a social media exchange which began with former Australian cricketer Shane Warne talking sport with good mate and fellow cricketer Michael Clarke, Warne revealed he was a little behind the times.

During the AFL match between the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers on Saturday evening Warne accused Swans star Adam Goodes of staging, or taking theatrical dives in order to earn free kicks during the game.

'Come on tigers beat those Swans and make the finals. By the way, does everyone get annoyed when Adam Goodes always "stages" for free kicks ?' Warne wrote.

Captain of the Australian cricket team and good friend Michael Clarke responded to his mate's comment with 'Goodes is a legend mate. Swans to win the flag champion.'

Warne then replied to Clarke with the baffling admission that he was surprised to discover Goodes was awarded Australian of the year for 2014 - which was awarded in January, almost eight months ago.

'I think Syd or the Hawks will win the flag. Shocked as I just found out Goodes was Aust of the year, wow ! Who votes for that?' Warne wrote in a bizarre tweet.

One wrote to Warne 'So much respect gone for you. Use to like you but you're actually a flog. Can't believe I looked up to you as a kid.'

Others joked that they thought the former cricketer's account to be a parody based on his recent comments, only to discover it wasn't.

On Sunday morning Adam Goodes responded to the exchange as he pointed out that Australian cricketer and one of Warne's former teammates Adam Gilchrist, is the head of the Australia Day Council.

'@adamroy37 Just stop staging for free kicks mate. You should be better than that as Aust of the year !!! Good luck in the finals', Warne tweeted.
