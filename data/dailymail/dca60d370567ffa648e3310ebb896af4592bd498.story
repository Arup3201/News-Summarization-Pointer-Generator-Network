Benefits cheat: Former showgirl Dawn Orton has been ordered to pay back almost £40,000

A former Moulin Rouge showgirl who cheated the benefits system to fund a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle has been ordered to pay back almost £40,000.

Disgraced mother-of-two Dawn Orton, 47, returned to the UK from Spain in January and was jailed for 12 months after being convicted of benefit fraud in her absence at Hull Crown Court.

Now the former showgirl, who enjoyed 41 holidays during her 13 years of fraudulent claiming, has been ordered to pay back £38,320.87 within six months - or face another year behind bars.

Orton had fled to Malaga with her 
lover to avoid her trial at Hull Crown Court, but eventually returned to
the UK in January with an international arrest warrant hanging over her
head.

She was convicted in
her absence of benefit fraud amounting to £29,000 after claiming 
widowed mothers' allowance over the 13 year period. She had failed to 
declare that she was in a relationship.

It subsequently emerged that Orton 
had claimed thousands in incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder - 
despite having frequented a badminton club and enjoyed ski trips and 
scuba diving with sharks.

Speaking
at Hull Crown Court this week, Recorder Brian Cox QC said: 'I declare 
the benefit sum is £38,320.87. There will be six months to repay it.'

While hiding out in Spain Orton, of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, had written to the court to say she was on holiday.

She was convicted of benefit fraud in her absence.

Orton flew home and handed herself over to police after reading the Mail’s website and discovering a warrant was out for her arrest.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC previously told her: 'I brand you an extremely foolish woman. You have brought this on yourself.

'You decided to bury your head in the sand. You were in Spain with your new lover and you elected to prioritise your relationship with him ahead of your responsibility in coming to this court.'

When her husband died in 1996, Orton was given the chance to claim widowed mothers’ allowance instead of incapacity benefit as it was a larger sum.

But, within a year, she had moved in with her new partner Mark Lissimore in Cottingham and failed to declare she was no longer single.

After 13 years of living with Mr Lissimore, she eloped to the US with a new partner and her offending came to light.

Orton then moved to Spain and refused to return for her trial.

Mr Lissimore, a former Cottingham shopkeeper, attended court to see his former partner jailed in January.

He said: 'We were together for 13 years and I never knew about this. She told me she was off on a short holiday and never came back.

'All these brown envelopes started arriving and, finally, I opened them and discovered this.'

Orton was convicted of defrauding the taxpayer out of £29,000, which was the difference between the incapacity benefit she was originally claiming and the widowed mothers’ allowances she had illegally obtained.

The Department of Work and Pensions is now investigating her incapacity claims.

The court heard she has claimed more than £100,000 for incapacity benefit for her shoulder injury, despite playing sports and skiing.

Under the proceeds of crime act, she will now have to sell her assets and use her savings to repay the money she falsely claimed from the public purse.
