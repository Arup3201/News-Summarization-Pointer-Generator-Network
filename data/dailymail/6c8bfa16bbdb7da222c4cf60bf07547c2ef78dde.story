Having criticised Arsenal’s players for taking a picture of themselves at Manchester City, I’m supposed to have been left ‘red-faced’ by an image that emerged this week.

It is of me, in a towel, standing alongside Daniel Sturridge and Pedro Philippou, one of Liverpool’s physiotherapists. It was taken in May 2013 at Fulham, after my last away game, and Daniel had scored his first hat-trick for Liverpool.

Daniel was over the moon and he wanted his picture taken with a Liverpool legend! So what more could I say? I had no idea it was going to end up on social media . . . I didn’t have a clue what social media was back then!

To try to say I am embarrassed now is utter nonsense — the same words I would use to express my distaste for this new fad.

Seriously, this trend has got to stop. Arsenal did it last week but it goes on at plenty of other clubs, too.

I’m all for players enjoying a win but shouldn’t the picture taking be saved for the games that matter, such as cup finals, when you can come away with proper memories?

‘Selfies’ shouldn’t be taken after you get three points: that, remember, is the job footballers are paid to do.

The trend of players taking 'selfies' has got to stop

'Selfies' shouldn't be taken after every win, that's what players are paid for

I'm not at all embarrassed or red-faced that a picture of me and Daniel Sturridge appeared on social media after I criticised Arsenal
