It is the latest twist in a tail that could have come straight out of one of Oprah Winfrey's chat shows.

One week after the billionaire bought her father Vernon's barber shop when it went into foreclosure, he has been accused of cheating on his wife and making threats to kill her.

It comes at the same time Oprah is accused of trying to force her stepmother out of the marital home.

Barbara Winfrey made the accusations against Vernon Winfrey, 79, in divorce papers, claiming her husband conspired with his daughter to have her thrown out of their home in East Nashville, Tennessee even though she has nowhere to go.

According to The Tennessean, Barbara Winfrey claimed in Williamson County court that on one occasion, her husband 'became angered at her, chased her with a gun and threatened to shoot her. She also claims he had 'more than one adulterous relationship' during their 12-year marriage.

The accusations were made in a counterclaim after Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his third wife on June 22, just five days after their 12th anniversary.

He claimed that his 64-year-old wife was 'guilty of inappropriate marital conduct' and cited irreconcilable differences.

She denies the claims.

The couple lived together in the gated 
Laurel Brooke subdivision in Williamson County’s Grassland community, according to the Tennessean, in a property worth almost $1.5 million.

But because the home is titled in Oprah's name, both she and her father have been trying to force Barbara - who is seeking alimony support - out of the marital home even though she has nowhere to go, according to the court papers.

The store in Nashville, Tennessee, was bought by Oprah last week for $475,000.

Barbara
Winfrey said the purchase means the chat show host, who now runs her 
own YV network, has gained control of the business and cut her out.

‘I know what is going on. I'm tired of it, and I've had enough,’ Barbara Winfrey told WSMV TV in Nashville.

On the same day Oprah bought the property, Williamson County Sheriff’s officials responded to a call from Barbara who said Vernon and an 'entourage of his friends' had shown up at her home.

Barbara told the local media that Oprah was controlling her father.

‘He believes what he's told. His 
daughter doesn't care about the community. His daughter doesn't care 
about the barbershop. But I do,’ she said.

WSMV said they had confirmed that Oprah, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion, paid $475,000 for the barber shop.

In a statement to the TV station a spokesman for Oprah said: ‘Oprah purchased the property that was in foreclosure.

‘Vernon Winfrey has been a fixture in the community for decades and will continue to manage the business on a day-to-day basis.’

In a telephone call to the TV station
Vernon said: ‘My wife and I, we have not been getting along well, and I
did not want to endow myself to another drawn-out, struggling debt.’

Vernon, a former town council official, has run a barbershop in East Nashville for 50 years.

He moved from the old premises in 2011 and the new salon had a boxing theme.

At the opening of the new barber shop Vernon said the premises would be his legacy to the community.

‘When I'm gone, I'm glad I'll be able to say I left the neighborhood looking nice,’ Winfrey said.

He said his daughter had urged him to give up cutting hair, but he planned to continue.

‘Some folks say, “Winfrey, you're kind of old to be doing it.” I say, “You're right, but I feel good,”’ he said.

Vernon said his famous daughter wanted him to retire.
