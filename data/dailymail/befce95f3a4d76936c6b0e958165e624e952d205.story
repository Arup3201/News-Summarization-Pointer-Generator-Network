This lion has shown the world exactly who's king of the pride after he delighted visitors to his safari park with several almighty roars which echoed across the grounds - before he got bored and retired for a nap.

In scenes strikingly similar to animated children's film 'Madagascar', the African lion prowled out onto a rocky plateau and made a series of impressive deep growling noises before launching into a roar. 

Visitors to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were clearly delighted and in footage filmed during the spectacle much oohing and aahing can be heard as they watch the alpha male make the spine-tingling sounds.

At one point it sounded almost as if the big cat was barking at the crowd with a rhythmic and guttural growl which reverberated around the enclosure. 

Clearly satisfied with a job well done, the lion then appears to tire of his efforts and turns his back on the crowd, presumably to go back to sleep. 

It is unclear if the lion was warning someone off or simply stretching his vocal chords.

The video, which was uploaded yesterday on YouTube,  has already garnered more than 88,500 views.  

The incident resembles a scene from hit movie Madagascar in which Alex, a sheltered and spoiled zoo lion, roars for his doting fans as part of a nightly show.

It is not clear which of San Diego's three male African lions gave the impressive performance. 

The video sparked a number of comments on social media.

Jack T wrote on YouTube: 'Hello everyone, cat expert and lion translator here. His accent sounds a bit thick but this is the gist of it, "To all delicious humans seeing me this day. I, Leonid (unintelligible) want to let you all know it's perfectly safe to come over the fence. I have a nice place here and love visitors."'

But others were more concerned by the unusual sounds the lion made. 

Anonymous wrote: 'This is sad. The King of the jungle trapped in a small enclosure. He's probably crying for help.'

On Reddit, sarcastifrey wrote: 'I have only experienced a lions roar once and it was so amazing and terrifying all at the same time. You could feel the sound vibrating in your chest.'

The incident was similar to Alex the Lion's nightly show of roaring in children's film 'Madagascar' (pictured)

EV0LUTIONX, who witnessed the event, said: 'I'm pretty sure the reason the little kids around quieted down was because of the reverberations. I had no idea an animal could make that kind of sound.'

Hairless_Talking_Ape added: 'When you hear a lion roar in real life, you can feel it go through your body. I was at the zoo and my buddy thought it was some loudspeaker before we saw the lion actually roaring. He thought there was no way that an animal could make that sound. I don't blame him though, it really is monstrous in person.'

The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has continuously had lions on show since it opened in 1972.

In 2004 the Safari Park’s Lion Camp opened with the arrival of six six-month-old lion cubs from a facility in Africa. 

Lion Camp is currently home to three of those original six cubs: male Izu and his two female companions, Oshana and Mina. 

Many of their 18 surviving cubs from over the years are now residing in other zoos, but six are still at the park, including a litter of four born in July 2014.

Lions vary in colour but typically sport light yellow-brown coats. 

Mature male lions are unique among big cats due the thick brown or black manes that encircle their necks and protect them while fighting.

In the wild lions consume a wide variety of prey, from wildebeest, impala,zebra, giraffe, buffalo and wild hogs to sometimes even rhinos and hippos. 

They will also feed on smaller animals such as hares, birds and reptiles. Lions are also known to attack elephants when food is scarce.

The lion population in Africa has been reduced by half since the early 1950s. Today, less than 21,000 remain in all of Africa.

The only social member of the cat family, lions live in large groups called prides, consisting of about 15 lions.

Related females and their young make up the majority of the pride. 

A single male, or sometimes a small group of two or three males, will join a pride for an indefinite period, usually about three years or until another group of males takes over.

Males defend the pride's territory, which may include some 100 square miles of grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands. 

Female lions are the pride's primary hunters and often work together to catch their prey.
