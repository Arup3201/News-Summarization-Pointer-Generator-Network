They are images which show a woman in the darkest moments of despair.

Rachel Dougall, 38, was used to the high life in Bali, living in a £1,000-a-week palatial villa.

But following her arrest on suspicion of drug trafficking, along with three other Britons, including her partner, it appears she has fallen into a deep depression.

Despair: Prison officials struggle to take Rachel Dougall, the British woman held over a £1.6 million cocaine haul, to Bali Police Hospital

Depressed: It is believed that Rachel Dougall has been refusing to eat and is constantly calling out for her six-year-old daughter Kitty

Unhappy: Ms Dougall, who could receive the death penalty for the alleged smuggling operation, has complained of being treated badly while held in police custody

After refusing to eat for the past 
five days during questioning at a Bali police station, police officers 
today became extremely concerned for her health.

She has been crying out constantly for her six-year-old daughter 
Kitty and left officials with no choice but to send her to hospital for treatment.

These pictures show her struggling with police officers and prison officials as they try to get her to the local hospital this morning.

She was arrested by police in Bali over a £1.6 million cocaine haul along with fellow Britons Julian Ponder 
and Paul Beales at the end of May. An Indian man was also arrested.

Troubled: According to her lawyer, Ms Dougall has fallen into depression since her arrest

Difficult time: Her lawyer Mr Suroso said: 'Rachel is always crying and shouting out that she misses her daughter and her mother'

Force: Prison officials are seen struggling to get Ms Dougall into a van so that she can go to hospital for treatment

The four suspects were held in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase as she arrived on the sunshine island.

It is believed she decided to help the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice.

They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang.

Ms Dougall, who could receive the death penalty for the alleged smuggling operation, told the BBC she had been given a sedative on arrival at hospital.

Problems: Ms Dougall is now believed to be seeing a psychiatrist in hospital

Starved: Reports have said she did not eat anything for more than five days

Treatment: Ms Dougall was transferred from a Bali police prison to Bhayangkara Hospital at 11 a.m local time today

She said she was being treated badly and complained that she had not been able to shower.

Her lawyer, Mr Suroso, said: 'Rachel is always crying and shouting out that she misses her daughter and her mother,' he said.

She was transferred from a Bali police prison to Bhayangkara Hospital at 11 a.m local time today.

Ill: Rachel Dougall, who is being held over a £1.6 million cocaine haul in Indonesia, has been taken to hospital claiming that she is being poorly treated in police custody

Hospital head Is Arifin said 
she was under the care of psychiatrist Oka Sumadi.

He said: 'She is currently being observed. The doctor has been to see her and we 
will do our best to treat her.'

Police officers who transferred Ms Dougall to the hospital on the 
Indonesian island told waiting journalists that she was a junkie 
suffering from withdrawal symptoms.

A hospital spokesman refused to give any more details about her condition citing the medical code of ethics.

Ms Dougall's lawyer, Mr Suroso, said his client was being treated in a special room in the hospital.

'Police were forced to transfer her to the hospital because she 
suffering from depression,' he said. 'She even didn't eat anything for 
over five days because she doesn't want eat any meal that is provided by a 
police officer.'

He added Ms Dougall was suffering from deep despair and depression because 
she missed her little daughter, who is being cared for by a housemaid in
their rented villa.

'After some of her friends in Bali came to visit she looks better but 
she still needs treatment from the doctor,' Mr Suroso said.

The Bali Police spokesperson, Sr Comr. Hariadi, confirmed officers had 
been forced to stop questioning Ms Dougall temporarily due to her bad health.

'We don't interrogate sick people,' he said. 'It will be against their 
human rights. We will be waiting until she is healthy again and then we 
will continue the questions.'

The mother has maintained her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up'.

It is believed she is in a relationship with Mr Ponder and the couple have a little girl Kitty, who is reportedly in the care of the couple's maid and gardener on the island.

Concerns: Ms Dougall, left, is believed to have not slept or eaten for days. She is pictured with fellow suspect Julian Ponder, right

Mr Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Ms Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter.

The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Ms Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons.

A spokesman said it did not have any information regarding the reports that Ms Dougall had been taken to hospital.

Customs officials have said that Mrs 
Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, may be spared the death 
sentence because she helped catch three other members of the smuggling 
operation, who could face a firing squad.

Police have 60 days before they have to hand over their files to prosecutors, it is believed Mrs Sandiford is thought to have told police she only agreed to make the smuggling trip because her children in England were being threatened.

Suspect: Paul Beales, right, has also been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking

She was paraded at a press conference

Kuta, a town on the holiday island, while a customs official cut open 
packages wrapped in brown tape to reveal a white powder.

Mrs Sandiford, 55, was driven to Nusantara Hotel in the capital Denpasar by detectives after being allegedly caught with cocaine worth £1.6million.

Under the gaze of undercover officers posing as tourists, she spent 12 hours wandering around the hotel’s gardens pondering her options.

After a short spell in her £25-a-night deluxe room the former legal secretary from Redcar, Cleveland, ordered chilli fried rice – nasi goring – from the restaurant. When she finished she stood up and told police she would give them her full co-operation.

In the days that followed she was watched as she met the alleged buyers at hotels and villas across Bali. The officers stormed in moments after Mrs Sandiford allegedly passed the drugs, disguised as a present in pink wrapping paper, to fellow Briton Julian Ponder, 43.

Officers then arrested Mr Ponder’s partner Rachel Dougall, 38, at their luxurious villa where they also allegedly found other hidden drugs.

A fourth Briton, Paul Beales, and Indian national Akkinemi Mandagopal, who has two young children with his British wife, were also arrested.

About
68g of cocaine, 280g of powdered ecstasy and a small amount of hashish 
were also seized following the arrest of the other gang members at 
separate locations in Bali, officials said.
