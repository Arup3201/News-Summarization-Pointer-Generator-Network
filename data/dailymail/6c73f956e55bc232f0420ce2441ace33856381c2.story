France's Socialist foreign minister was today forced to deny that he has a secret Swiss bank account aimed at hiding his money from the taxman.

Laurent Fabius, a former Prime Minister, was reacting to a report in the left-wing Liberation newspaper that he might be shielding part of his fortune.

It follows budget minister Jerome Cahuzac's resignation over a secret Swiss account in which he hid more than half-a-million pounds.

More damage: President Francois Hollande's Socialist administration has suffered a fresh blow as his minister of foreign affairs Laurent Fabius was forced to deny he has a secret Swiss bank account to hide his wealth

This is despite being tasked by President Francois Hollande with clamping down on tax evasion.

Now, if the Fabius allegations prove true, it could mean the end for Mr Hollande's entire Socialist project, with opponents calling for Parliament to be dissolved and new elections arranged.

Mr Fabius said: 'I categorically deny the rumour, relayed by Liberation in its edition of Monday April 8th, attributing a Swiss account. It is not based on any material evidence, and is completely unfounded.'

The minister, a high-profile politician who once dated former conservative first lady Carla Bruni, added that he had instructed his solicitor to prevent the 'false and slanderous' information from being spread.

On Sunday, it was reported Cahuzac tried to deposit €15million (£12.5million) into a Geneva bank four years ago - a claim he denies.

He still faces a trial and prison for the using the Swiss account to hide the half-a-million plus pounds.

Jean-Jacques Augier, the treasurer of Mr Hollande's election campaign in 2012, has also admitted to having shares in two companies registered in the Cayman Islands - a notorious tax haven.

Numerous entrepreneurs and celebrities have left France since Mr Hollande came to power last year promising 'exemplary' government and a punitive tax regime.

In turn, the Socialists have accused those leaving the country of being unpatriotic and greedy.

However now that senior Socialists are being exposed as tax avoiders, Mr Hollande's administration is looking increasingly fragile.

Millionaires who have left France since Mr Hollande came to power include Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu who has obtained Russian nationality and put his home in the French capital on the market.

Bernard Arnault, the LMVH boss who is France's richest man, has also applied for a Belgium passport.
