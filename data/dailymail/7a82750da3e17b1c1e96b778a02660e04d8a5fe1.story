A female New York City police officer claims she was repeatedly groped and grinded against by a hulking sergeant who nicknamed her his 'work p****.'

Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused 300-pound Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

She claims in a discrimination suit filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the state Human Rights Division that the 41-year-old showed her photos of his penis and crudely told her he wanted to have sex with her as well as rubbing himself against her while grunting.

The Brooklyn district attorney's office and the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau are also investigating the claims, which Cardenas' lawyer describes as the worst sexual harassment case she's seen.

'There was a frathouse culture in the precinct that was beyond the pale,' Linda Cronin told the New York Daily News.

The six-year force veteran describes an occasion in the summer of 2013 when she was sitting on a couch in the precinct and Sgt. John 'grabbed me, threw me down and held me down while trying to kiss me.'

The January EEOC complaint continues, 'He then climbed on top of me and would not let me up.'

The harassment allegedly went on for more than a year. 'He also showed me pictures of his penis and asked, "Is this big? It's bigger than your boyfriend's."'

In the complaint she alleged the harassment regularly took place in front of other officers. 

'Sgt. John often pulls his pants down in front of me,' she claims. 'He often sleeps in the office with his belt undone, and then will pull his pants down, grab his groin and say, "Ann, hold this for me."'

John's representatives have denied Cardenas' claims, suggesting there are many holes in her story.

Andrew Quinn, a lawyer for the Sergeants Benevolent Association, told the Daily News: 'Sgt. John is aware of the allegations and is in possession of compelling evidence confirming that Officer Cardenas is not being entirely truthful.'

The 20-year NYPD veteran has filed for retirement but his departure is on hold during the investigation. He was placed on modified assignment last month.
