Hailed a hero: Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani, agreed to guide Saif Gaddafi to safety over the Niger border, but instead directed him to an ambush in the desert

Colonel Gaddafi’s captured son Saif predicted Libya would slide back into conflict within weeks.

The 39-year-old former playboy spoke out as the country unveiled its new government last night.

The key job of defence minister went to an obscure army commander from Zintan – the remote mountain town where Saif was captured on Saturday.

Leaders in the area had refused to hand over their trophy prisoner for trial unless they received a top post in the new cabinet.

None of the cabinet positions announced last night went to prominent Islamists, which will come as a relief to David Cameron and his Western allies who helped oust Colonel Gaddafi.

But the defence appointment of Osama Jueili from Zintan, a town with 16,000 inhabitants, was a major surprise.

His appointment means Islamist Abdul Hakim Belhaj, the former Guantanamo Bay inmate who plans to sue MI6 over torture claims, has been cut out of the secularist government.

Mr Jueili denied he won the job as a reward for catching Saif. He said: ‘It is an insult to suggest a deal was done.’

Saif remains at a secret location in custody in a private house in the town. In a ranting video message, he said that ‘in a couple of months or maximum one year’ regions that banded together to oust his family would turn on one another.

He is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but the ICC conceded he would be tried in Libya. It means he will almost certainly face the death penalty if convicted.

Tribesman Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani yesterday claimed he forsook a million euros to betray Saif. He says he was offered the cash to guide a ‘VIP’ across the remote border into Niger.

Guessing who his secret client was, and fearing he would be shot rather than paid, he led Saif straight to the Zintan Brigade.

Secret location: Saif Gaddafi, seated, shown in a released video with his Libyan captors. The son of former leader Muammar Gaddafi has been reportedly arguing with fighters loyal to the National Transitional Council

Injuries: The footage shows the bandages still on the thumb and two fingers of Saif's right hand - injuries that Saif claims were sustained during an allied attack

In pain: The footage shows Saif grimacing while sitting in his chair. It is unclear whether he is reactive from his injuries or his general predicament

Mr Hotmani said he had been offered 
the money - the equivalent of more than 1.6million Lybian dinar - so 
Saif and four companions could escape capture and possible execution at 
the hands of troops loyal to the National Transitional Council.

But
 he said: 'I was offered millions but all the money they had would not 
buy a pebble of our sand or one drop of our martyrs' blood.'

It might have also been because Mr Hotmani had feared he would be killed after holding up his end of the bargain.

Mr Hotmani was speaking to reporters in 
Zintan, where Saif is being held at a secret location before 
the details of his prosecution are finalised.

The
 news conference came on the same day video footage was released showing
 Saif surrounded by Libyan revolutionary fighters shortly after his 
capture on Saturday.

The
 video, allegedly taken at the Zintan safe house, shows Saif arguing 
with his captors and admonishing them, saying the regions now united in 
revolution would soon turn against each other rip the country apart.

Mr Hotmani said he was hired as a guide to help Saif escape Libya but had instead contacted
 revolutionary fighters in the country's south - informing them that a 
two-car convoy carrying the wanted man would be passing near them on the
 night of November 18.

He said: 'I made Saif believe that I trusted him.'

'They were ready to execute me': Mr Hotmani, speaking at a news conference in Zintan, Libya, revealed he was offered one million euros to spirit Saif to safety

On the night of Saif's, Mr Hotmani said he was travelling with guards in the first car of their convoy.

Ten
 fighters from Zintan, in the Western mountains, and five from Hotmani's
 own tribe, al-Hotman, were waiting at a pre-arranged section of the 
desert.

The National Transitional Council 
(NTC) has appointed the local commander whose troops captured Saif Gaddafi as 
the nation's new defence minister.

Osama Al-Juwali, head of the military
 council in Zintan, was given the defence job as part of a cabinet 
line-up which has the tricky task of balancing rival regional factions 
and ideological camps who are jockeying for influence.

The new government line-up - which 
will run the country until elections are held - was agreed at an NTC 
meeting yesterday, a council source claims.

But, in an indication of the tensions
 around the cabinet composition, the source later said some NTC members 
were not happy with the final decision.

The anonymous source said: 'There are some people who do not accept some of the names.'

 In other appointments, Libya's 
deputy envoy to the United Nations was named as foreign minister, an oil
 company executive was made oil minister, and the finance minister in 
the outgoing government was re-appointed, the source said.

Mr Juwali is a former officer in the 
Libyan military whose forces from Zintan also played a crucial role in 
the offensive on Tripoli that ended Gaddafi's rule in August. He had not
 previously been seen as a contender for the defence job.

Mr Hotmani said: 'I had agreed with 
the fighters that the best place for the ambush would be in a part of 
desert that was surrounded by high ground.

'When we arrived at the dark, deep 
hollow the gunfire was very precise, it only took about half a minute to
 capture the first car.'

He intentionally told Saif's convoy to have the vehicles spaced two miles apart to give the captors time to regroup.

He said: 'When the second car arrived, we started to shoot very precisely, to damage the vehicle so he could not escape.'

Saif, dressed in a long robe and a brown head scarf wrapped around his face, jumped out of the car and tried to run into the desert, but his fate was sealed.

It is unclear whether Mr Hotmani had planned to ensnare Saif from the beginning, or whether he defected when he had doubts about his payment and feared that he might be killed.Mr Hotmani did admit: 'I'm sure were planning to execute me when we reached the border. They had two handguns, two grenades, a knife and handcuffs. They were ready to execute me if they had any doubt.

'I didn't ask for an advance payment or 
anything. There was no money in the car. This proves that he 
wanted to execute me at the border.'

NTC fighters found about £3,000 in the two-car convoy. Nevertheless fighters allied to the NTC who caught Saif refer to Mr Hotmani as a 'hero'.Mr Hotmani said he believed Saif hired him as a guide because he thought he was well disguised - and that perhaps because he was delusional.

Mr Hotmani said: 'Saif didn't think I knew it was him. Nobody told me it was him. Saif was dreaming of leaving Libya and then to eventually return.'

The commander of the fighters that conducted the ambush, Al-Ajami Ali al-Ateri, said that on the plane after his capture, Saif had asked if it was Mr Hotmani who tipped them off.

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said today that Libya could put Saif Gaddafi on trial at home, but that The Hague court's judges must be involved in the case.Luis Moreno-Ocampo was in Tripoli for talks with Libya's new leaders about their plans for Saif, who is charged with crimes against humanity by the ICC.

Libya's new leaders want to see justice done in their own country, even though they have yet to set up a court system.

Mr Moren-Ocampo said: 'Saif is captured so we are here to ensure cooperation. If they [Libyans] prosecute the case, we will discuss with them how to inform the judges, and they can do it... but our judges have to be involved.'
