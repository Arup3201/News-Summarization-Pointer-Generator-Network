The arrival of hundreds of fire-wielding Vikings would usually cause some serious and legitimate concern.

But this particular procession of armoured warriors in the Shetland Islands marked an annual tradition dating back to the 1800's - the Up Helly Aa festival.

Dozens of 'squads' descended on the small town of Lerwick in a proud nod to the archipelago's Norse heritage.

They dragged a specially made Viking Galley through the town's streets and eventually set it ablaze, before indulging in night of partying.

Up Helly Aa: Hundreds of men dressed up as Vikings to celebrate in a nod to the Shetland Islands' Norse heritage

Procession: Hundreds of men - known as guizers for the day - paraded through the streets with fiery torches

Tradition: At the end of the route, all the marching guizers surround a specially-made Viking galley which they have dragged through Lerwick

One of a kind: A host of volunteers toil from October to construct the galley as well as the thousands of torches being carried

Fiery end: After the singing of the Up Helly Aa song, the guizers throw their torches into the galley

Spectacle: Once the galley has burned and the flames die down, guizers sing the traditional song 'The Norseman's Home' before indulging in a night of partying

Stunning: Fireworks erupt over Lerwick as the Viking galley below is set ablaze by hundreds of men dressed as vikings

Hundreds of play-actors known as 'guizers' follow the main man known as a Jarl, who on this occasion was Neil Robertson.

After nightfall, all other squads would follow his with torches in hand, dragging with them a massive Viking ship.

When all the torch-bearers arrive at the route's end, they form a circle around the galley and singe the traditional Up Helly Aa song.

Once the song is complete, all the guizers throw their torches into the galley in a beautiful, fiery nod to their Norse heritage.

The sing another traditional song known as 'the Norseman's Home' before descending on the town for a night of drinking - and more singing.

A host of volunteers are responsible for the building both the galley and producing over 1,000 torches.

Leader: The guizers led by a single man known as a 'Jarl', which on this occasion was Neil Robertson (pictured, top)

Glory: The Jarl's squad (pictured) will lead the procession as they drag the galley on which they stand to its fiery end

Heritage: Up Helly Aa is a chance for multiple generations on the Shetland Isles to celebrate their Norse heritage

Work begins as early as October to ensure that everything is ready in time for the celebrations which often continue until 8am the following day. 

It may seem dangerous but the celebration as it happens evolved from the genuinely hazardous tradition of 'tar barrelling'.

It is thought squads of young men would drag barrels of burning tar through the town on sledges, before it was abolished between 1874 and 1880.

Permission was eventually granted to carry torches with the first procession taking place in 1876 and the first Up Helly Aa parade in 1881.
