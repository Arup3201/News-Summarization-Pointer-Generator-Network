Hollywood actress Sean Young spent four hours in a police station after allegedly fighting with a security guard at an Oscars party last night.

The 52-year-old star, who hasn't been in a major film since 2008, is said to have argued with a guard at the Governor's Ball in Los Angeles.

She was placed under citizens' arrest by another member of the security team then taken away by police and booked for battery.

And the divorced mother-of-two still 
appeared to be recovering from the partying as she gave a rambling 
interview after her release from custody.

Young, who shot to fame in Blade Runner playing opposite Harrison Ford, has seen her career fade of late - to such an extent that she recently agreed to appear in the reality show Skating With The Stars.

But sadly her comeback did not last long as she was eliminated in the second show of the ABC series in November after falling onto the ice twice.

Young was seen leaving a police station in Los Angeles at 1:45am on Monday and said the incident began as she was waiting to enter the party.

'I'm OK,' she told TMZ on being released from the police station. 'The Academy's lawyer recommended that a private person's arrest be made.

'I was standing outside the cord, waiting and seeing friends that were going up to the Governor's Ball,' she told TMZ.

Young said she was 'carted off to spend four hours at the Hollywood police', adding 'shame on you (the Academy) for that.'

Los
Angeles Police Sergeant Enrique Mendoza confirmed the arrest but 
wouldn't give details about the incident or the alleged victim.

The Governor's Ball is the official 
Oscar party and is held above the film award show's venue, the Hollywood
& Highland Theatre.

She posted bail of $20,000 early on Monday morning. An Academy of Motion Arts and Sciences spokesman did not immediately comment.

The incident is not her first issue at
an Oscars after party. She tried to get into a Vanity Fair party by 
sneaking in behind Jennifer Aniston in 2006.

But she was escorted out by four guards when spotted by security.

Young said of the incident in a recent
interview: 'It was degrading. But when you have nothing to lose, it's 
really not that big of a deal.â€™

She shot to fame in 1982 in the sci-fi 
thriller Blade Runner. She then starred in hit films including No Way 
Out and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.

Young, of Louisville, Kentucky, also had
roles in TV shows including One Tree Hill and more recently daytime 
show The Young and the Restless.

She married Robert Lujan in 1990 before divorcing him 12 years later in 2002 - but they had two boys together, named Quinn and Rio.

One famous incident was in 1992 when she arrived at the Batman Returns set in a homemade Catwoman suit after she lost out on playing the part.

Young voluntarily went into rehab for 
treatment of an alcohol problem in January 2008, after she had struggled
against addiction for many years.
