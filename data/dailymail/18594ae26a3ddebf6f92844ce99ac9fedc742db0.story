'I'll be different from a traditional SportsCenter reporter because I won't be behind a desk in a suit,' said Reeve, who bears more than a passing resemble to his famous father, told TheWrap.

'These stories are not going to appear on air and then fade off — they are going to get an extended life digitally and on social media.' 

Will was just a toddler when his actor father Christopher became paralyzed in a riding accident in 1995. He grew up helping his mother, Dana, care for him. 

Christopher became a dedicated campaigner after he was paralyzed in a horse riding incident in 1995.

With his wife Dana by his side, the star raised millions of dollars, investing heavily in stem cell research.

Sadly, almost 10 years after his accident, Christopher found himself constantly battling infections, and after a reaction to an antibiotic, suffered a heart attack before slipping into a coma.

He later suffered another cardiac arrest, passing away on October 10, 2004, when Will was just 11 years old.

A few months of his father's death, Will lost his maternal grandmother, Helen Morisini, who died of complications following cancer surgery at the age of 71.

And 17 months after losing his father Will's mother, Dana, who had won worldwide admiration for her devotion to her husband through his decade of near-total paralysis, died of lung cancer at the age of 44.

The singer-actress, who cut short her career to care for her husband, was a non-smoker.

Will, who was 13 when Dana died, was raised by family friends after his mother's death. He said he is confident both of his parents would be extremely proud about his new job.

'Hopefully they would get a kick out it,' he said. 'The things I am interested in and passionate about are similar to what they were. My parents definitely define who I am.

'My dad and I had a huge bond and shared a love of sports. I hope they would be proud and say, "Great job," no matter what. Then my dad would probably tell me to straighten my tie!' he laughed.

As a youngster Reeve had dreams of becoming a professional athlete or an actor like his father until internships at ABC and 'Good Morning America'.

Since graduating from Vermont's Middlebury College he has been working at ESPN on various writing and reporting gigs.

'ESPN was like a member of the family because it was always on,' he said. 'It is not only a dream job, it is my dream job … I just hope I don't screw it up! I don't want my dream to be taken away from me.' 

Together with his older half siblings - Matthew and Alexandra - he also keeps his father's charity work going via the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

Matthew and Alexandra are Christopher's children from his long-term relationship with Gae Exton and were 25 and 21 respectively when their father died.
