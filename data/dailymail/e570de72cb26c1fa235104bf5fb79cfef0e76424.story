This is the moment a 92-year-old driver smashes into nine cars as he leaves a grocery store after getting his foot caught on the accelerator.

CCTV footage shows Russell Kerr slowly reversing out of a parking spot before suddenly zipping forwards and backwards to strike multiple vehicles at the same time.

Moments later, another security camera at the Piggly Wiggly shopping center in Mayville, Wisconsin, shows him plowing  into a pick-up truck and speeding off with debris flying everywhere.

The driver of the SUV gets out and begins to chase  Kerr in a bid to prevent further damage. Another  man joins him.

Bad driving conditions were not to blame as there is no snow or ice seen on the ground. Kerr was eventually stopped and reported to authorities.

The senior citizen explained that he got his foot caught on the gas pedal of his 2007 Chrysler Pacifica and lost control of the wheel amid a state of panic.

His vehicle and the pick-up he struck were towed from the scene while other drivers were left to file insurance claims. Nobody was injured in last Friday's  incident.

Mayville police chief Christopher MacNeill said in 23 years of law enforcement, he'd never seen anything like it.

He said it was fortunate there were no pedestrians walking out with their groceries at the time. 

The event was deemed an accident and Kerr was not charged.

However, his license will be reviewed by the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine if he needs to be retested.
