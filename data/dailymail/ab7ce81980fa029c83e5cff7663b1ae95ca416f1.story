Had initially declined offer from Brazilian President for medical assistance

Spoke after a pre-Easter mass to beg God to spare his life

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called on God to spare his life, in an emotional speech to the Catholic community.

Chavez cried and his voice broke in the televised speech made in his home of Barinas, in front of his parents and other relatives.

The 57-year-old praised Jesus, revolutionary fighter Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and South American independence hero Simon Bolivar.

Chavez is believed to be flying to Brazil for treatment after his alleged  mishandling in Cuba

'Never forget that we are the children of giants ... I could not avoid some tears," he said.

'Give me your crown, Jesus. Give me 
your cross, your thorns so that I may bleed. But give me life, because I
 have more to do for this country and these people. Do not take me yet.'

Chavez made his plea standing below an image of Jesus with the Crucifix after a pre-Easter mass. He
 was anchored by his mother and father who both held his hand as a 
priest led a prayer for his health.

The public display of emotion came as Chavez scheduled an emergency trip to Brazil after allegedly suffering  intestinal burns during his cancer radiation treatment in Cuba.

Doctors have been treating the former soldier since he was diagnosed in June last year.

He
 had hoped to extend his reign with an additional six-year term in the 
country's national elections on October 7, but the latest setback could 
now jeopardise his chances for reelection.

However he dismissed those suggestions, insisting: 'So far, fortunately there hasn't been any adverse reaction to the treatment.

'All the exams that have been carried out have shown positive results of physical recovery,' he told The Associated Press.

Brazilian media have countered his claim, revealing that the cancer-stricken president is heading for the Sirio e Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo.

After
 initially rejecting Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff offer for 
medical assistance is July, in favour of treatment in Cuba, the reported
 mishandling has led Chavez deliberating his future care.

Reports suggest that Cuban medics administered the radiation improperly causing his burns.
