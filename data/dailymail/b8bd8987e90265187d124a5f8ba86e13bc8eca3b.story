The National Zoo's panda cub Bao Bao returned to her mom in time for Christmas Day after spending nearly 36 hours in a tree, where she went after being startled by a tool zookeepers use to contain animals.

Bao Bao climbed the tree on Tuesday afternoon after touching an electrified 'hot wire' used for animal containment and she didn't come down again until late on Wednesday.

Members of the public, who can watch live video of the pandas online, posted worried inquiries on the zoo's Facebook page when they saw that Bao Bao was in a tree overnight and still there on Wednesday. But the zoo said Bao Bao was 'perfectly fine.'

Bao Bao turned 1 in August. She's only the second panda born at the zoo to survive to her first birthday. 

Zoo keepers said that her behavior was 'predictable' and despite the scare, she is 'perfectly fine.' 

'She is still learning the boundaries of her habitat,' they added. 

Fortunately she came down from her retreat for Christmas to join her mother, Mei Xiang.

The National Zoo is one of only four zoos nationwide to have pandas, which are on loan from China. 

The zoo's first pair of pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, were a gift from China following President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to the country. 

The pair had five cubs while living at the zoo but none survived.

The zoo's current adult pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, arrived in 2000.

They welcomed a male cub named Tai Shan in 2005 but he was returned to China five years later for breeding.

Their second infant Bao Bao - whose name means 'precious' or 'treasure' - was born August 23, 2013.

Panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers.

In the past year she has grown from a wriggling pink newborn, a little bigger than a stick of butter, to a 44lb black-and-white bundle.

Her favorite activities include sleeping, exploring and munching on treats such as sweet potato and bamboo.
