It's the moment every cook dreads: realising they have forgotten the most crucial ingredient.

Now there is an solution for the world's forgetful chefs - delivering the missing flavour in a fork instead.

Inventors in Canada have unveiled the bizarre gadget, which emits smells to make people think they are tasting flavours like ginger, coffee or banana as they eat their meal.

Unorthodox: The fork, shown from behind and from the side, has a capsule filled with 'liquid aroma'

Whiff: The fork emits smells which waft over the food and reportedly add to the flavour

Collection: The unusual gadget is expected to be released later this year - but a full set will cost £36

The metal Aromafork comes with 21 different flavours, including chocolate, vanilla, lychee, passionfruit, strawberry, basil, cilantro, mint and almond.

Inventive eaters can also plump for coconut, peanut, cinnamon, ginger, jalapeno, wasabi, butter, olive oil, smoke or truffle.

It works by having a capsule of 'liquid aroma' underneath the fork's handle, which is then soaked through a small circle of blotting paper and released gradually as the owner eats their meal.

The user has to apply the 'taste' each time using a dropper and put a piece of blotting paper in place.

Jonathan Coutu, president of the Canadian inventors' firm MOLECULE-R Flavors, said: 'The initial idea was to reinvent the
 traditional fork into an improved utensil that would trick people’s 
mind by liberating an intense flow of aromas.

Contraption: Users put 'liquid aroma' in the back of the fork using a dropper and it soaks up on blotting paper

He claimed it could become 'the perfect educational tool to learn 
how to better appreciate food.'

Forgetting to buy ginger will set you back, however - a pack of four forks, a full set of 'tastes' and 50 diffusing papers costs £36.

Taste buds on the tongue recognise five primary tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami.

For differences between, for example, sugar and honey or light soy sauce and dark, the nose must do the rest of the job of picking out the subtleties of each piece of food.
