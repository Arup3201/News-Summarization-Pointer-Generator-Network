A blundering minister said a woman from Bolton who is looking for work should apply for a job in 'nearby' Sunderland - which is in fact 143 miles away.

Economic secretary Chloe Smith said the part-time carer should look for a full-time job at the expanding Nissan factory in the north-east.

If the worker was to commute to Sunderland, the journey would take two-and-a-half hours to drive - or four hours on the train.

Blunder: Chloe Smith told David Crausby that his constituent should work in 'nearby' Sunderland

Ms Smith, 29, made the mistake while responding to a parliamentary question from Bolton North East Labour MP David Crausby.

He wanted to know what his constituent could do as her working hours were being cut.

Ms Smith said the woman, who is employed by the Stroke Association in 
Bolton, should take a 'clear look around at the opportunities 
available', saying job vacancies were on the rise.

She during Treasury Questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday: 'There are jobs out there. 
Members need only to hear this morning’s announcement from Nissan - 
somewhere near the honourable gentleman’s constituency - to know that 
there is work available.'

A spokesman for the Treasury claimed Ms 
Smith thought she was responding to an MP from the north-east near the 
Nissan plant rather than a Bolton MP.

Long distance: Bolton is 144 miles from Sunderland - and it would take an estimated two-and-a-half hours to drive

A change in the rules for people 
claiming working tax credit means that, from April, couples must work a 
combined minimum of 24 hours a week.

Chloe Smith's rapid rise to become the youngest minister in government took some colleagues by surprise.

But extraordinary claims circulated at Westminster that Chloe Smith was appointed because David Cameron was confused about her credentials.

Miss Smith, who became the youngest MP in Parliament when she won the Norwich North by-election in 2009, was promoted to become Economic Secretary last year.

At the age of 29 years, four months and 27 days, she became the youngest minister in government, making an ascent to the political frontline unparalleled in modern times.

However, according to an account of the phone call giving her the good news, the Prime Minister was under the misapprehension that she had been a chartered accountant and would therefore be well suited to the post.

In fact, she is a former management consultant at Deloitte.

After Mr Cameron told Miss Smith he would like to offer her the post, she is said to have replied: ‘Well, thank you Prime Minister. . .It would be an honour, but the Treasury…it’s a little daunting…’

The Prime Minister allegedly responded: ‘Not daunting surely for someone who was a chartered accountant?’

The Norwich North MP is then said to have admitted: ‘Er, well, actually Prime Minister, I wasn’t an accountant. I was a management consultant in an accountancy firm.’

Mr Cameron apparently then said ‘never mind’ and welcomed Miss Smith aboard.

The previous minimum was 16 hours, meaning the Stroke Association worker now falls below the threshold.

The association was forced to slash 
the hours of two of its support workers after losing out on 
£17,000-worth of funding from Bolton Council.

Mr Crausby accused Ms Smith, the Norwich North MP, of 'knowing nothing about the north'.

He said: 'She clearly didn’t know what she was talking about on the whole issue. It was a ridiculous answer. It wasn’t facetious, more naive.

'To be frank, it was typical of a southern MP who knows nothing about the North. They have little experience of our part of the world.'

Julie Elliott, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: 'It’s not a slip of the tongue to know how far away Bolton is from Sunderland.

'Bolton is quite a famous town in the north west of England and I think someone in her position should know that.'

'The Tories are completely out of touch with the North of England.'

Nissan announced earlier this week it would produce its small car, the Invitation, in Sunderland from 2013 at a rate of 100,000 a year.

The workforce in Sunderland is expected to rise by 600 to 6,000 people, although it may create as many as 2,000 extra jobs in the supply chain.

Nissan has been helped with a £9.3million offer of funding from the Government’s £2.4 billion Regional Growth Fund.

Mr Crausby added: 'We should be trying to encourage people to go into work, not on to benefits.

'To increase the number of hours people need to work to gain working tax credit will put a lot of people in difficult circumstances.'

A spokesman for the Stoke Association said the council was reconsidering its decision to cut funding and that the hours of the two workers may be restored.

A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'The Economic Secretary inadvertently and briefly mistook a Labour MP’s constituency.

'The point she was making is that Nissan’s announcement is excellent news for the north east and a positive sign for the whole UK economy.'
