Knifeman: Sammie Lamont Wallace was shot dead after taking a two-year-old girl hostage in Walmart

A desperate knife-wielding man was shot and killed by police after he grabbed a stranger's two-year-old daughter from a Walmart shopping cart in Midwest City, Oklahoma.

For a tense half hour police tried to reason with the man, but as he started a countdown to killing the child while holding a knife to her, police shot him.

Sammie Lamont Wallace, who was demanding to be able to see his own children, was still clutching the child when police took him out at the Oklahoma store on Monday.

The terrifying ordeal started when Wallace, 37, grabbed the child at random from a shopping cart at about 3pm, when the store was full of shoppers.

As he held a knife to the child, he yelled that he wanted the mother to call his attorney so he could see his children.

Donita Owens, who was shopping one aisle away when the child was grabbed, said: 'I heard a lady start screaming, "please help me, he's got my baby, he's got my baby, please help me".'

'He's basically saying things like, he wants to see his kids, he wants his kids too.  He just wants to go home to see his family, he has nothing to live for, nothing to lose,' she told News9.

The store was evacuated and police began a tense standoff with Wallace, who is not believed to have known the child.

'The mother began asking him, what he was doing, it wasn't making any sense what he was saying, he had a weapon in his hand, a knife up against the child, threatening the child's life,' Assistant Chief of Police Sid Porter, said.

During negotiations police were able to get close to Wallace, who had a long criminal record in Dallas, Texas, but he refused to cooperate with them.Â 

'Eventually he began to basically do a countdown on this child's life and an officer had to use deadly force,' Assistant Police Chief Porter told Koco News.

Anxious wait: Shoppers and staff wait behind police tape for news of the little girl

Wallace was still holding the girl when he was shot once by officers. Neither the girl or her mother, who have not yet been named, were physically harmed.

The police involved with the hostage situation said it was stressful. The name of the officer who shot Wallace has not been released.

'I've been doing this 29 years. I can't remember something like this, a random act in a grocery store with all these people,' Assistant Police Chief Porter said.

The shop was open again for business late on Monday.
