Jailed: Nathan Phipps claimed the attack was 'an accident'

An off-duty policeman was mown down by a motorist he had confronted about sounding his horn at 6am.

Detective Inspector Peter Howarth collapsed in a driveway screaming 'Don't let him kill me' after 22-year-old Nathan Phipps ran him down and then reversed back over him in a revenge attack.

The 53-year-old, a keen marathon runner and triathlete, had to undergo emergency surgery for a double fracture to his leg and had a metal frame attached to his limb to aid his recovery.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Mr Howarth has returned to work following the incident on November 21 last year but was unable to use public transport and faced daily reminders of the 'catastrophic' injuries.

Phipps was convicted by a jury of inflicting grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving. He was jailed for three years and six months.

The court heard how DI Howarth had approached Phipps to ask him to stop sounding his horn and, when he thought he was reaching for a weapon, the police officer punched him.

Phipps then retaliated by mowing him down in his car.

Jailing the trainee electrician for three-and-a-half years, Judge Inigo Bing described the events as 'appalling'.

He said: 'You then drove both dangerously, recklessly and deliberately towards Peter Howarth and the group that were nearby and took the obvious risk that injury would result, and very catastrophic injury did result.

'There are elements of a revenge attack, because you were so angry by what had happened to you.

'You then abandoned a gravely injured man who was screaming in agony from what you had done to him.'

Â 

The judge said the effect on Mr 
Howarth was 'devastating', as he had to cut his athletic career short as
well as enduring extreme pain and a long period of treatment.

The
jury heard Phipps had driven to an address in Wanstead, East London, at
about 6am where his girlfriend was staying after the couple split up.

After driving up and down the street 
repeatedly sounding his horn to get his girlfriend's attention, he was 
challenged by Mr Howarth along with several other neighbours.

Mr
Howard asked Phipps to wind down his side window but fearing the driver
was reaching for a weapon, smashed the glass and pulled him from the 
vehicle.

They spoke briefly, after which Phipps got back into the car as if to drive off.

As the car went back I heard him shout 'Don't let him kill me'

But Phipps aimed the car at the pavement, 'floored' the accelerator and careered straight into his victim.

He then reversed over the stricken detective after he collapsed in a driveway.

Neighbour John Woolnough, who was woken by the car horn said he remembered hearing a 'dull thud and a piercing scream,' after Phipps mowed down Mr Howarth for the first time.

He said Phipps then turned his car around and 'floored it' in reverse towards the driveway where Mr Howarth had collapsed.

Timothy Downes, who watched the incident from a first-floor bedroom in the street, added: 'As the car went back I heard him shout "Don't let him kill me".'

Phipps was arrested two days later. During his trial he claimed Mr Howarth did not identify himself as a police officer and said he was 'in a panic' and 'very afraid' as he tried to drive off following the altercation.

He said he was unaware he had hit anyone, though when he returned home, he noticed his car bumper was hanging off.

Asked he if deliberately drove at Mr Howarth, he replied: 'I would never do that. It was an accident what happened.'

Phipps of East Ham, East London, was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving but cleared of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He was jailed for three years and six months for inflicting grievous bodily harm and 15 months, concurrently, for dangerous driving.

He was also disqualified from driving for five years.
