An alleged drunk driver led police on a wild, high-speed chase Saturday after they received a call that a driver was racing the wrong way down a major Ohio highway.

Streetsboro Police responded to a call and arrived at highway I-480 shortly after 3 a.m. where they spotted Ashley Stewart, 24, driving eastbound in the 
westbound lanes.

Stewart ignored police at they pursued her down I-480 with flashing lights and sirens, at times reaching speeds over 80 mph.

Scroll down for video.

Fright Night: Ashley Stewart, pictured, led police on a high-speed chase the wrong way down a highway in Streetsboro, Ohio. The 24-year-old refused to stop for police. When she was finally stopped, she refused a breathalyzer and was arrested.

After several miles of chasing Stewart over bridges, under turnpikes and through traffic lights, police manage to finally stop her when one officer cut her off, reports Cleveland's Fox 8.

Stewart's mugshot -- tears streaming down her mascara-stained face, with her large blue eyes bloodshot red peering up slightly above the camera -- quickly went viral on the Internet.

But the video might be even better.

Recorded on the Streetsboro Police dash cam, Stewart is seen swerving all over the road, at one point veering off the road and narrowly missing a guardrail.

The chase starts out in what looks to be a rural setting. By two minutes in, however, Stewart is dodging oncoming traffic, zooming under a turnpike and flying through a populated area with more traffic lights.

When police finally force her to stop outside a Burger King, it's only temporary.

She makes a last-ditch escape effort by making a lazy turn, slowly starting to head in the other direction as police get out of their cars and pursue her on foot.

'Get out of the car!' police scream just off camera. 'Get down! Get down! Hands behind your back. Didn't you hear the sirens?! Hands behind your back.'

Stewart can be heard crying.

After police removed her from her vehicle, the car rolled back into a  Summit County deputy's car that had responded to the car, causing minor damaged to the vehicle.

Stewart reportedly 
refused to take a breathalyzer at the scene, and was arrested and 
charged with failure to comply with the signal of a 
police officer, a third degree felony, and operating while intoxicated.
