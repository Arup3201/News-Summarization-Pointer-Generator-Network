The U.S. has condemned North Korea's state media after it described President Barack Obama as a 'wicked black monkey'.

A spokeswoman in Washington DC said the racist rhetoric, made two days after the U.S leader paid a state visit to South Korea, was 'ugly and disrespectful'.

Korea Central News Agency, the mouthpiece of the government in Pyongyang, made the attack in one of two pieces aimed at Mr Obama and South Korean president Park Geun-hye.

Angry response: President Barack Obama waves to the crowd after speaking at a Democratic National Committee reception in San Jose, California, yesterday

Both pieces were only in Korean and were not translated into English by the news agency.

Kang Hyuk, a worker at the Chollima Ironworks Factory, in a translation by the NK News website, said: 'How Obama looks makes me disgusted.

'As I watch him more closely, I realise that he looks like an African native monkey with a black face, gaunt grey eyes, cavate [sic] nostrils, plump mouth and hairy, rough ears.

'He acts like a monkey with a red bum, irrationally eating everything,' Mr Kang added. 'Africa's national zoo will be the perfect place for Obama to live, licking breadcrumbs thrown by visitors.'

One of articles was translated by Josh Stanton, who blogs regularly about the North's human rights violations.

He said, in comments about Mr Obama's visit to South Korea made on May 2, KCNA wrote: 'Park made waste water-like reckless remarks ... after inviting her American master reminiscent of a wicked black monkey to visit South Korea.'

Other attacks in the commentary, 
according to the Washington Post, described Mr Obama as being 'a 
crossbreed with unclear blood' and like someone who 'has the figure of a
 monkey while the human race has evolved through millions of years'.

It
 also called Mr Obama a 'clown,' a 'dirty fellow' and somebody who 'does
 not even have the basic appearances of a human being'.

In response, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said: 'While the North Korean Government-controlled media are distinguished by their histrionics, these comments are particularly ugly and disrespectful.'

The second article also featured attacks on the South Korean president, describing her as an 'old prostitute'.

It is not the first time North Korean media has used such language when talking about the South Korean leader.

Frank Feinstein, who runs the North Korean propaganda monitoring service KCNA Watch, told NK News: 'There is no similar instance of this sort of language in the recent KCNA history.'
