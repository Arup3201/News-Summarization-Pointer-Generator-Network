Few can fail to be awed by the spectacle of shimmering curtains of green that twist and turn on the horizon, combined with twirling cascades of red, yellow and purple.

Normally the event – known as the aurorae borealis in the northern hemisphere – is only seen by those in high latitudes such as Scotland, or by people who are  prepared to pay to go on a winter Arctic cruise.

Incredible: The sky above the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, lit up last night as a spectacular display of the Northern Lights illuminated the South West of England

Different colours: Stargazers in Foxley, Norfolk, were also treated to a stunning display of the Aurora Borealis that lit up the sky last night

Captivating: Skies over Loch Brora in the Scottish Highlands turn red and green by a mesmerising display of the Aurora Borealis

Bright: People across the UK revelled in a rare glimpse of the Northern Lights - stretching as far down as East Anglia. Above, the sky turns pink and yellow

Swirl of colour: Photographer Stewart Watt captures the Aurora Borealis lighting up the sky over the small town of Thurso in Caithness, Scotland, during the night

Historic: The sky lights up red above Stonehaven War Mermorial in Aberdeen

Unbelieveable: The Northern Lights display at Inverkirkaig, near Lochinver in Sutherlandshire, Scotland. The display lasted for two hours before clouds obscured them

Starry-eyed: The stars are caused by the collision of electronically charged particles with atoms in the high altitude atmosphere

Stunning: The Northern Lights were also visible in the North East of England. Above, the Aurora Borealis light up the sky near Hallbankgate in North Cumbria

Out of this world: And they also appeared over areas of Scotland, such as Carrbridge in Inverness-shire (pictured)

But not this week. After months of 
storms, floods and downpours, nature took pity on us and gave a rare 
glimpse of the lights across most of the British Isles, including 
southern England.

In 
Essex, Norfolk, South Wales, Gloucestershire and even Jersey, stargazers
 were able to enjoy one of the best displays in years. The sight is 
caused when electrically charged particles ejected from the Sun – known 
as a coronal mass ejection – hit gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere.

The nature of the Earth’s magnetic field means these particles usually rain down around the North and South Poles.

But
 if the outburst from the Sun is strong enough – and an eruption this 
week was particularly powerful – there are so many charged particles 
bombarding the atmosphere they can be seen from much lower latitudes, 
including southern Britain.

Dr
 Lucie Green, of Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College 
London, said astronomers got wind that we were in for a spectacular week
 after satellites captured activity on our nearest star.

Spectacular: People watch the Northern Lights, dance over St. Mary's Lighthouse in Whitely Bay just outside Newcastle

Lit up: The lighthouse appears to light up as a collision of particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere

Watching in awe: A man watches the spectacular array of lights, which have caused the lighthouse to gleam a blinding shade of white

Hard to believe: The Northern Lights fill the sky with an eerie green above Ayr, Scotland, last night

Gleaming: The Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights as they are commonly known, at St Mary's Lighthouse and Visitor Centre in Whitely Bay, North Tyneside

Visible: Such light displays in the sky often occur in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, but they were visible in North Tyneside

Amazing: A sightseer points at the Northern Lights at Embleton Bay in Northumberland

Colourful: The bay was lit up with purple, blue and green colours as millions of particles entered the earth's atmosphere

She
 said: ‘When we were watching the Sun on Tuesday we saw that a 
particularly large and fast eruption leapt off from its atmosphere, and 
the models predicted that we would probably get a glancing blow from 
this eruption, and they were right.’

She
 added: ‘They are always seen at high latitudes – they are there all the
 time. But when we get a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun, it 
erodes the Earth’s magnetic field and we get the lights at lower 
latitudes. In 1859, the lights were so strong they were seen almost down
 at the Equator.’

The 
colours of lights produced depend on the gases hit by the solar 
particles. The most common in northern latitudes is a yellowish pale 
green – caused as a result of collisions with oxygen atoms 60 miles 
high.

Rarer red aurorae
 happen when particles striking oxygen 200 miles up. Nitrogen gas 
produces blue or purple light. Scientists know what causes the colours –
 but the reasons behind what causes patterns like shimmering curtains or
 steadily glowing sheets  remain a mystery.

This week’s lights were a reminder of the beauty of space weather – but also its dangers.

Beautiful: The Northern Lights are pictured over a house, garden and greenhouse in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire

Mesmerising: A beautiful display of lights is pictured above the house in Carrbridge - giving the property warm yellow glow

Spectators: Dozens of people gathered to watch the breathtaking display of lights at Whitely Bay in North Tyneside last night

Daylight: The night appears to turn into day as the lights shine over St Mary's Lighthouse in Whitely Bay

Mark Thompson told the BBC: 'The electronically charged particles take two or three days to get here' Above, the Northern Lights at Sycamore Gap, Hadrian's Wall

He added: 'When they do get here they cause the gas atoms in the sky to glow. It is as simple as that'

Solar
 eruptions can knock out satellites, interfere with high frequency radio
 communications and damage electricity networks, said Dr Green.

Photographer
 William Henderson, who spotted the lights from Pan Tod Beacon on 
Ruardean Hill in Gloucestershire, said: 'Well tonight turned into 
something truly amazing.

'What was meant to be a simple night time shoot of the stars turned into something which I can only describe as awesome.

'This
 shot, taken at Pan Tod Beacon in Ruardean Hill shows the night time sky
 with a weird green glow. Is it a UFO? Is it the Northern Lights? 
Whatever it is, it was unbelievable!' 

Meanwhile,
 stargazers in Norfolk, Essex, South Wales, Cumbria and parts of 
Scotland were also treated to stunning views of the Aurora Borealis.

Twitter
 user and meteorologist, Chris Bell, posted a stunning photograph from 
his home in Foxley, Norfolk at around 8pm last night.

The Aurora Borealis or as most people know them as the Northern Lights, is giving spectacular displays, lighting up the skies over the UK under clear skies

Breathtaking: A streak of red can be seen in the sky as dozens of rocks rest on Embleton Bay in Northumberland below

The aurora was due to last for several hours before fading during the early hours of this morning

The skies were lit up red and green last night as a spectacular display of the Northern Lights illuminated parts of the country

Mark
 Thompson, presenter of Stargazing Live, told the BBC: ‘What happens is 
there is stuff called the solar wind, which is electronically charged 
particles, and they take two or three days to get here and when they do 
get here they cause the gas atoms in the sky to glow. It is as simple as
 that.’

The lights could be seen in the northern regions of the country last night, such as 
Whitely Bay in North Tyneside, where a lighthouse could be seen shining brightly.

They were also captured by photographers above Scotland-based homes in Carrbrige in Inverness-shire, and Inverkirkaig, near Lochinver in Sutherlandshire.

Mr
 Thompson said the aurora over Britain had been expected, after a burst 
of activity on the sun around four days ago, but that it had been 
brighter than expected.

‘Aurora
 displays usually happen around the North and South poles, so to see 
them this far south is pretty rare,’ he told the Eastern Daily Press.

‘I haven’t seen one like that in Norfolk for about 20 years.’

The aurora was due to last for several hours before fading during the early hours of this morning.

‘Scientifically, we don’t learn a lot from aurora borealis – they are just nice to look at,’ he added.

‘But
 I’m writing a book on astonomical photography at the moment and, as 
luck would have it, I got the chance to get some pictures of my own.’
