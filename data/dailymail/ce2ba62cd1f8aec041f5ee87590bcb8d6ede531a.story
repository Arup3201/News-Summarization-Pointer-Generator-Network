A terminally ill mother-of-three is planning to spend her final months sailing around the UK – and hopes the trip will leave her dog with a place in history.

Lori Murdock, 57, wants Betty the Patterdale terrier to become the first dog to travel all the way around the UK by sea.

Ms Murdock, from Topsham, in Devon, began planning her voyage when doctors told her there was no cure for her aggressive form of skin cancer and gave her nine months to live.

Lori Murdock, who has terminal skin cancer, is sailing around the UK with her dog, a Patterdale terrier called Betty - she hopes Betty will become the first dog to travel the whole way around the UK by sea

She will set sail from Topsham, Devon, this week on board a restored 1950s wooden yacht with two-year-old Betty and her partner, Stephen Rodwell, 60.

She will stop off at various locations around the coast in an attempt to raise awareness about the importance of having moles checked for signs of skin cancer.

She also hopes to raise £10,000 for cancer charities, Macmillan, FORCE and Factor 50 Fundraisers, before she returns to Devon after three months.

The retired solicitor and law lecturer, who has previously sailed across the Atlantic, said: ‘I’ve been fortunate enough to sail to some wonderful places but I realised that I did not know my own island.

The mother-of-three was given just nine months to live when it was discovered that her malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed in September 2009, had spread to other parts of her body

‘Nine months is no time at all so I realised I needed to make this trip happen and I only hope that I’m alive long enough to get all the way around.

‘Betty is a seasoned sea-dog and shouldn’t be too fazed by a few months at sea.

‘It might sound traumatic but she loves the boat and she has her own lifejacket which she has been wearing since she was a puppy.’

Ms Murdock was diagnosed with 
malignant melanoma in September 2009 two years after she first expressed
 concern to her doctor who failed to spot the cancer.

By then the illness had spread to other areas of her body leaving her with no hope of survival.

She intends to spend three months travelling all the way around the British Isles stopping at ports along the way. While on the journey she hopes to educate people about the signs of skin cancer and to raise £10,000 for cancer charities

She said: ‘Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer but it can be cured in most cases if you catch it early.

‘I’m hoping that by doing something like this I can raise awareness and if it helps one person then it will all be worth it.’

On her fundraising page Ms Murdock wrote: ‘I want to encourage everyone I meet along the way to check their skin, get to know it so you can spot any change, however small.

‘Get it checked out straight away. If you are worried, ask to be referred to a specialist.

‘Malignant melanoma is the second fastest growing cancer in young people between 15 and 35. Be aware and encourage the young people around you to use factor 50, not to burn and not to use sun beds.’
