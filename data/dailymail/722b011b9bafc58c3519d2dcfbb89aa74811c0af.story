Ruben Loftus-Cheek lent down and listened to the last words of wisdom from Jose Mourinho before the 18-year-old made his Chelsea debut.

'I gave you this, you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine.' Mourinho said. 'No problem,' the youngster replied.

Finally, with seven minutes of the 90 to play,  Loftus-Cheek got his chance.

Despite only playing 11 minutes for Chelsea on Wednesday, Ruben Loftus-Cheek impressed on debut

Loftus-Cheek, passing to a team-mate at Stamford Bridge, slotted into the Chelsea midfield with ease

He had been warming up for long enough and after all the talk ahead of the dead-rubber against Sporting Lisbon about how strong Chelsea's youth players are, one of them eventually made it on to the pitch.

Despite all Mourinho's pre-match posturing – putting Loftus-Cheek alongside him to face the media in their press conference and arguing that they may as well shut their academy if no players came through – he only named one youth product in the entire squad to face Sporting.

And even then, Loftus-Cheek had to make do with a place on the bench. They were 2-0 ahead by half-time. Still he did not get the chance to play after the break.

He finally begun warming up just after the hour mark, with Chelsea holding a comfortable 3-1 lead, with Ramires and Loic Remy.

Still his wait went on when Mourinho made his first substitution in the 71st minute and Remy came on for Mohamed Salah. Then three minutes later, Ramires was called over by the Chelsea bench and he was thrown on. The teenager was left all alone, patiently jogging up and down, stretching his already well-stretched muscles.

Eventually, after 20 minutes of warming up, he was whistled over and the wait was over. Mourinho put an arm on his shoulder as he crouched down to listen to the words of wisdom and instructions.

'Very good personality, very positive. Not afraid of playing, not afraid to have the ball. He wanted to participate. 10 minutes, but he wanted to do it. Obviously low levels of resposibility. We are qualified, the result is 3-1 and the game is over, but he showed immediately the quality he has,' Mourinho said after the match. 

Jose Mourinho kept Loftus-Cheek warming up for 20 minutes before handing out instructions to the midfielder

'Everyone in the stadium had the feeling we have a kid with talent. So keep going, keep working hard, and hopefully people around him don't disturb the work we are doing with him. I said to him: 'I gave you this, you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine.' He said immediately: 'No problem.'" 

The 83rd minute came up on the clock and he came on for Cesc Fabregas. Quite the act to follow. 'Please welcome the Stamford Bridge: Ruben Loftus-Cheek,' came the announcement on the PA system. There was a loud applause around the stadium.

The first touch was shaky, giving the ball away. But he did not look out of place, standing at 6ft 2ins tall, amongst the others. 

The Chelsea academy product started the match on the bench during his first call-up to the senior squad

He was a straight replacement for Fabregas, playing in the hole behind Diego Costa. A couple of minutes after coming on, he showed what he can do with two swift passes at either end of a Chelsea move from their own half to inside Sporting's box.

In 11 minutes on the pitch he stamped his mark on the match and showed he has the potential to become a first-team player. By the time he burst through and rounded Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patricio in stoppage time, only to be flagged for offside, the supporters were cheering his name. 

In only September he was playing in Chelsea's Under 19 UEFA Youth League group stage match against Sporting at their academy in Lisbon. The match was played at the tiny Aurelio Pereira stadium with a capacity of 3,000 which was only a third full. Chelsea thumped their opponents 5-0.

He is still included in the Under 21 squad profiles on the club's website where they describe him as 'a talented box-to-box midfielder capable of controlling games.'

Mourinho said on Tuesday: 'One month ago he played in Lisbon with the Champions League new generation, so you can imagine the difference between playing against Sporting academy, with 1,000 spectators, and then to play against Sporting in the real Champions League, at Stamford Bridge with 45,000 and all the lights on you.'

All the lights could be on him for many years to come.
