Three girls left motherless after a 
hit-and-run rampage that brought hysteria to a city's streets will open 
festive gifts labelled 'from mum,' tomorrow.

Karina Menzies, 31, was killed during 
30 minutes of terrifying carnage in the Ely and Leckwith areas of 
Cardiff, south Wales, in October.

Thirteen others, including seven children, were injured, some seriously, in the deadly incident.

Karina Menzies, 31, had already bought Christmas presents for her children before her death in October

Tomorrow the three girls, aged 11, eight and two, will unwrap the last gifts their mother ever bought for them.

Samantha Menzies, 26, the dead woman's sister, described them today as 'the last thing she will ever be able to give them'.

She took charge of her sister's girls
in the aftermath of the tragic death and they will spend their first 
Christmas together tomorrow.

I am excited about Christmas but at 
the same time I feel sad as well because it will be their first 
Christmas without her and that's going to be tough,' she told BBC Radio 
Wales.

'But I will put all my energies into 
keeping her memory alive and into the girls being involved at the 
cemetery - decorating her grave, making decorations for the tree - so 
they feel close to her.'

She said that her sister had already bought quite a few presents for her daughters before her death in October.

Mourners placed flowers next to where Karina died in October

'They are going to be labelled 'from 
Mum' because they are from mum.

'And I'm going to make sure they enjoy 
their presents and enjoy the day.'They are definitely going to know 
they are from Karina because that was the last thing she'll ever be able
to give them. So I'm going to make sure that happens.'

Friends and well-wishers gathered to 
say farewell to the mother-of-three at an emotional funeral service at 
the Church of the Resurrection, in Ely, last month.

Tributes were paid at the uplifting 
celebration to her life as the leopard print coffin containing her body 
stood at the centre of the church.

Matthew Tvrdon, 31, from Cardiff, was charged with the murder of the mother-of-three within a day of her death.

He has since appeared in court accused
of her murder and 13 counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault
occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving.
