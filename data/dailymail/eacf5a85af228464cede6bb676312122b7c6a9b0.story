A care home nurse was allegedly so drunk at work that she confused a teddy bear with a baby, a hearing was told today.

Violet Ruto attended the Ashton Grange Nursing Home in Horsham, West Sussex while intoxicated on repeated occasions and was so unsteady on her feet she had to be removed from the building, it was said.

She was also found sleeping in one of the rooms during her shift on New Year’s Eve, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Care home nurse Violet Ruto attended the Ashton Grange Nursing Home in Horsham, West Sussex while intoxicated on repeated occasions and was so unsteady on her feet she had to be removed from the building, it has been said

It is alleged that she asked a resident if they were holding a baby when it was actually a teddy bear on one occasion.

The nurse is facing a string of charges relating to claims she was unfit for work on at least four occasions.

Care home manager Carmel Rigby said she received a phone call at home at 10.15pm on December 1, 2010, to say that Ruto had turned up drunk for her night shift.

She said: ‘My instant reaction was shock, I couldn’t believe a nurse would come into work under the influence of alcohol.

‘When I arrived at the home I found Violet with her coat on and her bag packed - she was very meek.

‘I asked what was going on and she said "I’m fine".

Hearing: Laura Kane will appear at the Nursing and Midwifery Council tomorrow. She denies the nurse denies taking compassionate leave and lying about her qualifications

‘Her speech was slurred, her mouth was screwed up and she was speaking in an unusual tone.

‘Her eyes were bloodshot and she smelled of alcohol.

‘I had noted that she often wore a lot of body spray or perfume to work which I thought could have been to mask the smell of alcohol.

‘She could barely stand by herself.

‘Violet required staff to remove her from the premises as she was so unsteady on her feet.’

Ruto claimed she had not been drinking at all but was suffering from a migraine during an interview about her conduct.

The alleged incidents are all said to have taken place in December 2010.

If she is found guilty of misconduct Ruto could be suspended or struck off. She has not attended the tribunal and is not represented.

The hearing continues.
