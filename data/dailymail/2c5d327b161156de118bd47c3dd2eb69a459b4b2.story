Never work with children or animals goes the old Hollywood saying but today, Prince William found himself doing both - of a sort.

After a day spent meeting students at a Shanghai school, the Duke of Cambridge found himself meeting Paddington Bear on the red carpet at a film premiere.

Walking down the red carpet outside the Shanghai Film Museum, William was accosted by the much-loved character and cheerfully posed for photos.

Working with animals? The Duke of Cambridge joins Paddington Bear on the red carpet

Cheerful: William appeared to enjoy meeting the character and posed for photos on the red carpet

On show: The Duke of Cambridge arrives at the film premiere in Shanghai

The event was part of the GREAT Festival of Creativity, which is a government-inspired scheme designed to give a boost to all things British.

One of those things is the UK film industry and during the reception that followed the premiere, the Duke presented his hosts with some old footage of Shanghai recently restored by BFI.

William's visit to the Museum came after a day spent meeting school children and enjoying a kickabout with locals.

Watched by the excited children, William teed up a penalty and, after taking it, beamed as an excited child rushed up to give him a high five. 

Football is about to become part of the national curriculum in China, and the British Council runs a scheme called Premier Skills which fosters a passion for the game.

Good shot! A delighted local then rushed up to give the Prince a high five

The Prince was shown around by Paul Hughes, 33, a former coach at Reading FC, Millwall and Southampton, who now travels the world passing on his experience to local coaches under the British Council scheme.

'The Duke told the children that if they keep on working hard hopefully one day they might play in the Premier League,' explained Hughes afterwards.

'He asked them if they knew who David Beckham was, and said that if they got involved in football then one day they might meet him.

'The Duke was interested in how football helps build confidence, self esteem and promotes good health, and how the game is going to become a big focal point in schools here.'

The kickabout came on the third day of William's state visit to China, the first time a senior royal has visited the country since the Queen in 1986. 

All smiles: William wasn't the only delighted one - the coaches also seemed to approve

Well done: The Duke looked just as pleased by his efforts as the little boy did

Nice work: William and the youngster share smiles as they high five on the pitch

And while it has been almost 30 years since she stepped off the plane in Beijing, the visit clearly hasn't been forgotten as her grandson discovered during a tour of a Shanghai trade fair. 

There, William came face-to-face with a portrait of his grandmother, which was taken by photographer David Bailey to mark the Queen's 88th birthday last year.

The delighted Prince exclaimed: 'That’s fantastic, it’s a great photo, does anyone know when they were taken? I love them.'

The images are part of a collection display along with other top British design products at the event in Shanghai's Long Museum.

After officially opening the GREAT Festival of Creativity on Monday night, William returned for a closer look at the goods on show.

Beckham ring any bells? The Prince asked the children whether they had heard of David Beckham

Football fan: William, seen here with the children, is a keen football fan and supports Aston Villa

Coaching: Premier Skills sends British coaches to China to pass on their skills to local children

Round of applause: The Duke got a cheer as he arrived at the training field

At the BBC Worldwide stand he was greeted by a moving penguin cam, christened George  which walked towards him and bowed.

The lifelike model, with a hidden camera behind one eye, has just returned from the Antarctic where it was used to gather footage of real penguins in the wild for the TV series Spy in the Huddle.

William laughed and said: 'That’s incredible, it’s brilliant.' Speaking to Mike Gurston, creative director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, he said: 'What you produce really gives people a chance to see these animals.'

Later, the Prince was particularly moved by the REX robot, made by Rex bionics, which allows paraplegics to stand and even walk.

William, meet George! The Duke was introduced to a robotic Emperor Penguin chick

Having a go: William tried his hand at riding a fold-up Brompton bicycle

Familiar face: During his tour of the event, William came across a familiar face - a photo of the Queen

Creativity: William was introduced to British businessmen at the GREAT Festival of Creativity

Opening speech: On his first night in Shanghai, he officially opened the GREAT Festival of Creativity

The robotic legs were demonstrated by wheelchair user Sophie Morgan, 30, who suffered a car crash when she was 18.

She told the Duke: 'This allows me to stand tall. It’s lovely to be at eye height. People paralysed from the neck down can walk in it. It’s designed to completely stabilise you.'

William, whose day was rounded off with a speech at the British Council Global Alumni Awards at the historic Rujin Hotel in Shanghai, will travel on to Jinghong today.

During the visit, his last stop in China before he flies home tonight, the Prince will visit a Dai village and an elephant sanctuary, as part of his ongoing crusade to end the ivory trade and protect wildlife.

His plans were given an unexpected boost four days ago, when, on the eve of his arrival, China announced that it was imposing a ban on ivory imports from Africa for a year. 

Boost: The festival is a government-inspired scheme designed to boost Britain's trade with China

Showcase: The event is designed to showcase British creativity in technology and healthcare among others

Colourful: William was treated to a flamboyant display from local dancers when he arrived last night

Warm welcome: William got a warm welcome from President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People
