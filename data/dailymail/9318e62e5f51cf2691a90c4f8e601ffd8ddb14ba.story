When the Vince Lombardi Trophy is given to whichever team wins Sunday's Super Bowl, one of the games most recognizable faces won't be there to hand over the trophy.

Hall-of-fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw - a staple of modern NFL broadcasts - will not be in New Jersey tonight to award the winning team with football's most coveted trophy. Instead he will be with his family mourning the loss of his father who died Thursday.

Bill Bradshaw was 86.

For the last several years, Bradshaw has been part of the Fox Sports crew who does the trophy presentation after the Super Bowl.

In his absence, Fox says former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan, who has made a name for himself in the broadcast world after he retired from football after winning the Super Bowl in 2007.

Bradshaw played 14 seasons as the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Bradshaw won four championships with the Steelers and was named the Super Bowl MVP twice.

Before his pro career, Bradshaw played college ball at Louisiana Tech, where he was the second-string quarterback behind Phil Robertson, who is best known for inventing the Duck Commander duck call and starring in the A&E reality show Duck Dynasty.
