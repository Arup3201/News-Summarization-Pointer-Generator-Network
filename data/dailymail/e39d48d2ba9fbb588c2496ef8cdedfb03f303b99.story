Sergio Ramos looks to be a lucky boy after escaping with just a yellow card despite appearing to punch Atletico Madrid forward Mario Mandzukic in Tuesday's Spanish Super Cup clash.

The pair tangled in the 60th minute of the 1-1 draw between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, when Ramos thrust his fist into Mandzukic's face as he lay on the floor.

The Croatian striker had just beaten Ramos to a header and as both fell to the floor, Ramos seemed to hit his prostrate opponent. Both players were booked for the incident.

Ramos put his hand up as soon as he had made contact with Mandzukic, but the two clashed again just five minutes later when the Croatian made the most of minimal contact as they challenged for a high ball.

The Spanish defender is no stranger to ill-discipline, having been sent off a staggering 19 times for Real Madrid in just nine seasons at the club.

Real had looked to be heading to a first-leg victory at the Bernabeu after new signing James Rodriguez scored in the 83rd minute to put Los Blancos in front.

But Atletico midfielder Raul Garcia equalised with three minutes remaining to give his side the edge heading into Friday's second leg.
