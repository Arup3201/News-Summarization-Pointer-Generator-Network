Posing provocatively with their guns and truncheons these real life policewomen make an arresting sight. 

Since the Yorkshire matrons of the Rylstone and District Women's Institute stripped off for charity, there have been no shortage of saucy calendars on the market. 

We've seen a string of semi-clad firemen and scantily dressed sports teams, but now a group of women police officers have released their own racy attempt.

Caked in make-up these female traffic officers from Belarus pose in and out of their uniform for each of the 12 months of the year, according to Vocativ.com

The women all serve as traffic officers in the Grodno region of ex-Soviet Belarus, where the police are known as militia.

The calendar girls include in their ranks lieutenants, a captain and even a major.

It has proved a big hit with social media users in Russia and Belarus, according to vocativ.com  

One said: 'Traffic police issued a calendar with its half-naked employees. Wow!'

Others commented on the force's 'charming employees,' according to the website.

But not everyone was a fan, with some branding the police officers 'desperate.' 

As well as the sexy images, the 2015 calendar also features a number of bizarre shots, including a policewoman leaning on a spinning wheel superimposed in front of a police car.
