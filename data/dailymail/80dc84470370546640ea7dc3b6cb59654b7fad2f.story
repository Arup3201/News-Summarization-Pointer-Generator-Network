A 33-year-old woman has been jailed for life after murdering her widowed mother in a frenzied knife attack in which she was stabbed more than 60 times.

Lisa Traves attacked her 61-year-old mother Priscilla in a 'moment of madness' at the house they shared in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, last November.

She stabbed her with a 12.5cm long kitchen knife and left her for dead while she went into Lincoln city centre to meet a friend, before finally ringing 999.

Guilty: Lisa Traves was jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering her widowed mother in a frenzied knife attack

Traves was today sentenced to life 
imprisonment at Lincoln Crown Court. Judge Michael Heath ordered she 
serve a minimum term of 13 years.

He told Traves it was clear she and her mother loved one another but she had never been able to develop an independent life.

Evidence
suggested that stresses involved in their relationship as well as 
financial worries and Traves' claims that she was sexually assaulted 
could have contributed to the murder, Judge Heath said.

He
told Traves, who put her fingers in her ears and shook her head as the 
judge described some of the injuries her mother suffered: 'This was a 
deliberate, brutal, sustained and at times forceful attack.

'She was slightly built, unarmed and in no position to defend herself.'

Traves originally denied the murder but changed her plea to guilty on July 11, the day she was due to stand trial.

The
court heard that on the day of the murder Mrs Traves found out about 
her daughter's claims that she was sexually assaulted by two 
ex-boyfriends - which were never substantiated by police - and was 
demanding she got help, refusing to let her leave the house.

At
around 6pm, Mrs Traves tried on three separate occasions to ring a 
victim support line on her daughter's behalf, but the calls were never 
answered.

Prosecutor Yvonne Coen QC told the court: 'Within about 45 minutes of those calls Mrs Traves was dead or dying.'

She and her daughter got into a squabble that became physical and Traves grabbed a kitchen knife, stabbing her more than 60 times to the chest, neck and back, the court heard.

She cleaned the blood off her body, changed out of her blood-stained clothes and made her way into Lincoln city centre to meet a friend.

She rang 999 once she was at Lincoln Cathedral, where officers traced the call and arrested her.

Ms Coen told the court Traves, who was 32 at the time of the offence, had a difficult relationship with her mother and was unable to talk to her about personal matters, particularly romantic relationships.

They were also due to be evicted from their home in late November after they were unable to pay the rent.

Traves' defence barrister, Frances Oldham QC, said Traves loved her mother dearly and they were inseparable, but she attacked her in what she described as an 'absolute moment of madness' that was entirely out of character.
