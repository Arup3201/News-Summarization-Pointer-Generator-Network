Working in dark, cramped conditions in barren deserts often attacked by fierce sandstorms, these pictures show the brutal and uncompromising work of Sudan's gold miners.

Supported by weak-looking pulleys, workers lower themselves into the deep, dark mines, which appear like huge crevasses in the middle of the desert.

As those on the surface battle brutal storms and temperatures reaching 44C to hunt for gold with detectors, others lower themselves into the dangerous underground pits.

Tough conditions: A gold mine worker searches for gold inside a local mine in Al-Ibedia locality at River Nile State in Sudan

Cramped: The man works in tough, cramped conditions in unremitting heat. He uses basic tools to dig for gold, barely able to turn his body

Difficult: This picture shows just how dark and claustrophobic the conditions are below ground

The miners are part of a 60,000 strong workforce in South Sudan who take part in the back-breaking work, often because of widespread hunger.

These images show miners working in the Al-Ibedia area at River Nile State. Miners are lowered into the pits on flimsy-looking pulleys held together by wood.

The holes are so narrow, they can barely turn around. Wearing no safety jackets or helmets, the miners have just a headlamp to guide them in the bleak darkness.

Once at the bottom of the mines, they use a variety of basic-looking tools to dig for the valuable commodity, in hot, and unremitting conditions.

As the miners dig and search for long hours, above ground,  makeshift camps are created in which other workers prepare to deal with the findings from below.

Fierce: Above ground, workers prepare for their day's work in shelters, which are often battered by brutal sandstorms

Basic: The mines appear as long, slim crevasses in the ground . The pulleys which the workers use to lower themselves down into are supported by planks of wood

Dangerous: The conditions are brutal, with the miners not wearing helmets or protective clothing

Valuable: The mines are dark and claustrophobic but the rewards for those who find gold are huge

Hard work: A gold mine worker lifts a bag down into one of the pits

Workers sift the earth, looking for any sign of gold. Others operate large gold crushing machines and weigh their findings to check on their value.

Gold mining is big business in Sudan, particularly in the south. The land is endowed with many resources, many of which are undiscovered.  As well as gold, there is also believed to be copper, uranium and marble.

But with this comes numerous problems, including smuggling.

It was estimated recently that South Sudan loses $200m a year through gold smuggling.

Temporary: The gold rocks which are discovered below ground are crushed by teams of workers in these makeshift camps

Hunt: Above ground, workers search for other areas to mine using detectors

Process: This man uses a gold crusher at the mine in Al-Ibedia to prepare the precious goods for sale

Search: The gold which is discovered below ground is sent to the top where it is sifted by another team of workers . This worker displays some of the findings

Windswept: Workers take shelter from a sandstorm in the tents, which are filled with various tools and instruments to help search for gold

Speaking to the Sudan 
Tribune, the director general for mineral development, Arkangelo Okwang 
Olerr revealed that about 17 kilograms of gold could leave the borders 
of Eastern Equatoria state on a daily basis.

'In fact we did a rough calculation that if this was to have been 
organised, I am sure we would have got in total say every year like $600
million from this additional just local miners and applying taxation 
rate of about 33% internationally we would have gotten about $200 
million on average,' he said.

The authorities are now having to battle with illegal mining operations across many areas of the country.

Officials
have warned they will soon deploy inspectors along with police to  
areas suspected of illegal mining.

Happy: Despite the work being tough, the rewards can be huge. These workers display large gold nuggets as they weigh them at the mine

Heavy: Large chunks of gold are weighed so workers can assess they value

Battle: Gold mining is fast turning into big business in Sudan. But the authorities are increasingly having to struggle to fight against smugglers

Preparations: Gold mine workers at the back of a truck take cover from the rain as they make their way to a local mine in River Nile State

Boost: The miners work long and brutal hours, so taking time out to eat food is important

Sandstorm: The conditions below ground are tough, but as this picture shows, it is often even worse on the surface

The government needs the money which 
it generates as it looks for an alternative to oil, which currently 
provides more than 90 per cent of the government's revenue.

It is believed that about 60,000 people mine for gold in South Sudan. Many use their 
bare hands which they once used to harvest crops.

The back-breaking labour is even carried out by women, children and elderly people who are driven to work because of widespread hunger.
