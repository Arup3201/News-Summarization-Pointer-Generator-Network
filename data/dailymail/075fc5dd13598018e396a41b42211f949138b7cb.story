A debt-ridden hospital trust that plans to axe 750 jobs is spending more than £25,000 a month on an American IT expert.

Rotherham Hospital Trust paid around £40 million for a computer system that has never worked.

In a bid to repair the failing system the trust is paying £25,000 a month, plus hotel bills and air fares, to U.S. IT expert Larry Blevins - who has even advised the White House.

Staff at the crisis-hit trust are furious that taxpayers is picking up the bill for airline tickets, laundry and restaurant bills.

Rotherham Hospital Trust is planning to axe 750 jobs in an attempt to save money but spent £40 million on a computer system that lost 5,000 outpatient appointments

Flight tickets cost £4,000 when Mr Blevins flew in from the USA for a three month initial period.

His basic expenses over a six week period at Sheffield's Hilton Hotel came to £2,300 for accommodation, laundry, taxis to work, meals and non-alcoholic beverages.

His contract has now been extended and he remains as project manager for the struggling IT system.

Hospital chiefs have told staff that the Electronic Patient Record System is being retained despite ongoing problems.

The failing IT system caused chaos when it 'lost' 5,000 outpatient appointments in a 'black hole' which cost the hospital £1.6 million and had patients turning up at the wrong times for appointments that doctors knew nothing about.

The hospital trust has also admitted that three other consultants - Michael Morgan, the trust's interim chief executive, barrister and accountant Tim Bolot, who is leading the financial recovery, and Joshua Ejdelbaum in a supporting role - are costing £92,400 a month including VAT.

In February the trust was found by NHS watchdog, Monitor to be 'in significant breach of the terms of its authorisation' for its failure to deliver on its savings plans.

On-going problems with the controversial patient record system - originally budgeted at £30 million - were also highlighted by consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who reported that it would run to at least £40 million.

London based healthcare management firm Bolt Partners were called in to lead the recovery and restructure the trust. They provided Mr Morgan, Mr Bolot and Mr Ejdelbaum initially on an interim basis.

A trust spokesperson confirmed that Mr Blevins, described as an 'Electronic Patient Record System expert' had amassed 'basic expenses from the hotel to the hospital, meals - some bought from the hotel bar - and non-alcoholic beverages'.

She added: ‘The laundry expense was included within the hotel deal package and £4,000 of the monies was allocated as his fare from the United States as part of his contract.’

Last October the hospital told staff that more than 750 jobs would go and wards would close in a bid to save cash.

The hospital is currently making cuts in a bid to save £5million.

Since then several senior officials, including the chief executive, have left and job cuts have still not been made.

A source for the health union UNISON said: ‘There is still no word on when the trust will even begin the process of appointing a new chief executive.

‘Do they really need to keep up this level of spending? We knew the appointment of a new chief executive will take seven to nine months but when will it start.’
