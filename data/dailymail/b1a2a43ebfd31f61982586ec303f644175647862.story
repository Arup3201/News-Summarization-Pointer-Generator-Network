 It may have a face that only a mother could love, but it's still one of a kind at Queensland's Australia Zoo.

The zoo's latest arrival - a baby echidna that's the first to be born under a breeding program that began just two years ago - is getting plenty of attention. 

This may come as a surprise because when it comes to cute, a big nose, beady eyes and bald spots don't typically feature on the list of desirable features.

The smallest attraction at Queensland's Australia Zoo - a baby puggle weighing only 696 grams

But when you're a puggle, it works wonders.

The zoo released some oh-so-cute photographs of its latest arrival, which at three months old weighs just 696 grams, and doesn't have a name yet as it's still too early to work out if it is a he or a she.

 Zoo keepers are happy with the puggle's progress. It's gaining weight, growing new hair and spines every day, and nursing happily from mum Tippy. 

A 'puggle' is the term used for the young of an echidna until it leaves the pouch.

Mothers give birth to an egg that incubates in her pouch, and the puggle hatches after 10 days. Staying in the pouch for 45 to 60 days

After that, puggles start to develop spines prompting mothers in the wild to leave them in a nursery burrow, with the mother coming back once or twice a week to feed it. Echidnas are one of two types of monotreme, or egg-laying mammals, found in the world. The other is the platypus, and both are unique to Australia.
