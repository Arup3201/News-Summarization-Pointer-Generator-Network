From
that polka-dot Topshop dress 
to those vibrant pink jeans, everything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold.

Whether
her clothes, hair style or eyebrow shape, sales are sent sky-rocketing 
by anything that women believe will bring them one step closer to 
emulating their future Queen.

And
it seems her loyal legion of fans are so desperate to be copy-Kates they will do whatever it takes - even snapping up items she has bought for her unborn baby.

Sales of Moses baby baskets are soaring since the Duchess of Cambridge picked one up during a shopping trip with mother Carole on Sunday.

Soaring sales: In the latest example of the 'Duchess effect', supermarket Asda reported a 57 per cent increase in online sales of Moses baskets since the weekend

In the latest example of the 'Duchess effect', supermarket Asda reported a 57 per cent increase in online sales of Moses baskets since the weekend.

And the supermarket predicts blue buggy sales will triple, as new mothers follow Kate's colour lead.

Asda Baby and Toddler Club manager Claire Smith said: 'Shoppers across the UK want to offer their little ones the Royal treatment, and the blue buggy reports look set to send the nation into a princely state of excitement ahead of its birth this summertime.'

The positive effect the Duchess has on sales is not a new phenomena and just last week a Topshop polka dot dress she sported on a day trip sold out within an hour of her wearing it.

It's a sell out: Within an hour, the dress was completely sold out and customers were greeted with a message which read: 'Sorry, this item is out of stock'

Followers of fashion besieged the High Street retailer's online store to buy the Â£38 dress, after Kate was pictured in it on a day trip to the Harry Potter studios with Princes William and Harry.

Within an hour, the dress was completely sold out, and customers were greeted with a 'sorry, this item is out of stock' message.

Kate is a regular wearer of the British brand, and sported a monochrome collared dress last month when she attended the Child Bereavement UK headquarters.

Her wardrobe was certainly well-stocked: earlier in the month the mother-to-be was spotted perusing the maternity rails in Topshop's flagship store on Oxford Street, central London.
