It’s not quite the fast and the furious.

But there’s no doubt that this 12 hour lawnmower overnight race is a real test of endurance.

A total of 34 teams lined up for the highlight of sport's surprisingly busy racing calendar in Five Oaks, West Sussex, last weekend.

A total of 34 teams competed in the gruelling 12 hour race - the highlight of the lawnmower racing calendar

The majority of the 8pm to 8am race takes place in the darkness to make it technically more of a challenge

And the winning team, which included experienced racers Mark Rostron, Andy Rostron and Darren Whitehead, completed 366 laps of the 1.37km circuit by 8am.

Hollywood actress Julie Walters got proceedings underway as she waved the Union Jack to signal the start of the race at 8pm on Saturday August 9.

She said: ‘I’m so shocked at how dangerous, for a start, it looks. There’s one corner that is so sharp. It’s very exciting though. I can see how people become obsessed with it.’

On the very first lap one of the mowers overturned on a tight bend marking the start of a treacherous race.

The majority of the 12 hour race is completed in darkness to make it technically more of a challenge.

Each team has three drivers who swap around to combat fatigue and there is a support team in the pits.

The fastest lap of the day was set by a team from Luxembourg with a lap time of 1 min 39 seconds giving an average speed of 41.9mph.

The race kicked off at 8pm and each team swapped round their three drivers to combat fatigue

Mental and physical exhaustion can be a problem for the drivers, but these men and women clearly relished every gruelling bump of the punishing course.

Racer Clive Atton said: ‘I’ve done half an hour and I’ve broken the motor. They fixed it and sent me back out, but I just thought I’m going to die. I’m so tired and I’ve only done one stint.’

A heavy downpour at midnight made the course even more challenging.

There were many breakdowns, but most of the mowers were still in the race by 8am. 

The other lawnmower racers cheered on their team mates as they took a well-deserved break

The bizarre sport was invented in 1973 at The Cricketers Arms pub, Wisborough Green, West Sussex.

A group of young men, including sport consultant Jim Gavin, started discussing the prohibitive costs of getting involved in any kind of motorsport. 

They founded the British Lawn Mower Racing Association and shortly afterwards, the North West Lawn Mower Racing Association was formed.

The first British Grand Prix meeting for lawn mowers ran at Wisborough Green in 1973 and attracted an entry of 35 drivers. 

The sport has grown rapidly and now hundreds of enthusiasts have their own mowers purely for racing.
