Good news for witches – you won’t need your extra-warm cloak as you take to your broomstick tonight.

This Halloween will be the hottest on record, according to forecasters.

Temperatures could reach 21C (70F) in the South East, eight degrees higher than expected at this time of year.

But don’t get too excited; next week will see a return to traditional autumn temperatures.

The balmy forecast for today represents another high during a year which is so far the warmest on record. Much of the country has enjoyed sunshine and warm weather this week.

Meteogroup forecaster Laura Caldwell said: ‘Friday is expected to break the record for the last day of October.

‘Right across England and Wales it will be warm but it could get up to 21C in the South East, about seven or eight degrees warmer than average.

‘It’s been fairly warm for an October in general. The whole year to date has been the warmest on record so far. It’s been a remarkable year for above-average temperatures.’

Temperatures this week have hovered just below 20C at their peak in central England. Next week the weather will cool as bands of rain cross the country and temperatures will return to the average of around 10C or 11C for November.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams told MailOnline: ‘By Monday night, Tuesday night, we could start to see the temperatures returning to average.

‘We'll start to see the things we expect in November, like snowfall over the mountains in Scotland. That's exactly what we'd expect at this time of year.

‘It's a gradual process - each day will be a little bit colder than the previous. In terms of temperatures going over 20C, you can't completely rule it out.

‘But it becomes less and less likely as you go on into late autumn and early autumn.’

Meanwhile, families looking for pumpkins to help mark Halloween could be disappointed. Some supermarkets are running low after the wet autumn led to one of the worst harvests for years.

Thousands of pumpkins rotted in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, with some suppliers reporting losing as many as seven in ten.

Some Morrisons stores had run out while Tesco, M&S and Waitrose said they were aware of a shortage.

A Morrisons spokesman said: ‘Our buyers have been working extremely hard to bring in extra pumpkins and we aim to have them available up until Halloween.’

Yesterday’s top temperature was 17.1C (62.8F) in Bude, Cornwall, while the coldest in the day was Lentran in the Scottish Highlands, at 8.1C (46.6F). 

Tonight will be dry in the South East, but there will be a chance of patchy rain in the North-West - while tomorrow will be mostly dry and fine.

On Saturday, a band of rain will edge eastwards across much of England and Wales, although East Anglia and south-east England may stay dry.

Rain is expected to push south-eastwards across much of the UK on Sunday, but it will turn brighter behind with sunny spells and a risk of showers.

The Met Office has no severe weather warnings in place, but the Environment Agency has one flood alert out, for the Upper River Derwent in Cumbria.

Meanwhile, Mr Williams moved to dismiss reports today that Britain could be battered by the coldest winter in 100 years.

He said: ‘We have seen these kind of forecasts before - we saw the same thing last year before what was a very mild year.

‘Essentially within the short range forecasts we see temperatures by Tuesday return to near normal or below normal for the time of year. 

'So it will be feeling much cooler, but that's by no means any kind of Arctic freeze that will bring widespread issues to the UK.

‘Essentially, to forecast the kind of temperatures out to months ahead, the science just doesn’t exist to do that.’ 

Averages: This Met Office map shows the UK mean temperature for October 1 to 28, compared to the long-term (1981-2010) average

MailOnline’s betting partner Coral is offering 9/1 that it will snow on Christmas Day in Cardiff, 8/1 in London, 8/1 also in Belfast, and 9/2 in Edinburgh.

Met Office figures up to last Tuesday show the UK mean temperature for October so far is 11C (52F), which is 1.5C (2.7F) above the long-term average.

However, that is far short of the 12.2C (54F) record in 2001 and would currently rank 11th warmest in the forecaster’s national records dating to 1910.

Last year’s October average (11.2C; 52.2F), and that of 2011 (11.3C; 52.3F), were both warmer than this year’s early figure.

But nine out of the ten months this year have seen above average mean temperatures, with only August having been below average.
