One man died and four people were injured after a hydraulic crane fell over at a wedding in India.

The crane was lowering a ‘crystal platform’ carrying the bride and her sister into the wedding venue in Adalaj village, near Ahmedabad in Gujarat state.

The man, said to be a 40-year-old guest, died, while the injured are being treated at a nearby hospital following the accident last night.

Dangerous entrance: The diamond-shaped platform 
began dropping at a worrying speed as it became apparent that the entire
 crane was coming down with it

According to local police, the 40ft-crane fell over after it was parked in uneven and muddy ground.

A video from the wedding shows the cone-shaped platform being lowered down as pyrotechnics go off.

As the platform gets closer to the ground, the crane suddenly topples over and the platform, carrying the bride and her sister, crashes to the ground.

The wedding was hosted by a local resident for his daughter. It is not clear how badly the bride, or her maid-of-honour sister, were injured.

‘As per the plan, the bride was to 
reach the venue from outside the plot through the crane as she would be 
showered with flowers,’ a relative told Times of India.

‘Everything went as per the plan till the platform almost reached at the designated spot.

'The incident took place when the crane was about to drop it to the ground from the height of four feet.

‘Suddenly, the crane turned one side and both the occupants fell on the ground.’
