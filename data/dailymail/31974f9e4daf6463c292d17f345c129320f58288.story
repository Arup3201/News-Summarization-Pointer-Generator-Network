Victoria Beckham has admitted that she understands why the public perception of her is that she will be 'such a cow'.

Victoria, 39, who is famous for never smiling in photographs joked: 'Everyone thinks I’m going to be such a cow - I get it because I think the same when I see the pictures.'

While her public image suggests otherwise, her showbiz friends have often highlighted her witty sense of humour and it seems that she does a neat line in self-deprecation too.

The former Spice Girl turned designer
made the startling admission at the two-day Vogue Festival in London on
Sunday where fashion fans queued around the block after and paid £40 a ticket to hear her talk about her work and family life.

Victoria Beckham was speaking at the Vogue Festival and arrived with her 14-year-old son Brooklyn in tow

Clearly surprised at the turn out she
told the enraptured audience: 'I didn't expect so many people. If you'd
told me how many, I might have got up and sung a song. Now that would have been a worry.'

The former Spice Girl turned fashion 
designer gave a detailed insight into the team that helps her 
handle the demands of a career and motherhood - which unsurprisingly includes a nanny.

Victoria said: ‘I don’t know 
how I do it. It is a juggling act. It’s no different for me than any 
other mum.

‘I get up very early and go through spelling tests and times tables tests with the kids like any working mum.

‘I am also up late because I have a baby and a 14-year-old who refuses 
to go to bed. So I don’t get as much sleep as I would maybe like.

‘But
I have great people who handle my schedule. If there’s a parents’ night
or Easter bonnet parade or nativity parade I plan around that so I can 
be heavily involved.

‘But 
it’s difficult juggling working, having the children, having a husband 
who travels. I do have a bit of help, I have a nanny, I can’t do it all 
myself.

‘I really enjoy 
being a mum, I love them [her children] and I’d do anything for them. 
But I also love what I do. I think anyone who says it’s easy is lying.’

Victoria, seen with husband David and sons Romeo, left, Cruz, centre, and Brooklyn, said she 'can't do it all myself'

Victoria was accompanied to the 
talk by her oldest child Brooklyn, 14. She also has two other sons, 
Romeo, ten, Cruz, eight, and 21-month-old daughter Harper with 
footballer husband David.

She went on to admit her high expectations might make her difficult to work for.

She said: ‘I’m a perfectionist, I like everything to be right. I’m 
probably a  complete pain in the neck to work with because it is really 
important to me because I’ve grown this brand from nothing to where it 
is now.’

Mrs Beckham also revealed that she uses herself as a mannequin for the designs of her hugely successful eponymous label.

My office is a creche: Mrs Beckham said Harper plays on a swing in the office of her fashion label

‘I have a great team... we sit around and talk and then I basically get naked and make clothes.

‘I’m
designing things I’d want to wear myself. I love women and I want to 
make women feel good about themselves and confident and empowered.’

Poking
fun at those working in the fashion industry who make regular use of 
Botox, she said: ‘There were a lot of raised eyebrows, well those who 
could raise their eyebrows, that I was going to design a fashion line.

'There were a lot of preconceptions but I didn’t set out to prove them wrong, I set out to prove to myself I could do it.’

It was just one of many revelations Mrs Beckham made about her fashion designing business.

She said she encourages her staff to bring their children to work, joking that her office is like a creche.

She said: ‘My office is quite small and Harper had this swing. So she would swing one way and bash into a pile of fabrics and then swing the other way and bash into a rail of clothes. It’s a small creche.’

Late at night Mrs Beckham devotes time
to her beauty regime, when she plucks her eyebrows, and falls asleep 
thinking about what she will wear the  following day.

‘I’ve got four kids so I don’t have as much time as I’d like in the morning to pick out what I’m going to wear,’ she said.

‘I
think about it in bed before I go to sleep, I visualise it. It’s funny,
I told David and he said he actually visualises football when he’s 
lying in bed. And  Gordon Ramsay told me he  visualises food.’

Mrs Beckham’s morning routine also involves rigorous exercise, and she is a sworn fan of celebrity fitness guru Tracy Anderson, who Gwyneth Paltrow credits with helping her achieve her trim figure.

‘I get up really early three times a week to work out,’ she said. ‘I do Tracy Anderson. It’s a bit of dancing on the treadmill, a bit of bottom work.’

She added: ‘I’ve done rock climbing with the children, cycling, and I don’t wear heels for that.’

The Beckhams' moved to Los Angeles when David signed with the LA Galaxy football team and have since returned to live in London.

Mrs Beckham said she was enjoying life back in the UK, even though her husband is now playing for Paris St-Germain in France. On Sunday night the footballer was sent off after just six minutes.

‘Living in London is very, very different from Los Angeles, but it’s great, it’s inspiring – London is such an inspiring place to live, so multicultural, it’s interesting, I’m happy,’ she added.
