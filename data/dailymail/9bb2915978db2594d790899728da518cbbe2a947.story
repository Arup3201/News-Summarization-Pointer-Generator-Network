Ronny Deila has opened the door to a third spell at Celtic for Scotland star Shaun Maloney.

Out of contract at Wigan this summer, Maloney was the subject of a failed £750,000 bid by Leicester City last week.

Manager Malky Mackay revealed, however, that ‘four or five’ clubs were interested in the former Parkhead attacker.

Speaking from Celtic’s winter training camp in Gran Canaria, Deila admitted the Scottish champions could be one of them.

Keen to infuse his side with a hardcore of experienced, older Scottish players, the Norwegian said of the Maloney situation: ‘I am aware of all the Scottish players. He is a good player and is one we know about. He is at Wigan at the moment but we will wait and see.

‘I have seen him many times. He is a quick, creative player and is a very good person with a great mentality. He looks like a Celtic player.’

Wigan are holding out for £1million in the current window. Deila has seen Maloney excel in the 4-2-3-1 formation he likes with Scotland, however, and could make a move even if current playmaker Kris Commons signs a new contract.

‘I have always had six or seven older players in my team,’ he continued. ‘You can have a lot of (young) talent but it is insecure without leaders and they won’t develop. That’s why guys like Broony (Scott Brown) are so important.’

Commons’ agent Martin Reilly has been invited to Parkhead for fresh talks aimed at breaking the stalemate surrounding his contract situation.

Celtic are blanking calls from Neil Lennon’s Bolton in the hope of working out a deal to keep Commons – who is expected to fly to Gran Canaria after a family funeral.

Asked if the player will stay, Deila said: ‘It’s hard to say, only he can answer that. We are going to meet his agent next week when we get back. He is an important player and we want to keep him.’

Also reluctant to lose £8m-rated defender Virgil van Dijk, the Celtic boss remained confident of ending the transfer window with a stronger squad.

‘I am confident we will be stronger by February,’ he said. ‘I speak regularly with Peter (Lawwell) and he has one goal - to keep every player we want to keep. It’s vital the squad is stronger. This is not the time to lose players, we want to bring them in.’

Having been linked with Dundee United trio Stuart Armstrong, Nadir Ciftci and Gary Mackay-Steven, Deila joked: ‘I will buy the Dundee United team, and Aberdeen as well. That’s one way to do it, we could buy all of their strikers. But things are happening all the time. We are in a much better situation than we were in the summer.’

Deila has also been linked with a raft of his former players in Norway, but is wary of importing any more of his countrymen after the failed loan capture of Jo Inge Berget.

‘I would choose to bring in Scottish and English players, especially in this window as they need to be able to make a difference straight away,’ he admitted.

‘British players know what the Scottish game is all about.

‘If I was to bring in a Norwegian player they would have to be very strong. It’s difficult to say if they are good enough so I would be anxious about bringing one in.

‘It’s something we saw with Jo Inge. Other managers have brought in Norwegian players who have been successful but it’s safer to bring in home players.

‘I have been impressed with the technique of the Scottish players, but also the attitude. They have a good mentality. It’s difficult for teams made up of different nationalities. It’s more individualistic in Scotland whereas in Norway it’s more systematic. If we can get a mixture of both then we can do very well.

‘We are not going to have the best players in Europe - but we can have the best team. That’s what we are working on every day.’
