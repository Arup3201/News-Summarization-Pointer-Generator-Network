Girl Guides will learn about beauty myths and the tricks of airbrushing as part of a scheme to boost young girls’ self-esteem.

They will be taught to spot which magazine pictures have been touched-up and discuss unattainable body traits to win a new ‘Free Being Me’ badge.

The badge will also be available to Brownies, aged seven to ten. Guides are aged ten to 14.

New initiative: Girl Guides will be taught to spot which magazine pictures have been touched-up and discuss unattainable body traits to win a new 'Free Being Me' badge

Girlguiding has teamed up with the Dove Self Esteem project, which aims to promote body confidence.

A Girlguiding survey found 87 per cent of young girls think they are judged more on looks than ability and one in four girls aged between 11 and 21 would consider cosmetic surgery.

One in five girls of primary school age say they have been on a diet and more than a third of teenage girls have skipped meals to try to lose weight.

Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: ‘Along with Girlguiding’s 100,000 amazing volunteers, I am committed to helping girls develop into happy, self-confident young women ready to take on the world.

‘Free Being Me will play an incredibly important part in this mission – helping young women to develop in confidence, so they grow up to become unstoppable.’

'Low body confidence is a serious issue that is having a vast and damaging impact on the quality of life of many young girls in the UK'

Lucy Attley, Dove

Lucy Attley, Dove UK and Ireland Brand Director, said: ‘Low body confidence is a serious issue that is having a vast and damaging impact on the quality of life of many young girls in the UK.

‘The Dove Self-Esteem Project (DSEP) was created to help tackle this issue by providing support and tools to young people to help them raise their self-esteem.

‘Our partnership with Girlguiding in the UK to launch the Free Being Me badge builds upon the great work being done by the DSEP, allowing us to reach more young people and positively affect their body confidence and self-esteem so they can realise their full potential in life.’
