More than $200million has been squandered on a scheme to train Iraqi police that Baghdad says is neither needed nor wanted.

The Police Development Programme – proposed as the largest State Department programme in the world – was planned as a five-year, multibillion-dollar effort to train security forces after the U.S. army left Iraq last December.

A report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that Iraq did not confirm in writing that they wanted to go ahead with the programme to the American Embassy in Baghdad.

Facing Baghdad's ‘disinterest’ in the project, the embassy is gutting what was supposed to be the centrepiece of ongoing U.S. training efforts in Iraq.

According to the report, the embassy plans to hand over the $108million Baghdad Police College Annex to Iraqis by the end of the year and will cease training at a $98million site at the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Basra. The number of advisers has also been cut by nearly 90 percent — from 350 to 36.

In a 41-page summary of their inspection, auditors concluded in the report that: 'host country buy-in to proposed programmes is essential to the long-term success of relief and reconstruction activities.'

Auditors noted that it ‘has clearly been difficult’ for American diplomats to secure a solid commitment from Iraq's government to participate in the training program. Still, the report said: ‘the decision to embark on a major program absent Iraqi buy-in has been costly' and resulted in 'a de facto waste.’

The findings call into question 
funding needs at the largest U.S. embassy in the world, as the Obama 
administration prepares its new spending plan for the 2013 fiscal year 
that begins October 1.

While
auditors said it's unknown how much the embassy in Baghdad is 
requesting, additional funds for the police program ‘may not be needed.’

Despite years and billions of dollars of training, Iraq's police force remains a vulnerable target for militants.

On Sunday, seven police were killed and nine more wounded in bombings and shootings near the former al-Qaida stronghold of Fallujah, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. It appeared to be the latest strike by the Sunni insurgency as it seeks to reclaim areas where U.S. troops ousted them.

In a July 26 letter responding to a draft of the report, acting Assistant Secretary of State Carol Z. Perez said the embassy will need an unspecified amount of additional funding this year to continue training Iraqi police into 2013.

She disputed that money has been wasted, pointing out Iraqis will continue to use the Baghdad Police College Annex for training.

Perez added that the embassy has been
assured by Principal Deputy Interior Minister Adnan al-Asadi that Iraq 
is committed to a streamlined version of the training programme.

She
said U.S. diplomats will continue working with top security officials 
‘to ensure that our police assistance efforts meet mutual goals and 
objectives and to sustain senior-level Iraqi commitment to the program.’

Auditors,
however, said those assurances fall far short of a written commitment, 
and quoted al-Asadi as telling U.S. inspectors that the police training 
program is ‘useless.’

They 
added that Al-Asadi ‘also indicated that Iraqi police officers had 
expressed their opinion that the training received to date was not 
beneficial.’

Al-Asadi could not be reached for comment and his spokesman declined to comment.

A key member of parliament's security oversight committee said that U.S. training programmes are no longer needed by Iraqi police.

Shiite lawmaker Hakim al-Zamili said: "The Iraqi federal police went through many training courses, in many fields, and that resulted in having many experts and specialist academies.’

‘At this point, we don't need the American expertise, because of the expertise we have now.’

Auditors said the U.S. has spent about $8billion to train and equip Iraqi police since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. At that time, there were about 58,000 police in Iraq.

The report said that number had grown to 412,000 by 2010. Other estimates put the size of Iraq's federal, local and border police force at 650,000.

Training was led by the American military until last October, just six weeks before U.S. troops left Iraq. The embassy took over the programme, but with what Monday's report described as "mixed results."

Iraq's self-rule northern Kurdish region has embraced the programme and, as a result, half of the remaining 36 U.S. advisers assigned to police training will be based in the Kurdish capital of Irbil, 215 miles north of Baghdad.

But restive politics in the central government, whose factions are reluctant to be seen as dependent on American help, have prompted officials to keep the U.S. trainers at arms' length.

Some Iraqi officers have been told to skip the police training sessions, the audit said, citing one who blamed "lukewarm relations between the Americans and Iraqis (that) has created some distance between them."

Stephanie Sanok, who was at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad from 2009 to 2010 and is an expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the police training programme was "doomed from the beginning" because American officials never made sure Iraqis supported it.

She said: ‘The U.S. government has a tendency to go ahead with programmes that it has decreed are in the host country's best interests.

‘This was such an expensive program, and there was plenty of time to get the Iraqi government to help shape it in such a way that they could eventually take it over. But we never got that buy-in.’
