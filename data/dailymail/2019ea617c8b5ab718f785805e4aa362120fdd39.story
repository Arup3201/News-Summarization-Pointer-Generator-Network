Saying goodbye: Those who remember Tony Soprano saying goodbye to friends and family on The Sopranos can say hello to the Irvine-Cozzarelli Memorial Home which is on sale for 1.8 million.

Ornate: The decorated space can function as more than just a funeral home and has many rooms

HBO hit: The Sopranos ran for six seasons on HBO and sadly the show's star James Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano (center) died last year

The luxurious space is conveniently located just 11 miles from New York City.

'The Cozzarelli Funeral home is a glowing testimonial to architectural excellence and superiority in design and appointment. Imagine a fine restaurant...private club...dinner theatre...art gallery...exclusive boutique...,' writes the Sroka Worldwide Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

Vulture.com reports that location scouts for The Sopranos didn't discover the beautiful funeral home until days before they shot Tony Soprano's mother Livia's farewell.

Owner James Cozzarelli said that when his secretary called him to tell him that HBO wanted to know if they could use the home, he thought it was a prank.

What formed was a relationship that lasted until the final season.

Cozzarelli Jr. was able to gain his Sag-AFTRA card after appearing in nearly every burial scene.

Chance discovery: The funeral home's owner says that his space was discovered just days before Tony Soprano's mother Livia's funeral was shot

Relationship: The Sopranos then filmed every funeral at the home thereafter for the rest of the show's run

Sadly James Gandolfini who playedTony Soprano died earlier this year.

When the news broke, the show's fans gathered to make a makeshift memorial for him outside of the funeral home.

Cozzarelli says that Gandolfini was humble and a creative genius.

Locals would cook Italian food for the actor and bring it to him when he was shooting the show.

'All the Italian ladies from the neighborhood would come, and they would make food for him and bring it to the funeral home,' he says.

'He accepted all of it. He was a precious guy.'

When asked by Vulture what Cozzarelli's favorite scene was he said the one in which the character Uncle Junior played by Dominic Chianese breaks down and cries.

'He could turn on the emotion of sorrow so magnificently,' remembers Cozzarelli, who says the cast and crew gave Chianese tons of applause.

'It was otherworldly.'

What's to come: Despite having once served as a funeral home, the space could be transformed into something new like a supper club or a restaurant 

Lasting memory: Though the show nor Tony Soprano are no longer alive the space is a living memory of the show's masterful creation and each actor's genius body of work
