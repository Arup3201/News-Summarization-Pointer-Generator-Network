West Brom striker Saido Berahino hopes to move 'on to bigger things' in the future but insists his No 1 priority is helping the Baggies avoid relegation this season.

The 21-year-old has scored 14 goals for his side so far this term - with four of them coming in the 7-0 thrashing of Conference outfit Gateshead in the FA Cup last month - and his goalscoring form has seen him linked with move away from The Hawthorns.

The Burundi-born forward, who has made 13 appearances for England Under-21s since making his debut in 2013 and scored 10 goals, is committed to West Brom until 2017, but is confident he can continue to get the goals that will see him eventually move to a bigger club.

Berahino told Sky Sports News: 'I'm taking care of my short-terms right now and if I keep scoring the goals and if I keep doing well for West Bromwich Albion, I know the future will be bright for me and I know that I'll go a long way.

'I need to stay focused on what I'm doing right now which is scoring the goals and keeping West Bromwich in the Premier League.

'If I can keep them in the Premier League and score as much goals as I can, I'm pretty sure the fans wouldn't mind me pushing on and moving on to bigger things. So I want to ensure that I keep them first in the Premier League and score as much goals as I can for them.'

Liverpool and Tottenham have both been linked with Berahino, with reports of both sides lining up an offer of £25million. 

He admitted he was pleased to be linked with other teams, but reiterated that that his main focus was West Brom, who have won just one of their last seven league matches.

He added: 'I'm just flattered to be linked to all these sort of teams, but I stay focused. This is my second season in the Premier League and I still have a long way to go.

'I'm learning a lot from all sorts of different players. For me I just look forward to each game and try to enjoy as much as possible.'

Tony Pulis' side are currently 15th in the Premier League standings and only three points from safety ahead of Sunday's match at Burnley.
