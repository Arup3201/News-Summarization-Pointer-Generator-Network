Sir Stuart Rose would be prepared to pay more tax to help the country

One of the biggest names in British business has told the government not to scrap the new 50p rate of income tax.

The former head of Marks & Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose has not only said he opposes the move but is happy to pay more tax to help the country out of its current financial difficulties.

Rose is the biggest name so far to oppose the move which has been backed by a group of 20 economists on Wednesday, who feel the levy is hurting the UK's competitiveness.

Rose told BBC Radio 4's Hard Talk yesterday: 'I don't think that they should reduce the income tax rate. 

How would I explain to my secretary that I am getting less tax on my income, which is palpably bigger than hers, when hers is now going down?'

Rose's comments are in stark contrast to former Conservative Chancellor Nigel 
Lawson who urged George Osborne to axe the 50p top rate of income tax, 
warning it is 'dangerous' and 'foolish' to leave it in place.

Lord Lawson admitted it would be politically difficult for the government to slash the levy on the country's top earners but insisted 
it would be 'better' to push the change through soon.

Earlier this week President Barack 
Obama outlined plans for a larger payroll tax cut in an effort to assist
the struggling US economy. 

Rose is not alone in calling for the rich to pay more taxes, with several  high-profile names adding their weight to the debate.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffet urged Congress in August to raise taxes for millionaires, arguing they have survived the financial crisis better than those poorest in society.

Warren Buffett has also backed calls for the super-rich to pay more tax

Writing in the New York Times Buffet said: 'While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks.

'My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.

'It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.'

Buffett's tax rate last year was 17 per cent, compared with an average of 36 per cent for his employees at his Berkshire Hathaway company.

Wealthy figures from across Europe have also echoed Buffett's call, with Italian Formula One magnate Luca di Montezemolo publicly backing his ideas 'for reasons of fairness and solidarity.'

Others to back calls for increased income tax for the rich include L'Oreal billionaire hieress Liliane Bettencourt and Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of oil company Total.

Rose left his post as chief executive and chairman of Marks & Spencer earlier this year.

'Be brave, Lucinda. We all have to make sacrifices. So you may not be getting Liz Taylor's jewellery for Christmas.'

The Treasury is to review the impact of the tax over the coming months, with a decision to scrap it likely in the 2012 budget.

Liberal Democrats are expected to oppose the move until proposals to exclude those earning less than £10,000 are added.
