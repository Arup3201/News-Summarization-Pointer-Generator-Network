Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded Wednesday that it's 'possible' convicted felons could become Obamacare 'navigators,' gaining access to tax information and Social Security numbers of Americans as they help them register for insurance coverage.

Her admission came during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, in a tense exchange with Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn.

'Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check,' Cornyn asked her, 'even though they will receive personal – sensitive personal information from they individuals they help sign up for the Affordable Care Act?'

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded that criminals could be helping Americans fill out health insurance applications, gaining access to the tax information required to determine their eligibility for government subsidies

Round Two: Sebelius faced an unexpectedly harsh grilling at the hands of Senators. Last week, she got a similarly hostile welcome in front of congressmen

'That is true,' Sebelius responded in a moment of nervousness. 'States could add an additional – um – background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement.'

'So a convicted felon could be a navigator,' an annoyed Cornyn followed up, 'and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them?'

'Uh, that is possible,' she said, shifting blame to the groups responsible for deploying navigators in the field.

'Four Pinocchios' Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on President Obama's now-debunked promise that Americans who like their health care plans would be able to keep them after Obamacare went into effect -- a promise that The Washington Post called a 'whopper'

Line of fire: Sebelius faced calls to resign over the shambles by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts

'We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators, and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job.'

Sebelius also mentioned 'a self-attestation' that navigators are expected to sign, confirming their identities and their intentions.

'But it is possible.'

President Obama is headed to Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, where he will promote the navigator program, a feature of Obamacare that allows paid assistants, many from community organizing groups cast in Obama's historical mold, to help Americans with their enrollment.

Despite the administration promoting the navigators as an alternative means of registration to the program's semi-functional website, they too must use the website to determine whether or not applicants are eligible for federal government subsidies.

March to the gallows: Sebelius faced unusually tough questions from a typically more sedate Senate Finance Committee panel, with one member calling for her resignation

Under questioning from Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sebelius tried to qualify her startling admission about information security under Obamacare.

'The navigators must go through a minimum of 20 hours of training,' she said. 'A significant portion focuses on privacy and security issues.'

She insisted that applying for insurance under the new law 'there is no personal health information ever collected or needed, so they don't have access to that.'

But Isakson countered that 'to estimate the subsidy somebody's going to get under the Obamacare law, you'd have to know their income on their tax return.'

'Are the navigators going to be able to use that information in order to make that estimate?'

'If a consumer chooses – yes – to share that information,' she replied, 'they can give the consumer the information about what they qualify for.'

Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Sebelius' home state of Kansas, called for her resignation over the botched Obamacare website rollout.
