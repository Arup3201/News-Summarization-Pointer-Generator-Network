Change: Nick Clegg is on the verge of matching Cameron's pledge to hold an in/out vote on Britain's EU membership

Nick Clegg is on the brink of matching David Cameron’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, senior Liberal Democrats say.

The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to be considering a dramatic shift in his party’s position following the Lib Dem wipeout in last month’s European elections.

The move would leave Labour dangerously exposed as the only major party opposing a referendum.

Senior figures from both the right and left of the Lib Dems, including at least three ministers, are telling the Deputy Prime Minister his position is untenable, the Daily Mail has learned.

Thus far, Mr Clegg has refused to back Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum on Britain's future in Europe by the end of 2017 if he remains in Downing Street, whether or not he succeeds in negotiating substantial changes in our relationship with Brussels.

The Lib Dems were branded ‘enemies of democracy’ by Tory colleagues after conspiring with Labour to kill off legislation guaranteeing plans to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU earlier this year.

The Deputy Prime Minister has claimed that the Prime Minister’s promise is against the national interest and risks derailing the economy by creating uncertainty for international investors.

He has also dismissed the chances of Britain achieving any meaningful return of powers from Brussels.

But the Prime Minister has insisted that a referendum is a ‘deal breaker’ in any future coalition negotiations – saying it cannot be ditched if he fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power-sharing deal with the Lib Dems.

It is increasingly clear that despite his public opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister does not regard blocking a referendum as a priority if his party does enter into a second coalition with the Conservatives.

Senior Lib Dems believe embracing a referendum will show that the party, which was beaten into a humiliating fifth place behind the Greens in last month’s European elections, has listened to voters.

A source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘We are not indifferent to the message the electorate have just sent us. We will make clear our position on the referendum Bill in due course.’

One option would be to commit to a referendum in the next Parliament but not to the timetable set out by Mr Cameron.

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, said: ‘I think the British people should be given a say on whether we should be in or out of the EU but David Cameron’s policy is like playing poker with all your cards showing.’

One Liberal Democrat minister said: ‘It is obvious we would agree to hold the Tories’ blessed referendum if we go into a second coalition. So why don’t we get share of the credit for offering one?

‘We called ourselves “the party of in” in the European elections, and we should accept that voters are going to have a say and make the positive case for remaining in the EU.’

Another senior Lib Dem said a shift in position, agreeing to a referendum, would pile pressure on Labour, which has effectively ruled out holding a vote. ‘It would put them in an impossible position,’ the source said.

The issue will come to a head within weeks as the Tories reintroduce a Bill committing the Government to holding a vote by 2017 and dare the other parties to frustrate it once again.

Mr Cameron insists the vast majority of voters want a say on the issue and has condemned the Lib Dems for refusing to allow Government legislation to proceed.

Instead, the Conservatives will back backbench legislation to be introduced by former minister Bob Neill. They did the same in the last Parliamentary session, succeeding in getting a Bill through the Commons but seeing it killed off by Labour, Lib Dem and crossbench peers in the Lords.

In a highly unusual move for backbench legislation, a three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – is to be imposed on Tory MPs, meaning any members of the Government who voted against would have had to resign.

Mr Neill, now vice chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘One of the first votes I ever cast was on EU membership in the 1970s . Now as I pick up my bus pass I am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the British people.

‘Britain needs a new deal with Europe and the Conservatives have a plan for change in Europe – renegotiate, reform and put the deal to the British people in an in/out referendum by the end of 2017.

‘Parliament now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the British people have the final say.’
