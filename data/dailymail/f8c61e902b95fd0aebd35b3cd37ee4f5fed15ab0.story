Inter Milan fought back from two goals down to snatch a point against Lazio at the San Siro.

The Nerazzurri have struggled for form since Roberto Mancini's return in November but their comeback on Sunday evening did at least prevent a third defeat in five games.

Inter's fans feared the worst when Lazio's Felipe Anderson opened the scoring in just the second minute of play - his powerful shot from 10 yards out burst through Samir Handanovic's legs amid groans from the stands.

Inter Milan (4-3-3): Handanovic; Nagatomo, Ranocchia, Dodo (Medel 45'), D'Ambrosio, Juan; Kuzmanovic, Guarín (Bonazzoli 76'); Kovacic, Palacio, Icardi.

Subs not used: Obi, Andreolli, Campagnaro, Mbaye, Carrizo, Krhin, Hernanes, Vidic.

Goals: Kovacic (66'), Palacio (80'). 

Booked: D'Ambrosio. 

Lazio 4-3-3: Marchetti; Basta, Radu, De Vrij, Cana, Mauri; Ledesma (Gonzalez 82'), Lulic; Parolo, Anderson, Klose (Dordevic 56').

Subs not used: Berisha, Konko, Keita, Cataldi, Cavanda, Starshoka, Novaretti. 

Goals: Anderson (2', 37'). 

Booked: Gonzalez, Lulic, Anderson, Klose.

And the Brazilian struck again in the 37th minute, this time showing off his close control to dribble past the host's defence before finishing at the near post.

But Mateo Kovacic pulled one back for Inter with a magnificent second-half volley from outside the box. 

Federico Marchetti may feel he could have done more to prevent the goal but the power with which Inter's midfielder struck his shot was too much for the Lazio keeper's weak attempt at a parry.

Rodrigo Palacio then equalised with 10 minutes to go, poking home from two yards out after some woeful defending from the visitors at a set piece.

The result leaves Roberto Mancini's side 11th in the Serie A table - six points adrift of the Champions League places and nine clear of the relegation zone. 

Stefano Pioli's Lazio move up to third after overtaking Napoli on goal difference alone.
