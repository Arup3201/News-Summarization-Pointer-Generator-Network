In years to come, of course, it will be remembered as an historic day. But for the Royal Family yesterday, it seemed to be little more than a distraction in their hectic schedule.

The Queen spent the morning hard at work on official papers – which arrive daily at her desk in battered old red boxes – before breaking off to be at her great-grandson’s christening.

As well as attending to her paperwork, she managed to fit in both morning and evening appointments either side of the brief service at St James’s Palace.

As one aide put it: ‘It was very much a red box sort of day.’

The
Queen interrupted her schedule for only an hour to attend the 
christening ceremony, have a cup of tea and a slice of cake, and pose 
for the official photographs.

After
the christening, she was driven straight back to Buckingham Palace, and
by 6pm she was hosting a reception for The Queen Elizabeth Diamond 
Jubilee Trust, with several hundred guests thronging the White Drawing 
Room and Picture Gallery. 

She also managed to squeeze in several audiences with dignitaries and two military commanders.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who only met 
his great-grandson for the first time last month, was similarly busy, 
catching up on paperwork in his office at the palace and then later 
co-hosting the evening reception with the Queen.

‘It was a busy working day, largely briefings and correspondence,’ said an aide.

Grandfather Prince Charles was also forced to rush to the christening from other appointments. He stood in for his mother at an investiture at Buckingham Palace in the morning.

He handed out awards to best-selling author Kate Mosse, who was awarded an OBE, and the founder of My-Wardrobe.com, Sarah Curran, who was given an MBE for services to fashion.

The Prince then switched his formal naval uniform for a lounge suit before joining his wife Camilla at Clarence House for tea with Burmese opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who had made a special request to see the royal couple on her visit to London.

The talks, which also included a tour of Clarence House’s private gardens to see a tree the peace campaigner had planted there last year,  began at 1.45pm and ended at 2.30pm.

This gave Charles and Camilla just a few minutes to freshen up before meeting William and Kate with baby George at neighbouring St James’s Palace.

If they were smarting at the lack of an invitation, they were determined not to show it.

From the wilds of Canada to the West Country, senior royals who failed to make the cut for the christening were out in force.

The Earl of Wessex – William’s uncle, Prince Edward – had a breakfast meeting at the Lanesborough Hotel in London in his role as trustee of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards.

He then headed back to Buckingham 
Palace for a day of private meetings and paperwork before joining his 
mother, the Queen, at Buckingham Palace for a charity reception.

His wife, the Countess of Wessex, conducted four engagements in the West Country.

Royals: Prince Andrew (pictured with his daughters Eugenie and Beatrice at William and Kate's wedding in 2011) is understood to have a similarly busy day

completed visits to: an NSPCC centre of which she is President; a 
facility that undertakes research into why people are born with cleft 
palates; a GirlGuiding venue; and an evening concert.

Prince Andrew is understood to have a similarly busy day.

He had several meetings, including with Bui Thanh Son, a Vietnam foreign affairs minister, and members of the Outward Bound Trust, as well as a holding a lunch for the Patron’s Company.

His daughters Princess Eugenie, who is working in New York, and Princess Beatrice, were also left to read about the christening in the newspapers along with the rest of the public.

Princess Anne was in Canada undertaking a series of engagements with a ‘military theme’.

There was also no invitation for the Duke of Cambridge’s other uncle, Earl Spencer. He famously pledged at the Princess of Wales’s funeral to protect Princes William and Harry, who he described as his ‘blood family’.

In recent years he has criticised the parenting skills of the Prince of Wales and his failure to visit Princess Diana’s grave at the Spencer family estate, Althorp in Northamptonshire.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided not to invite several senior royals because they wanted the occasion to be an ‘intimate, family affair’.

William and Kate had already chosen to break with recent royal tradition and have their son christened at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace, because it was smaller and ‘more personal’ than Buckingham Palace.

By contrast, William’s christening in August 1982 was attended by more than 60 guests.

Prince Andrew, who was serving in the Falklands War, and Princess Margaret, who was holidaying in Italy, were the only senior royals not in attendance.
