We wouldn’t expect anyone even vaguely close to the Royal family to be sporting a tattoo, but Donna Air looks set to set pulses in the Palace skyrocketing when they see her posing with a large inking on her shoulder.

However Ms Air, who has been with boyfriend, the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James Middleton, for about a year, has not actually paid a visit to the tattoo parlour.

The 33-year-old has joined with a host of other celebrities including Jameela Jamil and Edith Bowman, to support Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life with powerful and defiant messages temporarily tattooed on their bodies.

With her blonde hair loose and styled in tousled waves the 33-year-old looks radiant in only minimal makeup for the campaign

While the TV and radio presenter recently hinted she will be scaling down her work commitments saying: ‘I set up  two companies recently but I’ve already decided to leave one. I’m busy focusing on my other project and being a mum and girlfriend,’ she obviously felt moved by the importance of the issue.

The words ‘Cancer, we’re coming to get you’ were inked on each of the women’s bodies in individual designs, meant to capture the fighting spirit of Race for Life and give a rallying cry to all women across the UK to sign up.

Jameela Jamil looks incredible in the campaign with dramatic eye make up and a tattoo on her arm in the form of an arrow with a ribbon wrapped round it

Edith Bowman, who had her temporary tattoo on her arm, admits that her participation in the campaign has a personal edge,

Of the campaign, Donna says: ‘I am incredibly proud to be supporting Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life this year. Cancer has affected too many of our loved ones and it’s time to fight back!

'Everyone who runs, walks or sponsors someone at Race for Life events this summer will make a huge difference in the fight to take cancer down.’

The women are encouraging others to sign up to Race for Life to raise money to help fight cancer

Fellow presenter Jameela Jamil, who also appears in the eye-catching campaign, points out:

‘Regardless of your age or how fit you are, everyone can take part or sponsor someone. The money raised is vital to help beat this horrible disease. So gather your girls, sign up, and let’s take the fight to cancer!'

Edith Bowman admits that her participation in the campaign has a personal edge, saying: ‘My family is not alone in being greatly affected by cancer. Sadly, it is something that touches us all but Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life gives us the opportunity to send the defiant message that it is cancer’s turn to be afraid!

'I’m so proud to be supporting Race for Life and urge all women to gather their friends and family and sign up now. Everyone who takes on cancer at Race for Life this summer will be playing their part in beating this terrible disease!’

Every pound raised at almost 300 Race for Life events this summer will help fund vital research to save more lives and help beat cancer sooner.
