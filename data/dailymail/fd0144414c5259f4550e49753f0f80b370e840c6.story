Jurgen Klinsman and his team are becoming increasingly popular.

Playing attractive football, and getting the notoriously 'anti-soccer' American public on their side, they have also attracted admiration and support from various celebrities.

President Barack Obama tweeted: 'In America, we don't settle. We out-hustle the competition. That's who we are. Let's do this @USSoccer!', while his Vice President Joe Biden also offered his support, tweeting a picture with the team and the 
message 'Let's go' shortly before kick-off.

Hollywood
 star Samuel L. Jackson tweeted a picture of his own USMNT shirt, with 
his twitter handle on the back, and the message 'Yall ready??!!!!'

Boxer Oscar de la Hoya had a similar idea, posting a picture of him and his children in their shirts on instagram with the message 'are you ready!'.

De La Hoya, like Jackson, has his twitter handle above the number on the back, while his son was wearing a Clint Dempsey shirt. De la Hoya follows Mike Tyson as boxers backing the team this week, after Tyson gave a rousing pep talk to Klinsmann's men.

Musician Joe Jonas posted a video to his instagram playing with a football in complete national team kit, before remove the red shirt to reveal a white one with 'JONAS 1' on the back.

Actor Robin Williams went for a less serious approach, calling on the team to 'chaaaarrrrrrrge', while NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson sent a message of good luck.

Kobe Bryant waited until the game went into extra time to offer his support, only tweeting once the USA were 2-0 behind.

Former US Secretary of state Madeleine Albright tweeted a picture with a football under her heels and the message 'Keep your eye on the ball'.

As the game wore on support kept coming, with former tennis star Andre Agassi tweeting 'You're in this #USMNT !! KEEP FIGHTING' as both teams pressed for a breakthrough.

Other sporting teams and institutions also lent their support to team USA, with the PGA Tour, Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco 49ers all tweeting.

Even the official account of the US Marines got involved, as the team's #onenationoneteam started trending again.
