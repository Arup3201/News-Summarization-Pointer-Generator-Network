Kevin Pietersen has not wasted a chance since he was sacked a year ago to press his claims for an England recall, but surely national selector James Whitaker has slammed the door in his face.

Responding to the latest whispers, he said: ‘There is no way Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’

Pietersen top scored with a ruthless 66 from only 46 balls in his first appearance in Australia's Big Bash for Melbourne Stars this week.

But it does not seem that he will be returning to the England side soon, despite the World Cup approaching

That, coinciding with his friend Eoin Morgan replacing Alastair Cook as one-day captain, seemed to boost his prospects of an international return with the World Cup on the horizon.

The 34-year-old even entertained the idea on his Twitter page, saying his 'phone is on' and upon the news that Morgan was made captain, tweeted 'I hope I get to play for him.'

But judging by the reaction of Whitaker, it appears both Cook and Pietersen will be free during the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, which starts in February.
