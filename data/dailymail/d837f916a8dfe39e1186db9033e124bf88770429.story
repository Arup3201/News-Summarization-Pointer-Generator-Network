Avoids jail: Zoey Tomlinson, 18, of Manchester, was annoyed by the 20-year-old man's text messages

A teen mother laid a honeytrap for a man trying to woo her by saying she was having a bath at home before letting him in - where he was subjected to an attack by thugs, a court heard.

Zoey Tomlinson, 18, of Gorton, Manchester, was annoyed by the 20-year-old man's text messages and asked friends to warn him off - but the thugs went too far, Manchester Crown Court was told.

They subjected the man to a sustained attack last December in which he was punched, kicked and scalded with hot water. Tomlinson has avoided jail after Wednesday's hearing, but her three friends have been sent to prison.

Tomlinson lured the man to her home after saying she was in the bath and would be 'waiting for him' - and later answered the front door in her pyjamas before beckoning him in, Christopher Beckwith, prosecuting, said.

But her accomplices rushed out and attacked him, as her two-year-old daughter slept upstairs.

Judge Michael Leeming told the court on Wednesday that the 'sustained and unprovoked attack' was 'wholly distressing' for the victim.
