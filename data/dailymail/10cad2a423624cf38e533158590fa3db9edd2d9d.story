A special education teacher murdered in the Connecticut school shootings died just two days after her boyfriend asked her parents for her hand in marriage, it was revealed on Sunday.

Rachel D’Avino, 29, was to be engaged to her longtime boyfriend on Christmas Eve.

She was gunned down by Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman who murdered 27 people  - including 20 first grade students - before taking his own life at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday.

Miss D’Avino was said to have tried to draw the shooter away from children at the school, and was killed in the process.

The Bethlehem, Connecticut, native only started teaching at the elementary school this past fall. 

Her friend Lissa Lovetere, who is also handling her funeral arrangements, said teaching special needs children was a calling for Miss D’Avino.

‘She had that gift, that maternal instinct. She cared for people,’ Ms Lovetere told MailOnline on Sunday. ‘Working with special needs children was her forte,' Lovetere added.

D’Avino worked in special education and had been a therapist for autistic children.

One of her college friends told the LA Times
that: 'She was one of the funniest, loudest, happiest people ever,' 
said the friend, who asked that she remained anonymous out of respect 
for the family.

'She was willing to do absolutely anything for the kids she worked with.'

D’Avino's friend said that she was well-known for dressing up and singing songs to the children during activities.

Rachel D'Avino was a recent arrival at Sandy Hook Elementary School who was described by a friend as one of the 'funniest, loudest, happiest people ever'

'She was an amazing person. We worked together for years, and lived down
the street from each other for longer,' the friend continued.

'She devoted her life
to children.'

The LA Times also reported on a Facebook post by Dr John Molteni, director of the Institute for Autism and Behavioral 
Studies at Saint Joseph College.

D’Avino had been a student in the graduate certificate program at Saint Joseph. Dr Molteni said: 'She was a paraprofessional working with a student with special needs, 
something she had dedicated her life to doing.'

'She had 
just completed her coursework to sit for her certification exam 
on Wednesday.'

The father of one of the children slain in Friday’s Sandy Hook Elementary shooting offered forgiveness to the shooter, saying his love went out to them as well.

Robbie Parker, who lost his six-year-old daughter Emilie in the massacre yesterday said: 'I’d live to offer our deepest condolences to all the families who were directly affected. It’s a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to them.

'This includes the family of the shooter, and I want you to know that our love and support go out to you as well.’

Speaking live on CNN Saturday evening, Mr Parker, 30, was barely maintaining his composure as he spoke of his slain daughter, saying that he was ‘so blessed’ to be her dad.

The 30-year-old physician’s assistant said he wanted to get his message out to the greatest amount of people possible, saying that the medium of television was probably the best way to alert friends and family as to how he and his wife are coping.

‘I’ve been contacted by so many people wanting to know how we’re doing that this might be the best way to share those feelings,’ he said, saying that he extended his condolences to all of the other parents and family members who lost a child in the ‘horrible tragedy.’

In a remarkable turn of grace, Mr Parker also said that he offered condolences to the family of the shooter, Adam Lanza.

‘I want you to know that our love and support go out to you as well,’ he said.

The father then began to tearfully speak of his blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter.

‘My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones giving her love and support to all of the victims, because that’s the kind of person she is,’ he said, pausing a moment to take a steadying breath.

‘As the deep pain begins to settle in our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth.’

Mr Parker spoke of Emilie’s incredible artistic talent, and how she could often be found carrying crayons, markers, and paper to make colorful cards for those having a dark day.
