Workers at an Arizona firearms range desperately tried to save the life of their colleague who had been accidentally shot in the head by a nine-year-old girl. 

In a series of frantic 911 calls, friends of Charles Vacca battled to save his life by applying pressure to his head wound while urging dispatchers to send an emergency helicopter. 

While talking to the emergency services, one worker tries to reassure Vacci: 'Keep breathing brother... the helicopter is on its way.'

Vacca was shot at the Last Stop gun range in White Sands, Arizona, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas 

Although another can be clearly heard saying: 'I don't think he's going to make it.' 

The series of five 911 calls was released by the Mohave County Sheriff's Office who have determined that there should not be any criminal charges as a result of the tragedy. 

Vacca, 39, was shot dead at the Last Stop outdoor shooting range in White Hills, Arizona on August 25. 

During one call, the dispatcher is told that Vacca was unconscious and convulsing, but he was still breathing.

Investigators do not believe that anyone will face criminal charges following last month's tragedy  

A dispatcher urged callers to apply pressure to Vacca's wound while a man could be heard saying, 'Breathe, come on, Charlie.'

Vacca was flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later.

He was standing next to the girl from New Jersey when she squeezed the trigger and the recoil wrenched the Uzi upward toward his head. 

A lawyer speaking on behalf of the nine-year-old girl's parents said the entire family, who are from New Jersey, said they are devastated by what happened during their holiday. 

The shooting range is about 60 miles south of Las Vegas 

The statement came as investigators released police reports and emergency call recordings involving the Aug. 25 shooting of instructor Charles Vacca at the Last Stop range in White Hills, Arizona, about 60 miles south of Las Vegas.

The police reports name the child's parents as Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan and don't list the couple's hometown.

New Jersey-based lawyer Kevin Walsh said the family 'prayed day and night that (Vacca) would survive his injury, and they continue to pray for his family during this terribly difficult time.'

The police reports say that immediately after the shooting, the girl said she felt the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder.

Her family members were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured by the gun's recoil. It took several moments for people to realize that Vacca had been shot by the 9mm sub-machine gun. 

The family had taken a shuttle from Las Vegas to the range. After arriving, the girl, her parents, sister and brother took a monster truck ride before heading to the shooting range.

The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot the gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, the reports state.

He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Vacca with a shot to the head, according to the reports.

The girl dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl ran toward her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder.

Another instructor rushed over to help to Vacca. The other children were then taken away from the range. 

Recordings of emergency calls show that people at the shooting range desperately tried to keep the unconscious Vacca alive as they urged police dispatchers to send a medical helicopter.

A dispatcher urged callers to apply pressure to Vacca's wound.

Vacca was flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later.

Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case. Arizona's workplace safety agency is investigating the death.

County prosecutors say the instructor was probably the most criminally negligent person involved in the accident for having allowed the child to hold the gun without enough training. They also said the parents and child weren't criminally culpable.

The girl's mother had video-recorded the accident on her phone.

'All right, go ahead and give me one shot,' Vacca tells the girl in part of the video released by investigators. He then cheers when she fires one round at the target.

'All right full auto,' Vacca says. The video, which does not show Vacca being shot, ends with a series of shots being heard.

Sam Scarmardo, the range's operator, has said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules. 

He also said he never had a safety problem before at the range and his policy of allowing children eight and older to fire guns under adult supervision and an instructor's watchful eye is standard industry practice, though he noted his policies are under review.

Vacca's ex-wife and children have said they harbor no ill feelings toward the girl or her family. Instead, they feel sorry for the child and want to comfort her.
