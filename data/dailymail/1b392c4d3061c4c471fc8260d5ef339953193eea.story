Scenes of rape, mutilation and murder have earned it a reputation as the Bard’s bloodiest play.

And at Tuesday night’s performance of Titus Andronicus, one gruesome moment brought audience members to their knees.

As
 Lavinia – whose tongue and hands are cut off after she is raped – 
appeared on stage at Shakespeare’s Globe, five people fainted, while 
others complained of feeling sick and fearing sleepless nights.

With scenes of rape, mutilation, murder and 
cannibalism the play has earned the reputation of being the Bard's 
bloodiest tragedy 

As Lavinia ¿ whose tongue and hands are cut off after she is raped ¿ appeared on stage, five people fainted, while others complained of feeling sick and fearing sleepless nights

The play, a revival of Lucy Bailey's 
2006 production, opened the Globe 2014 season with the offer of 
witnessing 'one of the darkest and most seminal production's in the 
Globe's history'.

Audience members were warned in advance that the production would be 'grotesquely violent and daringly experimental'.

It is described as a ‘terrible cycle of mutilation, rape and murder’.

In 2006, at the height of summer dozens of people who bought standing tickets are said to have fainted at each show.

Actress Flora Spencer-Longhurst who plays Lavinia in the current production, cut a terrifying figure in a bloody gown.

A Globe spokesman said: ‘We had five people faint during a particularly gory scene.

'Fainting
 isn’t exactly uncommon amongst Globe groundlings [those with £5 
standing tickets] so our front-of-house staff are very well trained. 

‘Shakespeare
 definitely didn’t pull any punches... it is a brutally violent play and
 this production is a bloody, exhilarating, incense-laden feast for the 
senses. But not one for the squeamish.’

Miss
 Spencer-Longhurst, said: 'Despite my character having her tongue ripped
 out it is the most articulate role I have ever played.'

The gruesome scenes provoked a flurry of reviews on Twitter, with audience members sharing their thoughts at the evening's production.

Spencer-Longhurst as Lavinia, is a revival of Lucy Bailey's 2006

Writer
 Helen Chandler, tweeted after the performance: 'Two people fainted at 
this evening's performance of Titus Andronicus at The Globe. Best value 
entertainment in London by a bloody mile.'

Another,
 Laura Hutchison, said: 'Definitely feeling a few violent dreams coming 
on after watching the bloodbath that is Titus Andronicus @The— Globe 
this evening ...'

Hannah 
Hughes, a photographic assistant living in London, said: 'Titus 
Andronicus @The—Globe — so much sunlight, SO MUCH BLOOD.'

Steve Slack, a museum consultant from 
London, said: 'Titus Andronicus as @The—Globe has so much blood there 
have been quite a few 'droppers'* this evening. *official Globe 
terminology.'

Shakespeare's tragedy is set in the days of the Roman Empire, and tells the story of the Roman general Titus.

It
 features a scene where Titus murders the sons of his rival Tamora, 
Queen of the Goths, before feeding their remains to her in a pie.

The Globe describes the play as having been written with a 'ghoulish energy Shakespeare was never to repeat elsewhere'.
