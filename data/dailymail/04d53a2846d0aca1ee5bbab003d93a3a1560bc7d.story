Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley, 57, took his own life months after his wife Margaret died of a brain tumour

A Falklands War hero who was decorated by the Queen for saving wounded comrades has taken his own life months after his wife died of a brain tumour.

Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley, 57, placed the last love letter ever written to him by childhood sweetheart Margaret on his bed before hanging himself.

The retired paratrooper took his life in June this year days after the anniversary of the Battle of Goose Green when 10 of his comrades died and he dodged gunfire to save an eleventh.

He was said to have grown increasingly upset on the 32nd anniversary and sent a series of texts, before writing a letter to his wife saying: 'I can't wait to go away this weekend with you.' 

The decorated soldier had been married to Mrs Bardsley for 33 years after meeting when they were both 10 years old and they had three children together.

But his life began to crumble when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2013 and died last December aged 56, an inquest heard.

Their eldest daughter, Catherine Disbury, 32, told the hearing how Mr Bardsley became a full time carer for his wife but her illness came as a 'terrible blow'.

She said the former soldier turned champion bodybuilder began to drink heavily and told his family: 'when your mum goes, I will follow'.

He had served with the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and in 1982 was embroiled in the deadly battle for Goose Green during the Falklands conflict.

Ten of his comrades were killed in the fighting but despite being forced to retreat by Argentinian soldiers he dodged gunfire and risked his own life to rescue an eleventh as he lay wounded.

He received a Military Medal for bravery in battle on land and was later awarded the United States Bronze Star Medal in 1993 for 'exceptionally meritorious achievements' in the first Gulf War.

Mr Bardsley then won a British Empire Medal before leaving the forces in 2001 and running his own gym. 

He kept his medals in a bedroom drawer at home and later sold then in 2012 for £118,000.

Ms Disbury told the hearing how he kept saying he did not want to be alive and just wanted to be with their mother.

He even stopped taking medication for an existing heart condition with the hope that he would have a heart attack.

'I was seriously worried about his well-being. It was clear from his behaviour he was not in a good place and was angry. He was talking about the Falklands. I think it was the anniversary of the Falklands or of Goose Green,' said Ms Disbury.

A few days before his death he said: 'I am a machine that won't or cannot be broken until I decide to turn it off.'

One text said: 'I am about as interesting as a garden slug these days but I used to have my moments. I am still drinking. It's not big, not clever but it works for me.'

Another text read: 'I need to un**** myself before we end up burying another Bardsley.'

In a statement she said her father had told her he had buried 10 men on the day of the battle and was 'very upset when he said it.'

She said that since leaving the Army he felt he was a 'nobody' and felt as he got older he had no purpose in life.

When asked his name he quoted Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley only to add: 'I used to be but now I am nobody.'

'When I was informed that he had taken his own life I was shocked but I was surprised it had taken this long after the death of my mum,' she said.

'He thought that now my sisters and I had grown up and my mum had gone nobody needed him. It was not obviously how we felt.'

Mr Bardsley's close friend Jason Cunningham, a fireman, told the inquest: 'He said he wanted to end his life to be with Margaret and he said it quite a lot.'

The Military Medal (MM) was awarded for acts of gallantry and devotion to duty under fire to personnel of the British Army and other services. 

It was discontinued in 1993 and since then the Military Cross has been awarded to personnel of all ranks within the British honours system. 

The medal bears the inscription 'For Bravery In The Field' in four lines, surrounded by a laurel wreath.

It is the second highest military bravery honour behind the Victoria Cross. 

He tried to text Mr Bardsley but when he got no response went his home in Moston and found his body next to a note from his wife.

It said: 'I just wanted you to know I love you all the world and more. I can't wait to go away this weekend with you.' 

Police also recovered a series of text messages from his phone, one which said: 'I am about as interesting as a garden slug these days but I used to have my moments. I am still drinking. It's not big, not clever but it works for me.' 

Another text read 'I need to un**** myself before we end up burying another Bardsley.'

Assistant Coroner for Manchester, Nick Stanage recorded a conclusion of suicide and said: 'It is clear to me that sadly the evidence in this case goes only one way. I offer my sincere condolences for such a difficult loss.'

Speaking after the inquest Miss Disbury said: 'He had three big medals and for a time was the most decorated Non Commissioned Officer in all the British army. We all had a great relationship with him. We were all great friends. We played a lot of sport together and he would come and watch me play hockey.

'Our mother was a very healthy lady and she played hockey right up to a few years ago. She was diagnosed with a brain tumour and shortly after we found out it was terminal. After about three months she deteriorated. My parents were childhood sweethearts and he just struggled to cope without her.

'I don't think his death it was a spur of the moment thing but something that happened in a bad moment.

'Dad was extremely brave, dedicated and loyal but he just struggled with the loss of my mum and he felt he didn't have any purpose. We had a great upbringing, travelling all over the world. He still used to come watch me play hockey. He was a really proud man.'
