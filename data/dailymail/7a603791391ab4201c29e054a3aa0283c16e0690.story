A woman has been slapped with a fine for supplying alcohol to a nine-year-old boy in New Zealand after shocking footage emerged of the youngster drinking bourbon, stumbling and slurring his speech.

Lucy Teari Winnie Snowden, also known as Franklin, 25, was fined $1,000 Hamilton District Court this morning by Judge David Ruth in the Hamilton District Court following a judge-alone trial yesterday, stuff.co.nz reported.

Delivering his decision, Judge Ruth said the boy could have died drinking the type and amount of alcohol that he consumed in January at the Fairfield Skate Park in Hamilton, New Zealand.

Three people were charged with supplying the nine-year-old with alcohol, but one man had his charges dropped

In the footage shot by a man at the Fairfield skate park in New Zealand, the boy is seen unsteady on his feet and slurring his words

The 25-year-old denied she gave the boy the alcohol with her lawyer saying the boy took it from Snowden's bag sitting on a front porch.

Kali Tiloi, also 25, was fined $750 on Thursday for supplying alcohol while charges were dropped against third defendant Michael King, 27, as the judge ruled there was no 'reliable evidence' New Zealand's 3 News reported.

Tiloi appeared before the court via video link while he was serving time for another matter.

In the video, the boy is seen stumbling around and slurring his speech like a drunk while sipping on a can of pre-mixed alcohol.

Giving evidence at court, the boy said he had spent the night vomiting after consuming two half-cans and two full cans of the 8 per cent mixer as well as shots.

The video was captured at the park in Fairfield on New Zealand's North Island and was later turned in to police by the good Samaritan who filmed it.

A judge at Hamilton District Court ruled there was not enough evidence that Michael King gave the child the alcohol

When a man off camera tries to take the boy's can of Cody's, a bourbon and cola mix drink, he protests and pulls it away from his grasp.

A group of children hanging around the boy start abusing the cameraman and his friend.

But another attempt to grab the can off the nine-year-old is successful. The boy then slumps against the wall and slides to a seated position on the ground.

A girl, who appears to be friends with him, is then asked by the cameraman: 'Who gave him the Cody's?'.

She replied her aunt gave him the booze, but refused to give him the name of alleged supplier.

The cameraman then asks the boy who is now standing and swaying: 'Are you alright?'

But the boy who appears to be heavily intoxicated does not answer the question.

While Kali Tiloi pleaded guilty and fined $750 and Lucy Snowden's fate will be handed down on Friday

The man then asks the nine-year-old boy, who looks like he was having trouble staying on his feet while mounting his scooter, the name of the person who gave him the alcohol.

In slurred speech, the boy gives him the name before taking off.

'You can't ride a scooter when you're drunk and you're nine years old,' the cameraman calls after him.

The trio were charged over the January incident when video showing the nine-year-old drunk surfaced and went viral.

The skate park where the incident occurred in January was located in Fairfield, a suburb in the city of Hamilton on New Zealand's North Island
