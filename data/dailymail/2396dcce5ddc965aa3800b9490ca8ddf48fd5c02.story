It is among the most charming sights to be found in a British summer garden — birds fluttering down onto a bird bath. But who can really say they’ve ever had clear sight of a robin having a rinse, a woodpecker washing or a blue tit mid-dip?

After all, it’s all over in seconds so the best most of us can hope for with the naked eye is just a glimpse of a blurry splash. Unless you happen to be Kim Taylor. For the eagle-eyed ex-government biologist spends up to eight hours a day taking these incredible images.

He has designed and made specialist fast-aperture camera equipment which enables him to capture a photograph in a 15,000th of a second in his garden in Albury, Surrey.

Mirror image: A robin takes a cautious look around before entering the bath for a wash

A quick flutter: In lightning-fast movements, a mistle thrush flaps its wings to spray water on its back

Flying visit: A young great spotted woodpecker complete with its red crown

Splashing out: This young blue tit looks rather apprehensive as it tries bathing for the first time

Tweet of the day: A blackbird shakes his feathers to create a remarkable fountain of droplets

Local colour: The beautiful yellow and red plumage of a goldfinch stands out in sharp relief

Causing a ripple: A siskin, with its vivid yellow-green feathers, takes a drink

Twitch and you'll miss it: Kim Taylor waits patiently for the next visitor

‘You just press the shutter and hope,’ 
said Mr Taylor yesterday. ‘The action is so fast you cannot tell whether
 you’re going to get a good shot until you see the image.

‘Every time, you think you are going to get something better than you got before. It just gets you hooked.’

He can take only one picture every ten seconds, so patience is essential because the camera needs time to reset.

Mr Taylor, 81, who hides behind a screen in his dining room to mask him from the birds’ view while he snaps away through a gap, said: ‘When they bathe, they shake their head in the water, throw water on their back and then flutter their wings.

'I like to watch young birds trying to bathe for the first time because they are never quite sure what they should do. They jump in and panic, before taking off.'

Mr Taylor, who runs a specialist animal photography business called Warren Photographic, said: ‘When I started, I wanted to photograph animals in action, which required specialist flash equipment to freeze the motion of the subject.

‘You couldn’t do that with the normal equipment that was out there, so I designed and built some myself.’
