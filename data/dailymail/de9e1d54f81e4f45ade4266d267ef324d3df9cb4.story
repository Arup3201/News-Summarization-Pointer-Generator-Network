As the editor in chief of fashion bible Vogue it is no surprise that Anna Wintour is bang up-to-date on the season's biggest trends.

The magazine editor embraced the hottest colour of the summer as she attended day one of the U.S. Open wearing a scarlet dress to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

The 64-year-old tennis fan was incredibly chic in the flared midi dress, which she teamed with nude Manolo Blahnik shoes, statement jewels and her trademark coiffed bob.

Lady in red: Anna Wintour wore the hottest colour of the season as she attended day one of the U.S. Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center

Anna, 64. who reportedly starts each day with a vigorous 5:45am tennis match at the Midtown Tennis Club in New York where hourly rates start at $80 (£48), will have seen Simona Halep, Maria Sharapova and Andy Murray claim victories on the court on Monday.

And there's no doubt she'll be keen to return today, if her schedule allows, to cheer on her good friend Roger Federer, who will take on Australia's Marinko Matosevic at the Arthur Ashe stadium this afternoon.

Anna recently nominated the tennis pro to take part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

Fashion's most notorious ice queen surprised pretty much everyone by accepting her daughter Bee Shaffer's nomination to undergo the ALS ice bucket challenge.

'I Anna Wintour, with my family, accept my daughter Bee's ALS ice bucket challenge, and I nominate Roger Federer and Dominic West,' the steely editor states in the video, which was posted to the publication's Facebook page from her Hamptons home in Mastic.

Immaculately dressed as always, Ms Wintour's assembled family then proceeded to launch several huge buckets of ice over her where, in a rare move, she breaks her usual stoic demeanour and squeals as the freezing water drenches her famous bob.

Within an hour, the Vogue video had gained over 4,671 'likes' on the social media network, and countless outpourings of disbelief from the fashion industry.
