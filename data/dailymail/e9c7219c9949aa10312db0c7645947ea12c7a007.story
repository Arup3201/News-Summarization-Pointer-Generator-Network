Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix 

It seems incredible to think Sepang has been hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix since 1999, but it appears one of Herman Tilke's circuit designs has actually become part of the furniture on the F1 calendar.

Sepang's sweeping nature can be a challenge to the drivers, but the biggest factor that can have an outcome on the race is the highly unpredictable weather which can leave plans and strategy in absolute ruins.

In the past, race day always threw up a challenge whatever the conditions. If it wasn't the flash storm catching out the drivers, it was the hot and extremely humid sun which sapped the energy from the drivers.

A later start time since 2009 has limited the factor played by the sun, but race day tends to be an exciting affair as Sportsmail looks back at the archive and memories from the Malaysian Grand Prix. 

For Albert Park memories I included a quiz half-way down the page but this week we will start with one. The Sepang Circuit hasn't changed its layout since the first race in 1999 but in which year was this overhead shot of the track taken? (Answer at the bottom of the page)

'Not only is Michael the best No 1 driver - he is also the best No 2.' Eddie Irvine (right) knew exactly who to thank after he won the first ever Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999. Michael Schumacher dominated the race after returning from a mid-season leg break, and allowed Irvine to win to aid his title bid. Mika Hakkinen (bottom left) finished third but would go on to win the 1999 world championship

Leading the pack under the safety car and heading into the final corner is Michael Schumacher ahead of Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello in 2000. Schumacher would go on to win the race with Barrichello finishing third behind the McLaren of David Coulthard

Schumacher had already been crowned world champion in 2000, but the double Ferrari podium allowed the team to clinch the constructors' championship. Here both drivers (with THAT red hair) celebrate with test driver Luca Badoer (right) and team boss Jean Todt (bottom right)

The 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix was a joyous occasion for Ferrari, but it was the end of the road for Johnny Herbert who driving for Jaguar competed in his final race. The Brit's sad eyes appear to reflect that an 11-year career as an F1 driver was about to come to an end

Legend has it that the 2001 Minardi was so slow that Fernando Alonso needed a push up the hill from a track marshall to make it round the circuit during qualifying. Giancarlo Fisichella passes in his Benetton Renault which fared little better performance wise over the season

Race day in 2001 was hit by a flash storm, and clever tactics by Ferrari saw them change tyres at the right time before claiming a one-two with Schumacher (front) leading home Barrichello. It was the first year where the race took place in its now traditional early-season slot

Juan Pablo Montoya (complete with a Ferrari nosecone for company) runs his Williams off the circuit in 2002 after a collision with Michael Schumacher. Despite the Colombian not being at fault for the clash, it was he who would pick up a controversial drive-through penalty

A quick glance in his mirror at the first corner and Giancarlo Fisichella will be stunned to find his team-mate Takuma Sato climbing all over the back of his Jordan in 2002. This was just one lap after Schumacher and Montoya collided

Benefiting most from the Montoya-Schumacher incident was Ralf Schumacher who led home a Williams one-two in 2002. It proved a false dawn for the team as Ferrari went on to win 14 of the following 15 races during the campaign

Heinz-Harald Frentzen appears to be a little distracted as Miss India of 2001, Celina Jaitley, sits on the front tyre of his Sauber in 2003

Antonio Pizzonia had clearly learned nothing from Takuma Sato's first-corner antics in 2002 when he took to the air a year later in his Jaguar. Unfortunately it was the Williams of Juan Pablo Montoya who was again the innocent victim as his rear wing takes the full force of the impact

Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello waves hello to the future of Formula One after McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen celebrates his first ever grand prix win in 2003. Joining the pair is Renault's Fernando Alonso (who started from pole position) and was also celebrating his first podium in the sport 

Drink up, Jenson! The 2004 season was all about Michel Schumacher's dominance but a sub-plot from it was the emergence of Button who here celebrates his first Formula One podium with second-placed Montoya (left) and race winner Schumacher

Another Malaysian Grand Prix, and another Williams taking a battering. This time it is in the final corner heading into the pit-straight as Mark Webber collides with Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault - putting both out of the race - which was won by the Italian's team-mate, Fernando Alonso

Having been at fault the previous year for the crash with Webber, Fisichella (left) stormed back in 2006 to take his final career win. The Italian led home Alonso in a Renault one-two with the duo celebrating with team boss Flavio Briatore

Fernando Alonso will mark his McLaren return by making his second debut with the team this weekend, but he's already driven at Sepang for the outfit back in 2007. Here the Spaniard tackles a fast double right hander with the iconic start-finish stadium section in the background

It wasn't often that you found Alonso and Hamilton looking happy in the same picture during 2007 but here they are all smiles for McLaren following a one-two led home by the double world champion. Hamilton's second place finish came after a third on his debut in Melbourne

Kimi Raikkonen was world champion, but here it's Felipe Massa leading the Ferrari cars round the first corner of the 2008 grand prix. Raikkonen would win the race with his team-mate retiring, but it was the Brazilian who would lead Ferrari's title charge during the season

The track is dry for now but not for long as dark clouds loom over Sepang during the 2009 race. Here Nico Rosberg pilots his Williams around the first corner in front of Jarno Trulli's Toyota and the Brawn of Jenson Button

As a monsoon hit the track, Button took advantage to storm to the front ahead of Toyota's Timo Glock (who would finish third). As conditions became too severe, the race was halted after just 31 laps with Button pronounced the winner and all drivers receiving half-points

Michael Schumacher retired after just nine laps with a wheel fault for Mercedes in 2010 and there appears to be no shortage of marshalls offering a lift back to the paddock for the seven-time world champion following his return to the sport after three seasons away

It's usually a one-finger salute from Sebastian Vettel after he wins a race, but he isn't celebrating second place here. The world champion has just recorded two straight wins at the start of 2011 in a season he would go on to dominate before claiming his second world title

All eyes were on Sergio Perez in 2012 after the Sauber driver narrowly missed out on a famous win having made a late error in trying to catch and pass Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton congratulates the Mexican on a fine drive to finish second. At the end of the season, it would be Perez replacing the Brit at the Woking outfit following Hamilton's departure to Mercedes

Well this isn't the happiest podium you will ever see. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton is sensing the tension in the air after race winner Sebastian Vettel (centre) controversially ignored team orders by passing team-mate Mark Webber during the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Vettel and Hamilton look on at Webber during the champagne 'celebration' as the furious Australian hit-out at his team-mate for ignoring the now infamous 'multi-21' order - a team call that indicated the Red Bull drivers held position with Webber in front of Vettel

It was easier for Hamilton to celebrate on the podium in 2014 as he stormed to his first victory of the season ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg
