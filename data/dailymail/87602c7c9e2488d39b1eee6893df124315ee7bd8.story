A couple has revealed they were offered baby Gammy, the Down syndrome boy who was caught in the middle of an international surrogacy scandal, by the same agency Gammy's Australian parents  used.

The ABC has revealed the extreme measures that David and Wendy Farnell, from Bunbury, Western Australia, as well as the Thailand Surrogacy agency, considered using to 'get rid' of the unwanted infant.

It has been revealed the agency tried to give Gammy to Kim and Brendan Cross, also from Australia, who had been struggling to conceive a child for years and had turned to Thai surrogacy officials for help.

Gammy is an eight month old baby who was abandoned in Bangkok by his surrogate parents - the Farnells - when they found out he had Down syndrome. They have always denied abandoning him, insisting they were forced to flee with his healthy twin sister, Pipah, before Thai authorities tightened surrogacy laws.

Ms Cross told ABC 'We contacted probably at least a dozen agencies over here (in Thaliand) before we went with this one because this one was - well, it had an American owner, which we thought we’d be safe with, and it said clearly on their website that their doctors had been, some of their doctors had been, trained through Sydney IVF.'

The Cross's were clients of Thailand Surrogacy for two years when they received an email from the company asking if they wanted Gammy, according to the ABC's 7.30 program.

'The email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves. My assumption of why I was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child.

'That’s just my opinion' she said, 'but of course we can’t accept someone else's child.

'We did see it as a genuine offer to have the baby. We were mortified, could not believe that someone would go through a process like this and give birth to a beautiful baby boy, regardless of if he had Down syndrome or not – he is their flesh and blood.'

The Cross couple are now proud parents of four week old Braxton, born via a Thai surrogate and egg donor.

The Cross couple said the offer was one of several proposals from American Antonio Frattaroli, the boss of Surrogacy Thailand, who has gone to ground since the story went global.

The ABC reported that Mr Frattaroli denies any knowledge of Gammy being offered to another Australian couple and he is shocked by the suggestion.

The ABC also spoke with a colleague of Mr Frattaroli, who said that the baby's biological father Mr Farnell had asked for the baby to be bleft outside a Thai temple.

'He did not want the baby. He just wanted to do anything so that he would not have that baby,' she said.

Mr Farnell has previously denied that he wanted the child aborted.

The surrogacy worker alleges he asked: 'There is a normal one, can I take the normal one?

'Can you leave the abnormal one at the temple? Can you leave him in Bangkok? Nobody will know about this'

She says the company denied his proposal, and reportedly showed an email to ABC which showed Mr Frattaroli said:

'They beg me to drop baby Gammy at the temple at night and run away. They told me, 'don't worry, Antonio, the monk will take care of the baby.'
