The 23-year-old will be hoping to prove his fitness to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers for the new season, particularly with star striker Luis Suarez subject to a proposed £80million transfer to Barcelona.

Borini spent last season on loan at Sunderland and was key to helping the Black Cats stay up, scoring 10 goals for Gus Poyet's side.
