They're the tiny insects we often swat away or spray with repellent.

But nature-loving snapper Boris Godfroid has used macro photography to bring to life the secret world of bees, wasps, flies and other creepy crawlies, revealing the fascinating shapes and colors of tiny bugs.

The former biology student's luminous close-up shots, posted to his website boris.godfroidbrothers.be, captures a bee bathing in pollen, a mantis resting on a hibiscus flower in Guatemala and a crab spider attacking a caterpillar on the petals of a beautiful flower.

‘All photos are taken from live insects 
in their natural habitat with natural colors,' he said. 'The distance 
between my camera and the subject is about three centimeters, so you 
have to be very careful approaching the insects.’

The Belgium resident picked up his first camera on his 16th birthday.

He says on his website he used his small 'compact camera', which he received as a
gift, for several months before upgrading to a DSLR.

Seeking to 'expand his boundaries', the self-taught shooter bought a D700 with movie-making capability two years later.

But Godfroid, keen to broaden his horizons, has expanded his impressive portfolio with moving images.

For
his final film school project, the photographer filmed snails, insects 
and other micro-fauna creeping through a rain-soaked mini-forest he 
built inside a tiny studio.

The
four minute documentary 'Life on Moss', uploaded to Vimeo, was shot in 
an afternoon and night with a Nikon D7000 and a couple of lights, 
according to petapixel.com.

Godfroid
used a few hundred pounds of bricks and covered a spare room with moss 
to film the tiny creatures in their natural habitat.
