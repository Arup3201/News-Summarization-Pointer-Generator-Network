French lawyer Frank Samson, 47, who is set to play Napoleon, said the French dictator was the real hero of Waterloo, despite suffering a crushing defeat

It is not so much a bid to rewrite history as a blatant attempt at match-rigging.

For the French are claiming that Napoleon – not Wellington – was the true hero of Waterloo.

In a reconstruction to mark this year’s bicentenary of the battle, they plan to ignore the fact that he emerged utterly defeated. 

Instead, they want to portray the French emperor as the winner over a ‘frightful’ English nobody.

But the sabre-rattling ahead of the commemorations in Belgium this summer was quickly dismissed by historians.

The first salvo was fired by French lawyer Frank Samson, who will play Napoleon in the re-enactment.

The 47-year-old, taking massive liberties with history, claimed that while Napoleon was ‘one of the greatest men the world has ever known’, the Duke of Wellington – who led the Allied army to a famous victory – was a ‘frightful Englishman that no one has heard of’.

He added: ‘In terms of public relations, in terms of his historical importance, it’s clear that [Napoleon] won at Waterloo. The public will acclaim him and we have forgotten that he lost.’

However, historian and broadcaster James Holland said Mr Samson’s views were ‘clearly very stupid’. He said: ‘The fact is that Napoleon lost at Waterloo, and not only was that the end of his military career, it was the end of his political career as well. 

'On the other hand, Wellington’s military career was enhanced by Waterloo and his political career began and he went on to be Prime Minister of Great Britain. 

'Napoleon was a dictator whose actions caused the death of hundreds of thousands. Wellington was merely trying to stop a murderous despot from taking over Europe.

‘There’s no question Napoleon’s stature and influence in the world was enormous. But it could be argued his legacy to France has not been 100 per cent helpful, whereas on the back of Wellington we became the greatest empire the world has ever known.’

Taking large liberties with historical fact, Mr Samson claimed Napoleon was 'one of the greatest men the world has ever known', while Nelson was 'a frightful Englishman no one has heard of' 

Saul David, professor of military history at the University of Buckingham, said the French disdain for Wellington – ‘one of the two or three greatest generals in history’ – may be because he was leading an allied army containing not only British but also Dutch and Prussians. 

The 200th anniversary of Waterloo, on June 18, will be marked by a two-day re-enactment on the battlefield, just south of Brussels, with 5,000 soldiers, 300 horses and 100 cannon.

Wellington will be played by New Zealander Alan Larsen, 54. Chief organiser Etienne Claude denied that Napoleon would emerge as the victor, saying: ‘We’re not mad enough for that.’ 

And Mr Samson, who has played Napoleon in 189 reconstructions of Waterloo, admitted: ‘I’ve lost every time.’
