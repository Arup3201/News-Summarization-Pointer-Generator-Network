Sydney cafe siege gunman Man Haron Monis forced several of his hostages to record chilling video messages which were uploaded to YouTube before the terror attack came to a dramatic close.

At least three female captives were forced to read Monis' list of demands - which included a phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister, a public declaration that the attack was being carried out by Islamic State terrorists, and the delivery of an Islamic State flag to the Lindt chocolate cafe.

The clearly terrified hostages - including Westpac executive Marcia Mikhael,42, and  Selina Win Pe - were forced to sit in front of banner adorned with Islamic slogans while reading from what appeared to be a pre-prepared script expressing their faux-bewilderment at why Monis' demands had not yet been met.

Despite the area around the cafe being under police lockdown, Monis was able to temporarily upload his videos to YouTube before having his account suspended and the footage removed.

Hostage: The other two videos uploaded to YouTube also feature women listing Monis' demands

The first video shows a woman wearing a black and white patterned blouse who identifies herself as 'one of the many hostages' held at the Lindt chocolate cafe in Martin Place, Sydney city centre.

'We had three specific requests and none of them have been met,' the woman says, speaking quickly and looking anxious. 'One [request] is to send an IS [Islamic State] flag as quickly as possible and one hostage will be released,' she adds.

The woman goes on to list Monis' demands, which include: 'To please broadcast to all media that this is an attack on Australia by the Islamic State. And number three is that we need [Australian Prime Minister] Tony Abbot to contact The Brother on a live feed and five hostages will be released.'

Her reference to 'The Brother' is a clear indication that Monis was using the name as a kind of nom de guerre throughout the siege.

Marcia Mikhael, a Westpac bank executive who had called in for her morning coffee on Monday, was forced to record a chilling video message in which she was forced to act shocked that the terrorist's demands hadn't been met while sat in front of black banner adorned with Islamic slogans

After listing Monis' demands, the woman goes on to claim that the jihadi has planted three bombs in the area surrounding the cafe. Police later stated that this claim, which Monis also made during conversations with hostage negotiators, was not true.

The other two videos uploaded to YouTube from within the Lindt chocolate cafe also feature women listing Monis' demands - two of which are related to the Islamic State terror group.

As in the first video, the second and third clips also show the terrified women being forced to act shocked that the terrorist's demands hadn't been met, while continuing to request Australian Prime Minister make contact with 'The Brother' using some sort of digital live feed. 

In each video, the hands of a man wearing a white jumper or T-shirt can be seen holding an Arabic-language religious banner behind the women, although his face is never seen.

While the siege was taking place, Monis managed to temporarily upload the video footage to YouTube before it was briefly taken down.

Hostages run away from the cafe after Australian police stormed the building and shot Man Haron Monis dead

The 17-hour siege came to an end with Monis and two of his hostages dead, and four more suffering injuries after police stormed the building and a dramatic and chaotic firefight ensured.

Earlier in the day reporters claimed to be able to see the terrorist wandering around inside the cafe holding a tablet computer. The device is likely to have been used to post the video clips online. 

The 17-hour siege came to an end with Monis and two of his hostages dead, and four more suffering injuries after heavily armed police stormed the building and a dramatic and chaotic firefight ensured. 

New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said 17 hostages had now been accounted for. 

He urged people not to 'speculate' or 'develop theories' about what happened inside the cafe and said police believed more lives could have been lost if officers had not entered the cafe at that point.

A 34-year-old woman and 38-year-old man have died in the aftermath of the siege.

Of the injured, two women have non life-threatening injuries and a police officer was injured by gunshot pellets, the police said. Another woman has a gunshot wound to the shoulder. 

Live television coverage earlier showed at least two people being taken away from the scene on stretchers, while one hostage was seen being carried out of the building. She appeared to be in pain and blood flowed down her legs.
