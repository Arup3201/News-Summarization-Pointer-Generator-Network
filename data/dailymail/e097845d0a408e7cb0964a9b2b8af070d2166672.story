The driver who was at the controls of a speeding commuter train which derailed killing four people has been suspended without pay.

Engineer William Rockefeller claims he fell into 'a hypnosis-like daze' when his Metro North train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of New York while travelling at 82 mph.

Today rail bosses confirmed the 46-year-old had been suspended immediately after the derailment and following a drug test, in line with railroad policy, according to NBCnews.

Under scrutiny: Rockefeller initially told investigators that the brakes didn't work but then he later said that he may have 'dozed off' behind the wheel on the Sunday morning shift

Earlier his lawer Jeffrey Chartier 
accompanied Mr Rockefeller to his interview with National Transportation
 Safety Board investigators and described the account his client had 
given.

Chartier said the 
engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the 
phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long 
it lasted.

What Rockefeller remembers is 
‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still 
clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting 
the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he
 hit the brakes.’

Suspended: Train driver William Rockefeller is wheeled on a stretcher away from the area where the commuter train he was operating derailed in the Bronx borough of New York

Nodded: An attorney who accompanied Rockefeller to his meeting with the National Transportation Safety Board said the engineer has now revealed he nodded off just prior to the crash and awoke when it was too late to brake

He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’

‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’

Rockefeller
 ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail 
employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him.

‘He
 had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico 
said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that 
might be.’

Terror: The Metro-North train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in New York City, derailing and coming to a halt feet from the Hudson River

Getting answers: Federal investigators have determined that there was nothing technically wrong with the train's brakes before the Sunday morning crash but came short of fully blaming the conductor

Investigators have determined earlier that the
 deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with 
the train itself as the driver had originally claimed.

The
 National Transportation Safety Board said in a Tuesday press conference
 that it hadn't found any evidence of brake or signal trouble during the
 train's nine previous stops along New York's Hudson River on Sunday 
morning.

NTSB member Earl 
Weener said Tuesday there were 'no anomalies' with the train but it was 
too soon to formally say whether the excessive speed was the result of 
human error- say, a sleepy or distracted operator- or a mechanical 
problem.

While investigators had yet to finish talking with engineer William Rockefeller, questions swirled around him because the train went into the curve at nearly three times the speed limit.

Dozens of people were injured and four people were killed.

As
 NTSB worked to determine what caused the Sunday morning wreck in the 
Bronx, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Rockefeller should be disciplined for 
'unjustifiable' speed.

Investigators began talking to the engineer Monday but didn't complete the interview.

The
 New York Police Department is conducting its own investigation, with 
help from the Bronx district attorney's office, in the event the 
derailment becomes a criminal case.

Whatever the findings on the cause of the crash, Cuomo said Tuesday the engineer could be faulted for the train's speed alone.

Recovery: Federal investigators wouldn't comment on Rockefeller's level of alertness around the time of the Sunday morning wreck, which killed 4. Shown are recovery operations in the Bronx on Monday

'Certainly, we want to make sure that that operator is disciplined in an appropriate way. There's such a gross deviation from the norm,' the Governor said.

An attorney for Rockefeller didn't immediately return calls Tuesday, but his union spoke up in his defense.

'This is a man who is totally distraught by the loss of life, and he's having a tough time dealing with that,' said Anthony Bottalico, his union leader.

'Once the NTSB is done with their investigation and Billy is finished with his interview, it will be quite evident that there was no criminal intent with the operation of his train,' Bottalico said.

Rockefeller had an unblemished record prior to the accident but told investigators after the crash that he had 'zoned out'.

The engineer, who is married with no children, has worked for the railroad for about 20 years and has been an engineer for 11, Bottalico said. 

Critical: Governor Cuomo, seen at the crash site on Sunday alongside NTSB's Weener, has now said that the engineer will undoubtedly be punished for the 'unjustifiable' speed as he was going 82mph in a 30mph zone

Rockefeller lives in a well-kept house on a modest rural road in Germantown, N.Y., about 40 miles south of Albany.

He started as a custodian at Grand Central Terminal, then monitored the building's fire alarms and other systems, and ultimately became an engineer.

Rockefeller's work routine had recently changed: he had begun running that route on November 17, two weeks before the wreck, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North's parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Bottalico said Rockefeller had changed
 work schedules- switching from afternoons to the day shift, which 
typically begins at 5am- but was familiar with the route and qualified 
to run it.

'He was a stellar
 employee. Unbelievable,' said his former supervisor, Michael McLendon, 
who retired from the railroad about a year ago.

McLendon
 said he was stunned when he heard about the crash, shortly after 
opening his mail to find a Christmas card from Rockefeller and his wife.

'I said, "Well, I can't imagine Billy making a mistake,"' McLendon said.

'Not intentionally, by any stretch of the imagination.'
