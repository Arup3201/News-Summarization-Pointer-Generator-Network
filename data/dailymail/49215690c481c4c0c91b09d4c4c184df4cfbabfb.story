Danny Alexander is positioning himself as future Lib Dem leader if Nick Clegg is ousted after the next election, senior party figures claim.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is seen as the leading candidate to stop left winger Tim Farron from seizing control.

It comes amid renewed speculation about Mr Clegg's future, with his office saying he is only committed to stay until 2020 if he is still in government.'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander is eying up a leadership bid to replace Nick Clegg

Mr Alexander today side-stepped questions about his ambitions, insisting ‘there isn't a vacancy for many years to come’.

Mr Clegg, who delivered an upbeat speech at his party's conference in York today, is expected to quit as Lib Dem leader only if the party is not returned to government in a power-sharing deal with the Conservatives or Labour.

Senior aides were today forced to insist that he would serve a full five-year term after the election, but only if he remains as Deputy Prime Minister.

S spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'Our entire focus is on delivering Lib Dem priorities in government and then getting Lib Dems back into government in 2015.

'Nick Clegg is very much enjoying being both Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Lib Dems. He is only 47.

'It is for the British people to decide … and if the Lib Dems are back in government again Nick intends to serve a full term.’

However, it is possible that his resignation could also be a condition of one of the larger parties entering a coalition with the Lib Dems.

Challenged about Mr Clegg's plans for the future, a senior Lib Dem source said: 'He wants to lead the Lib Dems into the next election and beyond into government. I think we should concentrate on getting re-elected and getting into government again.'

Mr Farron, the party president, is seen as the front runner to beat for the leadership.

But those on the right of the party are dismayed at prospect of being led by the Westmorland MP, whose comedy routines at conferences are thought to lack the gravitas needed to form a government.

One Lib Dem MP said: ’I'm sure Putin will be very intimidated about this cheeky chappie telling jokes about Margaret Thatcher and the miners.

Nick Clegg has vowed to continue as leader until 2020 only if he remains in government as Deputy Prime Minister

’He would turn the party back into a glorified student union, organising petitions and drinking cider.’

Another said: ’Farron as leader? Shoot me now.’

Now Mr Alexander has emerged as the lead candidate from the right of the party, which has battled to reposition the Lib Dems as a serious party of government.

Notably, Mr Alexander was one of only two senior minister name-checked by Mr Clegg in his conference speech.

’Danny is definitely positioning to challenge for leader,’ said a senior Lib Dem source.

’If there are two people in the race to replace Nick, it will be Farron and Danny.’

Admirers of the Scot note his recent attempts to shake off his reputation for being a closet Tory.

Asked about his moves to become leader, Mr Alexander told Sky News: ‘There's no vacancy, I hope there isn't a vacancy for many years to come. Nick Clegg is doing a fantastic job, I've got a big job to do...’

Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson has hinted at his own leadership hopes by claiming he would be prepared to pick up the ball if it came loose from the scrum.

Challenged over whether he would do the same, Mr Alexander said: ‘One thing the Liberal Democrats aren't is a loose scrum. Nick Clegg, I hope will be leader for many years to come and I think that focusing on the job in hand is always wise advice for anybody in politics.’

Mr Clegg has publicly denied his close friend had been ’taken hostage’ in the Treasury by Conservative Chancellor George Osborne.

Mr Alexander has made a number of public interventions putting himself at odds with Tory policy, most notably declaring the 45p top rate of tax would be cut ’over my dead body’.

In a speech today he accused the Conservatives of ’feebly’ trying to steal the Lib Dem policy of increasing the income tax threshold.

Mr Alexander has recently stepped up attempts to help him lay claim to the economic growth which the Tories have insisted is the result of their thought decisions.

He has also become a regular fixture on the ’rubber chicken’ circuit, speaking at Lib Dem constituency association dinners to raise his profile with grassroots activists who will choose the next leader.

’We have no big beasts,’ said a Lib Dem strategist keen to see Mr Alexander raise his profile.

’At the next election the only well known figures will be Clegg, (Vince) Cable and (Paddy) Ashdown. But Danny is getting there.’

One major obstacle to Mr Alexander’s leadership ambitions is his own slender majority.

Today reports suggested he is being lined up to replace Vince Cable as the party’s main economic spokesman.

But Mr Cable insisted it was ’presumptuous’ to assume what jobs people would have on the election campaign next year.
