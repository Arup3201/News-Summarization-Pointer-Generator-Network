Sophie Manser, 20, was enjoying a pepperoni pizza from Domino's when she found a fingernail

A disgusted university student was left with a foul taste in the mouth after taking a bite into her Domino's pepperoni pizza and finding a fingernail.

Sophie Manser, 20, was having a night in with her housemates enjoying films and a takeaway when she heard a crunch and realised she had bit into the yellowed nail, which was baked into the crust.

The third year Plymouth University student, offered the rest of the slice to a friend, who was more than happy to finish it and the unfazed Miss Manser continued to eat the remainder.

She then contacted the takeaway in the Mutley area of Plymouth in Devon where she ordered the food and was sent a replacement and vouchers for two free pizzas as an apology.

She said: 'I was just having a night in with my housemates so we decided to order Dominos and watch some films.

'When I was eating my third slice, I bit down on something crunchy. 

'I pulled it out my mouth and was shocked to see it was a quite big human fingernail .

'It looked like it had been bitten or torn off and baked in the crust. It was pretty disgusting really.'

She added: 'I called them up and took a bit of time to speak to a manager.

'They all seemed a bit shocked and offered to remake a pizza, and said I could have two more free pizzas when I wanted.' 

When the delivery driver arrived half an hour later, she handed over the fingernail in a sandwich bag to return to the store.  

She said: 'Also I just want to stress that it was a real yellowy, browny nail, not a fake one.'

The third year Geography student, originally from Ealing, West London, says the incident hasn't put her off pizza, but she will think twice before ordering from that branch again.

Domino's says it is aware of the incident and is investigating.
