Thunder-like sonic booms are usually associated with aircraft breaking the sound barrier.

But one holidaymaker has captured a volcano that erupted with such force that it triggered a sonic boom and visible shockwaves that warped the clouds in the sky.

The video shows a plume of ash being thrown up in the air from Mount Tavurvur, in Papua New Guinea, followed by impressive rippling clouds and an eardrum-rattling explosion that rocks the boat.

A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object, or objects, travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound.

They generate enormous amounts of sound energy and sound like a large explosion - as can be heard in the minute-long video.

The video of Mount Tavurvur was shot by 58-year-old taxi driver Phil McNamara aboard a small boat on August 29, when he was on holiday.

The volcano is located off the coast of Papua New Guinea (marked). It continued to erupt for several days after the eruption was filmed. The volcano explodes every few years

Last minute: The holidaymaker who captured the eruption (seen at the very beginning here) said he decided to make the boat trip at the last minute, taking other tourists with him to see the natural spectacle

A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object, or objects, travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound.They generate enormous amounts of sound energy and sound like a large explosion - as can be heard in the minute-long video. People usually associate the noise with fast aircraft that can break the sound barrier.

He told The Brisbane Times that his decision to embark on the filming mission was spur of the moment and he took others along from Kokopo Beach Bungalows for a closer look at one of nature’s most powerful – and devastating – sights. 

‘I thought I might as well try and capture something you rarely get to see,’ he said.

But he did not realise how strong the shockwave would be, saying that everyone on the boat ‘absolutely c*****d themselves’ when the sonic boom hit.

In the video, he can be heard saying: ‘watch out for the shock, it’s coming,’ before the shockwave hits the boat, prompting one spectator to exclaim: ‘holy smoking Toledos’.

Mr McNamara had visited Mount Tavurvur a few days earlier when it was dormant.

The volcano continued to erupt for several days after the eruption was filmed.

It erupts every few years and in 1994, exploded at the same time as another local volcano, Mount Vulcan, which destroyed two thirds of the city of Rabaul, IFL Science reported. 

The video has been viewed over six million times and Mr McNamara said that such widespread interest has come as a ‘bit of a surprise’.

Shocking! The video of Mount Tavurvur was shot by 58-year-old taxi driver Phil McNamara aboard a small boat on August 29, when he was on holiday. The explosive sound of the boom shocked observers aboard the boat. This image shows the volcano after the sonic boom was heard and the boat rocked

A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object, or objects, travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound. Many people associate them with high speed aircraft, such as an SR-71B (pictured) which Nasa uses to study aerodynamics and sonic boom characterisation
