Most dog adoption ads play up the pet's charm and eager personality, but the Humane Society has taken a different approach.

The organization's Silicon Valley shelter, in Milpitas, California, is brutally honest in a blog post warning readers not to adopt 'Eddie the Terrible', a two-year-old Chihuahua.

The tongue-in-cheek attack on Eddie's character claims: 'Inside that innocuous, adorable blonde package exists tons - indeed, whole square miles - of naughty.'

Naughty: The Humane Society Silicon Valley is brutally honest in an adoption posting for 'Eddie the Terrible', a two-year-old Chihuahua

The post goes on to outline three reasons why Eddie lives up to his unfortunate nickname; the first is that he's apparently prone to fights with other canines.

'While Eddie The Terrible has never actually attacked another dog, he's made it abundantly clear that he hasn't ruled out the possibility.

'He goes from zero to Cujo in .05 seconds when he sees another dog on leash. Well, sayeth you, lots of small dogs bark at other dogs on leash.'

The ad also warns that Eddie may not warm up to children very easily.

'Some dogs love kids. We have a bunch of child-lovin' dogs. Eddie the Terrible, however, is not one of them. Honestly he's a little whiffy with some adults, too. Not in an eat-them sort of way but in "this makes me very nervous" sort of way.'

And finally, Eddie has high-maintenance preferences for where he hangs out.

'Worried about dog hair on the furniture? Very valid worry if you adopt Eddie. While Eddie is crate trained, he has a weird thing about sleeping in the crate. And by weird thing we mean "nope, not happening". A bed in your room? Awesome.'

Of course, the post also lists plenty of Eddie's positive attributes along the way; for example, he's 'housebroken, loyal, fun and friendly' and 'lives to play fetch'.

After the hilarious post, which ran December 9, Eddie was adopted - despite his shortcomings.

The organization announced the good news in a post on its Facebook page Tuesday afternoon: 'ADOPTED! Oh yes, it's true. Eddie The Terrible found a couple with a big heart, no kids, and an endless amount of patience.'

Bernadette Cruz, director of marketing for the organization, told USA Today: 'We are really thrilled to have found a home for him.'

She added that the retired couple who heard about Eddie on the local news were 'so excited about him and knew they could provide a loving home'.
