E-cigarettes should be banned in public places because they 'normalise' smoking, a leading doctor has said.

Surgeon Ram Moorthy urged so-called 'vaping' to be banned in the same places that smoking is prohibited.

Mr Moorthy, deputy chair of the British Medical Association board of science, is due to present a motion to the unionâ€™s annual representative meeting calling for the restriction.

'E-cigarettes could be a portal into nicotine addiction and we should look to ban them in public places,' he said.

E-cigarettes 'normalise' smoking and should be banned in public places, surgeon Ram Moorthy of the British Medical Association board of science has said

Should E-cigarettes be banned in public?

'The concern is that we know among adolescents there is a huge awareness of e-cigarettes and we know that from cigarette smoking that smokers pick it up before the age of 18.

'E-cigarettes are currently being marketed through celebrity endorsement and we have seen the raft of flavours that are out there.

'On one hand they say these are very much for smokers, but your traditional 40-year-old male smoker is not going to go out and buy a pink candy flavoured e-cigarette.

'The flavours are very much geared at younger users.

'We have had a huge culture shift in the social acceptability of smoking since the ban in public places.

'The difficulty with e-cigarettes is the majority of devices mimic cigarettes and therefore it potentially normalises smoking.'

Recent research suggested as many as 30million people across Europe have tried e-cigarettes.

And a separate study found that by January this year, there were 466 brands of e-cigarettes available online through English language websites.

The researchers also found 7,764 'unique flavours' on these sites.

Mr Moorthy said the range of flavours electronic cigarettes are now available in, means they are geared up to a younger audience

Meanwhile, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has recognised e-cigarettes as an effective alternative to cigarettes, while calling for regulation of the products.

The professional body said: 'The RCP recognises that electronic cigarettes and other novel nicotine devices can provide an effective, affordable and readily available retail alternative to conventional cigarettes.

'These innovations could make harm reduction a reality for smokers.

'The RCP also recognises that these new products present potential risks as well as opportunities for individual and population health, and therefore advocates proportionate regulation to maximise the overall public health benefit.'

Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: 'Although there are concerns that e-cigarettes might lead people into smoking, research has found only 1 per cent of never-smokers have ever tried e-cigarettes.

'While e-cigarette use in England is rising, encouragingly smoking rates continue to fall.

'Balanced and effective regulation of e-cigarettes as medicines can manage the risks and maximise the potential for these products to replace smoking.'
