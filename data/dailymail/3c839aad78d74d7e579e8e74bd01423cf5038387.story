The oldest active pilot is a 95-year-old man living in Cameron Park, California.

Guinness World Records has confirmed Peter Weber Jr.'s feat, the Sacramento Bee reported.

'I'm overwhelmed,' Weber told the newspaper. 'I'm getting all kinds of phone calls, emails and all that stuff.'

The record was confirmed after Weber proved he piloted a plane March 30 in Placerville by mailing in multiple pieces of evidence, according to the Sacramento Bee.

The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor.

All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.'

According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943.

'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.'

Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says. 

Weber told the Sacramento Bee in March 'The reason I did it is because I though maybe I might have the record be - being the fact my age is 95 years, 4 months and 23 days.'

At the time, he said that Guinness recently made a new category for the oldest qualified pilot who still has a license and flies alone while speaking to the newspaper.

Weber has been married to his wife since 1943 and is a father to a 70-year-old son, according to reports.  

The Sacramento Bee reported Weber still has his driver's license -- and also pointed out that a since-deceased 105-year-old Colorado man holds the record for being the oldest pilot ever, according to Guinness.

Cole Kugel's final flight took place in 2007 before he died that June, Guinness says.
