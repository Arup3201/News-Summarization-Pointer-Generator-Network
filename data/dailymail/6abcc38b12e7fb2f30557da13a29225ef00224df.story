Many will be tucking into a chocolate egg today but Labour party members will be enjoying an unusual treat - in the shape of Nick Clegg's face.

The Labour party has concocted the Clegg Egg. Its box reads: 'Completely hollow' and it is 'guaranteed to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

The egg will also come with a free mug and instead of the words store in a dark place it reads: 'Store in David Cameron's pocket'.

The Clegg Egg: The Labour party made the chocolate treat in the shape of Nick Clegg. The egg was created as part of an internet campaign #cleggegg

Another dig at the Deputy Prime Minister, whose chocolate double is wearing a yellow tie, reads '100 per cent Artificially Conservative' written across the box.

The packaging also reads: 'Large chocolate Clegg, full of empty promises.'

The personalised gift even has its own Twitter hashtag #easterclegg.

The egg is part of an internet campaign launched by the party today.

Instead of tweeting about the egg today, party leader Ed Miliband opted for a more serious message.

On the Labour internet page he wrote: 'As Christians across Great Britain and the rest of the world gather to celebrate the most important event in the Christian faith, I would like to wish you all a happy Easter.'

A senior Labour source told The Sunday Mirror: 'Just like Nick Clegg, our eggs melt when the heat is on.'

A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: 'I canâ€™t believe Labour are getting egg-cited about this.'
