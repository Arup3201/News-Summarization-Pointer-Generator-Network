A teacher who sent lewd texts to a schoolboy who later killed himself has been banned from the classroom indefinitely - the toughest sanction he could have faced.

Iwan Harding, 35, was teaching at the village school at Glan Conwy, near Colwyn Bay in North Wales, when it was discovered he was swapping obscene messages with a teenage father.

Anthony Stubbs, 17, was later found hanged in woodland after his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, 18, found the messages he had been exchanging with Mr Harding.

Mr Harding claimed he thought the boy was 18 and a prefect in a Lancashire school when he started swapping texts 'of a sexually explicit nature' by mobile phone with him.

The General Teaching Council for Wales found Mr Harding guilty of unprofessional conduct falling short of the standard expected of a teacher. He did not appear and was not represented.

Chairman Peter Williams said Mr Harding had appeared to be in denial about the gravity of his unprofessional conduct and there had been only a limited expression of remorse.

Sending such messages 'of a deeply sexual nature' was an abuse of his position of trust.

The prohibition order was 'to maintain public trust and confidence and to protect the interest of pupils, the public and the profession'.

According to the presenting officer, Emma Burns, of 77 texts sent between October 7 and November 24 in 2012, about 25 were of a sexual nature, eight of them sent in school hours.

Miss Burns said Harding had said he never knew Anthony's name and believed he was 18.

He admitted sending one image which he said he obtained on Google, but Anthony was not a pupil of his and he did not consider it was unprofessional conduct.

Mr Harding said he later learned Anthony was 17 and the sexual texts stopped. He regarded what had happened 'as a private conversation between himself and another person'.

'I created a persona, I just wanted to chat ... it was just a bit of fun, there was no breach of trust, he was not my pupil, no duty of care.'

Miss Burns said Mr Harding was no longer a teacher but his present occupation was not known.

Head teacher Mrs Eifiona Price-Williams said Mr Harding had been sacked following a disciplinary hearing and an appeal was withdrawn.

'When interviewed he explained he had never met the man, it was a website. He did not know he was 17.'

Ms Williams said Anthony was being referred to throughout the case as 'an individual' and he appealed for his name not to be made public.

'The nature and graphic content of the material sent are extremely serious.'

The committee found allegations about 'communications of a sexually explicit nature' were proven. 

They also took into account a 2003 conviction for driving with more than three times the permitted amount of alcohol. 

Mr Harding had been banned from the road for three years and told to carry out 100 hours' unpaid work. He had maintained this was not relevant to the Anthony Stubbs case.

The ban means that Mr Harding cannot teach in Wales.

Ms Williams said: 'He may not apply for permission to re-register. He has a right of appeal within 28 days.'

Mr Harding, who lived at Llanberis, had denied in the magistrates' court last year that he sent grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages, one allegedly about having sex in school uniform.

In July 2013 a district judge was about to adjudicate in the case against Mr Harding but it was dropped at the last minute after the principal legal officer to the Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it should not proceed.

Antony hanged himself at Brickfield Wood in Leyland, in Lancashire, and his body was found three months later

Mr Harding and Anthony had encountered each other on dating website Love Leap, Caernarfon Magistrates' Court had heard.

Although users must be 18 to register, Anthony was able to set up an account under the tag 'young, sexy gay'.

Julie Hughes, prosecuting, said Anthony went missing on November 24 in 2012 following an argument with his girlfriend, Ms Mason, who had discovered the messages.

She told Caernarfon Magistrates' Court in north Wales. 'The messages themselves are obscene and indecent and, to an extent, that is conceded by the defendant in interview.'

Detective Sergeant Richard Horton, of Lancashire police, said that although Anthony's body was not found until January 14 he had killed himself in woods near his Leyland home soon after he vanished.

His mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through Love Leap, including a 47-year-old Manchester man.

He also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service Skype.

The court was told he had asked Anthony about the size of his manhood, described him as a 'horny lad' and offered sex.

He also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act.

Users on Love Leap dating website, where Mr Harding and Anthony first met, must be 18 to register. Anthony, however, was able to set up an account under the tag 'young, sexy gay'.

Tudur Owen, defending, said the case raised 'issues of public concern' because the Crown was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act.

Mr Owen said: 'It's a tragic case [but] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet. A lot of it is effectively fantasy.'

Mr Harding, who was suspended by his school, accepted he sent images and a video to Anthony who, he said, had claimed to be 18.

But he had denied sending grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages between October 7 and 19 in 2012.

Anthony had discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15, and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily, his daughter was born last September.
