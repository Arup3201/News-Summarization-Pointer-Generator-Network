Steffon Armitage, the European player of the season barred by England, has again let it be known that he might try to qualify to play for France in the 2015 World Cup.

Supporters of the dynamic Toulon flanker, last capped by England in 2010, indicated in June that he was thinking along those lines and further reports yesterday suggest he is still considering the French option.

A frustrated Armitage could be playing with fire, though. The slightest doubt over his allegiance and any sense that he is trying to force England’s hand will not amuse head coach Stuart Lancaster, who puts great store by old-fashioned patriotism and commitment to the squad.

Lancaster has fully supported the RFU’s stance of not picking players who are based overseas unless there are ‘exceptional circumstances’, and the only glimmer for Armitage has been that the phrase has never been properly defined. A run of injuries to the likes of Chris Robshaw and Matt Kvesic might be considered exceptional.

Armitage’s possible entry to the French squad would come via a loophole in the IRB qualifying regulations for the Olympic Sevens tournament which allows a player to play for another nation if they hold a passport for the new country and have not played international rugby for 18 months.

If such a player appears in the forthcoming IRB World Sevens Series for that new country, he would be available for selection at fifteens.

Armitage would have to be granted a French passport — not a given — while it is understood that the French Sevens squad, should they be minded to pick him, would require him to play in three or four of the Sevens tournaments around the world, involving considerable time away from Toulon during the season.

It is also thought that France legend Serge Blanco, who has been drafted in to help coach Philippe Saint-Andre, is against overseas players qualifying for France in such a way or through the three-year residency rule in the case of uncapped players.

Meanwhile, Lancaster has confirmed he has reached agreement with the Premiership clubs to delay the selection and announcement of his senior England and Saxons squads until October, which will be a big help in assessing current form.

An extended 55-man England squad began a three-day fitness testing camp in Loughborough last night, while a review of the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand in June is also planned.

Among the notable inclusions were loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero and back row Tom Croft, both of whom have returned to the national set-up after lengthy spells out with knee injuries.

Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani kept his place after returning to the England fold on the summer tour to New Zealand, while Saracens back row Jackson Wray is a new name.

Lancaster said: ‘This camp will give us a chance to get the wider squad together and an opportunity to review the New Zealand tour. It will be an important few days. The next time we meet will be two weeks before we play New Zealand in the QBE Internationals, so this time together is vital.’
