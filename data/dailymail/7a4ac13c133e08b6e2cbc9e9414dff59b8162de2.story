Slaven Bilic apologised to Arsene Wenger after he was sent off in the final moments of Besiktas’ fiery 0-0 draw with Arsenal in Istanbul.

Bilic was escorted off after complaining to Serbian referee Milorad Mazic during a stormy first leg of this Champions League qualifier at the Ataturk Stadium.

The former West Ham and Everton defender said: ‘I have apologised. It was a big game for us, right. I just wasn't happy with some of the decisions. He just showed me the way off.

Lost his cool: But the Croat says he has apologised to Arsene Wenger and the referee for his actions

‘After the game I apologised to him and to Mr Wenger. No hard feelings or whatever. I made a mistake. Maybe I overreacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit Flamini in the stomach and we were in a good position, two against one.

‘But nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game. I'm not used to this kind of situation. 

‘I had 60 or 70 games with Croatia, but I think this is the second time I've been asked out of the dug-out. 

‘I don't know the rules, but I see no reason for me not to be in the dug-out in London, really. If that was a reason, many coaches would be missing from the dug-out.’

Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba had two big chances for Besiktas to win it - including a spectacular shot from the kick off - but Bilic still believes they can win at the Emirates on Wednesday.

He added: ‘We'll be ready next week. We're going to London not to go shopping in Harrods, but to try to fulfil some would say our dream. I'd say our task, our plan.

‘Nobody respects Arsenal more than I do, but I wouldn't have taken this result before the game. ‘We are big time alive, though. I'm really optimistic. We're going to their soil, their stadium, in front of their spectators, but we didn't concede. ‘We played without our most important player (Atikba) Hutchinson, who is very likely to be fit for the second leg.

‘They'll be without Ramsey even if they have many great midfield players, but Ramsey is their top man.’
