A Corporal's wife who was 'starved of affection' was spared jail yesterday after having sex with the 14-year-old son of a soldier.

Caroline Salisbury, 27, lured the boy into her bed after meeting him on a school bus.

The mother-of-two, who had been 'looking for love', pleaded guilty to four charges of sexual activity with a child – after earlier telling a neighbour she had been raped by him.

Speaking at a court in Colchester yesterday, Judge Advocate Emma Peters gave her a two-year suspended sentence and warned her to 'stay away from young boys'.

Salisbury, who was 25 at the time, began having sex sessions in her living room with the boy a week after his 14th birthday in 2013, the Service Civilian Court was told.

They met when she became a bus monitor escorting children of soldiers based in a British garrison in Germany to school.

Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, told the court: 'She invited him to her house and the relationship developed from just being friends into what became a sexual relationship.'

She would send him Facebook messages when her husband, David, a corporal in the Royal Engineers, was out, so he could visit her married quarters for drink and sex.

In one message she told the boy: 'Come at four. He won't be in. I cannot wait for you to f*** me again.'

Col Jones said: 'She had two accounts on Facebook to communicate with him. It was not just about meeting up. Declarations of love were made on both sides.'

He added: 'Because he was spending so much time with her his mother became suspicious. A friend of his mother visited her and showed her messages from Salisbury which suggested a sexual relationship between her and the boy.'

His parents alerted the Royal Military Police and when they knocked on her door, the boy fled over the garden fence.

Despite twice being warned by the police not to meet him, Salisbury continued the affair. Then, when his parents were having a barbecue, the boy did not attend and was not answering his mobile phone.

His brothers went to Salisbury's home and began banging on the door because they knew he was inside.

Neighbours called the police and the boy fled once more. Col Jones said: 'The boy later confessed to his father he had been in a sexual relationship with her and she was arrested.'

Salisbury told a neighbour she had been raped by him. But in an interview with the Military Police she admitted twice having sex with him saying he had forced himself on her, but did not say rape.

Col Jones added: 'He was very upset at the end of it. He was totally besotted with her.'

Defence barrister Peter Glenser told the court that Salisbury was 'starved of affection' by her husband who has since left the Army and is working in Saudi Arabia.

'It was for this reason she sought the company of people younger than herself,' he said.

'In the last week he has indicated that he is sorry for the way he has treated her and that he should have been more supportive of her.'

Mrs Salisbury, from Suffolk, wiped tears away as Mr Glenser told the court: 'This is a shaming occasion for her. She desperately regrets what has happened.'

Judge Peters told his wife: 'This was a boy who was a child of just 14 and to suggest he pressed himself upon you is revolting.

'That is utterly criminal. The police warned you off and you carried on. Young boys have to be kept safe and not be groomed and taken back to your house when your husband was away.

'You were looking for love. You are a damaged woman. I am going to take an exceptional course – you have come within a hair's breadth of going to prison for a long time.

'I pass this suspended sentence with a heavy heart. You need to stay away from young boys.'

Salisbury was placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years and banned from having any boy aged under 16 in her home without parental consent.
