Research has revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia

An environmental report has blasted diesel carsÂ  - despite earlier government efforts to encourage drivers to switch from petrol to diesel.

Separate research has also revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia.

Nitrogen dioxide, a chemical present in diesel emissions, causes eye, nose and throat irritation and is said to cause breathing problems in young children.

But scientists have warned that as well as damaging the lungs, the fumes could cause autism and schizophrenia to develop within
 children living near busy roads.

Long-term exposure to the fumes changes the way that a child's brain develops, it has been revealed.

The
 danger of the fumes has been compared to the effect of lead in petrol.

In 1999, lead in petrol was banned after scientists revealed that lead 
additives caused brain damage in children.

The concerns over the fumes have been raised in a report by the World Health Organisation.

Dr Ian Mudway, a researcher in respiratory toxicology at King's College, and a co-author of the report told The Sunday Times that there is 'strong evidence' that diesel pollutants have an effect on cognitive function in children.

Dr Mudway said the organisation planned to carry out more research on the theme in London because the original study was conducted in California where diesel vehicle use is significantly lower.

The study, from California, reported last
 year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at 525 
children, 279 of the children had autism.

London was covered in a cloud of smog last week after dust from the Sahara became became mixed with pollution from Europe and the UK

A warning from the Air Quality Expert Group in report by commissioned by the UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has raised concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions, created by diesel cars, have continued to rise over the past decade

Results found that the pollution 
levels experienced by mothers' during pregnancy and by the babies the first year of their life were 
strongly linked to the risk of developing autism.

A
 further two American studies found that older men and women exposed to 
high levels of pollution experienced higher memory loss compared to 
others of the same age.

Much
 of the research on the topic has come from the United States - despite 
the fact that diesel is mainly used in buses and heavy goods vehicles there rather than normal cars.

On Wednesday in London, there was a surge in 999 calls after a cloud of smog caused breathing problems across the city.

Now a warning from the Air Quality Expert Group in report by commissioned by the UK
Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has raised 
concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions, created by diesel cars, have 
continued to rise over the past decade.

In the study, scientists have urged ministers to make a u-turn back to petrol vehicles.

The
 air quality group, which provides independent scientific advice to the 
government, told ministers that it would be easier to promote petrol 
rather than attempt to clean up diesel.

One of the authors of the report, David Carslaw, blasted the European Union for the 'complete failure' of the way emissions are regulated.

Mr
 Carslaw told The Sunday Times that European guidelines on testing cars 
were 'too lenient'. Tests did not reflect how vehicles perform on real 
roads, where they produce four to five times the number of emissions, he said.

Mr Carslaw said: 'Switching to petrol is the best idea for light vehicles', which includes cars, taxis and small vans.

A switch from diesel to petrol would be a lengthy process because a third of Britain's 29million private cars are diesel-powered.

A switch from diesel to petrol would be a lengthy process because a third of Britain's 29million private cars are diesel powered. And the number of diesel cars is on the up - half of the new cars registered in 2012 were diesel powered

And the number of diesel cars is on the up - half of the new cars registered in 2012 used diesel.

This is the third time that scientists have recommended a move from diesel to petrol. The two previous warnings were both archived by DEFRA.

A government spokesman said that 
there was no 'single magic bullet' to tackle air pollution and one form 
of transport could not be linked to pollution levels.
