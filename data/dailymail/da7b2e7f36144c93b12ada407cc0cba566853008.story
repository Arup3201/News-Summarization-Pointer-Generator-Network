TV Land has announced it will stop airing reruns of 'The Cosby Show' - making it the latest company to distance itself from Bill Cosby following rape accusations by multiple women.

A representative from the satellite and cable channel said the reruns will stop airing immediately for an indefinite time. 'The Cosby Show' also was to have been part of a Thanksgiving sitcom marathon.

It comes after NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said on Wednesday that a Cosby sitcom it was working on 'is no longer under development', while Netflix also postponed its stand-up comedy special with the once-beloved comic.

The announcements came just hours after model Janice Dickinson became the third woman in recent weeks to allege she'd been assaulted by Cosby - charges strongly denied by the comedian's lawyer.

Bill Cosby, pictured on Tuesday, has been accused of rape by multiple women. Since the allegations - some of which were reported a decade ago - NBC, Netflix and TV Land have all dropped projects with him

The developments, which involve allegations that were widely reported a decade ago as well as new accusations, have gravely damaged the 77-year-old comedian's reputation as America's TV dad at a time when he was launching a comeback.

A year ago, a standup special - his first in 30 years - aired on Comedy Central and drew a hefty audience of two million viewers. His prospective new series was announced by NBC in January.

Cosby has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations.

Former Pennsylvania prosecutor Bruce L. Castor Jr., who investigated a woman's claims that Cosby had sexually assaulted her in 2004, said Wednesday he decided not to prosecute because he felt there was not enough evidence to get a conviction.

'I wrote my opinion in such a way as I thought conveyed to the whole world that I thought he had done it, he had just gotten away with it because of a lack of evidence,' the former Montgomery County district attorney said.

Axed: TV Land has dropped re-runs of 'The Cosby Show' indefinitely, a representative said

If Cosby hadn't been cooperative with the investigation, 'I probably would have arrested him,' Castor said.

Cosby was asked about the growing furor by an Associated Press reporter when the comedian was promoting an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art that features the comedian's African-American art collection alongside African artworks.

When the AP interviewed Cosby, on November 6, the story involved long-circulated accusations from several women and recent criticism from comedian Hannibal Buress.

Cosby declined to comment, saying: 'We don't answer that.' 

Since then, more women have come forward publicly to accuse him of sexual assault, Netflix, TV Land and NBC cut ties and an appearance on 'The Late Show With David Letterman' was canceled.

Accusers: Joan Tarshis, left, says she was working as a writer in 1969 when Cosby assaulted her twice, while Amanda Constand, right, settled a civil suit against Cosby in 2006 for assaulting her in 2004

ANDREA CONSTAND

In 2005, the Temple University employee said she was molested by Cosby. Without enough evidence, Constand launched a civil suit but settled out of court. 13 other women said they would testify about assaults they had suffered at the hands of Cosby but due to the settlement, they did not appear in court.

BARBARA BOWMAN

In October she told MailOnline that when she was an aspiring actress living in Colorado in the 80s, she was introduced to the comic. She says she was 'drugged, raped an emotionally abused' by him.

JOAN TARSHIS

On two occasions in 1969, the music publicist says Cosby gave her 'strong drinks that caused her to black out and when she awoke she was naked and he then attacked her'.

LINDA JOY TRAITZ

Traitz of Hallandale Beach, Florida, claims she was just 19 when the actor drove her out to a beach in Los Angeles and tried to get her to relax by taking drugs.

JANICE DICKINSON

The model said Cosby lured her to his home with a TV offer and then drugged and raped her in 1982.

TAMARA GREEN

Green told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

THERESE SERIGNESE  

She was just 19 when she met Cosby before he performed standup in Las Vegas in 1976. He invited her to an afterparty and she claims he drugged her and she woke up to find him having sex with her.

CARLA FERRIGNO 

She claimed Cosby lunged at her and forcefully kissed her at a party, but after hearing stories from other women 'I was the lucky one'.

In recent days, as the allegations gained increasing attention, AP went back through the full video of the November 6 interview and decided to publish Cosby's full reaction to questions about the claims. 

As the interview was winding down, he comedian asked the AP to not use the brief on-camera refusal to comment he had just made about the allegations.

'And I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' he said.

The interview was on the record. The AP had made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time.

The Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art has not changed its plans for the show, which opened this month on the National Mall and is scheduled to remain on view through early 2016.

'The exhibition has been very well received. We've actually had record numbers through the door,' spokesman Eddie Burke said, adding the museum has had no complaints.

The NBC project was in the very early stages, without a script or commitment to production. But it would have brought Cosby back to the network where he had reigned in the 1980s with the top-rated 'The Cosby Show'. 

Cosby has continued working as a stand-up comic, and has at least 35 performances scheduled throughout the U.S. and Canada through May 2015. None of the performances has been cancelled.

National Artists Corporation, which is promoting part of the tour, said it will not be canceling any shows.

Dickinson told 'Entertainment Tonight' that Cosby had given her red wine and a pill when they were together in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room in 1982.

When she woke up the next morning, 'I wasn't wearing my pajamas and I remembered before I passed out I had been sexually assaulted by this man.'

Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a letter to the AP that Dickinson's charges were 'false and outlandish' and were contradicted by Dickinson herself in a published autobiography.

Cosby's spokesman, David Brokaw, did not return calls for comment.

Singer said the first Cosby heard of any assault allegation from Dickinson came in the 'Entertainment Tonight' interview, and suggested the actress was 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career'. 

Commissioner Bruce Castor, a former Montgomery County DA, says he stands by his decision not to charge Cosby in 2004 because evidence wasn't strong enough - even though he thought he should've been arrested
