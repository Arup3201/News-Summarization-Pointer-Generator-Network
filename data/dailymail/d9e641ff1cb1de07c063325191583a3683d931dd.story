Two young movie fans have put their own spin on this year's nominees for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, recreating the most iconic scenes from each big screen hit in their own unique way. 

With direction from their movie-loving mother Maggie Storino, four-year-old Sophia and her three-year-old sister Sadie re-enacted scenes from all eight Best Picture nominees, including Birdman, Boyhood and The Imitation Game, for their photo-based blog, which is aptly-named Don't Call Me Oscar.

It is the fourth year in a row that the girls have paid tribute to the iconic Oscars ceremony in this way, with Sophia having first starred on the blog when she was just four months old.

She can fly! Sadie (L) and Sophia (R) Storino recreated stills from all eight movies that are nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars, including Birdman

Original: Black comedy Birdman stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone

Growing up so fast: Sophia, four, has been recreating scenes from the Best Picture nominees, including Boyhood (pictured), since she was just four months old

The passing of time: Boyhood, which stars Ellar Coltrane (pictured), Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, is a coming-of-age drama

'We are still surprised at how much people like the photos,' Chicago-based Maggie told Today.com. 'Now, my favorite part is looking back at the archive.

'The blog is a snapshot of our family from the same week every year. 

'Sadie was born the week after our first [picture] was posted and now she’s flapping her wings in Birdman. It's an amazing way to watch our family grow and to document some of our fondest memories.'

While the girls are far too young to have seen any of the nominated movies themselves, both have formed strong opinions about which ones they favor - based purely on their experiences of acting out one pivotal scene from each. 

Sadie opted for Birdman, which stars Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, with her mother admitting that the youngster even spent time rehearsing her part in the picture, while Sophia picked emotional drama Whiplash, which stars JK Simmons and Miles Teller in the lead roles. 

Need a clue? In order to recreate this image from The Imitation Game, the Storino family had to put their crafting skills to work to recreate the numerous dials found on Alan Turing's code-breaking machine

Firm favorite: Benedict Cumberbatch (pictured) is also nominated in the Best Actor category 

Boxed up: As part of their preparation for this scene from The Grand Budapest Hotel, Sophia (R) and Sadie (L) had to put their crafting skills to the test in order to make all of the boxes featured in the background

True love: Sophia (L) and Sadie (R) had a chance to play with some fun costumes in order to recreate this scene from the Theory of Everything

Wedding day: Eddie Redmayne (L) and Felicity Jones (R) both received individual nods for their performances in the biopic, which is based on the life of scientist Stephen Hawking

Despite not being able to watch any of the films that they were acting out, Maggie gave her children a brief synopsis of each one after Sophia asked to understand more about the scenes that they would be starring in. 

And in addition to the background research, the family spent weeks preparing the scenery for each image, with Maggie admitting that the background for The Grand Budapest Hotel, which features dozens of pink packages, took the longest to perfect. 

'After a week of glue sticks, scissors and construction paper, they were so looking forward to taking the picture, it felt like Christmas,' she added. 

Both girls have clearly come a long way since their efforts last year; following the completion of their photos for 2014's nominees, Maggie revealed that working with such young stars had its difficulties, particularly when the girls were left to their own devices.

'We set [the scenery] up when the girls are asleep and then put Sophia in the middle of the picture when she wakes up in the morning,' she explained at the time. 

Play things: In place of men, Sophia is facing some of her favorite toys on this recreation of the poster for historical drama Selma 

Paying her respects: Despite her young age, Sophia still manages to capture the incredible emotion within this poignant image from American Sniper

Impressive performance: Bradley Cooper is also nominated for Best Actor at this year's ceremony

Feel the rhythm: The youngster shows off her most dramatic pose in this re-enactment of a scene from Whiplash - which was Sophia's favorite poster to recreate

Top notch: JK Simmons (pictured) has been commended for his impressive performance in the drama, which also stars Miles Teller

'With toddlers, if you don't get the photo on the first take it won't work - they eat the props, they play with the dolls, they run amok in a spacesuit.' 

The Storino family's photo project first began as a light-hearted attempt to make Maggie's sister - a journalist who was covering the Oscars in 2011 - laugh.

But after posting them online, Maggie says she was taken aback by the positive reaction the fun images received.

'My sister is a journalist, working on Oscars coverage and we took the photos to make her laugh. And it worked.

'Our friends and family liked the photos so much they suggested we post it online. 

'I was nervous about putting my kids on the internet. We are absolutely shocked to see how many people really seem to enjoy the photos.'
