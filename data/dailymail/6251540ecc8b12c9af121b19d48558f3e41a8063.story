Amanda Miles, 40, thought it 'entirely acceptable' for a black worker to be given the nickname 'golliwog Brian' at her multi-million pound firm, a tribunal ruled

The owner of a multi-million pound firm failed to stop her staff calling another employee 'golliwog Brian' because she did not think there was anything wrong with the nickname.

Amanda Miles, 40, 'tolerated a culture of racism' at her fruit and vegetable wholesaler, an employment tribunal found.

Brian Ennis was given the nickname and also called 'black Brian' to distinguish him from a white worker with the same first name, the wholesaler admitted.

Another black worker, a delivery driver who was so upset by the racist behaviour that he quit, has been awarded £27,000 in compensation after a panel ruled that having to listen to racist nicknames had 'violated his dignity'.

Roy Morgan told Bristol Employment Tribunal that a colleague ordered him to 'stop speaking that jungle talk' as he chatted to another driver in patois.

And bosses at the firm did not discipline a white driver who said that 'black people should be burnt at the stake like Jews', despite a complaint from an employee with Jewish heritage.

The tribunal awarded Mr Morgan £13,427 in 2011 for racial harassment and recently ruled he should receive a further £14,286 for lost earnings from constructive dismissal.

Ms Miles was 'entirely unreceptive' to the idea that the name-calling might offend black staff, it ruled.

But Mr Morgan is unlikely to see a penny of his award because the firm has recently gone into administration.

During the tribunal, the company falsely suggested that Mr Morgan had once been to prison.

Mr Morgan, who represented himself, was so upset by the lie that he stormed out of the tribunal.

Speaking after the case, Ms Miles branded the judgment 'absolutely ridiculous'.

She said: 'Brian Ennis did not have any issues. He is not shy and if he had wanted to bring up the names with me, he would have done. He could hold his own.

'The tribunal was the most pathetic process I have ever come across in my life.'

Mr Morgan joined the Gloucester-based firm run by divorcee Ms Miles and her partner Sean Linturn, 44, in September 2007. It had nearly 30 employees and an annual turnover as high as £4.2 million.

The drivers earned about £300 per week and swearing was common in the warehouse, the tribunal heard.

The company did have an equal 
opportunities policy but this was kept in a filing cabinet and none of 
the employees or managers knew it existed.

In November 2008, Mr Morgan brought a book on health and safety into work.

The tribunal found: 'Ms Miles lost her temper with the claimant. When he gave it to her, she threw it back at him. Ms Miles also pushed the claimant out of her office.'

Mr Morgan quit that day, citing harassment and discriminatory practices in his resignation letter.

The panel concluded: 'The claimant worked for an employer that tolerated not only racial banter in the workplace but also the expression of extreme forms of racial prejudice.

'The claimant found this comment to be offensive and was concerned that no steps appeared to be taken to address it.

'This was known about by Ms Miles. It did not occur to her to take any steps to curb this practice as it did not occur to her that there could be anything wrong with it.

'Ms Miles was entirely unreceptive to the notion that calling someone by the colour of their skin could cause offence.

'She had given no thought to finding another way of distinguishing the two Brians that did not involve labelling one of them by the colour of their skin.

'She had had no training in the principles of equal opportunity and appeared to have an entirely closed mind to what those principles might entail.

'At the very least we would have expected Ms Miles to have taken some steps to ensure this was not causing offence to Mr Ennis.

'Ms Miles was an employer who thought it entirely acceptable to distinguish one employee from another by referring to the colour of the skin of the black employee.

'That Ms Miles had no index of concern about this practice satisfied us further that there was a culture of racism that was tolerated in the workplace.'
