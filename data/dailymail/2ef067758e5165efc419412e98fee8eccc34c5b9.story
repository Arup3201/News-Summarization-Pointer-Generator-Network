Relatives of a murdered retired postmistress have criticised police who initially treated her death as an accident - even though she was repeatedly stabbed and set on fire.

Detectives still working on the unsolved killing of 86-year-old Una Crown in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of the confusion.

Her body was discovered by relative John Payne, 77, when he called at her bungalow to take her for a day out last January. She had suffered serious burns and multiple stab wounds.

Death: Una Crown, 86, with her late husband Jack. Detectives still working on her unsolved killing have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of early confusion

Probe: An officer stands outside the Wisbech home where Mrs Crown was found murdered in January 2013

However, officers first thought she had accidentally set herself on fire. They told Mr Payne and his wife Judy, 70, that they were free to enter her home and sort through her belongings.

But three days later they dramatically changed their minds and launched a murder investigation, telling Mr and Mrs Payne the bungalow was now a crime scene.

A post-mortem found Mrs Crown had been stabbed repeatedly - including through the heart and lungs - and then set on fire by her killer.

Mr and Mrs Payne complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and said they had felt ‘very let down’ by Cambridgeshire Constabulary.

Now, one year after her death, the force has admitted key evidence could have been lost as a result of the confusion.

Mrs Payne, from Wisbech, said: ‘I was surprised when the police said it was an accident. After a few days the point was proved. We got home and within half an hour the police arrived and told us it was a homicide.’

Mystery: Mrs Crown, who lived alone, was last seen alive on January 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day

Police officers said the family’s complaint to the IPCC had been ‘locally resolved’ and Mrs Crown’s relatives were content with this.

Detective Chief Inspector Jon Hutchinson said: ‘There was a problem with the first two days in that the officers that attended were under the impression this was a tragic accident.

‘Officers made the assumption that it was a non-suspicious death. There is always the potential, as a result of that, we may not have been as quick off the mark as we should have been.

‘We are absolutely determined that we will do everything to bring the offender to justice and to bring closure to Una’s family.’

Mrs Crown, who lived alone, was last seen alive on January 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day. Police believe she was murdered some time before 9pm.

A £10,000 Crimestoppers reward has been offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of Mrs Crown’s killer.

Det Con Hutchinson added: ‘We still believe the answer to this crime lies in the local community and we need their help.

‘I would urge people to think back to this time a year ago, did a friend or loved one come home with blood on them or smelling of smoke? Were they acting strangely around that time? Did they suddenly come into money?

‘Any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, could prove crucial to solving this terrible crime and giving some closure to Mrs Crown’s family who are desperate for answers.’
