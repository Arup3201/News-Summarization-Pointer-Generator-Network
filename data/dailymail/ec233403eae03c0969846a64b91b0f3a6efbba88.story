A former Power Ranger allegedly murdered his roommate with a replica medieval sword in a row over his girlfriend.

Ricardo Medina Jr, who played the Red Ranger, reportedly told officers that he stabbed Joshua Sutter after he forced his way into his bedroom during the fight.

Sutter was said to have been angry that Medina's girlfriend was spending too much time at their home when the former Power Ranger was not there, TMZ reported.

The 37-year-old has been charged with killing his roommate by stabbing him in the abdomen with the sharp weapon on Saturday afternoon. 

Medina, who reportedly called 911 himself, was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, shortly after, reports claim. Sutter was taken to hospital and pronounced dead.

The roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm, according to reports.

Medina went into his room with his girlfriend but Sutter tried to follow them, the report states.

It was then that Medina allegedly dealt the fatal blow. He has been charged and detained, with his bail set at $1 million. 

Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai. 

He also voiced Deker in the video game Power Rangers Samurai, and in the movie Power Rangers Samurai: A New Enemy, which hit theaters in 2012. 

Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Medina was also pursuing a singing career and had stints in ER and CSI, according to his IMDb profile.

'He is a great friend and a great client. It's something I can't even conceive. I don't see that in him. He was a very helpful guy and great with his dog. It's such a shock,' said Gar Lester, Medina's former agent who has known the actor for 12 years, told ABC7. 

Medina's neighbor, Justin Adamson, said the actor had moved into the block about two months ago. 

He told ABC7: 'We brought him some bread and just tried to interact a little bit with him, but he was more of the, you know, the type of guy that didn't really want to communicate.'
