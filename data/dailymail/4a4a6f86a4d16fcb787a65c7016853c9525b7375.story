Sometimes I think the Premier League clubs have to remember in which country their fantastic product is played.

You can already sense there is reluctance to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s suggestion that we increase the number of home-grown players in a squad from eight to 12. 

We will never know if our players our good enough unless they get the chance and there are still people at Premier League clubs reluctant to take that risk. Talent isn’t always as obvious as Raheem Sterling or Wayne Rooney.

Harry Kane has been phenomenal in attack at Tottenham Hotspur since being given his chance to shine

Sometimes, as with Harry Kane, it takes time to develop and that only comes with games.

It’s only a year ago that some at Tottenham would have questioned whether he was Champions League quality. They’re not now, but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him.

Germany have German owners and, by and large, German coaches and they’re world champions. Their clubs and football association co-operate.

We don’t have such unity so it is no surprise that our international record is what it is.
