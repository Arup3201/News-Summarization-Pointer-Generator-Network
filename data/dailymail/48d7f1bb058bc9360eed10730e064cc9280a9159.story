The novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, former wife of Kingsley Amis, has died aged 90.

She died peacefully at home in Bungay, Suffolk, following a short illness.

Best known for The Cazalet Chronicles, a series of semi-autobiographical books about an affluent family living in pre- and post-war London (the fifth and final installment of which was published in November), the prolific writer was also famed for her love affairs with prominent men, chiefly fellow writers and actors.

A natural beauty who modelled for Vogue in the late 1940s, Howard was married three times, first aged 19 to Sir Peter Scott, the conservationist son of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott and the man with whom she had her only child, daughter Nicola.

But just four years later Howard left both husband and daughter to pursue a literary career, marrying actor and writer Jim Douglas-Henry in 1958, staying in the dreadfully unhappy union for five years.

After beginning an affair with him while he was married to Hilary Bardwell, Howard herself married novelist Sir Kingsley Amis in 1965, becoming stepmother to his three children, including his son Martin, but they had a tempestuous relationship and divorced in 1983, never speaking again.

Martin Amis has, however, credited his stepmother with encouraging him to pursue literature, first as a recreational reader, then as a novelist.

She gave him his first copy of Pride And Prejudice, written by her favourite author, Jane Austen.

Between - and often during - her marriages she had numerous love affairs with famously artistic men including Arthur 
Koestler, Cyril Connolly and Kenneth Tynan.

She once described herself, saying: 'I was a tart for affection most of my life.'

Howard even had relationships with the poets Cecil Day-Lewis - husband of her best friend Jill Balcon - and Laurie Lee - married to her friend Cathy - and became godmother to daughters of each couple.

Speaking to Elizabeth Day in The Observer in April, Howard said: 'I was very happy with Laurie, whom I loved dearly. And I never had any - I want to make this clear, Cathy knew this - I never had any designs on him.

'I just took that bit of pleasure as it came and it was wonderful, and we all knew each other and we never had a cross word.

'I mean, most people would think it was rather shocking I expect but it didn't shock us and we were the people in it.

'If a very attractive man makes a dead set at you and you're very lonely, it's very difficult to resist him... I think I was very given to getting ambushed.'

Things with Day-Lewis, on the other hand, did not end so well: 'He ended up by being very angry with me because I left and he said, "You shouldn't have done that, you're a whore" and lot of rather bitter poems came out.'

Howard was born in London on 26 March 1923, and grew up in a Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill - the same road in which The Cazalet Chronocles opens - in a large house full of brothers and servants.

The daughter of an unhappy marriage between a timber merchant and a ballerina, Howard had a difficult relationship with her own mother, who constantly told her she was unattractive, and left home before she reached her 20s.

Her disappointing childhood left her vulnerable when it came to love, and she described herself as 'a tart for affection'.

She is survived by her daughter Nicola, with whom she was reconciled following a turbulent start to their relationship.
