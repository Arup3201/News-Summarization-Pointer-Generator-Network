A bride-to be hanged herself just weeks before her wedding because she was so worried about becoming the centre of attention, an inquest heard.

Leanne Baker, 35, was discovered by her fiancé after hanging herself at their home in Huddersfield, West Yorks on June 2, last year.

Miss Baker, who worked as a retail manager, had suffered from depression five years earlier but had recovered with treatment and medication.

However her anxiety and stress had returned in April 2013 which culminated in her taking an overdose the following month.

The inquest heard she was anxious about her imminent marriage ceremony abroad as she did not like being the centre of attention in Lindos, Greece, which was due to take place on June 10 last year.

Speaking today, Miss Baker's parents John and Carol Baker have spoken about the 'cruel illness' which took their daughter before her wedding.

Carol, 67, a textile worker, married to 67-year-old retired carer John, said: 'She was very nervous. She just couldn't cope.

'She came out of work one day and said: "Mum, that illness has come back".

'She tried everything, but she was in a panic because she wanted to be herself for the wedding.

'The wedding had all been paid for but she couldn't cope. She said to me: "I have everything I want but I've got nothing, it's just black'.

'It was the illness that took her, it wasn't my daughter. We were so so close  and it's such a cruel illness.

'She was really ill. She said to me: "If I were a dog mum they'd shoot me".

Leanne had everything planned for her wedding day - including the cake and dress - but suffered from depression

The inquest heard that Leanne had told her parents and fiance about her fears that her depression had returned and she worried she wouldn’t be well enough to go ahead with her wedding abroad.

She told the mental health team that she had no doubt about spending her life with her partner David Jackson, the Coroner's Court heard.

The court heard on May 4, 2013, Leanne took an overdose and attempted to take her own life and was admitted to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary for two weeks.

She was seen by mental health services as an outpatient at Folly Hall on May 16.

Leanne told practitioner Victoria Wilford at that appointment she did not regret her overdose actions and had ‘thoughts of not wanting to be here’.

After the appointment her parents agreed to be with her when her fiance was at work so she was rarely alone.

She was referred for home-based intensive treatment by a Community Psychiatric team as an alternative to hospital.

She was in contact with the team daily and was said to be showing signs of getting better.

Her
 anxiety over her wedding was affecting her mood and she had suicidal 
thoughts but repeatedly said she was not going to act on it.

But the court heard on June 2 her fiance left her at home to visit his mother and found her hanged when he returned.

West Yorkshire Coroner Mary Burke said that she was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that Leanne was fully aware of the consequences of her actions.

Ms Burke, who expressed her sympathy to the family, concluded: 'I am also satisfied she intended the consequences would be to end her own life.

'In conclusion Leanne Baker has killed herself'.

Afterwards her mother, who described herself and Leanne as 'best friends', explained that her daughter had everything planned 
for her wedding day - including the cake and dress.

She said: 'It was an expensive dress that would have been £1,500 but my friend owns a bridal shop and gave it for sale price.

'About 30 guests were going - all our friends and family.  Leanne had always wanted to get married abroad, she used to say it when she was a little girl.'

Leanne had always wanted to get married abroad, and had chosen Lindos in Greece for her big day

She added: 'It's just devastating. The whole family are devastated. It wasn't my daughter that did it, it was the illness.

'She was the most wonderful daughter a mother could have. I want people to know how lovely and precious she was to us.

'We
 were with her every day for a month. Dave is still living with us. He's
 had cancer twice and then this, I just think what a lonely place to 
be.'

The family have set up the Leanne Baker Trust Fund to raise money for charity.

They will be holding a curry night and 
auction at the Pink Elephant in Meltham, West Yorkshire, in March, and 
Leanne's brother Darren will also auction some of his artwork.

Carol added: 'People have been really supportive and I want to thank them for that.'
