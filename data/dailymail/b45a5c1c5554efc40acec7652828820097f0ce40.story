Made in Chelsea fans were up in arms when Jamie Laing rejected pretty co-star Binky Felstead in favour of newcomer Lucy Watson.

But the loveable, pint-sized blonde won the sympathy of the viewers once again after Lucy rejected his invitation to a party and instead arrived on the arm of Jamie's friend Andy Jordan.

'There is ridiculous drama this season. Andy is a chief, he's a schweff who likes girls more than his mates.

Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing says newcomer Lucy is a 'b***h' and Andy values girls over his friends

Jamie found it hilarious that Lucy ditched him for friend and co-star Andy Jordan

'As much as I was annoyed that she rejected me, Lucy is a b***h who doesn't care what people think of her, she's hilarious.

'The situation between us is pretty bad as you'll see tonight. We're not mates, she doesn't like me,' he told MailOnline.

The 22-year-old reality TV star has had his fair share of love interests on the show and avid fans will remember his love predicament with Binky earlier this season.

After she announced that she will be buying her former flame a 'Guilty Pour Homme' fragrance for Christmas, Jamie feels nothing but remorse.

Jamie says he accepts that he didn't treat Binky well and has bought her a 'sweet' Christmas present to make up for it

'I think it's fair enough that she's buying me that; I deserve it. I've already got her present. Let's just say it's very sweet and you put it on your keys,' he said.

The star, who will be spending Christmas at home in Gloucestershire, is jetting off for some winter sun in Barbados with co-star and best friend Ollie Proudlock for the New Year.

'We've been to Barbados together before with Francis too but he is playing polo or something this time so can't come.

Jamie will be moving in with Proudlock, Francis and Spencer who he nicknames 'the pug'

'It's going to be so fun, partying and hanging out with girls on the beach.'

The three boys have as much off-screen rapport as on-screen and have spent the last year living together.

'I have had the most fun I've ever had in my life living with the boys this year and it is so upsetting that we have to move out of the house but we are looking for somewhere new and are going to take the plunge and live with Spencer too, it's going to be awesome,' he said.

Jamie, Proudlock and Spencer (who Jamie refers to as 'the pug') spent the day at the Kingdom of Sweets in Lakeside, Essex where Jamie's Candy Kittens range is being sold.

Jamie Laing has collaborated with Kingdom of Sweets to launch an exclusive Candy Kitten confectionary selection, Today was his third launch at Lakeside, Essex, with Spencer Matthews and Oliver Proudlock

Jamie will be hosting another pop-up store in London in December and the boys, including Spencer, will be supporting their friend

As well as the signature clothing and accessories featuring Jamie's trademark terms 'Let's Pardy' and 'Yeah Boi', the range will include winter bobble hats, lollipops and advent calendars.

His next pop-up shop will be opening on Carnaby Street, London in December for a month.

'I'm so excited. There's going to be Christmas jumpers, lots of snow, girls in sexy outfits, no coal and plenty of happiness,' he said.

If he had to chose anyone from the show to be a candy kitten (a gorgeous sweet-bearing girl), he would opt for Binky.

'I would choose Binks. Possibly Millie too but she is a bit too queenish at the moment. And Sophia is good looking and fun,' he said.

Jamie says he would choose Millie as a candy kitten but she is quite 'queenish' lately while Cheska is too busy looking for a boyfriend

And although it seems he has had his fair share of love for one season, Jamie hopes for more romance in the final weeks.

He said: 'Hopefully there will be some more romance for me. But if you look for a relationship it doesn't happen.

'I love her to bits but Cheska keeps looking and doesn't find anyone. Everyone she meets, she thinks will be her boyfriend.'

Kingdom Of Sweets stocks sweets from all over the world and has stores at Lakeside, Cardiff and on Oxford Street. Visit their online sweet store www.kingdomofsweets.com for all your favourite sweetie brands in one place!

Lucy Watson has only been in two episodes of Made In Chelsea and has already caused quite a stir.

After
rejecting Jamie Laing's invitation to Rosie Fortescue's dinner party, 
the self-confessed 'player' then turned up at the actual event with love
rival Andy Jordan.

It 
wasn't long before a row kicked off over dinner, with Lucy making 
everyone laugh in shock when she asked: 'Why is everyone getting up in 
my grill (business)?'
