Questions over Ed Miliband’s leadership were growing in the wake of the disastrous by-election result in Heywood, with MPs on all sides accusing him of being out of touch with working-class supporters.

As Ukip came within a whisker of victory in one of Labour’s safest seats, his critics complained of policies ‘aimed at the latte-sipping, chino-wearing, light Green, inner-city left’ but ignoring the concerns of most voters.

Senior MP Jack Straw even suggested his party leader’s ‘panda eyes and strange lips’ were putting voters off.

One MP said Mr Miliband faces a ‘bloodbath’ meeting with his party on Monday, with ‘furious’ backbenchers ready to tell him his complacent attitude is putting Labour heartlands at risk.

Ukip made an extraordinary and unexpected advance in the Heywood and Middleton by-election, prompted by the death of veteran MP Jim Dobbin. Despite Labour going into the contest with a majority of 6,000, Ukip finished just 617 votes behind – after a partial recount.

Yet incredibly, Mr Miliband insisted the result showed he was on course to win next year’s general election. Party strategists claimed a similar Ukip advance next year would hand all 14 marginal seats in the North West to Labour.

At a ‘victory’ meeting in Heywood, Mr Miliband said: ‘The Tories are a party losing in their own backyard and retreating from what they used to call their own frontline.’ 

But senior figures accused the Labour leader of complacency over the potential threat. 

Ex-minister Frank Field said: ‘If last night’s vote heralds the start of Ukip’s serious assault into Labour’s neglected core vote, all bets are off for safer, let alone marginal seats at the next election.’

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk warned: ‘We will not get elected on the basis of public sector workers, students, Guardian readers and the ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom. We need a much broader appeal than that.’

Former Cabinet minister Jack Straw was the most senior MP to raise doubts about Labour’s strategy, arguing its immigration message needed to be ‘stronger’. He said: ‘We could and should have done better.’

Addressing voters’ doubts about Mr Miliband, Mr Straw said he was a strong leader, but added: ‘I know people say he’s got panda eyes and strange lips – I could make the same remarks in different ways about Mr Clegg or Mr Cameron.’

John McTernan, a senior adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the Heywood result must put paid to Labour policies ‘aimed at the latte-sipping, chino-wearing, light Green, inner-city left’.

‘We are in deep, deep trouble,’ he added. ‘We are lost and our voters want us back. They keep sending us messages. When will we listen?’

He said the party had ‘lost the power of hearing’ by pretending voters were most concerned about the NHS, adding: ‘For voters, visitors and the casual observer it was a by-election about immigration. Even in politics a conversation isn’t simply waiting for your turn to speak – it has to be about engagement.’

Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, told Channel 4 News her party has ‘to talk about immigration’, adding: ‘We need much stronger action on employers who exploit immigration to undercut wages and jobs – and that’s something that comes up repeatedly on the doorstep.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Ed Miliband needs to step up to the mark. Amongst Labour voters there is a huge frustration.

'But … this is much more than, “Do we like Ed Miliband? What does he look like on the telly?”. 

'There’s a bigger issue: is Labour in touch with its core vote and with those people who voted Labour in 1997 but have abstained since? 

'Because that’s a lot of the people who … have shifted to Ukip – those lost five million voters from 1997.’

But one senior Labour MP told Sky News: ‘Where our problem lies is leadership. Wherever you go you hear, “It’s your leader”.’ The MP said a meeting of Mr Miliband and his backbenchers on Monday ‘could be an absolute bloodbath’. 

A colleague said: ‘As a retail proposition Miliband is dreadful … even people who aren’t interested in politics have an opinion on him: he’s weird.’

Former leadership contender Diane Abbott said the working class in Labour areas is ‘increasingly alienated from the Labour Party’. 

She added: ‘But what the right forgets to mention is that this process began under their hero, Tony Blair …Whenever you mentioned core Labour voters you were dismissed. 

'New Labour bigwigs insisted that those voters “had nowhere else to go”. Well now they are finding somewhere else to go: the SNP in Scotland, the Greens and Ukip.’

Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s deputy leader, said in an invitation to Labour MPs and councillors: ‘If you want to come and join what is now statistically the most working-class party … come over and join Ukip.’

Locals say Miliband's unannounced and brief visit to Haywood and Middleton had done nothing to ease the concerns of working class voters

Ed Miliband was under fire last night for failing to meet voters or answer questions from news-paper reporters.

In a brief victory speech in the Heywood and Middleton constituency, Mr Miliband insisted he was listening to the concerns of ordinary people – but he then swept through a public library without speaking to anyone.

And he ignored questions from reporters on how Liz McInnes won the Lancashire seat by just 617 votes. Aides awaiting his arrival had claimed he would be ‘too busy to give any interviews’.

Only a handful of newspaper reporters were present among the television crews, with Labour officials giving little notice of Mr Miliband’s appearance.

Flanked by around 30 hastily assembled supporters, he gave a three-and-a-half minute address claiming he was capable of leading the fight against the ‘disillusionment and despair’ that had cost all the main parties votes. 

Afterwards, bewildered locals said his fleeting and unannounced visit had done nothing to tackle Labour’s problem with working class voters.

‘He seems like a bit of a coward to come all the way up here but then not meet ordinary people,’ one disgruntled constituent said. 

Retired businesswoman Anne Haworth, 67, who was in the library at the time, said she had not been impressed by Mr Miliband’s personal manner.

‘He just swept through without even looking at anybody on the way past,’ the grandmother of three added. ‘He doesn’t really help himself.’
