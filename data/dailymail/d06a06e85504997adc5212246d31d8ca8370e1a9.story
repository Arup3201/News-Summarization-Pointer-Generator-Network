Pupils should be encouraged by state schools to join a cadet force to improve their character strengths, Michael Gove said last night.

The Education Secretary wants head teachers to boost children’s so-called soft skills, such as showing respect, being self-motivated and coping under pressure.

Mr Gove said employers demanded these traits, as well as resourcefulness and tenacity.

It was not enough for teachers to simply concentrate on academic progress – they must help create a workforce with ‘attractive personal qualities’, he added, which could be achieved by promoting more school cadet force units.

In a speech today to highlight the need for schools to do more to build children’s character, he was expected to say: ‘Business – quite rightly – points out that it needs workers who possess not just impressive academic qualifications but attractive personal qualities.

‘Employees need to be self-disciplined, capable of subordinating their own instincts and interests to the needs of the team, responsive and respectful towards others, resourceful under pressure, tenacious and self-motivating. 

The Education Secretary wants children's soft skills to be developed to make them more employable

‘Increasingly, they also need to be creative in the face of adversity, quick-thinking when presented with unexpected challenges.

‘A central element of our long-term plan for schools is the cultivation of those virtues – character strengths – through activities such as team sports, cadet forces, debating, dance, music and drama. It’s why we’re expanding the number of cadet forces in state schools.’

Of the 256 school combined cadet force units in England, 196 are based at independent schools, with just 60 in the state sector.

The units can include cadets from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and Royal Marines.

The Ministry of Defence provides uniforms, training expertise, equipment and access to military training areas, camps and courses. Prime Minister David Cameron, who was a cadet at Eton, has pledged to add 100 state school cadet units by the end of next year.

Mr Gove’s comments come after the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and the CentreForum think-tank said last month that the development of children’s ‘character and resilience’ was so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after-school clubs. In a report, they called for teenagers to receive a school leaving certificate detailing their extra-curricular activities and employability skills.

The ‘character and resilience manifesto’ report said the certificates could show that pupils had gained skills such as the ability to bounce back from setbacks.

Meanwhile, the Education Secretary will today also call on all firms to offer apprenticeships for young people, saying concerns that it involved too much red tape had been addressed.

Speaking at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey, he is expected to throw down the gauntlet to businesses and say: ‘There is no reason why every company in the country should not be offering apprenticeships.

‘We set ourselves the challenge of simplifying the apprenticeship programme and making it more responsive to employers’ needs, so no employer could have any excuse for standing aloof.’
