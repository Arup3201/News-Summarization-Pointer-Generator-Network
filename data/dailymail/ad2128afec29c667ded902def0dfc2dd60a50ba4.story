Detectives hunting for Madeleine McCann are preparing to send sniffer dogs into a shop where a suspect was spotted with a little girl on the day the three-year-old disappeared.

Police sniffer dogs have been brought in to search areas of interest in Praia da Luz, from which Madeleine vanished in 2007.

There were a number of sightings of a man carrying a child away from the holiday apartments where her family were staying and police are now focusing on a building between the resort and the beach which witnesses say the man and entered with the child, reports the Daily Mirror.

Madeleine, then aged three, went missing from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in May 2007

Portuguese TV station SIC, which broke the news of the shop search, said: 'Other work is still to be confirmed, including searches in a commercial premises in Praia da Luz where someone is said to have seen a man with a child similar to Madeleine entering around the time of her disappearance,  a procedure which may require judicial authorisation unless approved by the owner of the premises.'

It comes after four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal on Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound reinvestigation of the case.

Officers from Operation Grange are believed to be using sniffer dogs to search the cars of two suspects quizzed earlier this week (it is not known if the men pictured are the ones having their vehicles inspected)

None of the suspects have been identified by police though three are believed to be Portuguese while another is originally from Russia

The suspects are said to be three Portuguese nationals and Russian computer expert Sergey Malinka, whose Praia da Luz home was searched by police shortly after Madeleine went missing in May 2007.

A spokesman for South Wales police told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that two South Wales Police specialist dog handlers, and victim detection dogs, have been deployed to assist with the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

'The officers are working as part of a small team of team of British police officers, led by Metropolitan Police Service, in conjunction with the Portuguese authorities.

'They can be deployed in a wide a variety of locations such as buildings, open areas and vehicles.'

According to the Daily Mirror, the animals will search cars belonging to two of the suspects being quizzed by officers from Operation Grange.

The dogs, 7-year-old English Springer Spaniels named Tito and Muzzy, were used in the search for April Jones in 2012.

The four men emerged as key suspects after analysis of mobile phone records suggested they were close to the scene of her disappearance when she went missing.

Sniffer dogs were earlier used by officers to search waste ground near to the site where Madeleine vanished

Officers from Operation Grange scoured three sites in Praia da Luz but found no new evidence

All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens, while one is believed to be of Russian origin. They have all been summoned to be interviewed but there have been no arrests.

In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case.

Scotland Yard said at the time that ‘more activity’ had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ‘first phase’ of a major investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Metropolitan Police inquiry, was among those present at the interviews earlier this week.

The new round of questioning comes less than three weeks after police dug up waste land near the Ocean Club where the McCann family were staying at the time of their daughter's disappearance.

Officers inspected sewers using a hi-tech camera over nearly a fortnight in a grim search for Madeleine's body.

The search and this week's police quizzes have happened at the request by Operation Grange detectives leading the British hunt for Madeleine.

Scotland Yard are working on the theory burglars killed Madeleine during a bungled break-in while her parents ate tapas nearby with friends - and then buried her body on waste ground in the resort.
