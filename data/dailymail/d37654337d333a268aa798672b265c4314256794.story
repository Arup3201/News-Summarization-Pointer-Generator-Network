Hoverboards have become an obsession for amateur designers ever since Marty McFly jumped on one in Back to the Future II.

Now, one Texan claims he has finally been able to create his own version for just £160 ($250) using garden leaf blowers that float on a pocket of air.

Ryan Craven, 27, built the device using four leaf blowers, a 4ft by 4ft (1.2 by 1.2 metre) piece of plywood, a skateboard deck, shower liner, coffee can lids and gaffer tape.

He claims that anyone can build their own in eight steps using simple tools that include a tape measure, sand paper, staple gun and a hole saw.

The waiter said he came up with the idea after seeing another hoverboard project on Kickstarter, which inspired him to design one which anyone can build.

'I'm a huge Back to the Future fan and always wanted to build one,' he said. 'I saw the HUVR Kickstarter campaign with Tony Hawk and thought it was the perfect time to try building one.'

'It can move quite a bit once it's going, and despite the steering issue, which really isn't quite there, you can go quite far and move a little bit.

Mr Craven explained that the device is essentially a miniature version of a hovercraft. He has also released instructions for anyone who would like to make their own.  

A skirt fills with air that is released below from strategically placed holes that create a small pocket between the device, dubbed 'Mr Hoverboard', and the ground. 

The Hendo hoverboard uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other

In October, Californian architect Greg Henderson made a similar hoverboard that floats in mid-air.

Dubbed the Hendo Hoverboard, the technology uses four 'hover engines' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath.

The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes.

As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster.

That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air. In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground.

Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field.  

'The Back to the Future hoverboard has always been the impossible dream, but I wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use, and not too expensive,' added Mr Craven.

'There are so many variations of skateboard and this one could easily end up being just another variation.

'But I would love for people to take my idea and develop it to the point where it becomes universal.'

The design becomes even more staggering as Mr Craven is not a designer or inventor – and he says his first prototypes were far from perfect.

'I'm not an engineer,' he said. 'I work in a restaurant, so it's pretty naive of me to buy four leaf blowers.

'I'm pretty much broke all the time usually and if people want to donate then that would be wonderful.

Mr Craven has been working on the design since March and the early prototypes had wheels and were much smaller at first.

'One was even powered by a disassembled hairdryer, until I finally hit on the idea of the leaf blowers,' he said. 'They were crude. Frankensteinish.

'The process is very chaotic and it's so much easier to fail than to succeed.'

Mr Craven is now working on the next version which he hopes will be quieter, with improved air flow and less vibration.
