Pub quiz question: Who were Mrs Grose, Mrs Pearce, Mrs Hudson, Mrs Danvers and Mrs Hughes? Answer: They were famous housekeepers. But you get an extra point if you also knew that none was married.

In the arcane world of upstairs-downstairs protocol, Mrs was a courtesy title, implying respectability. Marriage for a housekeeper, because it would have been ‘a distraction from her service’, was actively frowned upon by employers, so they tended to be widows at best.

By 1871, there were 140,836 housekeepers in Britain, stern-faced and meticulous women for whom nothing was too much trouble if it ‘added to the comfort’ of the gentry. They were sad creatures really: abstainers, early risers, methodical, punctual, discreet, implacable.

A housekeeper was in charge of everything from the store cupboards to the linen closets, ‘a large bunch of keys clinking at the waist as they checked their housemaids’ work’.

She would busy herself repairing and replacing napkins, towels and dusters. She oversaw sewing and jam-making operations. When family members were due to arrive, she ensured there were ‘no dust sheets on the furniture, fresh flowers in all the vases, beds aired, linen crisply ironed and every fireplace scoured and gleaming’.

It was the housekeeper’s duty to conceal the ‘frantic preparations behind the scenes’.

She was, says Tessa Boase, ‘a senior management figure of absolute authority’. Or at least that has always been the supposition, and is how these female counterparts to butlers have been presented in films and fiction.

The truth is more scandalous — this is one of those social history studies that uncovers such iniquities, the reader howls with rage.

When Boase set out to discover the real human stories behind the green baize doors, the first thing she found was that allegedly beloved and valued housekeepers had no financial cushion, pension provision or job security.

Slaving until they were racked with rheumatism on their deathbeds, throughout the 19th century they were lucky to be paid £35 a year (£1,500 today). To put this in perspective, the average aristocrat earned an annual £60,000 from his estates (£3.6 million today). 

Scandalous truth: Being a housekeeper wasn't as perfect as it appears to be in Downton Abbey

Furthermore, a housekeeper seldom emerged into the fresh air. They had to scurry along tunnels and passageways (designed so that female staff never glimpsed stable lads) and owing to these ‘troglodyte conditions’ often  had an anaemic appearance and vitamin D deficiency. There was no sick pay, of course.

A housekeeper had to be supplicatory, bowing and scraping. ‘She was entirely at the mercy of her mistress’s good humour,’ says Boase, and many of those old trouts could be ‘prey to capricious mood changes and querulous demands’.

They would order, cancel and re-arrange lunch parties for 100 guests,  heedless of the practicalities or disruption.

When Mrs Penketh, housekeeper at Erdigg in North Wales, got into an understandable muddle with the grocery budget owing to her mistress’s extravagance, she was accused of embezzlement, put in prison and ended her days in Salford Workhouse.

If Grace Higgens, Vanessa Bell’s housekeeper at Charleston, ever had the cheek to risk a day off, she’d come back to find the sink full of dirty dishes ‘or the fridge full of rotting meat’. She wasn’t allowed feelings or a life of her own.

Boase’s most outrageous case, however, concerns Mrs Doar, of Trentham Hall, one of the many seats of the Marquis of Stafford. Despite 14 years’ devoted service, she was sacked for expecting a baby.

‘It would be a bad example to others, and a Housekeeper who has Maids to look after should not be bearing children even to their husbands,’ thundered Lady Stafford.  Mrs Doar, uniquely, was married — though Mr Doar had to live separately in Stoke-on-Trent. The fact of the matter was that a pregnant servant had no rights.

‘Servants were not supposed to have children,’ says Boase. ‘No matter what the circumstances — betrothed, seduced, raped — getting pregnant was grounds for immediate dismissal without a reference.’

Two-thirds of the abandoned babies at London’s Foundling Hospital came from women in service.

‘Another way out was infanticide.’ (The late Queen Mother found an ingenious solution to the problem: at Clarence House she mostly hired gay men.)

Even though Trentham Hall was empty for all but six weeks of the year, ‘it is quite impossible in such an establishment to permit her breeding’, Lady Stafford continued, outraged at Mrs Doar’s presumption. The housekeeper was given her marching orders.

But first her bags were opened for inspection. They were found to contain ‘quantities of tea, sugar, coffee, foreign wine, soap, candles and mops’ — so in addition to being with child, the terrified woman was accused of pilfering.

‘It is dreadful to contemplate such depravity in one who had every confidence placed in her,’ gasped her erstwhile employer melodramatically, no doubt thinking what an incursion had been made into the Marquis’s £200,000 annual income by those mops.

If I’d been Mrs Doar, I’d have burned the bloody house down.

Boase failed to find out what happened next, but suspects the workhouse — from where Mrs Doar’s child would have been taken, and she herself would have ended her days ‘eating gruel’.

One good thing about two World Wars, the reader will concede, is that country house life was much retrenched by hostilities and the servants set free.

Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, for instance, changed its use ‘from indulgent weekend chateau to war hospital’. The housekeeper, Mrs Mackenzie, organised the conversion of the salons into wards. Fine furniture and oil paintings were removed to the cellars.

B eside the rococo marble fireplaces and beneath gilded ceilings, doctors amputated gangrenous limbs — the housekeeper attending as a nurse.

One thing didn’t change: wounded officers could use the front door, but other ranks limped in through the servants’ quarters.

Of the housekeepers remaining in 2014, one is Ms Nicky Garner at Holkham Hall. ‘I’m up close and personal with Lady Coke’s clothes, her shoes, her children,’ she says. ‘I’m part of an extended family.’ Nicky is ‘waging war on the moth infestation’, and feeds her ladyship’s parrot, Basil.

Even in the 21st century, however, Nicky is aware that she’ll be ticked off if she is over-familiar. Nicky may be Nicky to all, but Lord and Lady Coke are always Lord and Lady Coke, except I imagine to each other.

‘It’s a humble position; there is a lot of yes sir, no sir,’ admits the thoroughly modern housekeeper. I do hope the excellent Ms Garner garners more than £35 a year.
