Oscar Pistorius's sister left court in tears today after accusing a self-confessed hitman of mouthing abuse at her during her brother's sentencing hearing.

Aimee Pistorius claims underworld gun-for-hire Mikey Schultz mouthed 'f*** you' after she expressed discomfort that he was occupying seats normally reserved for the sprinter's family. 

The dispute came on another dramatic day in court as the Paralympian battled to avoid a jail term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

It began with warm applause for Judge Thokozile Masipa's 67th birthday, but descended into scenes of near farce with the Pistorius family demanding immediate police protection.

Mr Schultz, who arrived at court shortly before the lunch break, claims a police officer motioned that the only seats available were next to the Pistorius family.

Hitman: Mikey Schultz, the self-confessed killer of South African mine magnate Brett Kebble, claims he and a friend were told by the Pistorius family to move from their seating area 'like we were dogs'

But within ten minutes taking his seat, tattooed Mr Schultz had stormed out of court, claiming the athlete's family had told him and his friend to move 'like we were dogs'.

Complaining loudly to reporters, he said: 'Who do they [the Pistorius family] think they are? Do they think they own the front row?'

Once Judge Masipa had adjourned for an early lunch, the clearly distressed and tearful Miss Pistorius reported the incident to her brother Carl, prompting him to ask for immediate police protection for the family and for Mr Schultz to be banned from court.

Outside the Pretoria high court, Mr Schultz joined two friends - both known rivals of the double amputee - where he gave an impromptu television interview to deny Miss Pistorius's story.

He said: 'Clearly the Pistorius family are a bunch of liars, just like Oscar' adding with a heavy hint of sarcasm: 'They are the victims, always the victims.'

He denied mouthing any abuse. 

Mr Schultz, whose immunity from prosecution for his role in the 2005 contract killing of mining magnate Brett Kebble was ironically negotiated by Gerrie Nel, is not known to have any direct 'bad blood' with 27-year-old Pistorius, unlike the two friends who flanked him outside court.

Pistorius is said to have threatened to 'break the legs' of Mark Batchelor, a retired footballer, whom he suspected his girlfriend Samantha Taylor of cheating on him with, and Jared Mortimer, who sent the athlete flying to the floor after they were involved in a scuffle at a nightclub in July. 

As the burly trio of Mr Schultz, Mr Mortimer and Mr Batchelor huddled together rather menacingly at the entrance to the court house during the lunch adjournment, Pistorius narrowly missed a potentially excruciating encounter.

As the Paralympic gold medallist strode purposefully up the road in search of lunch, a gaggle of police officers had to run to catch up with him to offer rather tardy protection.

Today was not the first appearance that Mr Schultz has put in court.

On Tuesday, he sat with Mr Mortimer, Mr Batchelor and Miss Taylor on benches reserved for the Steenkamp family and their friends.

Their glowering presence clearly unsettled Pistorius in the dock, leading his uncle Arnold, the patriarch of the sprinter's family, to have his nephew escorted home from court by police out of 'fear for Oscar's safety.'
