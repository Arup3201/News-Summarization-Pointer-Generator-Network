Mystery surrounds the disappearance of a mother from North Carolina in August after a search by more than 100 people this weekend failed to yield any clues.

Crystal Morrison, 31, was last seen on August 23, shortly after she called a friend at 12.41 p.m. to pick her up from her customer services job in Concord, saying she felt sick.

But before the friend arrived to collect her 20 minutes later, Crystal took off on foot. Colleagues said she did not tell them she was leaving.

A co-worker later told police they 
had seen Crystal at about 1.00 p.m., walking on the road leading away 
from their workplace, though where she may have been headed remains 
unclear.

Mystery: Crystal Morrison, pictured, was last seen on August 23 after she walked from work, but relatives say she would not have run away as she was devoted to her eight-year-old son Kyson, right

Family members insist Crystal would not have left her eight-year-old son Kyson behind, and said the mother also requires daily medication and an inhaler for her asthma.

They added that she has no
known enemies. She has been divorced from her husband for several years and he now lives in another state.

'The $30 million question is, why did she 
walk out? Why did she leave after she made the phone call?' Kevin 
Ryan, the private investigator hired by the family, asked the  Charlotte Observer. 

'Based on the interviews I've done, I can almost say for certainty that she definitely did not run away. Someone out there 
knows where she's at and what’s going on. I honestly believe that.'

This weekend, the CUE Center for Missing Persons in Wilmington partnered with the Concord police to search  a four-square-mile area near Connextions Recruiting, where Crystal worked.

Hunt: Search teams look for clues in a four-square-mile area near to the place she vanished

Committed: More than 100 people used ATVs, cars, dogs and horses to search the area this weekend

Undeterred: Family members said that the mission yielded no new leads but they would continue to search

Some teams searched by foot while others used horses, all terrain vehicles, canine units and cars to scour the area, but they came across no leads, according to a Facebook group set up to find her.

'The area was searched thoroughly and nothing was found. At least we can eliminate those areas,' the group reported.

Monica Caison, founder of the CUE Center, added: 'Nobody is going to give up looking for 
her, I know that. She's got some dedicated law enforcement that are 
working very hard on her case.'

Crystal's sister, Mechelle Carey, said the family are hopeful a discovery will be made soon.

'Every day, it really becomes in some
ways more unbelievable, but it also becomes your new normal,' she said.
'I think we’re honest about the fact that we're praying for peace and 
whatever that entails.'

Where did she go? Crystal Morrison was seen walking around three miles from her workplace on August 23

No one has reported seeing Crystal since she was seen walking past the Mistletoe Ridge neighbourhood, and her bank account and credit cards have not been used since.

Carey said that working with a 
private investigator and the missing persons center has helped her 
family cope with her sister's disappearance.

'It's
something about having someone so focused on your case that just makes 
you feel less anxious,' she said. 'They've been a godsend for our 
family.'

She added that she is concerned for her nephew, Kyson, but that the family has rallied around him.

'This is about an 8-year-old little 
boy who needs his mom,' she said. “She’s a great mom and a great woman. 
And somebody knows something. That’s too busy of an area for someone not
to know something.'

Hope: An investigator said he does not think Crystal ran away but there have been no persons of interest

Prentice is about 5 ft 2 and weighs 100 pounds. She has blonde and red hair, blue eyes and has her son's name, Kyson, tattooed on the back of her neck.

She was last seen wearing a white blouse with black flower print, black pants, black high-heel shoes and carrying a black purse.

Anyone with information should call the Concord Police Department at (704) 920-5580.
