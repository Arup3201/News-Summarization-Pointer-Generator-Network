Stuart Freeborn, one of the greatest make-up artists in Hollywood history, has died aged 98.

The 'maestro' of film make-up created the Star Wars characters Chewbacca and Jedi master Yoda, and worked on dozens of huge hits including Superman, Alice in Wonderland, Dr Strangelove and The Omen.

Largely self-taught, Freeborn resisted his insurance broker father's attempts to have him follow in his footsteps and instead went on to create make-up and prosthetics for such cinematic legends as Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers.

He said in a documentary last year: 'I didn't want to spend my life in an office. I felt I was different.'

He died on Tuesday in London from a combination of ailments due to his age, according to his grandaughter Michelle Freeborn.

LucasFilm confirmed Freeborn had passed away, 'leaving a legacy of unforgettable contributions.'

Star Wars director George Lucas said in a statement that Freeborn was 'already a makeup legend' when he started working on Star Wars.

Lucas said: 'He brought with him not only decades of experience, but boundless creative energy.

'His artistry and craftsmanship will live on forever in the characters he created. His Star Wars creatures may be reinterpreted in new forms by new generations, but at their heart, they continue to be what Stuart created for the original films.'

Michelle Freeborn, who lives in Wellington, New Zealand, said her grandfather was like a 'hero' to her and inspired her and her late father to get into the movie business, too.

She said: 'He was a really fun and imaginative individual. He gave you the feeling that if you wanted to achieve something, you should just get on and do it, and don't ever use excuses.

Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put himself into Yoda, and his inquisitive elfin features bear resemblance

Freeborn's six-decade career led him to work on many classics, including Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Born
in London in 1914, Freeborn was the son of a Lloyds of London insurance
broker. He told a BBC documentary last year that he resisted pressure 
to follow in his father's footsteps because he felt he was different.

1930s, working for Hungarian-born director Alexander Korda, and honing 
his makeup skills on stars including Marlene Dietrich and Vivien Leigh.

After
air force service during World War II, he worked on British cinema 
classics including The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and David Lean's 
1948 version of Oliver Twist.Â 

His
transformation of Alec Guinness into Fagin -complete with a large 
hooked nose - was criticized by some as anti-Semitic, a matter of regret
for Freeborn, who said he was partly Jewish.

Freeborn later worked with Kubrick, transforming Peter Sellers into multiple characters for Doctor Strangelove before designing the apes for the 2001 Dawn of Man sequence, in which primates react to a mysterious monolith.

But he will likely be best remembered for his work on Star Wars - creating characters such as the 7-foot-tall wookie Chewbacca and the slug-like Jabba the Hutt.

Irvin Kershner, who directed The Empire 
Strikes Back, said: 'Freeborn quite literally put himself into Yoda, as 
the Jedi master's inquisitive and mischievous elfin features had more 
than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself.'

Yoda's looks were also said to be partly inspired by Albert Einstein.

Freeborn recalled being approached by George Lucas when he was a young man.

'He
was so genuine about it, I thought, well, young as he is, I believe in 
him. He's got something. I'll do what I can for him,' Freeborn told the 
BBC.

Nick Maley, a makeup artist who worked 
with Freeborn in the 1970s, called him a mentor who ran his department 
like a headmaster.

'It was my years working with him that helped me learn how to think, how to solve problems, how to not take the most obvious path,' Maley said.

'Everybody will remember him for Star Wars, but he did so much more than that. No one should overlook the groundbreaking work he did on 2001: A Space Odyssey. That was really the forerunner of Star Wars and used a lot of the same technology.'

Freeborn's wife, Kay, died in 2012. Freeborn's three sons - Roger, Ray and Graham - also died before him.

In addition to Michelle, Freeborn is survived by seven grandchildren and a number of great-grandchildren.
