A peaceful, child-free zone with the Egyptian sun beaming down by the poolside was the holiday Ray Green had hoped for at the Three Corners Ocean View at El Gouna.

Instead the 52-year-old from Cramlington, Northumberland, who has a heart condition and can't walk more than 100m, found himself at the heart of a spring break-style all-night pool party. 

Mr Green says he was misled by the Thomas Cook brochure for the resort which offered no warning that regular parties with lasers and loud music, with revellers bused in from around the area, were held at the resort. 

He added that the bass in the sound system was at such a level it forced a glass to fall off the table of his room. 

Ray Green, 52, from Cramlington, Northumberland, received £250 compensation in vouchers from Thomas Cook after his supposed-to-be peaceful wintersun break to an El Gouna resort was ruined by a pool party

A quiet, sun-soaked pool was what Mr Green expected, but instead there was an all-night party, he said 

'The hotel was supposed to have a nice quiet pool area as advertised by Thomas Cook,' Mr Green told the Trinity Mirror. 

'It was lovely, no kids, no noise, just the Egyptian sun and relaxation. However, what Thomas Cook failed to promote in the brochure is that the normally quiet pool sometimes hosts a party starting at 10pm until sun-up.

'It was complete with lasers and people being bused in from all of El Gouna, and the bass actually made my glass fall off the table.

'The next day, the pool area was littered with people trying to sleep. The queue to complain to the customer relations desk that morning was large but she apparently was not available.' 

Mr Green also complained to the holiday company about the room he was given because it was too far from the main area of the hotel. 

Mr Green also complained his Three Corners Ocean View hotel room was too far from amenities

His complaints led to Thomas Cook changing its advertising to make it clear accommodation is in two blocks

'I was also unhappy about the room because we were put in an annex 150m (164yds) away from the main facilities, which was also not mentioned in the brochure,' he said. 

'As I get out of breath after 100m it was hard for me to walk back and forth to the amenities.'

Ray, who was on holiday with his partner, complained about both issues to Thomas Cook and received an offer of less than £100 in compensation, which was increased to £250 in vouchers following enquiries by the press.  

'I don't feel that they are taking me seriously because they have made an offer of £82 in vouchers,' he said before the increased offer, which he accepted because he wished to travel in the future with Thomas Cook.  

'I thought the days of miss-descriptions in holiday brochures were in the past.'

A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company 'would like to apologise to Mr Green for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Three Corners Ocean View in Hurghada.

'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers, and we are always concerned to hear of anything that could affect their enjoyment while on holiday with us.

'Our customer services team have been in touch with Mr Green since his return to the UK to offer our apologies, and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.'

Since the misunderstanding with Mr Green about his room's location, Thomas Cook has made a clarification on their website explaining that the resort's accommodation in in two separate blocks.  

The Thomas Cook representative said: 'We can confirm that we have reviewed all details for the Three Corners Ocean View on our website, as well as clarified the copy set to feature in future brochure editions.' 

However, there is still no mention of the pool parties in their literature, which is advertised within the hotel.  

'The hotel has a pool party. This is not mentioned in the brochure but advertised in hotel when it is in operation.

'It is on every Thursday from 10pm to 2.30am and it normally only operates from February to November. The hotel has confirmed that the last pool party was on November 6 for 2014 and during [Mr Green's] stay there was only this one pool party.'
