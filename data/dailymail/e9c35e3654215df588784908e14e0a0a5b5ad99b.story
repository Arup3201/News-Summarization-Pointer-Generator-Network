A woman who was killed by her violent ex-partner in a murder-suicide had called police 34 times in the weeks before her death.

Kelly Thompson was stabbed to death in her Point Cook home, north-west of Melbourne, in February by her ex-partner, Wayne Wood.

The police probe surrounding Ms Thompson's death will now be subjected to a review after it emerged investigating detectives were from the same station that failed to respond to a call for help on the night of the killing.

Ms Thompson, who started dating Wood back in 2009, took out an intervention order against him in January after he started become abusive last year.

Police escorted Wood to Ms Thompson's home on February 7 so he could collect his belongings and a day later her neighbour texted her to say she had seen Wood driving past the house several times.

When she didn't respond, her neighbours called the police and while they were on the phone through a window they spotted Wood standing in Ms Thompson's bathroom.

'The caller was told: "Don't worry about it, call us back if you hear screaming or broken glass",' the Thompsons' family lawyer, Paula Shelton, told the ABC's 7.30.

Police found Ms Thompson and Wood's body in the home three days later after her brother contacted authorities twice urging them to do a welfare check.

Her parents, Wendy and John, believe the 34 phones calls she made to police before her death were to report breaches of the order.

'They have failed, miserably failed - they have failed two people that are now dead and families that are shattered and it should never have happened and it quite simply was so preventable,' Mrs Thompson said.

In the weeks following their daughter's death, the Thompsons questioned the police investigation, in particular why local detectives from Wyndham station were handling the case due to the possibility that their colleagues failed to help Ms Thompson prior to her death.

'It smacks of conflict of interest from the bottom right through. And even with the detectives that investigated the murder, (they) have from the word go had this attitude that it was a simple murder-suicide,', Mrs Thompson said.

Victorian assistant commissioner Tim Cartwright admitted this week the system had failed.

'It's only when the family's raised it that we've understood that the system's broken down there somewhere and that the investigation was remaining in that local division,' he said.

'It concerns me, it concerns the chief commissioner, it concerns the people down the line. The system's failed in ensuring that what we thought would occur has occurred. We'll be looking at that making sure it doesn't occur again.'
