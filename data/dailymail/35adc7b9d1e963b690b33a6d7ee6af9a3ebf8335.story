An extreme hoarder burned down his house, killing himself and seriously injuring his sick mother, in an apparent act of defiance.

Dean Verboven, 42, reportedly set a fire in his cluttered, run-down home in Havemeyer Lane, Greenwich, Connecticut, just hours before state social workers were due to arrive and clear out the mess.

His 69-year-old mother Barbara Verboven is getting treated for severe burns at Bridgeport Medical Center.

SCROLL FOR VIDEO REPORT

Arson: Authorities survey the scene after Dean Verboven apparently sparked a blaze.

Gutted: Scorch marks and melted materials show the temperature of the hire, which may have been started with an accelerant.

Police said the fire department believe the fire was deliberately started. Greenwich Police Lieutenant Craig Gray said: 'The fire department has determined it was intentionally set.'

Neighbour Richard Meehan witnessed the blaze, which broke out at about 7am. He said: 'I rushed over and there was smoke pouring out of the house. 

'About that time they were bringing the lady out and about five or six minutes later we saw them take the second person out.'

Gutted: The home was filled with the Verbovens' clutter. Barbara Verboven remains in critical condition.

A dumpster was already at the site to be filled with the Verboven's belongings. The house has been an eyesore for years, 
attracting complaints from neighbors, CBS New York reported.

Neighbours said Barbara used to work for the Board of 
Education in Greenwich but became ill and her son was 
taking care of her.  The man of the house was a retired Greenwich cop who died in the 1980s.

The two were in a 'slow decline' and things got especially bad in the past five years, they added, but the mother and son were well-liked.

'I knew this boy since he was 8-years-old and they are sweet people, nice people,' Gladys Pardo said.

One neighbor said Barbara Verboven spent almost all her time in a single room of the house, eating and sleeping in a room with a television on 24 hours a day.

Daily paper Greenwich Time quoted Fire Chief Peter Siecienski, who said heavy fire gutted part of the first floor of the house where the two had their bedrooms, and smoke caused heavy damage to the second floor.

The state fire marshal's office brought a dog to the scene. The dogs are typically used to search for accelerants.

Assistant Fire Chief Bob Kick commended the firefighters. He said: 'They did a good job. They got in there quickly.'
