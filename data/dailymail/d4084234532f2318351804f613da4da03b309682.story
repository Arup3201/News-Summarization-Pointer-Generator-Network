A millionaire lawyer dubbed the Diva of Divorce is drawing up one of the most important pre-nups of her career - her own.

Ayesha Vardag represents tycoons and royalty and was a key player behind a 2010 ruling which made all pre-nuptial agreements binding in British courts.

Now the mother-of-three is planning her own lavish wedding to her fiancé, the astrophysicist turned finance guru and fellow millionaire Stephen Bence.

Flamboyant but cautious: Ayesha Vardag with her fiancé Stephen Bence in her office. The pair will wed in a plush Westminster Cathedral ceremony next month - and have drawn up a pre-nup agreement

True to form, their opulent, romantic ceremony in Westminster Cathedral next month will be preceded by something far drier - a complex legal agreement.

She told The Mail on Sunday's You magazine: 'Stephen and I are both multimillionaires in our own right.

'We know what is fair and we didn’t want to be subject to the whims of the court.

'I will be giving him an interest in my firm and he has already facilitated for me to have an interest in his firm, which is how we are reflecting our connectedness to each other's working lives.'

Ms Vardag, a flamboyant character who drives a red 1984 Mercedes convertible, lives with Mr Bence and their five children from previous relationships in central London.

They have been portrayed as a perfect 
picture of romance - and she even has a £20,000 Harry Winston peridot 
and diamond engagement ring to prove it.

But the lawyer is no stranger to marriage break-up in her own life.

Her sons Jasper, 18, and Felix, 17, 
are from her first marriage, while nine-year-old daughter Helena is from
 a subsequent relationship.

Mr Bence, meanwhile, is the father of ten-year-old Edward and Susanna, eight, both also from life before his current fiancée.

But the top lawyer's own experiences pale in insignificance compared to some of the clients she has represented.

Ms Vardag worked on Michelle Young's seven-year battle with her estranged tycoon husband Scot, who she claimed had hundreds of millions of pounds stashed away in secret accounts.

Ms Young - who wanted £300million - 
branded a £20million settlement 'disgraceful' and vowed to keep fighting
 in what was branded one of the bitterest battles in British history.

The
 lawyer has also been representing a former Miss Malaysia beauty queen 
seeking Britain's biggest ever divorce payout of £500million.

Pauline
 Chai demanded the settlement from her husband of 44 years, the Laura 
Ashley retail tycoon Khoo Kay Peng - one of the richest men in Malaysia.

In March a judge criticised the vast amount the pair had already spent on legal fees, reportedly more than £1million.

The amount Ms Chai is seeking is thought to have dropped as she now claims her husband's fortune is £440million.

In 2010, meanwhile, Ms Vardag worked on a historic case that changed the law on prenuptial agreements.

Heiress Katrin Radmacher won a ruling in the Supreme Court that the prenup 
she drew up in Germany to protect her £100 million fortune from her French-born 
husband was legally binding.

The
 process saw Lord Justice Thorpe call for a greater legal recognition of
 the agreements, saying: 'In future cases broadly in line with the 
present case on the facts, the judge should give due weight to the 
marital property regime into which the parties freely entered.'
