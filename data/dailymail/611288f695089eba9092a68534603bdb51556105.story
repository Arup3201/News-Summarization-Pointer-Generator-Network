A school coach driver who ran over and killed a ten-year-old boy as he dropped home students from one of the UK’s top private schools was spared jail today.

Former army corporal Michael Geale, 53, was momentarily distracted as he took an ‘inherently unsafe’ turn at the Royal Albert Hall in London hitting Yat Yeung Tin who was crushed to death under the wheels.

Geale had been dropping off the last students from Dulwich College, south London, when the tragedy struck.

Victim: Yat Yeung Tin, left, was hit by the coach Michael Geale, right, 
was driving and died from his injuries outside the Albert Hall in London

Alex Chalk, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court
that Geale had been approaching the turning to the Royal Albert Hall on
the inside of a white van - forcing him to swing into the road on the 
wrong side and hitting Yat Yeung Tin with the middle of the Excalibur 
coach as he righted himself.

He
said: ‘He did not see Yat Yeung Tin before the collision. He did not do
so because the manoeuvre he made was inherently unsafe.’

Geale
told police officers he was ‘distracted for a split second’ before he 
saw a flash or red and felt a ‘bump’ under his wheels.

Yat Yeung Tin, also known as Nemo, died at the scene from the massive injuries he received.

Michael Geale had his prison sentence suspended but is banned from driving for three years.

Judge Stephen Robbins told Geale that he 
took account of the fact he was sentencing him for causing death by 
careless not dangerous driving.

He said: ‘This is a case of a very tragic accident that resulted in the death of a young boy pedestrian aged only 10 years old at the time.

‘Nothing that this court says or does can possibly alter the terrible loss to this boy’s family.’

Nemo Tin, who was a Chinese national, had been walking home from school in his uniform when the collision happened at 5 pm on May 23 last year.

Witnesses said that the young boy did not appear to be aware of the coach until the last moment.

As he saw the coach, and the boy turned to his left and raised his hands in anticipation of the impact

Alex Chalk, prosecuting, said: ‘There 
was no time for him to jump away and he went straight to the floor 
passing under the rear wheels.

'Despite desperate efforts to save him, Nemo Tin died at the scene.'

Southwark Crown Court, London, where Mr Geale was given a suspended prison sentence and a three year ban from driving

Geale, a father of two, served as a corporal from 1976 to 1989 and carried out a tour of Northern Ireland where he came under fire.

After the accident he was seen in shock slumped in the foot-well of the coach.

He had been driving school children home from Dulwich College, as he did on a regular basis, and there were two boys left on the bus when tragedy struck.

Geale, of New Cross, south-east London, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving.

Karen Dempsey, defending, said: ‘This has had an absolutely devastating impact on Mr Geale and continues to do so.’

He has now lost his job with Excalibur Coaches, who attended the hearing to support him, and had an ‘overwhelming sense of guilt at any happiness in his life’, she said.

Ms Dempsey added: ‘Actually going to work itself has been very, very difficult for him.

‘Initially he avoided certain driving routes that went past the scene. On a daily basis he was transporting children to and from their place of education.’

He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work and banned from driving for three years.
