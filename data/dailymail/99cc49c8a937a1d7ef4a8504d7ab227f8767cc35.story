When Steven Isles' father went missing five years ago in highly publicised circumstances, he was touched by the outpouring of support he received from friends and strangers.

This week Mr Isles, from Townsville in Queensland, was devastated by the deaths Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.

But he was particularly upset at the prospect of Ms Dawson's three children having to spend their first Christmas without their mother.

So the 34-year-old decided to start a Christmas card drive to let Oliver, Chloe and Sasha know that the whole of Australia was thinking of them at this difficult time.

The 34-year-old, from Townsville, said he was devastated by the deaths of the two Sydney siege victims

'I just thought "What can we do?",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'People don't want to get in people's way when they go through terrible things in life.

'Even if they don't open one of those cards for months when they actually want to, or feel they need some form of outside strength, they can share in it.'

Mr Isles' father Senior Sergeant Mick Isles disappeared on his way to a training course in 2009 and his body was never found.

While an inquest was held in 2012 Steven Isles suggested there was foul play involving other police.

His father had been investigated over money laundering and drug trafficking, and while he was cleared of any wrongdoing his relationship with other officers suffered as a result.

The inquest eventually found that Mick Isles 'intentionally took his own life', after his car was found abandoned with keys on the floor under the steering wheel, and a shot gun and ammunition were missing from the family home.

Steven Isles said when his father first went missing he remembers lots of people dropping off meals and letters to show their support.

'You feel a bit bombarded at the time, but on reflection you go "Wow" - it certainly was a welcome distraction to have that much support,' he said.

CHRISTMAS CARDS FOR Oliver, Chloe and Sasha Dawson. Let them know we are all thinking of them.

At times of such tragedy we, Australians being the resilient people do what we do best and that is band together during someone’s time of need.

There is still time. When you are at the shops or the newsagent please buy a Christmas Card and send it to the three beautiful children Katrina Dawson leaves behind.

I have spoken with Sandy Dawson's [Katrina's brother] Clerk and commitment has been provided to deliver to Katrina's children all mail that arrives. Address cards to:

Oliver, Chloe & Sasha Banco Chambers Level 5/ 65 Martin Place Sydney NSW 2000

Share this message anywhere and everywhere, lets get as many cards as possible to these children and lets show them how many people are thinking of them

Thanks in advance everyone.

Proud to be an Aussie.

Mr Isles said he was talking about the tragedy amongst friends when he came up with the idea to start the Christmas card drive.

'I'm in Townsville, in north Queensland, and a few of us were talking as you do - the whole country shared the pain of the loss of these two people,' he said.

'Yes it's Christmas and some people raised concerns about do these children Oliver, Sasha and Chloe, is it the right time for them to get Christmas cards?

'And I guess it's embracing the time of year, we're saying every child deserves some sort of Christmas spirit.

'It's amazing how many people truly care - we don't want to tread on your toes we just want you to know we care.'

He first posted the idea on his Facebook page on Wednesday and it has been shared almost 500 times.

The Australian Missing Persons Register also shared his post on their Facebook page, which received over 4500 shares and almost 3000 likes.

Mr Isles has organised for the letters to be delivered and collected by the clerk at the chambers of Ms Dawson's brother, barrister Sandy Dawson.

He also sent his own card with a picture of two gold hummingbirds on it.

'I wrote 'Legends say hummingbirds float free of time and carry the hope of love', it's just a token to say Mum's always with you and she won't be forgotten.'
