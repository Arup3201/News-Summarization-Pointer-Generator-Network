Educator: Los Angeles teacher Thelmo Garcia, 37, is accused of placing a plastic over the head of a 10-year-old female student in class last month

A Los Angeles elementary school teacher was arrested this week after police say he placed a plastic bag over the head of a 10-year-old student.

Thelmo Garcia, 37, a fourth-grade teacher at Rosewood Elementary School, pleaded not guilty to one count of child abuse Friday, two days after he was taken into custody in connection to the February 5 incident.

According to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the educator placed a bag over the head of a girl in his class 'for several seconds' during school hours.

The child reportedly did not pass out after the stunt, according to CBS Los Angeles.

Investigators would not say whether Garcia was disciplining the girl, or just joking with her, as he's been known to do with other students.

Garcia has been with the Los Angeles Unified School District since 1999 and taught fourth grade at Rosewood since 2010.

The 37-year-old man was ordered held on $100,000 bail. If convicted, he could face up to six years in prison.

The school has suspended Garcia with pay pending an investigation.
