A pair of New York developers have created a religious app for Google Glass called JewGlass.

It has been designed to help Jewish users find nearby synagogues, get directions and menus for kosher restaurants as well as translate Hebrew text.

The app also reminds wearers when to pray, tells them when their day of rest, Shabbat, begins and ends, plus has a Parsha, or biblical text, of the week.

A pair of New York developers have created JewGlass, a religious app for Google Glass users. It has been designed to help Jewish users find nearby synagogues and the app also reminds wearers when to pray

When out and about, JewGlass users can find nearby kosher restaurants using the app. The app can also track users and alert them when its time to eat. Directions to the restaurants are shown in real-time on a display above the user's eye, pictured

Rusty Brick already makes around 30 apps designed for Jewish people.

There is an iPhone siddur (prayer book) and an app that features Passover 
Haggadah (religious text).

There
is also a No Chametz app, designed to help Jews get rid of all their 
chametz, or leavened bread, before the Passover holiday.

A Bedtime 
Shema App can guide children through evening prayer and a bar mitzva app can teach them about their portions.

An aleph-bet app can help users to learn Hebrew.

There are also apps that virtually tour the Old City and a Jewish radio app for Jewish music.

JewGlass was created by New York firm Rusty Brick, run by Jewish brothers Barrie and Ronnie Schwartz.

The company already creates iPhone and Android apps including an iPhone siddur (prayer book) and Passover Haggadah (religious text).

There is also a No Chametz app, designed to help Jews get rid of all their chametz, or leavened bread, before the Passover holiday as well as a Bedtime Shema App to guide children through evening prayer.

The JewGlass app sends notifications to the Google Glass screen that sits above the user's eye.

Users can ask the app to find directions for nearby synagogues or ask it to find a local kosher restaurant.

JewGlass can also track a user's location and when they enter a synagogue, prayer advisory notes, religious teachings and tips are displayed, left. The app additionally responds to voice commands and if a user needs to phone a Kosher restaurant, for example, they can call via the app, right, without the need for a phone

Directions to these locations are then shown in real-time on the display.

The
application can also track a user's location and when they enter a 
synagogue, prayer advisory notes, religious teachings and tips are also 
displayed.

When in a 
synagogue or kosher restaurant, texts and menus can also be translated from 
Hebrew and the translation can either be read aloud, or displayed on the
screen.

'By pushing 
contextual, geographic-aware, and time sensitive data directly into your
line of vision - JewGlass can help you remember things such as prayer 
time deadlines, where to find kosher eateries, what or what not to say 
while praying in synagogue and Shabbat start or end times', said Rusty 
Brick CEO Barry Schwartz.

'This is just the beginning, the practical applications are endless.'

Schwartz told The Jerusalem Post:
'It’s not a way of bringing people closer to Judaism, but a way to help
people who are already observing do it more efficiently.

Barry and Ronnie Schwartz from Rusty Brick in New York already make around 30 apps designed for Jewish people. Barry Schwartz said: JewGlass is 'not a way of bringing people closer to Judaism, but a way to help people who are already observing do it more efficiently'
