England’s ‘model’ councils will get a greater share of a multi-million pound fund being set aside to repair the country’s potholes.

The government is launching its biggest investment in roads since the 1970s, putting aside £168million to repair the potholes that blight the country’s roads and frustrate motorists.

More than three million potholes will be filled in by March next year and the money will be spread 148 councils. Each will get a share but those councils who demonstrate ‘best practice in highways maintenance’ will get additional funding.

Potholes are the bane of motorists' lives causing damage to cars and making driving uncomfortable and potentially dangerous

Nationwide: From Finchley in north London (left) to Hull in east Yorkshire (right) the country's roads are scarred with potholes

Among 
these are Northamptonshire, which will get £3.3million after it 
initiated systems to track pothole repairs in real time, allowing it to 
deploy teams and co-ordinate work more effectively.

Hampshire,
 where new pothole-fixing equipment can be converted to salt icy roads 
in winter, gets around £6million, while Lancashire will receive 
£4.9million.

Some £10million is also earmarked for London, the Department for Transport said.

As well as damaging cars, potholes can cause fatal accidents.

Martyn Uzzell, a 51-year-old service engineer, on a charity ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats, died instantly from severe head injuries when he was thrown into the path of the car behind him after his bike hit a four-inch deep pothole on the A65 at Giggleswick, North Yorkshire.

Gertrude Donaldson, a retired nurse who served in India during the Second World War, was walking around numerous potholes and 'unclear' road markings in Station Road car park, Kendal, Cumbria when she was hit and killed by a reversing van. The owners of the car park, Jaymar Estates, were found guilty of breaching health and safety guidelines and were fined £95,000, with £50,000 costs.

Forty-five per cent of drivers say that they have had an accident or near miss because of a pothole.

The money must be used to repair potholes or ensure that they do not appear in the first place.

Councils will also have to publish updates on works every three months so residents can see how repairs are progressing, and all work has to be completed by March 2015.

Patrick McLoughlin, the Transport Secretary, said: ‘Potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace.

‘But it is only one part of a massive programme of investment to get our country up to speed as part of this government’s long-term economic plan. By building, repairing and renewing our key infrastructure we will ensure the future growth and prosperity of this country.’

The £168million pothole funding was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in March’s Budget, and is in addition to the extra £185million the government made available that month to help repair local roads damaged by severe weather.

Some £24billion will be spent on England’s motorways and A-roads between 2010 and 2021, the biggest investment in the road network since the 1970s.

The Government said a further £7.4billion would committed to local roads in the next Parliament, along with funding from the £12billion Local Growth Fund.

1 If it’s safe, gather evidence of the pothole as soon as you can, including photographs, measurements and position on the road (for example, is it on a blind corner?).

2 Report the pothole to the relevant council or to the Highways Agency. Councils are responsible for A and B roads, and inner-city roads. Motorways are the responsibility of the Highways Agency.

3 Obtain a full breakdown of costs for all damage caused by the pothole. If you incur additional costs, keep a record of these but remember that you might not get any or all of your expenditure back and that any unrealistic or extravagant claims are likely to be turned down.

4 Submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the relevant council or to the Highways Agency to establish how often  the road is inspected or maintained. To find out how to do this, type the name of the authority you are claiming against, along with the words ‘freedom of information’, into an internet search engine, and you will find the relevant web page.

5 Download the national code of good practice for highway maintenance and familiarise yourself with the guidance on highways management.

6 Write a detailed letter to the local authority explaining exactly what happened. Include a map of the area, marking the location of the pothole. Highlight your costs and explain that you wish to claim for compensation. Your letter might eventually be read out in court, so keep it factual and concise.

7 Your claim may be initially rejected under Section 58 of the Highways Act 1980. This allows a council or the Highways Agency to defend claims on the basis that they had taken reasonable measures to ensure potholes were found and dealt with swiftly. Provided they have followed their system of regular repairs and inspections, they may be successful in rejecting your claim.

8 Use your FoI request information and the checklist at Potholes.co.uk to evaluate the local authority’s defence against your claim. If you think you still have a case, write back to the authority pointing out the discrepancies and include evidence in the form of paperwork and photographs. Inform them that you don’t consider they have satisfied Section 58. Remember, finding discrepancies doesn’t automatically lead to a successful  claim. There could be a reasonable explanation or you may have misinterpreted the information.They might also be prepared to defend the discrepancy in court.

9 If the local authority still refuses your claim, think carefully how you want to proceed. You might even want to take some legal advice at this stage as you may end up spending more money in court fees than you receive in compensation. Small claims are effective for taking action for small amounts and can now be completed online at Moneyclaim.

10 If an offer is made, be willing to negotiate. You might not be entitled to claim for all the costs you incur.
