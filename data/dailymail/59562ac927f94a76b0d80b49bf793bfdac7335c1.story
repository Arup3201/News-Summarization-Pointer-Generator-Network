They boast some of the most famous faces in the country among their number but not every member of the Royal Family is so easily identified, as police outside Buckingham Palace discovered today.

Officers had to resort to a crib sheet to pick out the likes of Princess Alexandra and Prince Michael of Kent but had no such difficulty with the  senior royals on the guest list, among them the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Prince Harry.

Prince William, who was fresh from an early morning visit to homeless charity Centrepoint in London's Soho, arrived with his glossy-haired wife, who looked lovely in her festive cherry-red dress and dramatic chandelier earrings.

His brother Harry arrived seated beside his formidable looking close protection officer but, ever charming, was all smiles as he was driven past waiting photographers.

Equally cheerful was Canadian Autumn Kelly, the blonde wife of Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, who offered waiting members of the public a wave as she flashed past. 

Princess Anne and the Earl of Wessex were also at the luncheon, as was Anne's husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence who, unusually, arrived for the event on foot.

Others invited to join the party included Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, their daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and a fresh-faced Princess Beatrice who smiled happily as she was driven in.

Just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge like to dress their son in contemporary versions of traditional classics, so too with his reading material.

As the 16-month-old prince was driven into Buckingham Palace, what looked like a copy of one of the Curious George books could be seen clutched in his fingers.

Written by Hans Augusto and Margret Rey, the first book in the series, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, made its debut in France in 1939, although the central character was called Fifi instead.

When the book made its UK debut in 1941, the monkey, by then called George elsewhere, was rechristened Zozo to spare King George VI the embarrassment of sharing his name with an ape.

By the time the second book in the series, Curious George Takes A Job, was published in 1947, the monkey had his name back and Curious George has remained Curious George ever since.

Although the Reys wrote only the first seven books, such is their popularity, new books written and illustrated 'in the style' of the Reys have been appearing since 1998.

Authors and illustrators of the second series include Mary O'Keefe Young, Martha Weston, Anna Grossnickle Hines, Michael Jensen, and Vipah Interactive.

The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th.

All of the senior royals, among them Prince Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex are expected at the country estate on Christmas Day and appear alongside the monarch at the traditional Christmas morning church service.

One member of the Royal Family who appeared to be particularly looking forward to his lunch was Prince George, who was driven into the Palace beside his nanny, Maria Theresa Borrallo in the back of his parents' car.

George, who was adorably smiley as he peered out of the window, is due to celebrate his second Christmas at Sandringham next week - and his last as an only child.

The 16-month-old royal and his parents are also due to relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate where an extended nursery big enough for two babies has been prepared.

George's new sibling is due in April and will live with his or her parents and older brother at the Norfolk property. The little prince will also have to share his nanny, who is expected to help care for the new arrival.

Carole and Michael Middleton, who have spent a considerable amount of time with Prince George over the last year, are also expected to take a hand in raising the new arrival and will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Anmer Hall on Boxing Day.

Low key: Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the husband of Princess Anne, was the only royal to arrive at the Palace on foot

Royal arrival: Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is driven into Buckingham Palace for lunch

Nice day out: Princess Alexandra of Kent arrives for lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace today

Adorable: Lord Nicholas Windsor brought his adorable sons Albert and Leopold to meet their more famous relations

On their way: Timothy Taylor, Lady Helen Taylor and their daughter Estella arrive for the lunch party

Big arrival: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent drove in with their festively-dressed daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor

Stylish: 33-year-old Lady Gabriella teamed her scarlet dress with a pair of matching red coral earrings

Solemn: The Duke of Kent, who is the Queen's first cousin, looked solemn as he was driven into the Palace

Visiting: The festive lunch party was completed by Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband Daniel

She is almost as famous for her shiny locks as her cousin by marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge, but Princess Beatrice was taking no chances when it came to having lunch with the Queen.

The 26-year-old royal was spotted emerging from a South Kensington hair salon, hours before being driven to Buckingham Palace for the royal family's annual pre-Christmas lunch.

Beatrice, who is currently completing an internship, was caught up in the recent Sony scandal after details of her salary were among those leaked by hackers, believed to be linked to North Korea.

Despite having endured a torrid few days as a result, the Princess was all smiles as she left the salon and appeared to be on cheerful form as she was driven into Buckingham Palace.

Taking no chances: Princess Beatrice was spotted leaving a South Kensington hair salon early this morning

Looking good: The 26-year-old cut a glamorous figure as she strolled down the London street after her hair appointment
