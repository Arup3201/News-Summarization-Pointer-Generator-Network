It's a show in which stars reveal their pet hates in the hope of seeing them banished to Room 101.

For Ray Mears, however, appearing on the BBC programme to talk about one of his biggest grievances – caravans – has proved rather costly.

After describing them as ‘hideous’ to Room 101 host Frank Skinner, the bushcraft expert was dropped as a speaker at the forthcoming Caravan, Camping and Motorhome Show – a job which was set to make him at least £10,000.

Discussing caravans in the episode, which was filmed in September but aired on BBC1 last Friday, Mears, 50, said: ‘I just think they’re hideous.

‘Huge swathes of our coastline are just covered in these things. I wouldn’t mind so much if they could be painted green, but they have to be painted white.

‘You go down to Devon and all you can see are cities of these displaced urban people in their ghastly white caravans.’

While his comments may have been meant as a bit of fun, the organisers of Mears’ speaking engagement were not amused in the slightest.

Mears said on the show that caravans were a blight on Britain's coastline and are 'hideous' and 'ghastly'

Emma Entwistle of Pelican Communications, which is promoting the event next month at Birmingham’s NEC, confirmed he had been dropped. 

She said: ‘We booked Ray Mears in November after the show was filmed, and there was never any mention of what he had said when we signed him up.

‘There was no way we can now have him come along to speak at our event – he has slagged off the community we are in charge of promoting and protecting.

‘We can’t align with someone who doesn’t agree with our core values. He has insulted the people who come to the show.’

She confirmed he had lost out on a ‘five-figure sum’, adding: ‘It’s all a bit elitist, saying that you are OK going outdoors if you are staying in a man-made shelter.

'It’s a shame because we are all about getting kids off their backsides and into the outdoors, an ideology I’d have thought we would have shared.’

Mears has not responded to requests for comment, but Ms Entwhistle claimed his agent was 'very apologetic'.

She added: 'He shouldn't have taken the job if he has fundamental issues with caravans.'

But his tirade has hit him in the pocket after a £10,000 appearance at the Caravan, Camping and Motorhome Show was cancelled after the programme was aired

Mears had been used on publicity material for the show, but organisers now feel he's 'slagged them off'

Many caravan fans have criticised the ‘hypocritical’ survival expert online.

Writing on a forum at caravanclub.co.uk, a user called Trini said: ‘Pity he is so against caravanning, until of course there’s [a] chance of some money.'

‘He should be taken to the NEC in a caravan with Jeremy Clarkson towing it!’ IanH wrote: ‘Oh dear ... I wonder how much he’s being paid to be a complete hypocrite?’

Organisers of the show, which runs between 17 - 22 February, are hoping Helen Skelton, formerly of Blue Peter, will be able to replace Mears. 

Other stars who are expected to appear include TV presenter Matt Baker and former athlete Sally Gunnell.  

The caravan show's promoters accused Mears of being 'elitist' for backing only camping and not caravanning
