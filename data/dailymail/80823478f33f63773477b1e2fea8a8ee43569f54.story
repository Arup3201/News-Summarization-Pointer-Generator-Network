Two members of a girl gang savagely attacked a pair of legal secretaries following a Royal Wedding street party.

Kalee Powell, 18, and Precious Gordon, 19, attacked Daniela Holischeck and  Birgit Habersetzer after spending the day boozing at a street party to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Ms Holischeck, who worked for City law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, was left a bloodied mess following the savage beating.

She spent the night in A&E after the attack and had to take a fortnight off from work.

Powell and Gordon, along with a 17-year-old who cannot be named, attacked 'like a pack' after they were called 'idiots' when they knocked a pizza out of the hands of Ms Habersetzer.

Gordon admitted affray and assaulting Ms Holischeck and Ms Harbersetzer, while Powell was convicted of affray for her part in the attack on Ms Holischeck after a trial at the Old Bailey.

Both were given community orders and told to pay a total of £300 compensation to their victims.

Judge Stephen Kramer QC said Ms Holischeck and her flatmate had been caught up in 'an ugly incident in which mindless, drunken and unlawful violence was used'.

'It must have been a shock and thoroughly frightening for the two women who were victims,' he added.

'I am satisfied what you both did you did that night because you were fuelled by alcohol, having gone to a street party and drunk alcohol celebrating the Royal Wedding.

'You have each come within a whisker of a custodial sentence. I hope you both appreciate that and these courts will never see you in this sort of position again.'

Ms Holischeck told jurors she felt as if it was 'raining fists' during the 10 minute attack in Bathurst Gardens, Kensal Rise, northwest London, on April 30 last year.

She became so desperate she kicked out at a car in an attempt to start its alarm.

'They managed to grab my hair and pull me to the ground, and started to kick me,' she said.

'I could feel pizza being rubbed in my hair - bits of cheese coming down on me.

'There was so much blood everywhere - my face was full of blood, my hair was full of blood.'

Ms Habersetzer, also a legal secretary, was also attacked while two boys from the group stood watching in Kensal Rise, London, just after midnight.

Miss Habersetzer had brought the pizza as a late night snack and was taking it home.

Prosecutor Helen Guest said: 'As they passed on the pavement, one of the girls knocked the box out of the hands of Birgit Habersetzer, and then followed that up with a punch to her face.

'She threatened to call the police, and then a girl came to Daniela Holischeck and started to attack her. She ended up on the floor, and they were kicking and punching her.'

The attack only came to an end when a passing police car pulled up. Powell told officers she was drunk but had been trying to stop the fight.

Ms Holischeck said she spent the night in A&E and had to take two weeks off sick.

'I had some trapped nerves in my back, and was not able to get out of bed by myself for a week,' she said.

'I had friends come to help me get out of bed.'

'I had a nose bleed from punches to the head.'

Attack: Powell and Gordon had spent the day boozing at a street party to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton

The two victims - both German - had been celebrating the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton in a local pub but had drunk only fruit juice because they were in training for a charity fun run.

Powell, of Northolt, northwest London, denied affray and common assault on Ms Holischeck and was convicted.

She was given a 12-month community order requiring her to spend a total of 24 hours at a senior attendance centre run by the Probation Service.

She will also be under a nightly 8pm to 8am curfew for three months and will have to pay £100 compensation to Ms Holischeck.

Gordon, of Kensal Rise, admitted affray and common assault on both victims.

She was given a 12-month community order requiring her to spend a total of 27 hours at a senior attendance centre and ordered to pay £100 compensation to each of the victims.
