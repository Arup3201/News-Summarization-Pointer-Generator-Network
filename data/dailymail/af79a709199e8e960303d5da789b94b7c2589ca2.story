A mountain of binbags has built up in a block of flats after council binmen made  just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an EU law.

Residents in a block of flats in Colchester, Essex, were told red tape means the binmen can't collect rubbish there when it's too dark for them to see it.

As a result, the massive pile of 70 stinking black binbags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile.

Furious residents stepped in to demand the binmen take away the black bags.

But they were stunned when the binmen told them that the EU regulations mean they can't put their hands where they can't see them for health and safety reasons.

The binmen have now refused to collect any more rubbish from the flats, saying they can't be seen to be breaking the rules.

Many of the bags now spilling out of the store are split and rats have already been spotted in the area just yards from people's front doors.

Health and safety rules have left residents of the block of flats in Colchester with eight weeks of rubbish

Block resident Jill Mawby said: 'We 
thought the binmen had forget to come into the flats so we waited 
around to have a word with them.

'But
 when we spoke to them about it, they said if they cannot see where they
 are putting their hands, then they can't pick up the bags because of EU
 law.

'There were 12 binmen, yet they could not collect our rubbish. It's utter madness.'

Residents from the block of flats use the communal store for their bins which should be picked up on a weekly basis by workers from Colchester Borough Council.

Miss Mawby, a mother of two, added: 'All we can smell is weeks' worth of bins - it really is disgusting.

'Colchester Council promised me a collection would be made yet I just don't think it is going to happen.'

A spokesman for Colchester Borough Council said: 'The crews have identified an issue with the accessibility of collection in a bin store at this location which is now to be investigated.

'We will ensure that all the rubbish at this location is removed as part of this visit and liaise with the property management company to ensure that any future problems are prevented.
