This is the bizarre moment members of the English Defence League gatecrashed a book club to confront Russell Brand only to find readers were merely discussing his latest work.

A gang of around 15 EDL supporters stormed the event at a Newcastle bar after being wrongly tipped off that the comedian would be there.

Instead the men, believed to be from EDL groups across the North East, found Bar Loco filled with readers who had gathered to speak about Brand's book Revolution - but disrupted the meeting regardless, bursting into Islamophobic chants.

This is the bizarre moment members of the English Defence League gatecrashed a book club to confront Russell Brand only to find members were merely discussing his latest work 

Those at the meeting said the gang of around 15 EDL members had sat at the back of the room for around 20 minutes until they realised Brand would not be coming

Police were called to the disrupted event, which the EDL members eventually left saying 'and now we're off for a curry'. Police said officers had spoken to those present, but 'no offences were committed'

'It was an open book club to discuss Russell Brand's new book,' said reader Dan Jenkins, from West Denton of the event at Bar Loco.

'But the guys from EDL clearly thought he was going to turn up himself so had gathered a group together from all over the North East to come and disturb the meeting.

'I got there a bit late so I was sitting among them at the back and I could hear them talking about it and asking when he was coming, and then 20 minutes in they realised that he wasn't coming so they decided to be disruptive.'

Mr Jenkins, 39, said the men had then started singing 'No surrender to the Taliban', and 'With St George in my heart, keep me English.' heart, keep me English.'

Dan Jenkins, 39, was among the readers who had gathered for the open book club meeting to discuss Russell Brand's latest effort Revolution

An EDL organiser said the men had gone to Bar Loco after one of their own meetings was disrupted by 'left-wing activists', and had Brand been there it would have been a bonus

'When they were heading out one of them just shouted defiantly "And now we're going for a curry" and they had just been singing these songs about the Taliban,' he said. 

'It was bizarre.'

EDL regional organiser Alan Spence said the group had gatecrashed the event in retaliation for the disruption of one of their meetings by left-wing activists.

'The last time we had a North East meet and greet some of the left wing went down to the pub and abused the barmaid, prior to us getting there,' he said.

'So we thought it was time we returned the favour.

Mr Jenkins described the EDL's arrival at the meeting had been 'bizarre', and said he had heard members discussing when Brand would be arriving at the Newcastle bar

'Any left-wing organisation in the North East should expect a visit from the EDL if this happens again. If that's the way they want it they can have it that way.'

Mr Spence said they saw the rumour Russell Brand would be there as an added bonus.

He said: 'We went because there were going to be known activists that were going to be there and we got told Russell Brand was going to be there too. He's a joke.'

Bar Loco manager Agle Dubinkaite said: 'Some people were causing a bit of a disturbance, so naturally I called the police to escort them out. They refused to leave when I asked them to and there were quite a few of them.'

A police spokesperson said: 'Officers attended and spoke to those at the event. No offences were committed.'
