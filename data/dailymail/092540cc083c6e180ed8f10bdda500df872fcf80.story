A mother abandoned her baby boy in his stroller as she tried to steal $300 of candy from a drug store.

Michelle Calderon, 23, fled from a Duane Reade store in downtown Manhattan during an October 7 robbery, leaving her one-year-old son behind. 

Calderon attempted the robbery with two accomplices Raymond Lebron, 20, and ex-boyfriend Darnell Johnson, 26.

Michelle Calderon, 23, was charged with robbery after she attempted to steal candy from this Duane Reade in downtown Manhattan and fled, abandoning her baby son

She was caught on surveillance camera in the store shoveling sweets into the bottom of her baby's stroller.

The thieves were caught by a store security with $179 in cough drops, $59 of Wrigley's gum, $43 of Dentyne gum and $15 of Tic Tacs, police told the New York Daily News.

When the employee tried to stop the trio, Lebron hit the man in the face and Calderon used her child's stroller as a battering ram. 

The man was pushed to the ground but managed to grab on to the stroller. The mother and her accomplices then fled the scene, leaving her child behind. 

Dentyne gum was part of the $300 stash of candy that the trio stole from the drug store in New York

Calderon, who has 16 previous arrests, was captured when she entered a police station disguised in a wig to make inquiries about her son.

The three suspects were charged with robbery, abandonment of a child and endangering the welfare of a child and are currently being held at Rikers Island.

The 23-year-old was previously arrested at Rikers for trying to smuggle cocaine inside in June.

Calderon was held on $15,000 bail. Her child remains in the protective custody of family services.
