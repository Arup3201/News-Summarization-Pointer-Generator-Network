Typewriter sales are booming in Germany as government departments, businesses and people go back-to-the-future to thwart spying by American spooks.

Old tech is trumping the new in the wake of the NSA spying scandals which saw Chancellor Merkel's phone hacked on numerous occasions by Washington and culminated in the expulsion of the CIA spy chief from Berlin earlier this month.

The head of the parliamentary inquiry into spying by the US National Security Service in Germany said his committee is considering using typewriters. But many have already made the switch.

Sales of typewriters have jumped in Germany following allegations about American agents spying on MPs

Typewriter makers Olympia and Bandermann both report a revival in their fortunes.

'We sell about 10,000 typewriters every year,' Bandermann manager Rolf Bonnen told a German website, adding that sales last year were up a third on 2012.

Last year Triumph Adler, part of Bandermann, made a YouTube video announcing its machines were 'Bug proof. NSA proof.'

An
 Olympia spokesman said the company expects to sell more typewriters 
this year than at any time in the last 20 years, with sales set to 
double in 2014 over last year's figures.

Defence
 contractor Diehl, several big businesses and many individuals are now 
shunning their computers to put sensitive data on to paper.

'We will certainly cross the 10,000 threshold,' said Olympia manager Andreas Fostiropoulis.

He said their Russian business partners had asked for 20 typewriters for the country’s secret services.

President Barack Obama has today 
dispatched two senior advisers to Germany in an apparent effort to 
soothe tensions following new allegations of American spying.

The prospect of German MPs reverting to typewriters comes a year after allegations surfaced that the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured, had been bugged by American agents

The White House says chief of staff Denis McDonough and counter-terrorism adviser Lisa Monaco are in Berlin for meetings with their German counterparts.

The White House says intelligence and security matters were in the agenda.

The 
meetings follow the discovery earlier this month of two alleged US spies
 in Germany, prompting Chancellor Angela Merkel to demand the departure 
of the CIA station chief in Berlin.

The
 allegations follow revelations that the US National Security Agency was
 conducting mass surveillance of German citizens and eavesdropping on Ms
 Merkel's cellphone.

The White House says the US and Germany agreed to set up a dialogue to address intelligence concerns on both sides.

The
 jump in sales comes after Christian Democrat politician Patrick 
Sensburg, head of the Bundestag’s parliamentary inquiry into the NSA 
surveillance scandal, was asked on television last week whether 
politicians were considering a return to older technology.

Obama has today sent two senior advisers to Germany in an attempt to smooth relations after the expulsion of the CIA spy chief from Berlin earlier this month

Speaking
 on the Morgenmagazin TV programme, he replied ‘As a matter of fact, we 
have – and not electronic models either’ before adding ‘Yes, no joke,' 
The Guardian reports.

Mr
 Sensburg added: 'Of course we have to keep our internal communication 
secure, send encrypted emails, use encrypted telephones and other 
things, which I'm not going to say here.'

The decision to order the CIA representative out came after dramatic reports of U.S. espionage in Germany.

Public outrage at the revelations put pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to take action against the United States.

Last week, Berlin said it had discovered a suspected U.S. spy in the Defence Ministry.

That came just days after a German foreign intelligence worker was arrested on suspicion of being a CIA informant and admitted passing documents to a U.S. contact.

The scandal has chilled relations between Berlin and Washington to levels not seen since Merkel's predecessor opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

It would not be the first time a country had turned to less sophisticated technology to counter spy activity.

Russia's Federal Guard Service opted to use more typewriters after classified NSA documents were leaked by the organisation's former contractor Edward Snowden.
