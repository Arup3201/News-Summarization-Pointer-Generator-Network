From creating LinkedIn as a dapper businessman to picturing Flickr as an artsy hipster, a fashion photographer has imagined what social networks would look like if they were real men.

Viktorija Pashuta, 31, from Los Angeles, has brought together a playful photo series, which also depicts Twitter as a smartly-dressed creative type and image-sharing site Pinterest becomes a serious style expert.

In a possible nod to Mark Zuckerberg's favourite item of clothing, Facebook is depicted as a hoodie-wearing youngster, while Tumblr, which often has an anarchic edge, is imagined as a rocker in a vest shirt.

Speaking about her quirky photo series, Viktorija said: 'I wanted to combine fashion and technology to create something that will not only speak to the fashion crowd but also to people who use social media on a daily basis.'

Miss Pashuta's idea was to use the social networks' logos as visual references and transfer the  functions and personalities of the networks on to human models.

She said: 'We see internet browser icons and social media logos every day. I wanted to glamorise these boring icons and bring them to life in the form of beautiful, fashionable people.' 

Miss Pashuta, of Los Angeles, collaborated with wardrobe stylist Jordan Anthony Swain and together they visualised what social media brands would look like if they were brought to life.

Speaking about photographing her social media models, she said: 'The main preparation for the shoot took place before I even touched my camera. 

'I spent a lot of time researching into each website and characterised each one of them. 

'Then I started to visualise what kind of person would use that particular network and formed an exact idea of how I wanted them to look.' 

The innovative fashion shoot manages to give each social network its own vivid personality.

Tumblr, here as a long-haired hipster, is part of the photo series called What If Guys Were Social Networks?

Using eight participants as models and a wardrobe of different styles, Miss Pashuta transformed Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook and more into actual people. 

She said: 'Even though they share similar functions and features, each social network has its own character and style. 

'Facebook is depicted as casual, Twitter as classic, Pinterest as creative, LinkedIn as business, Instagram as vintage, Flickr as artsy, Tumblr as hipster and Google+ as innovative.' 

The series, entitled What If Guys Were Social Networks?, is a follow-up to the photographer's previous series entitled What if Girls Were Internet Browsers?.
