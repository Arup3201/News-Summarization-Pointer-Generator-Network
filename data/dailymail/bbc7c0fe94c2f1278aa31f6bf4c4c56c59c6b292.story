Roger Federer did not so much wield a racket as wave a wand on the sunlit grass of Wimbledon on Tuesday.

It was another masterclass in a tournament of masterclasses from the seven-time champion, in this instance against Tommy Robredo, the usually stubborn Spaniard who was dismissed from the premises in 94 minutes of imperious precision.

Comfortable: Roger Federer is through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon after demolishing Tommy Robredo

Unstoppable: Federer took just 21 minutes to take the first set, and didn't lose a point on serve in the second

It was almost as if time had stood 
still and a young Federer in his first bloom was with us again. At 32, 
he is no more likely to shrivel away and disappear from the All England 
Club than its famous ivy.

His
 accumulation of statistics is phenomenal; he is the only competitor in 
the men’s singles not to have lost a service game in four rounds. None 
of his matches has lasted longer. ‘It’s like being a footballer,’ he 
said.

His serve was 
dominant, his net play clean and incisive. Poor Robredo made the fatal 
mistake of starting poorly, winning just 13 points in the first set and 
committing a horrific series of unforced errors. By the time he was up 
and running in the third set, it was way too late.

That
 was the story of one Swiss victory on Tuesday. The other was unfolding 
on Court Two: a fractious contest won 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 by Federer’s 
countryman and close friend Stan Wawrinka against Feliciano Lopez.

Experienced: But it wasn't Tommy Robredo's day on Court No 1

The 
two men were locked in heated dispute as the match ended, tension having
 built as the match developed, but they shook hands in the end and 
claimed that everything was mended when they came to speak to the press 
afterwards.

The upshot is a 
Swiss-Swiss quarter-final: Wawrinka versus Federer. Never before has 
that country had two men reach the last eight here.

More
 intriguingly, set against Federer’s long period of success, Wawrinka 
outranks Federer – third versus fourth – in the world standings. He is 
also the player more recently to have won a Grand Slam tournament, this 
year’s Australian Open.

Yes they are buddies, but has Wawrinka’s recent success not changed the dynamic between them?

‘Which
 dynamic?’ said Federer, leaning on 17 Grand Slam titles. ‘Well, I think
 for him the dynamic has changed a lot. Definitely in terms of showing 
up for the big moments, believing he can come through them after 
previously losing a lot of close matches against many of the top guys.

Sunny day: Fans packed into to watch the match at SW19 on Tuesday

‘People clearly marked him out after the Australian Open, but it started at the US Open and just prior to that.

‘So
 I am really happy for him that he’s been able to keep it going strong, 
even though he had had some ups and downs that are inevitable after a 
big win like the Australian Open.’

These
 are heady sporting days for neutral Switzerland. A few hours after the 
wins of Wawrinka and Federer, they scuttled back to their TVs – separate
 screens, different locations – to watch the World Cup match between 
Argentina and Switzerland.

A loss, though it lasted a good deal longer than Federer’s match. Well, you can’t have everything.

Just
 before the match, the big-serving Wawrinka was wearing a t-shirt with 
the slogan ‘Stan the Man’. When questioned, he said he wasn’t 
necessarily the man – that sounded a bit boastful, he thought. It this 
was just a nickname. I suppose a ‘Stan Not the Man’ t-shirt would be 
ludicrous.

Classy: Federer could be set for a semi-final clash with Rafael Nadal

But can he be the
 man against Federer on Wednesday, just as he was in the final of the 
Masters 1000 in Monte Carlo? On the negative side, due to the weather 
delays on Saturday, will be playing his third match in as many days.

‘That win in Monaco will give me a lot of confidence,’ he said, ‘knowing that I can beat him on the big stage.

‘But
 tomorrow it’s going to be a different experience. First time on grass. 
First time at Wimbledon. Five-set match. Yeah, it’s going to be tough.’

Did that not sound a touch defeatist?

He
 added: ‘You know when you play Roger at Wimbledon, when he’s fit and 
confident and feeling well, it’s one of the biggest challenges in 
tennis. It’s like playing Rafa in the French Open. These guys are 
playing their best tennis for many years.’

Tommy Robredo will most certainly attest to that in the case of Mr Federer.
