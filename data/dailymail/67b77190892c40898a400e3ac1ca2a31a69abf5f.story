A talented teenage sailor, who killed herself the day after her birthday, had been taking an acne drug which has been linked to depression.

Jessica Eales had recently represented Great Britain at the Isaf Youth Sailing World Championships in Tavira, Portugal, where she finished 11th.

She was found hanged in woodland in July at Sway in the New Forest in Hampshire, about a mile-and-a-half from her family home in Lymington, the day after her 17th birthday. 

Jess Eales, 17, from Lymington, Hampshire, was found dead weeks after representing Great Britain in sailing

An inquest following her death found that the medal-winning sailor and straight-A student had been taking Dianette, a hormone treatment for acne, before she died. One of the drug's listed side-effects is depression.

The teenager's family have since asked their daughter's GP to 'yellow flag' the drug to highlight it for further research into the 'well-documented' side effects of depression. 

The inquest heard she had left a handwritten note in her bedroom saying 'I am sorry, I love you with all my heart XXXX'. 

When she was found it was discovered she had been listening to music. Her rucksack contained a half empty bottle of gin and a bottle of alcohol although toxicology tests showed a low alcohol level in her blood which made it uncertain whether she had been been drinking.

Jessica had spent her 17th birthday with friends on a boat and had uploaded a picture of herself smiling on the day she died. This has now been 'liked' by dozens of people.

She had recently won a gold medal at the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) Youth National Championships in Weymouth and Portland, Dorset.

Friends said she had been happy and had been talking about her future before she died, and was a popular girl

The inquest at Winchester, attended by Jessica's grandparents, heard she was a happy girl who had been successful both in sailing as well as in her studies and she hoped to go to university to study science.

In a statement read to the hearing, her father Nicholas Eales said: 'Jess was a happy girl who enjoyed her formative years doing all the normal activity associated with growing up.'

He said that sailing became the sport of her life and described her success in Portugal as the 'best two weeks of her life'.

He added: 'Often described as academically-gifted, her achievements were the result of her dedication and sheer hard work.'

Mr Eales also raised his concerns about Dianette. The statement added: 'Jess was taking Dianette that was prescribed to her four months earlier. From research it appears serious concerns have been raised about the serious and well-documented side-effect of depression.

'The family have asked that this drug is yellow-flagged as a result.'

This means the drug will be highlighted for research into the possible side effects of the drug. 

Dianette is a contraceptive pill that is often prescribed to women to treat acne

It is banned in some parts of Europe and has been linked to the death of seven British women

Six of the deaths were attributed to blood clots and one to a fall 

Dianette is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

In Britain there have been more than 80 reports of women suffering side effects such as hair loss and depression after taking it

Last year France suspended use of the pill while European Medicines Agency investigated its side effects

Charlotte Porter died from deep vein thrombosis. The coroner said Dianette was a contributory factor

Dianette, also known as Diane 35, is banned in Canada and Japan, and under review in Australia 

In 2013 doctors said they suspected the drug was linked to the stroke suffered by Angela Macleod when she was just 29 

Dianette is a combination of two drugs - cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen)

It has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives, however the risk is still small

Charlotte Porter, 17, from Allington, near Maidstone, Kent, died in March 2010 of a deep-vein thrombosis after taking Dianette for acne. 

The coroner said it was the largest clot he had ever seen in someone so young and that the drug had been a contributory factor in the teenager's death 

The Porter family has launched a petition to ban the drug  

On her birthday Jessica took her boat out to the Isle of Wight where she had a picnic with three friends and her family before going to a pizza restaurant in the evening in Lymington.

Friend and sailing companion Jess Hammett said in her statement that she had no idea why Jessica took her own life.

She said: 'Jess was a popular girl, at the sailing club she had a lot of friends. She was also very clever.'

Miss Hammett, who was staying with Jessica on the day of her death, described how she had formed her first relationship with a boy while in Portugal and had appeared upset that he had not contacted her during her birthday.

She said: 'Jess was happy and she said she had her three best friends with her. I could tell she was disappointed she hadn't heard from the boy and she kept checking her phone but she was still happy.'

The teenager said she had been unable to answer why her friend would have wanted to take her own life, and said she had been happy and had previously talked about the future. 

She added: 'Although she was sad she hadn't heard from her boyfriend the night before, she knew it wasn't serious because he lived abroad.'

Graham Short, coroner for North Hampshire, recorded a verdict that Jessica took her own life and said that he could not establish a link between the acne drug and her actions.

He said: 'I know the family is concerned about the drug Dianette. I have considered whether Jess was affected by that and whether or not it caused her to be depressed.

'I accept that there are reports of people taking the drug who have complained of depression and the leaflets issued by the manufacturers do give information about that.

'However, Jessica had been prescribed Dianette for over six months and had apparently been taking that without any indication of depressions and none of her friends or family seem to have noticed she had suffered from depression.

'I therefore cannot find a link between the drug and her action to end her life.'

Jessica had been taking Dianette for four months before she killed herself, the drug has depression as a side effect. However the coroner said he could not find a link between Jessica's suicide and her taking it 

Jessica was a straight A student and hoped to go to University and her father said sailing was 'sport of her life'

He added: 'I cannot establish what was in her mind, I can well understand her parents have been racking their brains to understand as well.

'However I think we shouldn't underestimate the pressures on teenagers, particularly high achievers like Jess and the sad part is that she felt unable to share these worries with her family and indeed her friends before she reached the decision to hang herself and it's a tragedy for all concerned, for the sailing community, her friends but most importantly her family.'

Jessica, a student at Brockenhurst College in the New Forest, learned to sail in 2009 before becoming a member of Hayling Island Sailing Club.

Her parents, Nicholas and Annette Eales, arealso keen sailors, run a marine breakdown assistance company called Sea Start. She has a brother, James, 14.

Dozens of tributes have been paid to the teenager by the sailing community.

RYA youth racing manager Mark Nicholls said: 'The RYA is aware of the sad passing of British Youth Sailing Squad member Jessica Eales.

Jessica was found dead at woodland in the New Forest, near her home in Lymington, the day after her birthday

'She was a young sailor who showed promising talent which can now unfortunately never be fulfilled. Our thoughts are with the family and friends at this sad and difficult time.'

Jessica was a member of Royal Lymington Yacht Club (RLYC) and the Hayling Island Sailing Club.

A statement on the RS Feva Association website said: 'Jess was a well-known and popular HISC/Royal Lymington YC youth sailor, and will be greatly missed.

'Jess was a leading light in the 29er fleet. Having progressed from the RS Feva fleet, she had recently been selected for the Isaf youth worlds, sailing an SL16.

'Our thoughts and hearts are with Jess's family and friends at this sad time.'
