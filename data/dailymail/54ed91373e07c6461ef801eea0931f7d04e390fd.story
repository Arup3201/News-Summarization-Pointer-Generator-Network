Probation: Thomas Grant, 24, was accused of accidentally shooting his young cousin during a Halloween party pleaded no contest in court and has been sentenced to probation

Grant has been placed on probation after initially being charged with aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and simple assault.

'He's terribly upset over this whole situation, and obviously the first concern is that the 9-year-old little girl is doing well,' defense attorney Steven Valsamidis said at a preliminary hearing in November.

'She's recovering, and it's my understanding that, so far so good.'

The shooting happened in New Sewickley Township, Pennsylvania on October 20th during a bonfire.

Accident: Grant shot his nine-year-old cousin after it was thought she was a skunk rather than someone in a Halloween costume

Mystery: No explanation was ever given by Thomas Grant as to why he thought his cousin was a skunk other than the fact she was dressed in a black and white costume for a Halloween party

Police said the owner at the home heard there was a skunk in the backyard and asked Grant, her son, to shoot the animal while she used a flashlight to shine light over the hillside.

Grant fired the shotgun once and hit the girl, police said.

'He is extremely devastated by the actions that took place. I mean, it's a tragic incident that occurred. It's not something that he dreamed would ever happen,' Police Chief Ronald Leindecker said after the shooting.

The girl was mistaken for the animal because her costume was black in color and included a black hat with a white tassel.

She was being treated in the garage of the home by members of her family before being flown to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for surgery.
