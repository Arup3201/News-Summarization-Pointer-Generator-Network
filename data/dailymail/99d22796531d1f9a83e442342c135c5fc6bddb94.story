Robbie Lawler has warned fans not to expect another ding-dong battle with Johny Hendricks, because he's planning an early night.

The welterweights' first clash in March was one of the fights of the year with Hendricks prevailing in Texas to win the vacant title.

And Lawler is confident he can exact revenge in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

'I'm not looking to go back and forth with Johny,' he told Sportsmail. 'I'm looking to go out there and beat him up, I want to finish him.

'I don't want to have a fight of the year this time like we did last time. This time I'm looking to go out there and take him out.

'I've got better in all positions, I've fine-tuned a lot of things, my coaches have been working on a lot of things so top to bottom I'm just a better fighter.

'The title will mean a lot. I've had a long career. It's been a lot of hard work and dedication and people putting time and effort into me – so when I win it won't be just for me it's for them as well. But I'm just going to eat some pancakes and eat some food!'

Hendricks, however, has prepared himself for another epic.

'If it does finish early, I'll be excited about it,' he said. 'But I'm not expecting that, I'm going in there expecting another 25-minute war. But the skill sets and everything that we've done, I believe that we can finish him.

'I think he'll take the game plan that he did the 3rd and 4th round when we last fought. So he'll come out strong, play to his strengths.

'I had to play a lot into his strengths last time. All stand up, I really couldn't do many takedowns. So I think this fight he's going to look at that 3rd round and 4th round last time where he had a lot of success.

'And that's what he's going to do - he's going to think that he can push me forward, and throw a lot of punches, and hope that one gets through.

'I want Robbie to believe he can take my belt. I want the best Robbie Lawler, I think I fought him last time. He didn't fight the best Hendricks.

'This fight is sort of my coming out saying, 'alright, I fight you once, if I can put on a better performance the second fight, in a rematch, that means that whenever I fight somebody, if they don't beat me the first time, they know they're going to have to worry even more for the second time round.'
