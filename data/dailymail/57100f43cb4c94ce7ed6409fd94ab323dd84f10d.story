Apprentice winner Stella English was today accused of 'running to the teacher' when she complained to Lord Sugar that more than £1.4million from one of his businesses still had to be invoiced, a tribunal heard today.

The multi-millionaire is being sued for constructive dismissal by Ms English, 34, who won series six of the BBC1 show in 2010.

Ms
English was given a £100,000 role with Lord Sugar's IT division Viglen 
as her prize but resigned in May 2011 and complained that her role there
was that of an 'overpaid lackey', something her former boss strongly 
denied.

The mum-of-two previously told the East 
London tribunal how relationships at the company soured after she told 
her boss Bordan Tkachuk that £1.4 million had not been invoiced.

Giving evidence this morning, Mr Tkachuk accused the 34-year-old of setting 'false alarm bells ringing' when she told Lord Sugar there was a problem.

Legal battle: Stella English, pictured arriving for the fourth day of the tribunal today,  is claiming constructive dismissal by Sir Alan Sugar (pictured yesterday), who has called her 'suspicious' and 'untrusting'

Evidence: Viglen chief executive Bordan Tkachuk (pictured right in The 
Apprentice) accused her of 'running to the teacher' by complaining to Lord
Sugar about unpaid invoices

'Stella didn't understand 
this was work in progress so to come out and say there is missing money,
then that is ridiculous without discussing it with me first,' he said.

'Numbers are all over place and it is normal there are outstanding amounts of money. It is not a revelation.

'After the claimant went to Lord Sugar it was like she had set false alarm bells ringing.

'It's like running to a school teacher claiming something that isn't true.'

Previously she said when she emailed 
the Viglen MD asking if she could discuss these matters with him, he 
sent her a scathing reply, copying in everyone else in the office.

Straight talk: Miss English told the tribunal that Alan Sugar dismissed her as a: 'Nice girl, don't do a lot'

Stella wept earlier in the week as she
said he wrote to her: "I don't know what you're doing but this ain't 
how things work around here.'

The senior executive also denied telling former Ms English that there was no job for her.

Bordan Tkachuk told the East London 
Tribunal Service: 'I do not understand why I would say "there is no job"
because obviously there is a potential job for one of the two 
candidates.

'I did not say there was no role. For the five previous contestants there was a job for them.'

Mr Tkachuk also denied that Lord Sugar made the comment 'Nice girl. Don't do a lot' about Ms English when he asked what he thought of her during a meeting between them.

He told the tribunal: 'I don't remember him saying that but the inference might have been that.'

He recalled that she was 'a nice girl but probably had a lot to learn'.

Mr Tkachuk denied that he had shown 'bullying behaviour' towards Ms English, of Whitstable, Kent, or that he did not get on with her saying 'I had no problem at all with her.'

He described her as 'naive' about how procurement works.

Row: Lord Alan Sugar (pictured yesterday) said that his former employee's claims were 'blunt lies' and accused her of trying to extract money from him

Lord Sugar met his former employee Stella English (second from left, front row) on the series that was aired in 2010 - but now she is suing him

Her resignation from Viglen caught him 'a bit unawares and it was a bit of a surprise', he told the tribunal. The reason behind it seemed to be that she did not like working in IT having come from a banking background, he suggested.

He took her to lunch to discuss the situation away from the office as she was 'clearly a little bit emotional about it,' he stated.

Mr Tkachuk said: 'She explained that she did not feel that the IT industry or the company location was for her. She was not happy with working in the industry - it was a different culture.

'It was an amicable meeting. We got on well. We were there for a couple of hours or so. There was certainly no animosity to myself or the company.'

He said he was surprised because she was in a 'potentially well-paid' role in a 'learning job' where she could make progress.

Lord Sugar later gave her another role at internet set-top box company YouView after she resigned from Viglen in May 2011.

Ms English claims that Lord Sugar told her he would not be renewing her contract during an unscheduled meeting on September 28, 2011.

The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday.
