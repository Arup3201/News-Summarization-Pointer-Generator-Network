A survey has revealed the cars most likely to be given a ticket on America's roads – and the results prove it is not all about horsepower.

The study found that the Subaru WRX tops the national ranking - and one in three drivers of the turbocharged vehicle has a recent traffic violation.

But while the ‘Ticket Magnet’ list of hundreds of vehicles includes the likes of the eight-cylinder Alpha Romeo 8c Competizone, the top 20 includes less high-octane models, including  the Suzuki Reno and the Mercury Topaz.

A study carried out by Insurance.com found that drivers of the Subaru WRX were the most likely to be ticketed 

The Pontiac GTO was second on the 'ticket magnet' list of cars most likely to draw a traffic violation

But the top ten list included some surprising entries - including the Mercury Topaz

The insurance comparison website insurance.com said it looked at data from 526 models and more than 557,000 recent customers between January 2013 and July 2014 to draw up its list.

After the Suburu WRX, the Pontiac GTO, Scion FR-S, Toyota Supra and Subaru Tribeca made up the top five.

The rest of the top ten includes the Volkswagen Rabbit, the Mercury Topaz, the Scion tC, the Toyota FJ Cruiser and the Mazda2.

The list, which included the Scion FR-S (pictured) at number three, was compiled using data from 526 different models

The Toyota Supra came in fourth on the list of cars most likely to draw tickets, according to a survey by Insurance.com

Surprising: While the list included high powered vehicles, the Volkswagen Rabbit came in sixth on the top ten list

The most-ticketed brand overall was Scion, with 27.5 per cent of all owners reporting a traffic violation.

1. Subaru WRX – 33.6%                                    

2. Pontiac GTO – 32.7%

3. Scion FR-S – 32.6%

4. Toyota Supra – 30.8%

5. Subaru Tribeca – 29.7%

6. Volkswagen Rabbit – 29.6%

7. Mercury Topaz – 28.8%

8. Scion tC – 28.8%

9. Toyota FJ Cruiser – 28.4%

10. Mazda2 – 28.1% 

But the high powered Dodge Viper (at 5.3 per cent) was far less likely to be ticketed than the Dodge Dart and 26.7 per cent. 

Insurance.com Managing Editor Des Toups said it was not all about powerful vehicles.  

‘Cars don’t get tickets, drivers do – but those drivers like the WRX,' he said.

‘It’s not about horsepower. The Chevrolet Corvette, Dodge Viper and Nissan GT-R rank well below average for tickets even though they can easily double the highest speed limits. 

'But those cars are also costly, so their buyers tend to be older and take fewer risks.’

For all models, nearly 20 per cent of drivers reported having a traffic violation in the previous three years.

This would usually be for speeding but also included such offenses as failure to yield and drunken driving.

According to CBS, the car least likely to get ticketed is the Chevrolet Orlando - a 'concept' mini-van with no reported tickets. 

The Mazda2 appeared at number ten in the list with 28.1 per cent of drivers having a recent ticket

The Scion tC was ranked at number eight in the list. Des Toups from Insurance.com said: 'It’s not about horsepower'

The Subaru Tribeca appears on the list with 29.7 per cent of drivers found to have recent tickets, the survey revealed

Toyota FJ Cruiser came in ninth on the list. Data was drawn from more than 557,000 recent customers between January 2013 and July 2014

Mr Toups said that when setting rates on particular vehicles, insurance companies paid more attention to claims than tickets. 

He added: 'If you have an accident, it helps to drive up the rates of everyone who owns that kind of car. 

'Tickets tend to drive up your rates alone.'
