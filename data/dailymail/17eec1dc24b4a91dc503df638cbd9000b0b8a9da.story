A private cargo pilot has been charged with flying while drunk after losing touch with air traffic controllers for an hour.

Air traffic officials also noticed the plane being piloted by Phillip
Lavoie was descending and had slightly veered from its path during the flight
from Tampa to North Carolina.

The situation was so serious that the  Tyndall Air Force Base dispatched two fighter jets.

A federal flight inspector and police officers said Lavoie, 28, smelled of alcohol and was crying when he landed.

Lavoie was charged on Tuesday with operating a common carrier under the influence of alcohol following the flight in December.

He allegedly had a blood alcohol content of 0.27 
per cent - well above the .04 per cent permitted by the Federal 
Aviation Administration.

The charge could see the pilot be sent to prison for up to 15 years.

Unfit: Police officers said Lavoie, 28, smelled of alcohol and was crying when he landed

Speaking to the The Tampa Bay Times, his attorney, Summer Goldman, said he drank before 
leaving Tampa.

He then landed in Greensboro, dropped off the cargo before refuelling and
returning to the air.

'He truly has an alcohol problem, had one, and he's taking the steps to 
correct that,' he added.

He added that Lavoie has entered a residential treatment program.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
