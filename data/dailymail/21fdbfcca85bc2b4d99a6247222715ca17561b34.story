He added: 'This is an ongoing investigation and something we are taking extremely seriously.

'Our priority is looking after the victim and working with her to see if we can identify the offender as quickly as we can.

'We have additional police resources deployed in the are providing high visibility for the public until this man is caught.

Since the attack police have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries and have used a police helicopter in the search for clues to the attack.

Laura Hughes, who lives opposite the rape scene, said today: 'It is sickening really. I have a four-year-old daughter and it is just awful to think that it happened so close by.

'I wish I had heard something but I didn't because I was on the phone.

'Everyone uses that lane all the time for dog-walking and running. It was only early evening and still daylight. You don't think of things like this happening so early.

Detective Inspector Louise Roddy, leading the investigation, said: 'If anyone saw or heard anything at all in the Drayton area last night which could help us with this investigation, no matter how insignificant they may think the information is, please contact us immediately.'
