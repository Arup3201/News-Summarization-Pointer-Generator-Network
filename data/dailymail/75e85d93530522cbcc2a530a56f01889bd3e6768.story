Eight of Liverpool's starting line-up were signed by Brendan Rodgers, confirmation of the impact he's had in little over two years at Anfield. 

The three he inherited weren't too shabby either; Steve Gerrard (homegrown), Raheem Sterling (signed by Rafa Benitez) and Jordan Henderson (Kenny Dalglish) 

The match against Ludogorets was Brendan Rodgers' first as a manager, and Liverpool's first in five years

More people at Anfield than in whole of Razgrad

There were a few empty seats at Anfield but the 43,307 crowd was still larger than the entire population of Razgrad, the north-eastern Bulgrian town that Ludogorets come from. That is estimated at around 38,000.

Henderson's first match as vice-captain 

Jordan Henderson led by example in his first outing since being named the club's official vice-captain to Steven Gerrard. It wasn't the easiest evening for Liverpool but Henderson showed incredible energy and always tried to make himself available for the man on the ball. He might not be another Gerrard, but he'll be a good captain in years to come, possibly for England too.

Is Adam Lallana the new Joe Allen?

Early days yet but Brendan Rodgers will be hoping Adam Lallana isn't this year's Joe Allen. Fine player and all that but so far he just seems a bit overawed. He scuffed a great chance to put Liverpool ahead, at which point the camera rather unkindly panned to the injured Daniel Sturridge, sitting in the stands. 

Liverpool signed Adam Lallana for £23million from Southampton but he has failed to impress thus far

Steven Gerrard sets new milestone 

At 34 years, 109 days, Steve Gerrard became the sixth-oldest Liverpool player in Europe, following Gary McAllister, Ian Callaghan, Jamie Carragher, Bruce Grobbelaar and Sami Hyypia. He was a player Brendan Rodgers felt he couldn't leave out despite the ageing skipper having faced Aston Villa 72 hours earlier.

Stadium announcer sets the scene

The stadium announcer tried to capture the emotion of Liverpool's Champions League return by playing Get Back by a local group called The Beatles. Given they have tricky trips to Bulgaria, Switzerland and Spain to follow and the possibility of Europa League, perhaps The Long and Winding Road would have been more appropriate.

Raheem Sterling reputation growing

Raheem Sterling found out his reputation comes before him these days. Ludogorets No 80 Junior Caicara stuck to him like glue and it was an excellent little tussle with Caicara showing enough tenacity and low centre of gravity to ensure he did a lot better than many Premier League defenders
