Thousands of desperate homeowners with interest-only mortgages could forfeit their children’s inheritance in a bid to avoid repossession.

Every year, half of those reaching the end of their interest-only home loan find they are unable to pay off their debt.

Santander has become the first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release – for people in this position. The family home is then sold when they die and all or part of the proceeds handed to the bank to pay back the outstanding loan.

But experts warned that such schemes should only be used as a last resort and borrowers should discuss it with their families before effectively selling off the family silver.

The lifetime loans are designed to help tackle a mortgage timebomb which could see families forced to downsize at the end of their fixed term or face repossession.

Millions took out interest-only mortgages in the 1980s and 1990s. Monthly repayments are lower than with a traditional mortgage because only the interest, rather than any capital, is being paid off. However, that leaves the full loan to be repaid at the end of a typical 25-year term.

But around half of the 85,000 loans of this kind which expire every year cannot be paid off in full, with the average shortfall in excess of £71,000.

Around one in ten of those with such loans failed to plan ahead and save money into a repayment plan. Others bought an endowment policy, a stockmarket-linked savings plan designed to pay off the loan in full but which, millions have discovered, actually falls well short.

Now those who find themselves with a shortfall could be offered the new deals.

Santander said ‘a lifetime mortgage is one option we are considering for 2015’ in a bid to save families from eviction or being forced to sell their home and downsize to a cheaper property.

Other major banks are also understood to be considering following Santander into the equity release market, which is dominated by insurance companies.

Nigel Waterson, of the Equity Release Council, admitted that lifetime mortgages can cause tension with family members wanting to keep hold of their inheritance. He said: ‘The ombudsman receives very few complaints about equity release compared to normal mortgages, but those they do receive are mostly from sons and daughters, which is sad but not really surprising.

‘If the banks were to become a member of our council then we would require them to follow our strict standards and make sure borrowers have discussed their decision with family members.’

Lifetime mortgages will work like equity release, where homeowners use their property like a cash machine by borrowing money against the equity they have built up.

The difference is that with traditional equity release, borrowers never repay the interest. With the bank loans proposed by Santander they will pay monthly interest until they die. The remaining debt will be deducted from the sale value of the property, leaving their children or grandchildren with a reduced inheritance.

Banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest-only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan

Banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest-only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan – leaving more at risk of having their home repossessed.

Previously, older workers unable to pay could switch to a repayment mortgage or extend their interest-only term – but many have been shut out by the tougher rules, designed to restrict risky lending, introduced in April.

Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘Lifetime loans will offer an alternative but you have got to be very, very careful before buying these types of products. When you are talking about inheritance intended for family members the subject becomes very emotive.’
