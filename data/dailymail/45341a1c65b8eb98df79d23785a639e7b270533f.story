Alex Wein's idea for his latest photography project was simple - so simple he did it standing on his head.

The 23-year-old turned the art of self-portrait upside-down with pictures from his road trip - doing headstands across America.

The photographer from Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., went topsy-turvy from the edge of the 
Grand Canyon to the deserts of Utah to produce a playful portrait 
collection that sees him observing the world from upside down.

Head over heels: Alex Wein said his Grand Canyon was the 'craziest' of his headstand locations

Footloose: The photographer threw caution to the wind when he performed the stunt in the middle of the road on the Memphis and Arkansas Bridge

Fresh perspective: The pictures were taken on a road trip around some of the most stunning sites in America, such as Monument Valley in Utah

Mr Wein came up with the idea after he spotted a girl doing a headstand in a park in San Francisco.

He was at the park with a group of friends from Brighton, UK, the day before they were due to set off on a road trip around America.

Despite a painstaking lesson from the girl and hours trying to master the stunt, Mr Wein just couldn't do it.

But he refused to stand around and be ridiculed by his friends, and when they made their first stop on the road trip he tried again.

He was thrilled when he finally mastered it - and celebrated by continuing to perform headstands throughout their three-week trip and asking his friends to photograph him.

And as these images show, Mr Wein performed the precarious balancing act in a skate park, a cemetery, in the middle of the road and even on the edge of a cliff.

Mr Wein said: 'I'd tried for hours to do a headstand in the park that day but for the life of me I just couldn't do it.

Spot the skateboard: Alex Wein set up unusual shots in some more mundane locations, such as this picture from Kona Skatepark in Jacksonville, Florida

Head over heels: Mr Wein was inspired by the photographic potential of this fallen roof in Harford County, Maryland

Top of the world: Alex Wein's friends stood on hand to take this picture of him on the edge of King and Queen's Seat, Rocks, Maryland

Headstone: Lafayette Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana, provided the backdrop for this shot

Feet of clay: The lap of this Buddha statue in the Sculpture Garden of the Maryland Institute College of Art became another perfect headrest

Road stand: Shabby Madeira Street in Baltimore, Maryland, inspired the young photographer to take this artistic headstand shot

Headland: Presumably no cars came along this deserted-looking road in Marin, California, while Alex Wein was taking his photograph

'I was so determined to do it so when I finally did, I was so excited.

'It became a bit of a joke for me for me to do a headstand everywhere we stopped.

'I'd read about other self-portrait projects where people had taken photos of themselves across America, so when I finally managed the headstand it seemed like a great idea to use that as an idea for my next project.

'We were on the road for around three weeks we went from San Francisco to LA, South West Utah, along the Gold Coast to the Grand Canyon, Florida, Alabama and finished in Baltimore.

'I'd do a headstand picture every day of the trip, sometimes I'd do two or three a day it really depended on our surroundings. If the landscape changed a lot that day I'd usually do more than one picture.

'We were at the mercy of the landscape really. I'd always look for the most unusual locations and the edge of the Grand Canyon was definitely the craziest.

Upside-dune: The incredible inland White Sands in the Tularosa Basin, New Mexico, made a soft cushion at this stop on Alex Wein's journey

Head banger: A quick musical interlude at a piano at Wild Horses Studio gave Alex Wein the chance to mix his photo series up a bit

Head of state: Alex Wein takes his stunt to the Capitol in Washington DC

Head of the river: Alex Wein did another headstand when he visited Ninth Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana, along the Mississippi

Headstand tall: Alex Wein straightened up next to the trees in Springwood, Maryland

'The road trip was in 2012 but the project is still going if I spot somewhere cool I just have to do a headstand and get someone to take my picture.

'Sometimes I'm on my own and I ask a member of the public to take my photo.

'They just think I want a normal tourist photo, so they're pretty shocked when I suddenly do a headstand, it can be quite funny.'
