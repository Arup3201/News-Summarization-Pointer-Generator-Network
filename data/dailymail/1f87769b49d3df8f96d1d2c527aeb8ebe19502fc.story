The parents of a six-year-old boy were left red-faced after their six-year-old boy had to be cut free from a pair of furry handcuffs. 

The family were throwing a New Year's Eve party in their flat in Hösbach, northwest Bavaria, when the child came across the sex toy.

He had got bored during the party and decided to explore the apartment when he found the handcuffs in his parents' bedroom.

Being naturally curious, he decided to put them on and locked his hands in the cuffs. 

When the boy realised he could not get them off he went to show the rest of the guests.

However, his parents were unable to find the key to the lock.

The boy was taken by his grandmother and mother to Aschaffenburg-Hösbach police station where traffic officers were able to free him using 'special tools'.  

A police spokesman told The Local: 'New Year’s was saved'.
