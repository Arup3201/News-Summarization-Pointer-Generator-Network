A fitness-obsessed co-ed that became unable to sleep last year made a startling discovery during a routine medical exam.

Christina Speirs, 22, of New York, exercised almost every single day, taught yoga and stayed in top shape. What she thought was a product of drinking too much water turned out to be a cancerous tumor growing inside her.

The tumor was on her kidneys and forced her body to produce hormones that kept her awake almost continuously, she recalled to ABC News.

She couldn't sleep: Christina Speirs didn't think being awake more was abnormal

‘I had a lot of energy,’ Ms Speirs said. ‘I wasn't sleeping... I was always on the go, I was never tired.’

Ms Speirs thought the high amounts of water she was drinking caused her to wake up often during the night, so she did nothing about it until a medical exam made a shocking discovery.

Doctors discovered last fall that her blood pressure was high, ‘through the roof’ high, but her potassium levels were low – it stumped them.

‘That really freaked me out because them not knowing what's wrong with me, they're doctors, you know?’ Said Ms Speirs.

After ruling out a heart condition, doctors checked her kidneys at the urging of her mother.

The sonogram stumped doctors as well, it appeared she had one combined kidney, throwing the co-ed into further panic as she was whisked to an MRI.

Horrified: Ms Speirs was shocked when doctors told her she had a large tumor inside her

The sonogram technician asked if she felt anything, Ms Speirs replied she felt fine.

The MRI showed she had two kidneys, but instead she horrifyingly had a tumor almost the size of a grapefruit growing inside her.

‘I was in complete shock,’ Ms Speirs recalled to ABC, saying she called her parents because she needed surgery. ‘Then, I got so upset honestly. I had no idea where this came from.’

She also soon learned the tumor was producing the hormones aldosterone and cortisol – which led doctors to fear it was cancerous.

Her surgery was scheduled at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York for October 31, 2012 – Halloween night.

Better now: Ms Speirs is cancer-free and able to sleep

As if having her surgery on the same night ghouls and ghosts run amok wasn’t bad enough, Superstorm Sandy unleashed it’s wrath on the city only two days prior.

The hospital was overcrowded and short-staffed, but her medical team was determined to save her life.

The 22-year-old was in the hospital during the storm, unaware of the damage it caused to the city, but was wheeled past several people displaced by the worst storm in the city’s history.

‘I was just kind of a little teary,’ she remembered.

Doctors removed the tumor, stage 2 cancer. Described as adrenal cortical carcinoma, the tumor was growing on her liver – it affects one in several hundred thousand people, Ms Speirs’ doctor told ABC.

Ms Speirs awoke after the surgery with no electricity because of the storm, but that mattered little to her.

‘I was just happy to be alive,’ she said.

She is now cancer-free, but takes medication to stay that way. One of the side effects of the medication happens to be drowsiness – she can’t do hot yoga anymore, but now she can sleep.
