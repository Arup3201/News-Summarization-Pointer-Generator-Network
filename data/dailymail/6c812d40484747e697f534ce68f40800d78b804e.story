A teacher handed police shocking secret footage which allegedly shows two colleagues slapping and choking a special needs student before knocking him off a chair.

The video was filmed at Harper-Archer Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia, over four days by a teacher who claimed the principal did not act on her complaints.

Classroom aide Alger Coleman, 42, was arrested and charged with child cruelty and simple battery.

Attack: Shocking secret footage allegedly shows two classroom aides assaulting a student in Atlanta

Action: One aide has been criminally charged and another has been reassigned outside the classroom

'I was shocked, outraged and you have to add profoundly disappointed,' said Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis told CBS 46.

'We are looking into all of the communications that took place'.

According to the Atlanta Police Department, the video was shot by teacher Tori Jackson-Reynolds.

It appears to show Coleman, and another female aide alleged to be Keisha Smith, repeatedly physically abusing two boys.

One shocking section shows an aide smack one of the boys in the head so hard he falls out of his chair.

Charged: Classroom aide Alger Coleman

After the boy gets back up, he is put in a choke hold and slapped again.

The video was recorded in February and police were alerted last month.

The Atlanta Police Department incident report, seen by MailOnline, said: 'Mrs Jackson-Reynolds stated that she was appalled at the unprofessional behavior of her paraprofessional (being lazy and unattentive to students' needs).

'To document the staff's behavior she placed a video recording device in the classroom for several days. Mrs. Jackson-Reynolds gave me a copy on the video, which we reviewed together.

'While reviewing the video I observed a black male which Mrs Jackson-Reynolds referred to as Mr Al Coleman slap [a pupil] several times and place him in a wrestling type choke hold.

'Seconds after the slapping 'Mr Coleman' slapped [the pupil] again with enough force to knock him out of his seat.'

The report said the officer phoned the boy's mother, who said she was aware of the allegations, her son had not been injured and she was reluctant to press charges, saying: 'I know my son is a handful and I don't want to jump to any conclusion before I watch the video.'

But after viewing it, she agreed to press charges.

Coleman was arrested at his home south of Atlanta after police broke down his door.

Ms Smith was not criminally charged, and was instead reassigned outside the classroom pending a disciplinary hearing.

But Kimberly Green, spokesman for Atlanta Public Schools, told MailOnline today Ms Smith resigned this week before the hearing could take place.

'She's no longer with the school district,' she said. 'She has resigned as of April 28.'

The mother of one of the children, aged just 11, broke down in tears when shown the secret footage by WSBTV.

Allegations: The focus is on Harper-Archer Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia

She said: 'I was heartbroken, I was very heartbroken... I really couldn't believe the school would let this go on.'

She added the second classroom aide should face criminal charges.

'I want them charged today, yes today', she said.

She also thanked the 'Good Samaritan' teacher who made the footage.

Atlanta Public Schools issued a statement when the footage was made public last week.

It said: 'Atlanta Public Schools can confirm that Alger Coleman is no longer with the district.

'The safety and security of our students remain a top priority for Atlanta Public Schools.

'The
 district takes all complaints seriously and reporting behavior that is 
harmful to our students is everyone's responsibility.'
