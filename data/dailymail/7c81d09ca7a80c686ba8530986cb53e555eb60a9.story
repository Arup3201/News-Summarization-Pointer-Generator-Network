It's official: The trout pout is out; the chin is in. The Real Housewives of Orange County's Vicki Gunvalson and Teen Mom Farrah Abraham are among the celebrities who have been showing off noticeably more defined jawlines.

Last year, the American Society of Plastic Surgery reported that the 'chinplant' was the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery procedure.

Gunvalson reportedly got her chin tweaked as part of an $8,000 'breakover' 
surgical overhaul following her divorce from ex-husband Donn.

Countless other stars are rumored to have been nipped and tucked below the nose.

Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol emerged 
with a much more prominent chin after jaw surgery. She never confirmed 
an implant, but experts say that procedures to correct bite problems,
rhinoplasty and/or facial liposuction can be performed at the same 
time. 

So why is the surgery becoming so popular? A strong chin is traditionally a sign of strength and success. Many people want to balance their face to look better onscreen, whether that involves reality TV or video conferencing at work.

Cautionary
tale: Heidi Montag, pictured here in late 2012, had 10 surgeries in 2009 that included chin augmentation 
and a brow lift. She has since expressed regret about the multiple operations

In younger women, this may mean adding definition. Older women often want to defy gravity and fight sagging.

'A weak chin makes an aging face look older, and we most commonly see 
this in women,' explains New York plastic surgeon Dr David Rapaport. 'We get jowls.'

So which celebrity has the most-wanted chin? Browsing through plastic
surgery blogs, Angelina Jolie's angular profile is a favorite - there 
are dozens of online debates devoted to whether or not she has had work 
done below the nose.  

When Pacific Plastic Surgery Group compiled a list of their five 
most requested celebrity body parts, Jennifer Lopez, Keira
Knightly and Halle Berry's chins were at the top.

But for potential 
patients, it's not as simple as walking in with a Mr Potato Head 
profile and asking for the Christina Hendricks cleft.

'Each patient is 
completely unique. It's about blending the lower face with the rest of 
the face. It's like art,' Dr Rapaport explains. 

Implants can either be temporary - where
surgeons inject fillers such as Radiesse or the patent's own fat - or 
permanent with silicone.

The injectables can last up to a year - longer than, for example, a shot of Botox - but patients will have to come back for top-ups.

Surgeons can also saw down the bone to make a chin smaller.The important thing, doctors stress, is that the face stays in balance.

Shortly after her full-body makeover that involved ten surgeries, Heidi Montag said that her chin was her 'favorite'. She later said that she regretted having so much work done.

With 'chinplants', as with most surgeries, sometimes less is more.
