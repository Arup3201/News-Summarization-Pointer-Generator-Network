Voting for Ukip is about a 'state of mind', not policies, Nigel Farage will say today.

In his first major election event, the Ukip leader will use a speech in Essex to pledge to fight a 'positive' campaign that highlights the party's values and beliefs.

Last month, it emerged that Ukip policy chief Tim Aker had been forced to quit after falling behind on work to finish the party's manifesto.

Ukip's 2010 manifesto included a number of bizarre policies, such as requiring taxi drivers to wear uniforms. Mr Farage was later forced to disown it, saying it was 'drivel' that had been written by an 'idiot'.

Upbeat approach: Voting for Ukip is about a 'state of mind', not policies, its leader Nigel Farage will say in a speech in Essex today

But Mr Farage last night said the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies.

He said: 'We will have a fully-costed manifesto, with policies across a range of issues. But I actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates. We are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic.

'It's about a state of mind, an attitude. We are on the side of the small guy, we are on the side of patriotic people, we believe in a Britain that is free and independent with a proper border control policy, and people know that.'

The three main parties launched their election campaigns six weeks ago, but Mr Farage said voters were not yet ready to pay attention. And he accused them of a conspiracy of silence on immigration.

'They have started miles too early – already they are boring the public to death,' he said. 'Labour are trying to weaponise the NHS, the Tories pretending everything in the garden is rosy – both of them barely credible.

'Neither of them is offering any solution at all to the immigration issue and its impact on jobs, schools and hospitals.

What the people want: Mr Farage says the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies

'Instead we are getting a negative, US-style campaign of personal attacks, which we are not going to have anything to do with. They can say what they like about me - I will turn the other cheek.'

Mr Farage will also make the audacious claim that Ukip, which has MEPs in England, Scotland and Wales is now the only national party.

He will attack the others as 'regional parties', with the Conservatives unable to break out of their southern heartlands, and Labour making no progress outside the north.
