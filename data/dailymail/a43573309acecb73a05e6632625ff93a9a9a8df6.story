Andrew Sadek's body turned up last June along the banks of the Red River, which winds between Minnesota and North Dakota, with a gunshot wound to the head.

The 20-year-old college student had been cooperating with narcotics task force SEMCA, as a confidential informant, but had severed contact with agents shortly before his death.

With the gun that killed her son still missing, Sadek's mother believes that force knows more than it is sharing about the events surrounding his death.

More questions: Andrew Sadek, 20, turned up dead months after walking away from a role as confidential informant for a narcotics task force, who his mother, Tammy, believes pressured him

'There are more students in danger,' Tammy Sadek told KVLY after a report was released this week. 'SEMCA is alive and well, doing what they please.'

She had petitioned the North Dakota Attorney General for an independent review of SEMCA, which she has accused of bullying her son into the risky position of being a confidential informant.

According to the five-page report, in April 2013 Sadek sold two small quantities of marijuana that together totaled $80 to a SEMCA informant on the North Dakota State College of Science campus, where Sadek attended classes.

In November of that year, SEMCA agents searched Sadek's dorm room and found a plastic grinder with marijuana residue that Sadek confessed belonged to him.

During an interview at a police station in Wahpeton, the report states, Sadek was told about the charges he was facing and agreed to become a confidential informant in order that the charges be dropped or eliminated.

Between November 2013 and January 2014, he bought marijuana on three separate occasions under the direction of a SEMCA agent.

After the third buy, Sadek stopped communicating with SEMCA agents, who tried to push him to make more narcotics purchases, the report says.

Early in May, Sadek was reported missing. In June his body was fished out of the Red River near Breckenridge, Minnesota.  

The review, ordered by SEMCA's Executive Board and conducted by the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, outlined four minor recommendations.

This included requiring briefings before informants carried out controlled buys and requested an official supervisor be appointed to the task force. It also recommended assigning a North Dakota BCI agent to SEMCA. 

Unsolved: Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself

Good student: His mother said that there are more students like her son that are being put at risk by SEMCA

The review found no wrongdoing in the task force's conduct and did not give details about the investigation into Sadek's death.

The student was last seen leaving Nordgaard Hall at 2 a.m. on May 2 wearing a red and black sweatshirt. 

When he turned up dead in June, he was in a jacket that his mother didn't recognize. His wallet has yet to be recovered,Twin Cities reports.

The weapon that killed him has also not been found, and though the family says it's missing a .22-caliber pistol, his mother believes his circumstances point to suicide.

'There was no suicidal tendencies,' she said back in October. 'There was no note. There was no depression. And his grades were excellent.'

On campus: Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son

'Somebody knows something. They need to have the strength and courage to come forward and speak up.'

The use of confidential informants to conduct buys for law enforcement on college campuses has drawn scrutiny recently. 

Earlier this month, UMass-Amherst Chancellor announced the end of a controversial UMass police program that worked to turn students arrested for narcotics into informants.

In 2013, Eric Sinacori, a 20-year-old UMass junior who had become an informant after being caught selling Molly and LSD to an undercover officer, overdosed on heroine in his off-campus apartment.

In spite of finding a hypodermic needle during a search, officers did not arrest Sinacori or inform his parents, something that his mother, Francesca, believed had allowed his addiction to fester.

'If you find a needle on my kid, you have to assume it’s heroin. And if it’s heroin, you have to say something,' she told the Boston Globe.
