Julie Mannion, 45, was having a cigarette outside North Manchester General Hospital when she claims a security guard punched her in the face

A woman patient was knocked unconscious and suffered horrendous facial injuries when she was punched by a hospital security guard, it was claimed today.

Police and hospital bosses are probing reports the security guard punched Julie Mannion in the face outside Manchester North General Hospitalâ€™s A&E department.

Julie, 45, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, spent three days at Salford Royal and had to undergo an MRI scan after she says she was knocked unconscious.

She had originally been taken to A&E at North Manchester shortly after midnight on Saturday, April 12, after banging the back of her head during an altercation at the Golden Lion pub near her home.

The customer service adviser claims that while she was outside the unit having a cigarette the security guard punched her, leaving her with two black eyes.

She says she left the hospital and went five miles away to Salford Royal casualty unit for treatment.

Pennine Acute Trust, which runs the hospital, and its security contractors, Mitie, are holding a joint investigation.

It is understood the incident was captured by hospital CCTV cameras and the security guard has been suspended.

Greater Manchester Police are also investigating but no arrests have been made. Julie says she has been left terrified by the ordeal.

She said: 'It came from nowhere. He just came and punched me full in the face. I was knocked out for a few seconds.

Ms Mannion was initially admitted after banging the back of her head in an altercation in a pub near her home

After she was punched, Ms Mannion went to another hospital, Salford Royal, for treatment on her face

'Itâ€™s made me very nervous now, particularly around security guards and people in uniform.'

It is understood hospital bosses have been told Julie and her boyfriend had been involved in an argument with the guard who was escorting the man from the premises.

A spokesman for Pennice Acute Trust said: 'A hospital security officer was carrying out his duties when this incident occurred.

'Regretfully, a patient suffered an injury. The police attended and dealt with the incident.'

Penine Acute Trust, which runs the hospital, is investigating. The security guard, who worked for Mitie, has been suspended and the company has launched its own probe
