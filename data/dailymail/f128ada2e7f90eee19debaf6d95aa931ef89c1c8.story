Derek Grant, 38, pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of Patrick Bradley (pictured), who blinded  father-of three Grant in one eye when he was confronted after stealing Grant's son's phone

A man killed a thief who stole his son’s iPhone after using a mobile phone application to track him down.

Derek Grant’s son Jordan, a university student, was held up by convicted thug Patrick Bradley as he made his way home from work last August.

The 20-year-old and his father used a mobile phone app to track down the missing phone – and found it, and Bradley with it.

Derek Grant, of Greenock, Renfrewshire, demanded the handset from Bradley – who then blinded the father-of-four in one eye by stabbing him in the face.

But a badly-hurt Grant retaliated by knifing the 29-year-old and fatally injuring him.

It led to the 38-year-old former driver being charged and yesterday, at the High Court in Glasgow, he admitted the culpable homicide of Bradley.

A judge heard how Grant had only reacted after being subjected to ‘extreme violence’ and that the incident was a ‘tragedy’ for his ‘high achieving’ family.

Grant was remanded in custody and will learn his fate next month, but culpable homicide can lead to a prison sentence in double figures.

The court heard how Jordan Grant had been returning to his home, late last August 30 when he was confronted by knife-wielding Bradley.

The thief - who had a significant record for violence - ordered the McDonalds worker to hand over his iPhone, which he did.

Jordan Grant went home and told his father who, using the ‘Find My iPhone’ app – discovered the mobile was still close by.

Derek Grant then left his home in the town with Jordan and his two younger sons Lee, 17, and 16-year-old Jamie.

They spotted Bradley, whom they did not know - and Derek Grant ordered him to hand back the stolen phone. But Bradley instead lashed out at Grant and knifed him in the left eye.

His frantic son Jordan screamed for help.

But his father repeatedly struck out at Bradley with a knife he had taken from home, having feared for his safety.

Bradley suffered a cardiac arrest and died following the incident.

He was found at an address in the town at around 1.15am and taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital but subsequently died.

Grant was arrested and he later said: ‘I wish to declare for the record that at the time of this incident, I was acting in self-defence.’

Grant had faced a murder charge before prosecutors yesterday accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.

His three sons were also accused of murder, but their not guilty pleas were accepted.

Advocate depute Douglas Fairley, QC, said it was agreed Grant had suffered a ‘significant’ degree of provocation before the fatal assault.

Grant’s lawyer, Ian Duguid, yesterday told the court that he only lashed out as a ‘reaction to the extreme violence’ he had faced.

Mr Duguid added that what happened had been a ‘tragedy’ and ‘catastrophic’ for a law-abiding family.

The court heard Jordan Grant was a university politics student, another son had hopes of being a footballer while a third was doing well at school.

The hearing was also told that Grant had been forced to give up his job as a driver after losing the sight in his left eye.

Mr Duguid went on: ‘It may become evident this is a family of high achievement.’

Lord Boyd remanded Grant in custody and deferred sentencing until September 1 at the High Court in Livingston.

Last year, Gulf War hostage John Nichol condemned police for failing to confront a thief who stole his wife’s iPhone – despite being told exactly where it was.

The £500 phone’s tracking software instantly revealed its location and the former RAF Tornado navigator passed the information to detectives.

But they were apparently ‘too busy’ to retrieve the phone. Instead, they bombarded Mr Nichol and his wife with phone calls asking them to fill in forms and offering victim support.

Mr Nichol, who was shot down during the 1991 Gulf War, held prisoner and paraded on Iraqi TV, was incredulous at their response to the disappearance of the phone, as his wife attended a meeting at her London office.

He added: ‘The thing about this is you can put a tracker on it. So we watched my wife’s iPhone getting out of the meeting, going along the road, getting on the Tube, getting out at Clapham Junction and making its way to a house in Clapham.’
