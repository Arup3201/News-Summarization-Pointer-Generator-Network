The 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times in a violent attack by two classmates and left for dead has thanked the thousands of people who sent heartfelt messages of support and thousands of dollars towards her recovery. 

A photo was released this week of the girl's hands holding a homemade card covered in purple hearts which simply read 'thank you'. She was surrounded by some of the hundreds of messages sent from supporters around the world. The other picture showed a collage of these notes arranged on her bedroom wall.

The unidentified middle-schooler was lured into the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin on May 31 
by 'friends' Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, also 12, who planned to 
kill her in order to gain access to the world of the mythical 'Slender 
Man'.

A picture of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month was released this week. Her identity is protected bu the little girl holds a simple thank you message with a purple heart amid some of the thousands of messages of support she has received

The girl survived the brutal stabbing 
and was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist 
found her and called 911.

Along with the messages of love that have been sent to the little girl to aid in her recovery, the public has also donated $50,000 towards her medical expenses through a fundraising page.

The family said in a statement: 'Our family would like to thank everyone who has supported our daughter on her miraculous road to recovery.

'Our little girl has received thousands of purple hearts from numerous countries and from most continents. We simply cannot put into words how grateful we are for the prayers, packages and heartfelt messages. We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support.'

Her family spokesman told ABC that she is making a slow but steady recovery and had recently gone to watch a Disney movie with her dad.

The family statement added: 'Together as a family, we continue to 
adjust to our ''new normal''. She has a courageous heart and bravely deals
 with both the physical and emotional challenges since the attack.'

The parents of the 12-year-old victim of the 'Slender Man' stabbing said their daughter's condition is slowly improving. The girl is pictured being transported to the hospital after being stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month

Geyser and Weier have since been charged
 as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police 
say they had been plotting the crime for month.

Geyser's attorneys have asked that she receive a mental health evaluation.

Weier and Geyser, are due back in
 court on July 2. Neither has so far entered a plea.

Both suspects told police they tried 
to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a 
character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is
 devoted to horror stories.

Geyser's obsession with the mythical 
man was something her parents seemed to be aware of as well, as her 
father proudly shared a crayon drawing his daughter drew of Slender Man 
while they were out to dinner one night.

But
 far from being alarmed by the disturbing sketch, Morgan's father Matt 
seemed to find it amusing and posted it on his social network account.

Beneath the picture he wrote: 'Only Mogo (Morgan) draws Slenderman in crayon on a napkin when we are out to dinner'.

to police that they stabbed the classmate in hopes of joining the cult of the 'Slender Man'

In
 an official police report, Weier said Slender Man is the ‘leader’ of 
Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty.

She
 explained Geyser told her they needed slaughter their friend in order to become ‘proxies’ of Slender 
Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

They 
planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion.

Geyser
 was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. 

But
 they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a 
bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew 
there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down.

When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband.

They planned to play 
hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of 
sight, in the trees.

The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth 
that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009.

It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed 19 times.

Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg.

On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene.

Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious.

'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.'

Suspects 
Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison.

Geyser's family members broke into tears several times during her first court appearance on Monday. 

‘The family is very horrified at what has happened,’ attorney Donna Kuchler said.

If
 moved into juvenile court and convicted, the girls could be held at 
most until they were 25 years old, Waukesha County District Attorney 
Brad Schimel told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

‘It's a very shocking incident. There's no two ways about it,’ he added.
