I gave Wayne Rooney a standing ovation after he said the most sensible and productive thing any England player has said for decades.

'We are too honest,' our best player said. At long last someone gets it, someone who’s at the centre of England’s misery finally understands one of the basics of World Cups: you won’t get anywhere without a little bit of cheating.

You can all get on your moral high horse and gallop off into the self-righteous distance if you like, but Rooney is unquestionably correct.

I’ll give you two examples that could have – and should have – changed the course of English football history.

Admission: Wayne Rooney said England were too honest during their World Cup disaster

Exit: England were eliminated eight days into the tournament and didn't win a game in Brazil

Firstly, Mexico 86. I notice this week Gary Lineker has been defending his record of no yellow cards in his career. That is a shameful boast. England were 2-1 down in the quarter final to Argentina in 1986, and late in the game John Barnes sends over a delicious cross to give Lineker a golden chance to equalise.

But desperate to protect his no yellow cards boast, he bottled it, and Argentina cleared. Lineker should have cheated: by that stage of the game every England player knew Diego Maradona had scored with his hand, so Lineker should have cheated too. Elbow the defender out of the way, or put the ball in with your hand – just do whatever it takes to get that ball over the line and keep England in the World Cup.

I’m not the only one who thinks that. I recently interviewed one of the England squad from 1986 who felt exactly the same way. But he wouldn’t go on record because 'you can’t crticise Gary, can you?' Yes I can. He should have been prepared to cheat for his country, and exact instant revenge on Maradona.

Clean: Gary Lineker never received a yellow card during his career at the highest level

Hand of God: Diego Maradona's infamous goal against England at the Estadio Azteca in 1986

The second example happened in this World Cup: Luis Suarez was clearly rushed back from injury to save Uruguay. So in Sao Paulo when he took to the field against England, did none of our players think it would be a good idea to get stuck into him?

Don’t misunderstand what I’m saying here – I don’t mean break his legs deliberately or anything so crass. No, let’s be clear – I mean get physical with him, unsettle him, put him off his game. Rooney said that he was kicked 10 times during the Uruguay game and every time the opponent got away with it. So why didn’t we do the same to their best player, who wasn’t fully fit?

Instead our players set up a five-yard exclusion zone around Suarez that no player in a white shirt could enter. The players might as well have sat in the crowd watching him. GET STUCK INTO HIM! Kick him off the park if you have to.

Freedom: Luis Suarez ran England ragged during their 2-1 victory in Sao Paulo

Buried: Suarez scored twice to eliminate England from the tournament after their second loss

Diego Godin avoided a yellow card for planting his forearm into Daniel Sturridge’s throat. Where I used to play football if a ref did that it meant you had a free shot at one of their players. So where was the English elbow in the Uruguay throat? It never happened.

I don’t want to win the FairPlay award thanks, I want to stay in the World Cup.

Look at those who have done well: 2010 – both finalists disgraced the game with 120 minutes of kicking, fouling and diving. 2006 – Italy won the World Cup but cheated in the round of 16, Fabio Grosso admitted he dived for a penalty to beat Australia in the final moments of the game.

In 2002 – Brazil were world champions, but who can forget Rivaldo clutching his face to get Hakan Unsal sent off when the Turk had clearly kicked the ball at Rivaldo’s leg? Rivaldo even confessed he’d cheated straight afterwards.

Struck: Rivaldo falls to the floor holding his face in 2002, even though the ball hit his leg

Tumble: Fabio Grosso dived to win a penalty against Australia in 2006, and Italy went on to win the World Cup

The list goes on and so England face a choice: do we carry on giving every team we play against a head start? Or do we get down and dirty with the rest of them?

England must start cheating. It’s what winners do.
