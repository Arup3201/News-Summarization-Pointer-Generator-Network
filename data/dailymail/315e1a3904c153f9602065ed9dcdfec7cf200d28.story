If you were to guess what this prim-looking lady with neatly cropped hair sporting a drab grey cardigan gets up to at night, you might imagine it involves a hot mug of chocolate and earnest novel.

But in fact, as these pictures show, she whips off her top, adorns her nipples with fluffy feathers and dons a bright pink wig to transform into Viola Van Wilde, her burlesque alter ego.

Photographer Sean Scheidt decided to embark on a project showing the contrast between the real-life people and their glamourous and risqué stage personas.

The Baltimore-based 31-year-old says each photography session in the series he calls 'Burlesque' took between two and five hours, during which time he interviews the subjects - who do not wish to make their real names public.

Sean explains: 'The shoots are more than anything an interview process. We talk about the "why" behind burlesque, how their families have reacted, what challenges they face among other things.

'This helps make them really unaware that they are in my space being photographed. It disarms and gives them more power over the final image.

'Usually performers have control over their space and their crowd. When you take them out of that and place them in my studio, I have the power.

'This is my way of trying to give as much back to them so that the images are as true as possible.'

Performer Fox Martin: On the surface, burlesque may seem no different than stripping, but the photographer says it's a form of artistic expression

The photographer says he has friends in burlesque and has been going to shows for the past two years, but without much more than a surface interest.

So what inspired him to start the photography project?

'I was hired to photograph a burlesque show, but found myself fascinated by what occurred backstage and seeing ordinary people transform themselves completely in various ways.

'Then about a week later I happened upon a YouTube video of Judy Garland rehearsing, that was spliced with the actual performance she gave a few hours later.

'It was really amazing, she appeared to be a drunken mess, or sleepy or whatever, but a wreck, mumbling words, etc. A few hours later she was just ON and amazing. She had transformed completely for the stage.'

The photographer embarked on a project capturing burlesque performers, including Marla Meringue above, after he was hired to photograph a burlesque show and found himself fascinated by what was happening backstage

The photographer says: 'I saw this exact transformation backstage during the burlesque show (not from a wreck to something spectacular, but a transformation nonetheless).

'So, I began to reach out to the Bbrlesque community to try and photograph this process of transformation. The idea is very simple upfront, to juxtapose photographs of each performer as they are every day, with an image as their stage persona.

'As I began to know the subjects personally, the project began to take on the task of confronting what viewers might believe burlesque is all about and any preconceived notions about what a person who does Burlesque might be like.'

The photographer wants his project to clarify the distinction between burlesque and striptease. 'For those unfamiliar, burlesque can, on the surface, seem no different than stripping.'

But he explains: 'While striptease is also used in burlesque there is a distinction between the two. In burlesque, performers use their bodies as a tool to confront an audience, often using the striptease to challenge sexual objectification, orientation and other social taboos.

'In this way performers are in control of their own bodies and how they are presented to an audience. This can make a lot of people uncomfortable and is in direct opposition to stripping where "performer" is reduced to no more than a sexual object, catering only to the sexual fantasies of the often male dominated, audience.

'It is my hope that this project highlights that point by de-mystifying and showing each performer as a person who has ownership of their own body. I also hope this project allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment, and consider the individual, as well as the art of performance.'
