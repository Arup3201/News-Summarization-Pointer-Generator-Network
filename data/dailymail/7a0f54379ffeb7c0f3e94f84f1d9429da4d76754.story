More than 10,000 
people could die when - not if - a monster earthquake and tsunami occur 
just off the Pacific Northwest coast, researchers told Oregon 
legislators today.

Coastal towns would be inundated, schools, buildings and bridges would collapse, and economic damage could hit $32 billion.

These
findings were published in a chilling new report by the Oregon Seismic 
Safety Policy Advisory Commission, a group of more than 150 volunteer 
experts.

Warning: Experts have warned of a mega-quake and tsunami hitting Oregon. They say such a natural disaster is expected and will cause untold damage to the Northwest Pacific coast

In 2011, the Legislature authorized 
the study of what would happen if a quake and tsunami such as the one 
that devastated Japan hit the Pacific Northwest.

The
Cascadia Subduction Zone, just off the regional coastline, produced a 
mega-quake in the year 1700.

Seismic experts say another monster quake 
and tsunami are overdue.

'This earthquake will
hit us again,' Kent Yu, an engineer and chairman of the commission, 
told lawmakers. 'It's just a matter of how soon.'

When it hits, the report says, there will be devastation and death from Northern California to British Columbia.

Many Oregon communities will be left without water, power, heat and telephone service. Gasoline supplies will be disrupted.

The
2011 Japan quake and tsunami were a wake-up call for the Pacific 
Northwest. Governments have been taking a closer look at whether the 
region is prepared for something similar and discovering it is not.

Japan earthquake: The report presented today to Oregon legislators warns a quake and tsunami similar to that which hit Japan in 2011 is imminent

Devastation: The damage caused to Japan in the 2011 quake is well-known. Experts say a comparable natural disaster off the northwest coast of the states is 'long overdue'

Oregon
legislators requested the study so they could better inform themselves 
about what needs to be done to prepare and recover from such a giant 
natural disaster.

The report says that 
geologically, Oregon and Japan are mirror images. Despite the 
devastation in Japan, that country was more prepared than Oregon because
it had spent billions on technology to reduce the damage, the report 
says.

Jay Wilson, the commission's vice 
chairman, visited Japan and said he was profoundly affected as he walked
through villages ravaged by the tsunami.

'It 
was just as if these communities were ghost towns, and for the most part
there was nothing left,' said Wilson, who works for the Clackamas 
County emergency management department.

Under-prepared: Experts warn Oregon is not prepared for such as state of emergency

Wilson
told legislators that there was a similar event 313 years ago in the 
Pacific Northwest, and 'we're well within the window for it to happen 
again.'

Experts representing a variety of 
state agencies, industries and organizations expanded on the report's 
findings and shared with lawmakers how they have begun planning.

Sue
Graves, a safety coordinator for the Lincoln County School District, 
told lawmakers that high school students in her district take 
semester-long classes that teach CPR and other survival techniques in 
the wake of a giant earthquake.

The class teaches students to "duck, 
cover and hold" when the ground starts shaking.

Maree
Wacker, chief executive officer of the American Red Cross of Oregon, 
said it is important for residents to have their own contingency plans 
for natural disasters.

'Oregonians as individuals are under-prepared,' she said.Â
