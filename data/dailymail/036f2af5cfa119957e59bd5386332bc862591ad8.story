From Darth Vader riding the tram and baseball players wielding lightsabers to Han Solo frozen in carbonite found dumped in a back alley – these images make the Star Wars galaxy seem not so far, far away after all. 

Superfan Thomas Dagg, 24, used Photoshop and the toys he'd had since childhood to superimpose characters and machines into everyday surroundings in Toronto, Canada.

He said the images are his way of paying homage to his to his favourite films which he used to watch on VHS almost every night, eventually wearing out the tapes altogether.

'The project is inspired by the imagination I had when I was eight year old child. I loved, and lived, Star Wars back then,' he said.

He intended to depict a world in which Star Wars characters and technology are mundane sights.

'I wanted the photos to seem realistic. If you had to photograph something flying past your window in real life it wouldn't be a clear shot - it would be blurred,' he said.

'I had to work very hard to make it look like I had just snapped the photos in passing and accidentally captured something amazing.'

Each photo took days of planning and around five hours of editing.

'It's quite a complicated process,' he said. 'It usually takes four to five hours to edit the photo but it can take days to find the right location and figure out the suitable lighting and angle.

'I used a lot of the toys I had played with as a child. They are what I had used to spark my imagination back then so it seemed only fitting to use them again in this project.

He made the photos slightly blurred and said: 'If you had to photograph something flying past your window in real life it wouldn't be a clear shot.' An Imperial Star Destroyer is shown flying over Toronto in this picture 

'Integrating them into the shot requires a lot of lens trickery and playing with perspectives.'

He was five years old when he watched the first Star Wars film and hopes to continue producing photos to coincide with the upcoming films.

'I'm trying to get the photos featured in a couple of galleries here in Toronto so I'm thinking of producing a few more to put on display,' he said.

'Depending on how good the new films are I would love to continue producing photos to tie in with them as well.

'I am excited for the next trilogy and I have a lot of faith in the director. It's going to be really cool.'

Star Wars: Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams, is currently set for a release date of December 18th 2015.
