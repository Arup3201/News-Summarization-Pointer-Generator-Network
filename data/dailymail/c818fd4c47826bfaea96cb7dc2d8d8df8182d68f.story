Water  is usually top of the list when it comes to any health kick, with health professionals recommending water as a cure for everything from bad skin to sleeping problems to headaches.

This was the case for Gold Coast grandmother Helen Trengove, who embarked on a 14-day detox and cleanse program to kick start her health regime. 

On her first day of the program, the 61-year-old drank a litre of water every two hours.

After ingesting 5 litres of water as part of recommended intake, Mrs Trengove began complaining of feeling woozy and light-headed.

'I wrote down that I felt cold and nauseous and that I was going to take myself to bed, but I don't have any memory of it,' Mrs Trengove told a Current Affair

'I wrote down that I felt cold and nauseous and that I was going to take myself to bed, but I don't have any memory of it,' Mrs Trengove told a Current Affair. 

'To not have any memory or recollection of any of it is pretty shocking.' 

After falling asleep, Mrs Trengove fell unconscious and began fitting, crying out and drawing the attention of her husband Pete Trengove, who thought he heard strange noises coming from the bedroom.

Helen was on the bed, and was spasming and twitching all over,' Mr Trengove said.

'I tried to wake her up, but she wouldn't wake up. Her eyes were open but there was just nothing there.' 

Mr Trengrove called an ambulance and his wife was rushed to Gold Coast University hospital.

Mrs Tengove slipped into a coma and spent three days in the intensive care unit of the hospital with her husband and son by her side.

She was diagnosed with hyponatremia, or water intoxication, a rare condition brought on by ingesting too much water. Nutrients in Mrs Trengove's body became diluted and were unable to perform their functions.

‘It was bloody scary. I didn’t know whether she was dying,' said Mr Trengove.

'I just can't believe it happened, to be honest. It was just really scary', Mrs Trengove said

Former head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Gino Pecoraro, said that drinking water in excess can be potentially damaging.

'Like most things, if you have too much of it, it can be bad for you- and water in excess can actually kill you,' Dr Pecoraro told A Current Affair.

Drinking too much water can lead cells in the brain to swell, impacting on a person's ability to breathe, and potentially leading to unconsciousness and death.

'What you're using to clean out the body can become the toxin that can cause death,' said Dr Pecararo.

'I just can't believe it happened, to be honest. It was just really scary', Mrs Trengove said. 

'I just never thought that water could kill you.'

While Mrs Trengove didn't suffer from any long-term health complications, Dr Pecoraro said that brain damage can occur as a result of water intoxication and that avoiding drastic detoxes is the best way to avoid such issues.

'Don’t force feed yourself water, as it can do harm from a diet point of view. Anything that seems too good, too quick, usually is too good to be true,' he said.
