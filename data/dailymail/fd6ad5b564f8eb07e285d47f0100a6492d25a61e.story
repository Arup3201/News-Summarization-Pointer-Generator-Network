With fewer than 72 hours to go until the new Celebrity Big Brother housemates are revealed, rumours have been rife over the last couple of months, over who will enter this year's Celebrity Big Brother house.

And now, the line-up for the series has reportedly been revealed, with former boxing manager Kellie Maloney, TOWIE star Lauren Goodger and Kelly Brook's fiancé David McIntosh all expected to grab headlines.

A CBB source told the Mirror: 'Kellie was top of the list - she was the one that everyone on the show wanted. They all think she will make Celebrity Big Brother a must-watch.

'Kellie Maloney's signature is  seen as a huge victory for Channel 5 bosses, they see it as a brilliant line-up'

'Having her signature is being seen as a huge victory for Channel 5 bosses, she is part of what they see as a brilliant line-up.'

In interviews, Maloney said: 'I was born in the wrong body and I have always known I was a woman.

'I can't keep living in the shadows, that is why I am doing what I'm doing today, living with the burden any longer would have killed me.

'What was wrong at birth is now being medically corrected. I have a female brain, I knew I was different from the minute I could compare myself to other children.'

 The Daily Mirror claims that the full line-up will also include B*witched singer Edele Lynch, former Emmerdale bad girl Claire King and heavyweight boxer Audley Harrison.

Former prostitute Helen Wood won Big Brother 2014 and picked up a cheque for £100,000

Ashleigh Coyle came in second after the two became the first women to be the last finalists in the history of Big Brother.

Helen had immunity from the beginning of the show, which started three months ago, and won the £100,000 prize.

Christopher Hall came in third, Ash Harrison in fourth, Chris Wright fifth and Pav Paul sixth during Friday night's episode.
