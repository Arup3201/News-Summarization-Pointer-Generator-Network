Jose Mourinho claimed there is a 'campaign' against his Chelsea side and it seems the siege mentality at Stamford Bridge has been adopted by the club's official website.

Following the 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho outlined the timing of several questionable decisions by referee Martin Atkinson which went against the Premier League leaders.

'I think there are four moments of the game where you can write the story of the game. Minute 30, minute 33, minute 43 and minute 69.I repeat for you, I make it easy for you. Minute 30, 33, 43 and 69. The game had four moments and don't ask me more questions because I don't answer,' the Portuguese passionately told Sky Sports.

Chelsea's site continued in a similar vein, outlining the incidents in detail: an unpunished challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Branislav Ivanovic; being denied two 'clear' penalties and a shocking Barnes'  challenge on Nemanja Matic - again unpunished - which led to the Serb's sending off.

Following Match of the Day's analysis of the match, the website posted a lead article entitled: 'Match of the Day: Referee ' had a terrible game'.

Chelsea saw their lead cut to five points following Manchester City's 5-0 rout of Newcastle and pundits Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage agreed with Mourinho and questioned the performance of Bradford official Atkinson.

‘I have to agree with him [Mourinho],’ said Shearer. ‘I think Martin Atkinson had a terrible game.'

'He [Barnes] should have been booked for the first challenge and that should have been a straight red for Ashley Barnes. Alan’s right, Matic is lucky he’s not out for six or seven months. Mourinho’s right, Chelsea were hard done by today,' Savage added.

Speaking on Radio 5 Live, Chris Waddle appealed for common sense to be applied to Matic, who is set to miss next weekend's Capital One Cup final against Spurs.

'Any player in football would have reacted the same, a leg breaker, the red card should be rescinded if common sense prevails,' the former England man said.
