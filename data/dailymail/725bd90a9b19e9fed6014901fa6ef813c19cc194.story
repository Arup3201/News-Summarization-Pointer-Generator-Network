A Florida couple found an unwelcome guest making use of their swimming pool in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Sharon Bente was awoken by noises coming from the backyard of the Bradenton home she shares with her husband, John.

Upon further investigation, the noise that she had thought was wind blowing patio furniture around was in fact caused by an eight-foot three-inch alligator.

Unexpected guest: The Bentes were not prepared for their late-night visitor, an eight-foot three-inch alligator

Shock: Sharon Bente went out to investigate a noise that she thought was caused by the wind, but made her way quickly back inside when she saw something in her pool that isn't usually there

Unwelcome: The Bentes say it's a great story - but they hope they never see another alligator in their pool

'I saw something that is not usually in the pool along with the little floaty,' she told My Sun Coast.

Sharon Bente's first thought when she saw the huge gator was to get inside as quickly as possible.

'Can I get back to the door without it seeing me or realizing I'm bait?' she wondered to herself, she says.

She managed to get inside the house unscathed and awoke her husband with the unexpected news.

'[She] said, "We have a gator in our pool," to me, and of course I didnâ€™t know what she was talking about,' John Bente told My Sun Coast. 'I was still half sleeping.'

Size counts: A typical adult alligator grows to about 13 feet, so the one who broke into the Bentes' pool would have been a juvenile

Apprehended: The gator was eventually caught by a trapper, who took her to an alligator farm

The alligator had ripped through the screen enclosing the pool and patio area and gone for a late-night dip in the pool.

'He was just swimming around in circles,' John Bente says.

'He tried to get up here for awhile, [but] I think he was a little intimidated with everybody watching, too.'

The couple called the sheriff's office and a trapper came around to remove the gator, a female.

She was taken to an alligator farm in Arcadia.

The Bentes are glad there isn't more damage to repair than their ripped screen.

'It is a great story, it is a fun story, and hopefully it just won't happen again!' Sharon Bente told My Sun Coast.
