Women spend almost twice as much as their men on their sexy Christmas lingerie, according to a new survey.

In the hope of becoming a sexy Mrs Claus this year, ladies will spend £47 on new lingerie over the festive season.

However, if men are in charge of buying the gifts, they spend almost half as much - just £24.

Nervous: Men spend half as much as their partner on sexy Christmas lingerie because they are terrified their lover will hate their choice

But the difference in spending isn't because men are skinflints - they are
worried of completely misjudging their lover's tastes so they tend to 
opt for the first sexy slip that they see and leave it at that.

Women are more confident about their purchases and happily splash out on three times as many pieces as their men.

The study also found that the most generous female lingerie shoppers are in Carlisle, followed by London, Guildford, Liverpool and Edinburgh.

Men in Cardiff spent the most on their women - followed by Sheffield, Manchester, London and Chelmsford.

The most popular item chosen by both sexes was classic black suspenders and stockings, followed by black or pink briefs, a sheer black teddy, a red satin body bow and basque.

And it seems that sexy lingerie is big business; last year, the UK female lingerie market was worth £1.5 billion.

It was also revealed that women spent a total of £15,000 on lingerie in their lifetime - buying 13 new pairs of knickers a year.

A spokesperson for Bluebella, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Women today know what they want and are feeling more empowered than ever before to enjoy buying beautiful underwear which makes them feel gorgeous and confident not just in the bedroom but in the boardroom too.

'The fact they buy three times as much as men is great for both parties - she feels fabulously sexy and confident in lingerie that suits her perfectly and he gets to enjoy the new view.

'Men tend to impulse buy when it comes to underwear and go for the first sexy slip they see. They're probably unsure if their partner will like their choice so they prefer to spend less. If he gets it wrong, it can put him off buying lingerie for a while but it doesn't have to be this way.

'If he gets it right, it is the gift that keeps on giving.'
