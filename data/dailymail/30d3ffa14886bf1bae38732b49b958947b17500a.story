Christmas is just like any other day for firefighters across the country, who had to work through the holiday to save lives.

And it was a good thing Orange County, California firefighters were on duty yesterday.

The station got an unusual call around 4pm when a 3-year-old became trapped after accidentally lodging her head between the bars of a gate at a McDonald's restaurant.

Christmas day rescue: Firefighters in Buena Vista, California freed a 3-year-old from a gate at a McDonald's restaurant

A picture taken at the Buena Vista fast food restaurant shows firefighters using the Jaws of Life tool, usually used in car accidents, to pry open the bars and free the girl's neck.

Safely unstuck, the girl was given a sticker badge and a stuffed animal by a firefighter.

Apparently McDonald's restaurants are rife with all sorts of unexpected safety hazards.

A
 man eating at a McDonald's in Cork, Ireland last May found himself in a 
similar situation when he was pictured  stuck in one of the restaurant's
 high chairs.

The image, taken by a fellow diner, quickly became an internet hit after it was posted online.

The man was pictured surrounded by three police officers after becoming stuck in the high chair in Cork

More than 4,500 people have seen the picture on Imgur and it has attracted hundreds of comments.

The picture was taken last May after the man, who has not been identified, popped in for a bite to eat.

He chose the child's high chair, rather than numerous adult-sized seats that were vacant at the time.

Police were then called when he realized he could not free himself from the chair.

According to the person who took the picture, the man had drunk some alcohol before squeezing himself in to the seat.

He was released without charge after being freed.

A McDonald’s spokesperson, who was quoted in The Metro, said: ‘McDonald’s is aware of the incident involving a customer who decided to sit in one of our children’s high-chairs in Winthrop Street.

‘As you can see, we recommend that children don’t use the high-chair without adult supervision.'
