Arsenal striker Benik Afobe is set for a permanent move to Championship club Wolves.

The Gunners academy graduate is expected to undergo a medical in the next 24 hours ahead of a switch to Molineux after a fee was agreed between the clubs.

The striker, 21, has enjoyed a successful loan spell at MK Dons, scoring 19 goals for Karl Robinson's side this season.

And his displays have caught the attention of Wolves boss Kenny Jackett, who is now close to signing Afobe, who has played for England Under 21s.

Afobe has been out on loan to Huddersfield, Reading, Bolton, Millwall and Sheffield Wednesday since 2010 before his current stint at MK Dons.

The 21-year-old has not made a first-team appearance for the Gunners since signing a professional contract in 2010 and looks set to land regular football with Wolves, who are riding high in eighth in the Championship, just outside the play-off places.
