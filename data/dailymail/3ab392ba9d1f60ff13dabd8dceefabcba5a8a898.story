Alex McLeish has confirmed he is to leave his position as KRC Genk head coach at the end of this season.

The former Aston Villa, Rangers and Scotland boss took up the reins at the Belgian club last August but narrowly missed out on a place in the Jupiler Pro League Championship play-offs.

Genk will instead compete in the Europa League play-offs - which start on Friday - but Scotsman McLeish has already to decided to make public his decision to leave in May.

McLeish, 56, said: 'I have decided that I won't renew my contract when it expires at the end of the season.

'I've been revitalised with this challenge and I am proud to have worked with a group of players who have improved mentally, tactically and technically.

'I am proud that we have achieved a 46% win rate this season and with 49 points, we have amassed four more points than at this stage last season.

'Communicating this decision creates clarity and will allow us now to put our focus on winning a Europa League place.

'Myself, the staff and players promise to give every ounce of energy as we did in the regular competition.'

A club statement read: 'KRC Genk respects the decision of McLeish and is confident that he, his staff and the players will give their best in the play-offs.

'The club is well aware that Alex has to work in difficult circumstances and yet has put down a good result.'
