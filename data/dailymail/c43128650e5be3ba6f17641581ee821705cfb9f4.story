Two of Colombia's fattest babies have been brought together in a bid to save their lives.

At just ten months old, Santiago Mendoza and Isabela Caicedo tip the scales at an incredible six-and-a-half stone combined.

The severely overweight babies were brought together by Medellin-based charity Chubby Hearts foundation (Gorditos de Corazon) who work with weight-loss specialists.

Santiago, seen breastfeeding with his mother Eunice Fandino, was rescued by the foundation after she was unable to deal with his insatiable appetite which saw him balloon to three stone aged just eight months

Earlier this year, the foundation came to Santiago's rescue after his mother was unable to deal with his insatiable appetite.

At eight months old, Santiago reportedly weighed more than three stone - as much as a six-year-old - and his life hung in the balance.

Now the foundation have brought his weight-gain under control and hope to see signs of improvement in the coming months.

After seeing Santiago on television, Isabela's mother Niyered Martinez also contacted the foundation for help.

She said: 'In the first few months Isabela pestered me all the time - she didn't sleep, she was just eating and eating.

'We started to try to regulate her food intake but she wasn't losing any weight.'

Since
 meeting the foundation's director, Salvador Palacio, and working with a
 team of health specialists, Isabela has lost nearly 3.5lb.

The charity believes the babies can be down to a normal weight in six to eight months

Thousands of children in Colombia - and millions around the world - suffer with obesity, says the charity

Salvador said: 'We hope with six to eight months using a special diet the babies could be down to a normal weight.

'Thousands of children in Colombia - and millions around the world - suffer with obesity.

'From Colombia we have formed an international alliance to help people who are overweight.

Santiago's mother, Eunice Fandino, has confessed that her 
own 'ignorance' had led to her son's unhealthy weight gain and that, 
every time he cried, she gave him food or milk to calm down.

The 20kg child, pictured at a centre for the obese, has been taken from his mother due to his size

He was flown from his home in the northeastern city of Valledupar to the capital Bogota on Sunday after his mother called the charity asking for help with her child's size

He has reportedly suffered medical complications due to his weight and has already been hospitalised on several occasions.

She revealed that she was practically confined to her home as the baby was 'too heavy' to take out and about.

But
 she added that she was ‘optimistic’ about the help she was receiving 
and has promised to follow the instructions she's given by doctors.

At 132lbs, Lu Hao (below in blue) was already five times the size of a normal child his age when he was aged three.

The toddler from China eats a staggering three bowls of rice when he sits down for a family meal.

When
 Lu Hao was born he weighed just 2.6kg (5.7 lbs), however, from the time
 he was three months old he began to gain weight rapidly.

Another large baby (above left) was an 11-month-old who was already the size of an eight-year-old.

The
 giant baby tipped the scales at a whopping 61lbs 12oz (28kg) and stands
 four and a half stone larger than his older brother.

Due to his hefty frame the toddler also has to wear huge nappies.

His mother, Milena Orosco de Agudelo, said her son started ballooning at just two months old.

The baby has had undergone a number of medical examinations which suggest he may have a problem with his endocrine system.

In 2009 weighing 23st 2lb at just nine-years-old, Dzhambik Khatokhov was believed to be the world's fattest child.

But the wrestling fanatic - known as Jambik - insists he is happy with his size and has no intention of losing weight.

His
 mother, Nelya, 42, claims Jambik is like any healthy, growing child and
 refuses to put him on a diet despite severe health warnings.

This week a Chinese woman gave birth to a 16lbs baby boy at a hospital in Shanwei, southeast China.

Medical staff nicknamed the giant new-born Xiao Pang, which means Little Fat.

It
 is possible that he is the heaviest baby to be born in China, as the 
last claimant on the national record weighed ‘only’ 15.5lbs.
