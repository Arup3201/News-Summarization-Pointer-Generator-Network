Charlie Adam insists Stoke outplayed Arsenal last weekend and has rubbished claims suggesting his side try to bully teams.

The midfielder came off the bench in the 69th minute to feature in Stoke's impressive 3-2 win against Arsenal.

Adam believes Stoke deserved the three points against Arsene Wenger's side after racing into a three-goal lead before  conceding two second-half goals.

Stoke trio Peter Crouch, Bojan and Jonathan Walters got on the scoresheet against Arsenal 

Speaking to the Daily Star, Adam said on the performance against the Gunners: 'Listen, we beat Arsenal last weekend and not only did we beat them, we outplayed them.

'A lot of people seem to have the mindset that we try to bully teams like Arsenal. That's just rubbish. We're physical, in that we stand up to everybody, because you have to in the English game.

'The problem we have is that some people have tunnel vision. They still want to paint us as just wanting to kick people.

'But we're a good team that passes the ball. Our play in the first 45 minutes against Arsenal was sensational.'
