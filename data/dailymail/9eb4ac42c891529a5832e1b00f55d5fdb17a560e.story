This remarkable footage shows a hypnotist having her wisdom tooth removed without any pain relief.

Sharon Waxkirsh, who works in north London, said she felt no pain during or after the procedure.

Two incisions were made using a scalpel and she had one stitch, as well as having the tooth removed.

But the hypnotist said she felt nothing after putting herself into a trance while she was in the dentists chair.

Ms Waxkirsh says she was also able to stop the bleeding using the power of her mind and that she experienced no swelling or bruising.

She told MailOnline: ‘I hypnotised myself and it is so effective.

‘It didn’t ever become painful, not once, and I didn’t have any blood loss at all.

‘The beauty of it is that it allows you to have complete control over your body and you lose that when you have an anaesthetic.’

She added: ‘I just decided to completely relax my body – it is all about getting in the zone.’

Ms Waxkirsh said anyone can learn to hypnotise themselves and that it can also be beneficial in many other circumstances, including during childbirth.

She added that there are many benefits to using hypnosis instead of an anaesthetic during dental treatment.

Ms Waxkirsch said hypnotherapy can offer an alternative for people who are scared of needles, claiming it results in less blood loss, a lower rate of infection and a greater sense of control.

She says she was able to eat again immediately after the treatment and that she felt no pain afterwards.

She added: ‘Once you can do that, you can do anything.’

Ms Waxkirsh believes that the technique could save the NHS millions of pounds by reducing the need for anaesthesia during surgery and by speeding up recovery times.

She argues that all hospitals should have a hypnotherapy specialist on duty.

‘It
 has the potential to save the NHS millions of pounds every year and get
 people out of hospital much quicker than with conventional recovery 
programmes,' she said.

She says she felt no pain during or after the procedure and that she was also able to stop her gum bleeding

‘Hypnosis can over-ride the chemicals in the brain that cause us fear and tension. It can also allow us to subdue pain and let the body concentrate on healing itself.

‘It is most obvious in dental work where patients with fear of either the dentist or needles can be prepared for pain-free treatments. This makes it easier for the dentist and the patient.’

Ms Waxkirsh believes that for some patients even major surgery could be performed without anaesthetics.

She said: 
‘It is possible to have it with all kinds of surgery to reduce the level
 of anaesthesia but people are often more open to using this technique 
for dental work and operation recovery time.

‘We should have highly trained therapists at every hospital to consult with patients.

‘Research
 has shown us that infections are less likely, blood loss is less, the 
immune system is boosted and therefore patients are up and about much 
quicker than normal.

Ms Waxkirsh says the technique can be particularly beneficial for people who are scared of needles so do not want to have a local anaesthetic. She also claims it reduces the risk of infections

‘The NHS is fantastic but it can take away our responsibility for our own bodies making us totally dependent on the hospital staff when we have power within ourselves that we can harness.’

Ms Waxkirsh is not the only person to have had a tooth removed with no pain relief other than hypnosis.

She says she has accompanied many of her clients to the dentist while they had teeth removed, or fillings put in, without an anaesthetic.

However, she does acknowledge that if people want to try this, they do have to choose their dentist carefully to find one who is on board with hypnosis.

She says hypnotherapy can also help women through childbirth and that she has many clients who have come to her seeking help with pain relief before giving birth.
