Rielle Hunter, the mistress who derailed John Edwards' political career, says she was not the only lover the two-time presidential candidate had outside his marriage.

In her explosive new book about her affair with Edwards and the child she had with him, Hunter claims the North Carolina Democrat had two other mistresses while he was with his wife Elizabeth.

But, Edwards lied when he first met Hunter, she says, and told her had even more lovers.

Hunter seems to excuse Edwards' attacks on the people around him, especially his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth, whom she called a 'witch on wheels.'

Tell-all: In an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air on Friday, Rielle Hunter describes her life as a political mistress

ABC News reports Hunter claims that Edwards never told her the truth about his affairs until last year, two years after she testified under oath to a grand jury.

Hunter's book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' is a tell-all about the life of a political mistress.

She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail.

They often shared hurried dinners over take-out before short, passionate romps. Then, Edwards had to leave and return to his cancer-stricken wife and his life in the public eye.

Her 'What Really Happened' is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.'

The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship.

Hunter attacks Elizabeth Edwards, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.'

She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women.

Other accounts of the 2008 presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive.

He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. 

She says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential candidate.

Hunter repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that the baby was not his.

The pair met in February 2006 at a Charlotte hotel when Hunter approached Edwards, who had just given up his US Senate seat, and told him 'You are so hot.'

He called her over minutes later and invited her up to his hotel room.

Speaking up: Rielle Hunter, with her daughter Quinn, speaks to Chris Cuomo for 20/20

After they slept together, she says, he lied and told her he was also involved with three other women in Chicago, Los Angeles and Florida.

For five years, he controlled Hunter's emotions with tales of his trysts with other women. She says he lied about the additional affairs to keep her from getting 'too attached.'

In fact, she says, Edwards admitted in 2011 that he had two previous affairs, but both ended before he had met her.

'My reality in our relationship had been ripped out from under me,' she writes.

However, Hunter ends up justifying Edwards' decision to lie to her, and to the country.

'Johnny didn't do anything out of character. He has a long history of lying about one thing only -- women -- and I mistakenly thought I was different,' she writes.

When Edwards faced the prospect of an indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a country club than a jail.

She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened.

The book also included 48-year-old Hunter's mixed views on Edwards' parenting of their daughter Quinn and descriptions of his wife Elizabeth's outbursts.

Hunter was pictured for the first time being interviewed on camera for 20/20, sitting with her daughter Quinn in her lap.

Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts

At the end of the book, Hunter says she still has romantic feelings for Edwards but doesn't know how their relationship will turn out.

The book also provides a window into Edwards' psyche as federal prosecutors began their case against him. Days before his indictment Hunter asked: 'So if you went to jail, what kind of jail would it be? One of those country clubs?'

'He said, ''Yeah.'"

'Where?' she asked.

'Probably Virginia.'

'So Quinn and I will move to Virginia. Virginia is a great state.'

The only low-security federal prison in Virginia is in Petersburg, where former Washington, D.C., mayor Marion Barry once served time.

On the day of the indictment, the two shared a surreal phone call as a newspaper reporter banged on her door in Charlotte, while the man she refers to as 'Johnny' throughout the book called her cell phone to say that he was also being pursued.

'I've got helicopters circling my house,' Johnny said.

In the public eye: Hunter's affair with John Edwards which resulted in their daughter Quinn, cost the former senator his bid for the White House

New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book, citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books, on June 26.

Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month.

Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts.

The judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors then said in a court order earlier this month that they wouldn't retry Edwards, and the charges against him were dropped.

Neither Edwards nor Hunter testified.

Prosecutors had accused Edwards, 59, of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.

The trial publicized intimate details about Edwards' affair with Hunter as his wife, Elizabeth, was dying of cancer.

Revelations: Rielle Hunter is set to appear on 20/20 as she touts her new book about her affair with Edwards

Much of  Hunter's book describes 
their unfolding relationship and the lengths to which Hunter went to 
sneak in and out of Edwards' hotel rooms, even after her contract as a 
videographer ended. She also describes paparazzi chases after news of 
their affair broke.

Hunter 
writes that Edwards is a doting father when he's around their daughter 
but that his obligations to his other children curtail their time 
together.

The book 
features several pictures of the father and daughter together, smiling. 
Immediately after his trial, Edwards said during a news conference - 
with his adult daughter, Cate, by his side - that he loved Quinn 'more 
than any of you can ever imagine'. Quinn is now four and lives with 
Hunter in Charlotte.

'He is a great dad to her when he is with her,' Hunter writes.
