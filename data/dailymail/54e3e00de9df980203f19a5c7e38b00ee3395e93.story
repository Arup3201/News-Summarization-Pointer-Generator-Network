Police believe that the Irish gangster gunned down in a Costa del Sol bar popular with Irish tourists was lured to his death by a mystery woman.

Detectives recovered a mobile believed to belong to Gerard ‘Hatchet’ Kavanagh from the murder scene at the upmarket resort of Elviria near Marbella.

They  are now working through the numbers on it to see who called him before he died.

The 44-year-old gangland enforcer was shot nine times in a professional hit just before 5pm local time on Saturday as he had a drink on an Irish bar terrace with an unidentified female.

Hit: Stills from news footage shows the victim's body being wheeled away. Kavanagh was shot nine times 

The two killers shot him three times in the arm as they raced towards him, three times in the back as he tried to run inside the bar to safety and twice in the head as he collapsed in the doorway of Harmons Irish Bar.

Witnesses have told police one of the two assassins, described as 'ninjas' because one was dressed from head-to-toe in black, stood over Kavanagh and fired a shot to the back of his head as he lay dead or dying.

The pair escaped in a BMW they had left with the engine running near the bar. It is not known what happened to the woman.

A car matching its description was found burnt-out shortly afterwards near a supermarket three miles west on the road towards Marbella.

Forensic specialists were seen working on the car yesterday as detectives from a specialist anti-drug and organised crime unit continued to hunt for the killers.

A source close to the investigation said: ‘It was a professional hit.

‘He was shot nine times in the left arm, back and head but the killers fired off other shots that missed their target.

‘It sounds like the worst sort of violent Hollywood film. Anyone could have got caught in the crossfire.’

A stray bullet believed to have come from a gun used by the killers is said to have hit a car parked near the scene of the shooting.

Witnesses to yesterday’s shooting have told police Kavanagh, known in west Dublin as a violent criminal whose main job was collecting drugs debts, was sat on a chair in a pair of green swimshorts talking to a woman when he was targeted.

One said in the aftermath of the shooting: ‘The men rushed up to him from behind and shot him two or three times in the back and as he tried to run for the safety of the bar, finished the job off with a shot to the back of the head.

‘They turned him over to see if he was dead before fleeing. It was absolutely horrific.

‘The police took the dead man’s black Audi away and undertakers removed his body around 8pm.’

Another said: ‘The killers left the engine on their getaway car running.

‘I’ve been told it was found burnt out at a supermarket just down the road.’

A friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The dead man was lying face down just inside the door of the bar when I saw him.

‘He was dressed in just a pair of shorts and there was a lot of blood.’ 

Police have already seized CCTV footage from local businesses and are going over it for clues to the assassins’ identity.

They also took away the black Audi Kavanagh arrived at the pub in.

Witnesses have told detectives one of the men who shot the Irishman is blond and the other is bald and chubby.

Harmons Irish bar, owned by boxing and Gaelic football fan Dave Harmon, remained closed today. No-one from the bar was available for comment.

Police chalk marks, circling the spots where spent cartridges had fallen, were still visible inches from diners.

Detectives are already probing possible links between the killing and shooting of ex-boxer and Sky pundit Jamie Moore near Estepona last month.

Moore, 35, is thought to have been shot by mistake after coming to Spain to help prepare Birmingham-born boxer Matthew Macklin train for a fight in Dublin at his gym near Marbella.

Macklin, who has no involvement in crime, is a friend of the Kinahan family whose drugs cartel boss dad Christy is facing a money laundering trial in Spain with his two sons Daniel and Christopher after  police raids in May 2010.

Kavanagh, who worked as an enforcer for Kinahan, had reputedly been embroiled in a drug feud between the ex-pat gangland figure and another Dublin gangster, Chris Russell, over a £1.2m debt.

Russell’s home in Drimnagh is said to have been repeatedly targeted by Kavanagh and Paul Rice, another Kinahan enforcer.

Detectives are now bracing themselves for a revival of the violent Costa wars of five years ago sparked by feuds on the streets of Dublin.

Dublin gangster Paddy Doyle was murdered in a drive-by-shooting in Cancelada near Estepona in February 2008.

Drugs boss Peter ‘Fatso’ Mitchell narrowly survived a bungled assassination attempt in August 2008 after a hitman tripped as he fired off four shots in a packed bar in Nueva Andalucia near Marbella.

Expat father-of-four Richard Keogh, originally from Cabra, was shot seven times in January 2008 by a casino near the Costa del Sol tourist resort of Benalmadena.

Bar owner Mr Harmon, from Dublin suburb Kimmage, last month retweeted a message wishing Jamie Moore a speedy recovery in hospital after he was shot on August 2.

He also posted a picture of Irish boxer Jamie Kavanagh, who emigrated to southern Spain when he was 11, alongside a man believed to be convicted drug dealer Kavanagh.

Locals described Mr Harmon as a lovely man and his bar as a ‘very nice place.’

One said: ‘It’s shocking that something like this has happened round here.

‘The killers picked a quiet time between lunch and dinner but three hours either side of the shooting and it would have been packed with tourists.’

Mr Harmon, who runs his pub with wife Tracey, were among Irish tourists caught in the middle of a huge wildfire near Marbella two summers ago.

He told a paper at the time: ‘It was horrendous.

‘We were up all night. The place was like a zoo with everyone coming to the bar and bringing all their pets.’

Wife Tracey, who was evacuated from their nearby home and went to her bar to help customers and stranded members of their community, added: ‘We are at the bottom of a hill near the water and everyone congregated there.

‘They had nowhere to go. It was a massive evacuation.’

One travel review of their business describes Tracey as ‘gorgeous.’

Another, referring to the same eye-catching courtyard where Gerard Kavanagh was shot dead, says: ‘This well-known Irish bar in Elviria has a reputation as the place to be seen.

‘With lively karaoke each week night alongside their happy hour, there’s always a bustling atmosphere and lots of fun to be had at Harmon’s Bar.

‘Families are welcome as the courtyard out the back provides a safe place for children to play.’ 

A woman who answered a side door at the bar last night said: ‘Sorry we’ve got nothing to say. We’re not going to speak.’
