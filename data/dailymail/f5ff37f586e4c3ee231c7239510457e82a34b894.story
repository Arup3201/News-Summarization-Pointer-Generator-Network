A billboard company is suing a couple in rural Pennsylvania for their 'protests' over a brightly lit sign which have allegedly driven away six advertisers.

Oliver Outdoor Advertising claims it has lost $50,000 in revenue due to Andrew and Patricia Colberg's constant complaining.

The couple allegedly called advertisers asking them to pull ads from the billboard near their home on Butler Road in West Kittanning stating that the light made it difficult for them to sleep at night.

In total, they reportedly contacted 18 of Oliver Outdoor Advertising's clients with six complying to their request.

They also complained to local officials with the hope of pushing through legislation to regulate outdoor adverts.

However, any new direction would not help the Colbergs as it would only address signs erected in the future. 

'There's nothing we can do to existing signs,' said Kittanning Borough Council President Bob Venesky.

In light of Oliver Outdoor Advertising's filing last month, the Colbergs now plan on counter suing.

This would be the only way they could get the billboard -  installed in 2012 - removed.

According to Tribune Live, the counterclaim will also request that the  Colbergs be compensated for legal fees and aggravation.

The couple's attorney, Gregory Swank, believes that Oliver Outdoor Advertising's case 'lacks merit'.

'The Colbergs haven't interfered with Oliver's business - they were just talking to people about this situation,' he said.

The billboard company's attorney declined comment to the Associated Press Wednesday.
