The Unite union has launched a video campaign to teach children how to carry out militant protests - but they don't want you to see it.

Pupils could be given lessons through watching videos on how to make placards, oppose local businesses and fight plans for privatisation.

Videos have even been produced which encourage children to defy school rules.

But, despite the videos being freely available online, the production company that helped create them does not want their name published and Unite have refused to grant permission for it to be shown on Mail Online.

Direct action: A scene from the video portraying children standing up to greedy businessmen

Mail Online has contacted both Unite and the production company to comment on why they do not want the video published here.

Unite – run by left-wing firebrand Len McCluskey – has joined forces with the main teaching unions the NUT, NAS/UWT and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers to get the material into schools.

Five videos teach ‘strategies for public protest’ and ‘how organised protest is an effective way of ensuring change takes place’.

The videos show a group of cartoon teenagers protesting against a fictitious company’s plans to ‘take over’ the town of Tethergo – an anagram for ‘together’ – and its ‘big plans to privatise the entire area’.

The children are shown campaigning to save a closure-threatened community centre from laughing businessmen.

Placards: Children are shown campaigning to save a community centre from laughing businessmen

When they fail, lesson plans prepared by Unite urge teachers to think about how they might make protests more threatening. 

Children are asked to think of ‘five things you could do to push the protest further.’

They are then urged to make their own placards and ‘consider emotive language used to write letters of complaint’.

Unite also recommends that ‘teachers may wish to create a display of finished protest placards’.

Incredibly, the union also wants children to undermine the authority of their headteachers.

Staff
following Unite’s guidance should ask pupils to ‘Think of anything that
is unfair in your school. Does anyone make the rules to suit 
themselves?’

One of the 
videos asks teachers to read out a quotation from Martin Niemoller – a 
German pastor who risked his life opposing Hitler.

Niemoller is famous for his poem which starts: ‘First they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist’ and includes the line, ‘Then they came for the trade unionists.’ 

Last night head teachers and Tory MPs described Unite’s plans as ‘reprehensible.’

Nigel Adams MP said: ‘This propaganda is almost North Korean. It might be acceptable in the schools of Pyongyang, but not in Britain. 

‘These cack-handed attempts to pedal trade union ideology in schools would be funny if it wasn’t so dangerous.’ 

Mike Griffiths, head of Northampton School for Boys, said: ‘If anyone even remotely suggested it where I work they would get short shrift. The notion of encouraging children to undermine teachers is reprehensible.’ 

Peter Kent, head of Lawrence Sheriff School, a boys grammar school in Rugby, said he would only consider allowing the subject in lessons if it was balanced.

‘If it was part of a lesson about  history and the teacher wanted to explore how people used public protest I can see a legitimate angle,’ he said.

‘But they would have to make sure it covered both sides of the argument with respect for authority figures.’ 

Christian May, spokesman for the Institute of Directors, denounced the negative depiction of businessmen.

He said: ‘These videos are very 
disappointing and send completely the wrong message to the next 
generation. Frankly, they’re bizarre.’ 

A
government source said: ‘Any teachers allowing these Unite materials in
the classroom are obliged to present the other side of the argument to 
ensure balance.

'Schools which allow Unite officials indoctrinating young people to go unchallenged could be breaking the law.’ 

A
Unite spokesman said: ‘This series of short films helps young people 
understand that they can be part of something called society.

'At
a time when lots of young people feel forgotten by the Government, it 
is important that they know that they can shape their world, and that 
there is real strength in coming together.

'It
is utterly ridiculous to think that there is anything sinister in what 
is a teaching resource, there to be discussed and analysed by young, 
free thinking people.’
