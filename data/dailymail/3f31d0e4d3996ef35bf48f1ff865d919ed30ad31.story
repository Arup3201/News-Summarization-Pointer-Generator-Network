Derby slipped down the Championship table after losing 2-1 at Brentford, with Chris Martin opening the scoring for the Rams, only for Andre Gray to equalise and then Stuart Dallas to strike deep into stoppage time.

Gary Rowett began his reign as Birmingham boss with a goalless Midlands derby draw at Wolves earlier in the day and that result allowed Middlesbrough to move above Wanderers with a 3-0 romp at Rotherham.

Patrick Bamford and Yanic Wildschut put Boro in control before the Millers had Jordan Bowery sent off and Lee Tomlin added insult to injury late on.

Down at the bottom, there was no dream debut for new Blackpool manager Lee Clark as the Seasiders suffered a fourth straight defeat when going down 2-0 at home to Ipswich, with David McGoldrick and Daryl Murphy doing the damage.

Kit Symons celebrated his permanent appointment as Fulham boss with a thrilling 3-3 draw at Wigan, where Ross McCormack saw red for the Cottagers and Leon Barnett was dismissed for the Latics.

There was also a penalty scored by each side, with Adam Forshaw, Roger Espinoza and Shaun Maloney on target for Wigan, while Bryan Ruiz bagged a brace and Lasse Vigen Christensen struck for Fulham.

Nottingham Forest's poor run of form continued with a 3-0 defeat at Huddersfield after Joel Lynch struck in the opening minute and Nahki Wells and Grant Holt added further scores.

Rudy Gestede enjoyed a double as Blackburn beat Reading 3-1, while Charlton drew 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday after Igor Vetokele replied to Royston Drenthe's opener for the Owls.
