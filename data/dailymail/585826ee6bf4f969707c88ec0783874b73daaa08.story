Britain’s nuclear dump in Cumbria is ‘virtually certain’ to leak radioactive waste and contaminate the coast, according to a report.

Experts are concerned that the Drigg Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR), near Sellafield, will be eroded by rising sea levels, an internal Environment Agency document reveals.

While there is no cause for immediate concern, scientists believe the repository will start leaking in a few hundred to a few thousand years’ time.

The Drigg Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) is the UK's national low level radioactive waste disposal facility.

It is located in the West Cumbrian coastline and is one of 19 sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), operated by LLW Repository Ltd.

Established in 1959, the site has disposed of the UK's low level waste for over 50 years, which is stored in containers.

Low Level Waste is material that is contaminated by radioactivity through its use.

It includes paper, plastics, clothing and scrap metal as well as building rubble from old nuclear facilities.

Very Low Level Waste is also stored at the site from hospitals and universities.

Low Level waste is the least dangerous category of radioactive waste and makes up 90 per cent of the UK's nuclear waste by volume, but because the radioactive content of the material is low, it contains less than 0.1 per cent of the total radioactivity.

The waste arrives in containers, which are filled with grout to make a solid structure so that they can be stored safely in vaults.

The large containers are stacked on top of one another in a similar way to those in a port.

The Environment Agency document, obtained by The Guardian, suggests that it was a mistake to position the waste site so close to the Cumbrian coast because of the risk of flooding.

‘It is doubtful whether the location of the LLWR site would be chosen for a new facility for near-surface radioactive waste disposal if the choice were being made now,’ it reads.

The site is not part of Sellafield, but is used by the nuclear reprocessing site and other nuclear facilities to store 
material contaminated by radioactivity through its use, such as clothes 
and tools, rather than spent nuclear fuel itself.

High level nuclear waste is currently shipped to be processed abroad and the largest shipment to be sent from the UK so far has just arrived in Japan.

A total of one million cubic metres of low level radioactive waste produced over the last 55 years is housed at the site, which could, in ‘a few hundred to a few thousand years from now’ work its way into the sea of west Cumbria.

Experts are concerned that tiny particles to objects like tools which have been contaminated during use at nuclear sites, could find their way onto beaches in the future.

A plan is being considered to house another 800,000 cubic metres of waste from power stations, nuclear submarines and weapons at the Drigg site over the next 100 years but environmental groups argue that given the potential for future leaks, such a move would be unethical and potentially dangerous.

LLW Repository Ltd, the company that 
operates the site, has reportedly described the risks as ‘insignificant’
 and the Environmental Agency has stressed that the site is currently 
safe.

A total of one million cubic metres of radioactive waste produced over the last 55 years is housed at the LLW Repository (marked as Drigg), which could, in 'a few hundred to a few thousand years from now' work its way into the sea of west Cumbria. The repository is located nearby Sellafield, but is separate from the nuclear processing plant

The document, dated January 9, is the most recent risk assessment of coastal erosion at the waste repository.

Experts think that erosion caused by storms and rising sea levels is all but inevitable as the site is between just five and 20 metres above sea level and the company behind the repository is already considering extra flood defences.

Ian Parker, the Environment Agency’s group manager in Cumbria said: ‘It's highly probable the coast will erode and the waste will be disrupted,’ after detailed technical examinations.

Tempestuous future? An Environment Agency study suggests that it was a mistake to position the waste site so close to the Cumbrian coast because of the risk of flooding.

He told The Guardian's Rob Edwards that the agency took ‘a very conservative approach’ its study.

An Environment Agency spokesman told MailOnline:'Existing sites such as this must operate in line with our high expectations, along with our requirements and guidance, which are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect current best practice. 

'The Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) can continue to be operated safely; an Environmental Safety Case was made for dealing with the waste.

'We will not agree to any increases to the volume of waste that can be brought to this, or any other new site unless we are convinced it is safe to do so and all our requirements are met.

The site is located near Sellafield (pictured) but is separate from the nuclear processing plant. It stores items like clothing and tools that have been contaminated with radiation, but are considered low level, as opposed to spent fuel rods

'The operator must demonstrate that they can meet all the environmental safety criteria we set out for disposal sites, taking all relevant factors into account.'

While no final decision about whether the site will be continued to be used is due until next year, LLW Repository Ltd has already places restrictions on the amounts of radioactivity that can be disposed of at the site to make sure that if there was a leak, people would be exposed to small doses of radiation.

Dr Richard Cummings, the company’s head of science and engineering, explained that they work within incredibly strict regulations so that the effects of a future leak would be insignificant.
