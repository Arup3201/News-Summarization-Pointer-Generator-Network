This remarkable picture captured with just a little bit of photographer's luck, has captured the fascinating moment a tiny louse hitched a lift on a floating dandelion seed.

Clinging on with most of his legs, the colourful bug appears to have figured out a smart way of covering lots of ground while conserving his energy. 

The tiny spotted green bug went unnoticed by macro photographer Irinia Kozorog, 35, who had zoomed in to capture individual seeds being whisked away in the wind from dandelion florets in her garden.

Clever louse: This little louse has figured out a smart way to get around in a hurry, by hitching a ride on a floating dandelion

In fact the clever critters an-TICS 
nearly went unnoticed, but Ms Kozorog spotted the bug after later 
looking through her pictures on a computer at home. 

The serendipitous moment was caught on film in a sunny garden in Moscow, Russia.

Using currents in the air, the seeds 
of a dandelion's florets are swept away and transported over long 
distances, dispersing the plant over greater distances.

Most dandelion species produce seeds 
without the need for pollination, meaning their seeds will produce 
plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant.

There are more than 3,000 species of wingless insects - known as lice. 

Most are scavengers, feeding on skin 
and other debris found on the host's body, but some species feed on 
sebaceous secretions and blood. 

Most are found only on specific types of animals, and, in some cases, only to a particular part of the body.

Louse - the common name for up to 3,000 species of wingless insects... one of which has found a clever way to fly on a dandelion seed
