Neatly trimmed lawns and fixed picket fences could soon be the order of the day for not only homeowners in New York, but across America, if they want to avoid hefty fines and even jail time.

This week, a unanimous vote was passed outlawing messy gardens, excessive litter, graffiti and broken windows in Massapequa Park, Long Island.

Home and business owners face fines of $10,000 (£6,343) and up to 15 days in jail for flouting the law.

Clean cut: This homeowner in Massapequa Park could now face fines of up to $10,000 for not properly maintaining their lawn

The measure was brought in to stop the community's property prices sinking further and force landowners, including banks, from letting empty properties fall into disrepair following a foreclosure.

Now James Altadonna, mayor of Massapequa Park, said a “number of other municipalities” — including 
the nearby town of Brookhaven — are considering passing a similar law.

He told Fox News: 'It was really out of frustration in trying to get banks to maintain 
[foreclosed] properties, so we wanted to craft a law that would be 
significant enough to get the attention of the banks.

'We’re willing to work with anyone who will respond to us 
and maintain their property. These fines are only for the most 
egregious.'

Get to work: Incomplete building work, litter, graffiti and broken windows could all lead to breaches of the new law

Alongside Massapequa Park, similar measures have been adopted in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, and the suburb of Pelham in Birmingham, Alabama.

According to Birmingham's city code, premises should be "maintained in such a condition so as not to 
constitute an eyesore or unfavorable appearance or dangerous condition, 
including any unpainted, decaying or unused automobile or other vehicle,
or rubbish or any other condition offensive to the appearance of said 
premises."

In Massapequa Park, owners have ten days to rectify breaches of the law, before fines are imposed.

First-time offenders who fail to fix broken outdoor lights or remove fallen trees could be fined up to $1,000 (£643), with further offences leading to five-figure fines and jail time.

James Altadonna Jr, mayor of Massapequa Park, has welcomed the new measures and says they could be adopted across America

The law, which was passed on Monday, states: 'The Village finds that the presence of blight upon properties, 
caused by factors including, but not limited to, foreclosures throughout
the Village, is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the 
Village.

'It is the intent, therefore, of the Village 
that blight be identified, abated and eliminated.'

Mr Altadonna added: 'You’re not going to see houses with broken windows [in Massapequa 
Park]. But how would you feel living across the street
from a house that has 18 inches of grass in front of it?'

Meanwhile, at least two people have spent time behind bars in recent months for failing to maintain their homes.

In January, Linda Ruggles, 53, from Mount 
Pleasant, South Carolina, was sentenced to ten days in jail after failing to pay a 
$480 fine for a having a messy yard.

A month later, a Florida man was reportedly sentenced to a year and one day in jail after he failed to remove litter from the front of his house. He had broken the conditions of his probation, which were connected to illegal dumping charges.
