The once squeaky clean boy band have spent almost as much time in tattoo parlours as they have on stage in recent years.

With the sole exception of Niall Horan, One Direction have devoted hours to getting themselves inked from head to toe since hitting 18.

The first to hit the ink was Harry Styles, who had an outline of a star tattooed on his inner bicep as soon as he reached 18 - and his band mates were quick to follow suit.

Revelation: One Direction stars Harry, Louis, Zayn and Liam have revealed what their tattoos mean 

Their designs include the obvious, such as Zayn's illustration of girlfriend Perrie Edwards, and the cryptic, among them the feather on Liam Payne's forearm.

However, speaking in an interview with Teen Vogue, the boys opened up about the meaning of a few of their tattoos - some of it proving quite unexpected.

Interviewed backstage during the Miami leg of their world tour, Harry, who famously got nine tattoos in just 10 months, revealed that he takes inspiration from the people he meets.

'We get to meet a lot cool people and they say stuff that sticks,' said the teen heartthrob. 'Some tattoos are just reminders of friends I've made - whether it be lifelong friends or those I've made in the past four years. 

'It's nice to have people impact you in different ways.'

Not all of the boys think so deeply about their body art, however, with Louis admitting that several of his came about simply because he 'likes the look of them'.

'To be honest, not many of them actually have any meaning,' he explained. 'I just like to look at them. 

'I started with a silly stick man. And then I like skateboarding, so that's why I got that one. This is for the world tour. This "Oops" is because I didn't like this line here, so I was like, "Oops!"'

Although Zayn and Harry were both quick off the mark, Louis gives both a run for their money in the tattoo stakes and also boasts a spider's web and a bomb ('because I'm da bomb') on his forearm.

Superheroes: Zayn says the Zap! tattoo relates to his childhood passion for comic books

Zayn revealed that his famous 'Zap!' tattoo came about because of a childhood fascination with superheroes.

'I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to comic books,' said the star. 'I've always had a bit of fascination with cartoons and comics.'

The news may come as a surprise to dedicated Directioners, as the 21-year-old has previously claimed that the tattoo had an alternative meaning.

In an interview with Nova.fm in 2012, Zayn insisted that the 'Zap!' tattoo referred to his own secret society called 'Club Zappers' in which he and Louis are captains.

Naughty: Louis caused controversy when he had the name of his old band The Rogues tattooed on his shins 

Prior to making his bizarre claims public, many had thought that the comic book style tattoo was an acronym for 'Zayn and Perrie.'

Whatever the real meaning of 'Zap!', the star has plenty more inkings to decode, among them a small black script on his collarbone.

Taking to Twitter after having it done in 2012, he tweeted: 'For every1 asking what the new tatt means it says be true to who you are'.

The performer also has his grandfather's name on his chest in Arabic as well as a Japanese symbol on his hip which means 'born lucky', while the yin and yang symbol is to be found on his wrist.

Tribute: The feather is a reference to his grandmother while the words beneath are a One Direction song lyric 

Unmarked: Niall Horan remains the only member of One Direction to successfully resist the lure of ink

The final tattoo fan in One Direction is Liam Payne, whose most recent inking paid tribute to his band and involved having the lyrics 'I figured it out' from the song You and I added to his feather etching. 

The 21-year-old says his feather is especially meaningful to him - and even managed to impress his mother - because it refers to his deceased grandmother.

'My mum hates tattoos but she likes this one, because this one is specifically to do with my nan. That was actually the one that turned her around to tattoos and she was OK with it.' 

'The feather was a thing, when I was a kid we used to find feathers around the house and whenever we found them my mum used to say it was my nan leaving them around for us to find, so that was quite sweet.'

Liam's other tattoos include the words 'Everything I Wanted But Nothing I'll Ever Need' on his left forearm. He also has 'Only Time Will Tell' on his right wrist and four chevrons on his right forearm.

Of his ankle tattoos, he says: 'These are the first tattoos I ever got. All of us apart from Niall have got these on are ankles. 

'They're just crosses, the screws which keep you together. I suppose it's a keep you ground thing. Keep your feet on the ground.'
