After he was pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich, Ed Miliband said there was more to politics than photo-opportunities.

But the Labour leader's latest posed picture has become the subject of much intrigue after it appeared to show he had grown in height.

Despite his apparent dislike of photo-opportunities, Labour MPs were invited to Mr Miliband's office to have their pictures taken with him for their election leaflets.

Ed Miliband looks barely a couple of inches shorter than the Labour MP Toby Perkins, despite being almost half a foot shorter

When shadow business minister Toby Perkins proudly showed off his photo with the leader on his website though, something seemed amiss.

The MP for Chesterfield, who is 6'6', has previously dwarfed Mr Miliband when they have been pictured together.

Yet in the latest photograph, Mr Miliband, who just over six foot, appears to be almost the same height.

It was rumoured that Mr Miliband had resorted to standing on a box or a phone book to improve his stature.

But after Labour aides tonight categorically denied the suggestion, the mystery remained.

Asked whether Mr Miliband been on a box, Mr Perkins told the Mail: 'No of course not.'

Questioned further on what Mr Miliband had been standing on, he added, 'I want to know what you're on,' before ending the call.

A spokesman for Mr Miliband later added that the only thing he had been stood on was the floor, but he refused to comment on whether Mr Perkins had been forced to crouch.

He said: 'Ed was not stood on anything. He is over six foot tall and was not on a box.'

Labour MPs were last week invited to have 'portrait photos' taken with Mr Miliband in his office, the website Guido Fawkes reported. 

However, it is not thought the party anticipated much demand as it only allowed 45 minutes for the pictures despite it having 256 MPs.

Mr Perkins, who was elected in 2010, posted his picture with Mr Miliband with article on his website about Labour's pledge to reduce university tuition fees.

After facing much ridicule for his bacon sandwich picture, Mr Miliband said in July last year: 'Here's the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op. And that culture diminishes our politics.'

A Labour source said that Mr Miliband is around 6'1' to 6'2' tall.

In 2010 it was claimed Nicolas Sarkozy had not seen the funny side after it was claimed David Cameron and George Osborne had both made jokes about his height while they were in opposition.

Mr Cameron denied an accusation that he had mocked the former French president, who is around 5'5', by making a remark about 'hidden dwarfs' while referring to a picture of himself with Mr Sarkozy.

Mr Osborne provoked laughter at a conference when he removed a stool from behind the lectern at which he was about to speak and joked that it was 'the Sarkozy box'.

The BBC's Newsnight reported that French officials had complained that the two incidents, which came within a few days of each other, 'failed to show sufficient respect' for the French head of state.
