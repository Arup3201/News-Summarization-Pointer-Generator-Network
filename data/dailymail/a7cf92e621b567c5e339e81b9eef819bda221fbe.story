Whenever you're on the verge of big business, the last thing you want is the skeletons in your closet being aired out to all and sundry.

But that's exactly the problem that confronts One Direction's Louis Tomlinson who is believed to be on the verge of buying his beloved football club.

Just days after shocking video footage of the 22-year-old apparently smoking cannabis in Peru emerged, it has been revealed that the singer plans to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers. 

But, lifelong Rovers fan Louis - who even made an appearance for the club's reserves team earlier this year - is said to be concerned the recent controversy could jeopardise his chances.

One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, 22, has made a formal bid to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers and negotiations are said to be at an 'advanced stage'

Louis, who was born in Doncaster, is a lifelong fan of Rovers and even made a professional appearance for the reserves team in February after signing to the club's books last summer

He has now taken his love for the club one step further - by joining forces with businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a large share to a consortium

According to The Sun, a source said: ‘The timing of 
the Peru video has really upset him because he doesn’t want anything to 
jeopardise the deal, which is very commercially sensitive and worth a 
seven-figure sum.’

The pop star was embroiled in controversy this week after exclusive 
MailOnline footage of him and bandmate Zayn Malik, 21, showed them smoking a suspicious looking roll-up.

Neither have addressed the video but Louis is said to be concerned the 'scandal' could hinder his plans to takeover his hometown club.

The singer, who was born in Doncaster, is a season-ticket holder at Rovers and made 
his professional appearance for the reserves team in February after 
signing to the club’s books last summer.

He now plans to 
take his love for the club one step further – by joining forces with 
businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a
 large share to a consortium.

The pair are said to be in the 
process of setting up a trust to buy the recently-relegated side and 
negotiations of a formal bid are said to be at an ‘advanced stage’.

It
 is thought Louis and Mr Ryan – who still owns a quarter share of the 
club – will act as co-chairmen if their bid is successful.

The
 pair, who hope to become the new owners as early as July, have 
ambitions to take the club back to the Championship within a year and 
into the Premiership within three.

'Joint
 lit. Happy days!'  Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson smoked a 'roll up 
cigarette' and joke about marijuana in a video taken in Lima, Peru, last
 month

Controversial: In
 MailOnline’s exclusive video, Louis Tomlinson, 22, can be heard putting
 on an accent while speaking about doing drugs. He then says: ‘It’s 
green only, Nig.’

The insider said Louis and Mr Ryan plan to buy the club – which was relegated from the Championship this season – outright.

If successful, Louis would be the 
first pop star chairman of an English football club since Elton John 
famously took over at Watford in 1976.

‘This
 is his passion project – and it will happen. He’s putting everything 
into it because of his love for the side,’ the source said.

A spokesman for Doncaster Rovers today confirmed the club was discussing a proposed takeover.

It
 is thought the singer will attract a number of new investors to the club 
if he does purchase it – thanks to his worldwide following from One 
Direction fans and supporters.

He managed to draw a crowd of an additional 2,000 extra fans to the Keepmoat Stadium when he donned a Rovers shirt for a reserves match against Rotherham United in February.

After the match, which ended 0-0, he told his 15.5 million Twitter followers: 'Wow what an incredible experience. Can't put into words how I feel. I will never forget pulling on my own Doncaster Rovers shirt!

'Really can't thank the team, the gaffer and every single person involved at Doncaster Rovers enough! I feel like a 10 year old again.

'And obviously a huge huge thank you to everyone who came down :) a real credit to our fans :) hope it was a good day out!'

However, many fans have turned their back on the star and One Direction after the controversial footage of him and Zayn talking about drugs and smoking a ‘joint’ emerged.

Louis has also been further lambasted for apparently using a racial slur in the video which was filmed as they were being escorted by car to a show in Lima, Peru, on April 27.

In the footage, Louis uses the word 'nig' - which fans say is a shortened version of the N-word.

One Direction fans - as well as MPs and racism campaigners – have demanded apologies from the band in light of the video.

They say the boy band has abused their position as role models and risked encouraging their young fans to copy them.

Even Louis’ father, Troy Austin, 45, said he was ‘worried’ for his son after watching the controversial footage.

He said his son had previously vowed to never touch drugs or get a tattoo and said ‘fame and money have changed him’.

Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik didn't address the controversy when One Direction played at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Wednesday night (pictured)

Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal could create a divide in the band

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘He’s a different person to that person three years ago.

‘I do believe that being that famous will be taking its toll on them. They need a serious talking to.’

However, the band have remained unusually quiet and didn’t make any apology for the controversy when they performed to 50,000 people at Sunderland football club's Stadium of Light on Wednesday for the opening night of their UK tour.

The only reference made to the scandal was by bandmate Liam Payne, 20, who joked about his skinny jeans then, in response to something shouted by a member of the crowd, added: ‘No more media attention, please.’

Despite the band putting on a united show at the opening night of their tour, it is thought the scandal has created somewhat of a divide in the band.

Harry Styles reportedly blasted Louis and Zayn for their ‘stupid and reckless’ antics, while it is also understood he and Niall Horan, 20, already take separate ‘non-smoking’ private jets to gigs to avoid their bandmates’ smoking.

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Louis Tomlinson for comment.
