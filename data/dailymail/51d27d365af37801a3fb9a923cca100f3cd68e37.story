Fancy a bit of puppy love, but aren't able to keep a dog of your own? Then log on to borrowmydoggy.com, which allows you to look after someone else's.

The site matches owners who don't have time to walk their pet with dog lovers who don't have the space to keep one of their own. Dogs are available across the country and it’s free to register at the moment - though charges will be introduced later this year.

When they sign up, borrowers give details of their experience with dogs, the amount of time they have and upload a picture of themselves.

The owners write a profile about their pet and whether they want it walked, looked after at home or groomed. To ensure nothing goes wrong, the site carries out detailed checks on borrowers (such as making sure the name and address given match).

The site also recommends that borrower and owner email, talk on the phone and meet up somewhere public before the dog is borrowed.

Rikke Rosenlund, 38, came up with the idea when walking a friend’s dog. 'I love dogs, but I don’'t think it would be fair to have one in my London flat. Walking someone else's is the perfect compromise. Some owners are busy working or travel a lot and want to avoid paying for a dog walker,' she says.

'Others have had a baby or been diagnosed with an illness so no longer have as much time for their dog.'

The project has proven so popular that Rikke has since given up her job to run the site. One enthusiastic borrower is Katie Hampshire, 24, from High Wickham, Kent, who borrows cross-breed Rosie.

'Her owner is a teacher and wanted Rosie to get out more. I text when I have free time and take her for walks. It’s great,' she says. 'I'd love my own dog, but I just don’t have time.'
