These lucky ducklings are now in safe hands after being rescued from a drain.

When a passer-by heard cheeping coming from a grill near Marton Road, Middlesbrough, they alerted the RSPCA.

Inspector Clare Wilson managed to lift the cover but was unable to reach the birds, so the fire brigade was called in.

Safe and sound: The five ducklings which were rescued by the RSPCA and fire brigade after getting stuck down a drain near Marton Road, Middlesbrough

The ducklings were rescued by the RSPCA and fire brigade who lifted up the drain cover with a crowbar

They poured water down the hole to flush the ducklings through the drainage system while Ms Wilson waited at the other end to catch them in a net.

While the young birds were lifter to safety, the mother was frightened away by the commotion and could not be located.

The ducklings were taken to a local wildlife centre where they will be reared and released once they are old enough.

Inspector John Lawson, from the RSPCA, said: 'I would urge the public to leave wildlife alone unless, as in this situation, they are obviously in trouble and need our help.

'I'm so glad we managed to get them out safe and sound and would like to thank Cleveland Fire Brigade who always attend quickly and are happy to help me get animals out of danger when needed.'
