A California insurance company paid a senior citizen in coins as part of a settlement.

Victim: Andres Carrasco, 73, was paid over $21,000 in coins by an insurance company in a settlement deal

'Adriana's Insurance, is this the way you treat everyone?' He said in statement to the station. 'Why don't you like your clients?'

Carrasco also said 'I am disappointed by the way Adriana's treats their customers and the elderly. We might be poor, but we are people too.'

Antonio Gallo, Carrasco's attorney, told NBC Los Angeles that company employees left 'five-gallon containers' at his office.

Gallo told the affiliate station his client is not strong enough to lift the containers. Carrasco was recently treated for a hernia, he said.

As noted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, since the story broke online users have flooded the company's Yelp page with one-star reviews.

A request for comment to the insurance company from MailOnline was not immediately answered.
