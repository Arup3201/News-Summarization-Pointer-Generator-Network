Alleged Shooter: Corey Dunton, 16, has been arrested by NYPD following the shooting at Bryant Park's skating rink last night in Manhattan which has left a 14-year-old boy paralyzed

A New York teenager has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly opened fire at skaters in Manhattan's Bryant Park and then seemed to confess to the crime on Facebook.

During an hour-long standoff at his Bronx apartment on Sunday morning, Corey Dunton, 16, wrote on the social media website: 'Feds trien [sic] kick down my door its over were do i go from hereeeee...[I don't know] wat to do i f----ed up.'

Minutes later, he added: 'These n----s gunna have to take me out take my life … I aint goin to jail i reather [sic] take my life!!'

The alleged gang member is accused of shooting two men at the ice rink because of a dispute with another man over a coveted 'biggie' jacket he was wearing.

When police began banging on his door at around 8 a.m., he posted: 'Feds at my door Im goin out with a bang!!!!!!! take my soul.'

He is suspected to be a member of the Bloods gang and was taken to the Midtown South precinct house in Manhattan where he refused to answer questions and demanded a lawyer.

The teenager allegedly fired on Javier Contreras, 20, of the Bronx, but in doing so hit Adonis Mera, 14, of Manhattan who now faces being paralyzed from the waist down.

Police believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth 'biggie' jacket he was wearing and was shot in the hand and the hips.

A source with the NYPD confirmed that Contreras and Dunton knew each other.

The arrest of Dunton comes after the distraught family of 14-year-old Mera expressed their fears he will never walk again.

Currently being held in Bellevue Hospital in a critical but stable condition, Mera's brother Jorge Arias told the New York Daily News he visited to see his injured sibling.

'I didn’t really try to get him to speak,' Arias, 24, said. 'I just wanted to see his face. He’s a baby. He’s a little kid.'

Contreras was approached by the gunman and asked to hand over his jacket. When he refused the shooter left the rink but returned minutes later to unleash three gunshots - hitting both Contreras and Mera.

This is not the first time the puffy 'biggie' jacket has become a source of problem in New York.

The jacket, which costs $600, is believed to be the source of a scuffle in the Lower East Side earlier this year which led to Raphael Ward, 16, being shot in the chest over the coast.

The coat was discontinued by Paragon Sports last year and as such has become a desirable and rare piece of fashion.

The shocking incident happened just after 11pm Saturday, on the skating rink in the heart of the popular midtown park located at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue.

Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene.

‘People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn’t run,’ said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park’s second-floor restaurant Celsius.

‘People were scared they didn’t know what was going on,’ he said.

Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter.

He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room.

‘We didn’t know anything. The shooter could’ve been a lunatic with a machine gun,’ he said.

A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire.

In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks.

A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, ‘My brother 'just got shot in front of my face.'

Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was a friend named Adonis, identified by MailOnline as Adonis Mera.

According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice.

On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!'

Shorty before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people.

Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. 

Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.'

NYPD officers 
converged on the park after receiving reports of shots fired and 
quarantined some 50  skaters, who were later released after being 
questioned by police.

Joe
Carella, a spokesman for Bryant Park Corporation, the not-for-profit 
company that privately manages the park, said the park is virtually 
crime free.

In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers.

The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a ‘small miracle.’

Quarantine: Police secured the rink and questioned the park goers before letting them leave

These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months.

In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.
