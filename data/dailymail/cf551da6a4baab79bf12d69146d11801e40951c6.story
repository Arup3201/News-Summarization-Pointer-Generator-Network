A bungling burglar who was photographed with a ‘swag bag’ full of stolen goods over his shoulder has been jailed.

Rodney Geisha had been attempting to flee his victim's house in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, when he was snapped by a witness.

He was caught red-handed hauling his stolen goods over his shoulder in a comical manner similar to the cartoon crook Burglar Bill.

The witness, who has not been named, immediately called the police and offered up their iPhone image as crucial evidence to seal a conviction.

A second witness gave police a running commentary of Geisha’s movements, allowing the long arm of the law to catch up with the prolific burglar just 15 minutes later.

The clumsy crook's haul included a laptop, Xbox games, cash and two bottles of Jack Daniel's.

Geisha, 41, from Clacton, who had previous convictions for burglary, pleaded guilty and was jailed for four years when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday.

Investigating officer, Det Const Claire March of Clacton CID, said: 'The two witnesses were brilliant and their quick-thinking has meant another burglar is behind bars.

'The photograph and the running commentary describing Geisha’s movements was absolutely compelling evidence and he had no option but to plead guilty.

'The victim of the burglary is delighted too because all his stolen property was recovered although he was left with a huge repair bill for all the damage that Geisha caused.

'I hope that this superb example of the public helping police to catch criminals will be an inspiration to everyone.'
