Scientists believe they have found an alternative to surgery for women with the so-called 'breast cancer gene'. Angelina Jolie had a mastectomy after learning she had the faulty gene

When a woman is told she has the so-called ‘breast cancer gene’ she currently faces a stark choice – to have her breasts and ovaries removed or face the terrifyingly high risk of cancer.

But now, researchers in Belfast believe they have come up with an alternative.

The scientists say women with the BRCA1 gene mutation could use drugs, which are already available, to reduce their risk of the disease.

In the UK, about one woman in every 1,000 has the BRCA1 mutation – the same gene fault that prompted Angelina Jolie to undergo a double mastectomy.

These women have up to an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and up to a 40 per cent chance of ovarian cancer.

Until now, surgery to remove the breasts and ovaries has been their only option.

However, researchers at Queen’s University, Belfast, now say drug treatments which lower levels of oestrogen could also reduce cancer risks.

Their research revealed that there is a direct link between high levels of oestrogen and DNA damage, which causes cancer, in the breasts and ovaries.

The scientists also found that the cells of women with the BRCA1 mutation cannot effectively fight the very high levels of oestrogen that exist in all women’s breasts and ovaries, leaving them vulnerable to DNA damage.

Dr Kienan Savage, who led the research, said: ‘This discovery is very significant in the management of women with the BRCA1 gene mutation.

‘It’s the first really credible evidence that oestrogen is driving cancer in women with a BRCA1 gene mutation.

‘Because of this discovery, we now have the opportunity to propose an alternative treatment to surgery.

‘It also opens up the possibility of pausing treatment for a period in order for women to have children, if desired.’

Scientists say taking anti-oestrogen drugs could reduce the risk of cell damage, and therefore tumours, in people with the BRCA1 gene mutation. This is because these women's cells are unable to cope with high levels of the hormone. Angelina Jolie is pictured with partner, Brad Pitt

He added: ‘What also makes this exciting is that there are drugs already on the market which turn off oestrogen production.

‘In theory, we could use these drugs to chemically reduce oestrogen production in women which could negate the need for irreversible surgery.’

The researchers are currently seeking funding to launch clinical trials and hope to do so within 12 months.

It is envisaged that, in the first instance, a small control trial will be carried out using a combination of two drugs on 12 women for a period of three months, using biopsy, blood and urine samples to track DNA damage.
