Lightning never strikes twice - but for one unlucky couple and their home, cars apparently do.

Carol and Chris Broad were devastated when a driver smashed into their house in Barry, South Glamorgan, four years ago, causing £30,000 of damage and writing off the family car.

Now they are in shock after a second driver ploughed through their front garden and into the wall of their living room - forcing them to stay in a hotel while builders assess the damage.

Lucky escape: Carol Broad, pictured, said she could have been killed in the smash - the fifth to involve her house and a neighbour's

Speaking today, Mrs Broad, 52, said she could have been killed in the smash - the fifth to involve her house and a neighbour's.

She said: 'The only saving grace is that it happened when we were asleep upstairs.

'Bricks came flying ten metres 
through our front window and landed right where I sit watching TV.

'If it
had happened in the evening, I’d be dead.'

Describing the impact of the latest collision, Mrs Broad said: 'The house shook and I
knew instantly what had happened.

'I didn't even get out of bed to look -
I just reached for the phone and dialled 999.

'Chris looked out the window and did his best Victor Meldrew impression - "I don’t believe it".'

The cleaner said her next-door neighbours Monty and Janet Starr's house has been hit twice - by a
motorcycle about 30 years ago and a car ten years ago.

She said: 'We'd
seen some near-misses over the years, but you just hope it’s not going 
to happen to you.

'This is now the fifth time these two houses have been 
hit.'

In another incident before the Broads moved in, a car crashed through the
garden wall of their house and landed on its roof.

Barely recovered: Chris and Carol Broad were still trying to get over a previous smash when a second car hit their home in Barry, South Glamorgan

Mrs Broad and her electrical wholesaler husband, 48, had barely recovered from the previous smash in 2008, when a Volkswagen Golf careered into their three-bed semi in the early hours of New Year's Day.

The couple's brand-new Toyota Celica, worth £22,000, was written off.

Recalling the incident, Mrs Broad said: 'It was a horrendous start to the year.

'We were in bed at 6.30am when we heard this almighty crash and the entire house shook.

'The Golf had smashed through our garden wall, mounted our car, and ploughed into the porch and extension.'

They bought the house in 2001 and were warned by neighbours soon after moving in that the location was an accident blackspot.

Damage to their home from the first smash took 12 months to repair, but Mr Broad says he has never recovered from the mental trauma.

He said today: 'I haven't had a proper night's sleep in four years.

'It's there in my mind all the time - I've just been waiting for it to happen again.'

The couple's home - opposite a school on a busy T-junction - is in a 20mph zone.

But they say drivers regularly reach speeds of 60 and 70mph descending the hill facing the house.

'They brake at the last minute - or sometimes not soon enough, it seems,' said Mrs Broad.

'The council put a speed bump in after the last crash - but it just acts like a launch ramp.

'It's only a matter of time before someone is killed.'

The latest smash happened at 1.15am on Saturday as the couple and their 15-year-old daughter, Christy, were asleep in bed.

They now face four months in temporary accommodation while builders repair the damage.

Mrs Broad said: 'I can't imagine we’d ever be able to sell this house now even if we wanted to move.

'I don't even know if we'll be able to get insured again after this.'

Local MP Alun Cairns, who visited the couple to examine the damage, said: 'Chris and Carol have experienced the worst possible nightmare for the second time.

'The road alterations made after the last accident are clearly deficient.'

South Wales Police said a 29-year-old man is due to appear before Cardiff Magistrates on June 20 charged with a number of motoring offences.
