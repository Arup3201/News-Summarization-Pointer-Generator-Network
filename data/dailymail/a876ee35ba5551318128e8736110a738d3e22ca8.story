Angelina Jolie's surgeon has revealed in detail the treatment the 37-year-old actress had before, during and after her preventative mastectomy procedure.

The actress made the brave decision to have three months of 
secret procedures after being told she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting 
breast cancer due to the BRCA1 gene.

Angelina is said to already be planning her next surgery - the 
removal of both her ovaries - as the gene means she has a 50 per cent chance of 
developing ovarian cancer.

Now, in a blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website, her surgeon Dr Kristi Funk has explained the different stages of Angelina's medical treatment to help other women seeking information about BRCA gene mutations and what it might 
mean for them.

Speaking about Angelina's journey and recovery, she said: 'To a 
large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected
to feel well, to be active.

'On Monday, the pathology returned and I 
called Angelina to confirm our biggest hope: all of the breast tissue 
was benign.

'On day four after her mastectomies, I was pleased to find 
her not only in good spirits with bountiful energy, but with two walls 
in her house covered with freshly assembled storyboards for the next 
project she is directing.

'All the while she spoke, six drains dangled 
from her chest, three on each side, fastened to an elastic belt around 
her waist.

Dr Funk added: 'It is important to
emphasize that each woman’s case is different. Surgery will not 
necessarily be the right choice for everyone, and there are alternatives
available. As Angelina says in her article, the important thing is to 
be aware of your options.'

The first stage, says Dr Funk, is to gather data and information. 'BRCA stands for BReast CAncer.  BRCA genes help you fight cancer when it
happens in your body.

'Women carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations have up to an 87 per cent lifetime chance of breast cancer and 54 per cent chance of ovarian cancer vs. a general population risk of 12 per cent for breast cancer and less than 1 per cent for ovarian cancer.

Dr Funk said that Angelina's partner brad Pitt was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic, as he was during each of the operations

Speaking about Angelina's journey and recovery, Dr Funk said: 'To a large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected to feel well, to be active'

'Given the high likelihood of getting breast or ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations, family history usually triggers testing for the gene. Angelina’s mother had breast cancer, and sadly passed away from ovarian cancer.  Her maternal grandmother was also diagnosed with ovarian cancer.'

Women carrying a BRCA mutation then undergo a surveillance plan involving mammograms, breast examinations, pelvic ultrasounds and blood tests to check for CA-125, which is a marker of ovarian cancer.  If and when a woman commits to a preventative mastectomy, there are a number of questions a woman has to address, says Dr Funk.

The first is whether or not to preserve the nipples. 'Women undergoing preventive mastectomies can always consider keeping their nipples.'

Angelina had a technique called Nipple Delay, performed one to two weeks before the actual mastectomies. This uses the planned mastectomy incision and lifts half of the skin off of the breast surface.

'A small disc of the tissue directly behind the nipple and areola is also removed and analyzed by a pathologist,' says Dr Funk.

Angelina's decision to have the preventative mastectomy was prompted by the fact she lost her mother, Marcheline Bertrand (left), to ovarian cancer at the age of 56

'This is done to rule out the presence of any disease directly behind the nipples, which would make preserving them a dangerous proposition. Additionally, it recruits extra blood flow to the area, lessening the chances of nipple and skin loss due to insufficient blood supply after the mastectomy.'

Angelina was in the operating room for the first 
operation, the nipple delay, on February 2, 2013. 'Her partner was on hand to greet her as 
soon as she came around from the anesthetic, as he was during each of 
the operations,' said Dr Funk.

'After the operation, her skin was slightly 
bruised but soon returned to normal.  Two days after her procedure, 
great news arrived: the tissue behind both nipples came back completely 
normal.

'On February 16, she had the main surgery, which can last 
up to eight hours.  The mastectomies went smoothly, with sentinel nodes 
identified but not removed.' 

Dr Funk said Angelia had a procedure called Nipple Delay to preserve her nipples and an implant reconstruction with allograft

When it came to the incisions, 'for Angelina, her optimal incision choices were around the areola, or 
underneath the breast in the inframammary fold – the latter was chosen,' says Dr Funk.

'After the mastectomies, I assisted plastic 
surgeon, Dr. Jay Orringer, as we performed the first stage breast 
reconstruction by placing tissue expanders with allograft.

'Implants are the most common reconstruction, often requiring two stages,
whereby a tissue expander is placed prior to the final implant.

'A 
tissue expander is a deflated implant that goes behind the pectoral 
muscles and gets slowly inflated with saline over a period of 2-3 
months, until the chosen volume is reached. A second operation is 
performed to swap the expander for the final implant (usually silicone).

She adds that 'Angelina’s body type was best suited to an implant reconstruction with allograft.

'This uses synthetic sheets of material, that create a more natural look. Although tissue expanders required an additional operation, she preferred to use them.

'The next day she had her first injection of saline 
into the expanders, thus beginning the process that would gradually 
prepare the tissues for the final stage of her operations, 
reconstruction.

'Four of the six drains were removed.  Four days after 
that, on postoperative day nine, the last two drains were removed.  A 
second saline fill occurred on March 4. Over the next four weeks she was
hard at work.

'The final operation occurred on April 27, 2013, 
ten weeks after the mastectomies: reconstruction of the breasts with 
implant, which went extremely well, bringing an end to her surgical 
journey.'

Dr Funk says Angelina also followed a strict regimen of supplements to both prepare and recover from surgery. This included:

To enhance wound healing (for each operation):Vitamin C: 1000mg tablets; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery.Multi-Vitamin: one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery.Zinc: 50 mg; one tablet once daily for one week before and one week after surgery.

To reduce the risk of infection:Bactroban ointment: Applied twice a day beginning 3 days prior to surgery x 7 days.Hibiclens
shower: Hibiclens soap applied to upper torso and abdomen – left on for
5 minutes, then rinsed. Applied once a day for 3 days prior to surgery.Keflex: 250mg (antibiotic); one tablet 4x a day for 7 days, beginning with 2 doses the day of the operation.

To reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (for each operation):Emend: 40mg; one tablet by mouth the night before surgery

To reduce postoperative swelling and bruising (for each operation):Arnica Forte (Arnica and Bromelain): two capsules daily x 7 days, beginning one day prior to surgery.To help eliminate anesthesia from the system (for each operation):Exchem:
10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily, beginning the 
day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery.

Lymphomyosat:
10 drops in water or directly in the mouth twice daily, beginning the 
day before surgery and continuing for one week after surgery.

To increase oxygen to the skin (operations 1 and 2):Cutagenix:
Applied to breast every 6 hours x 3 days. Skin care specialists use 
this topical cream after laser resurfacing to increase oxygen flow to 
the outer layers of skin. We decided in Angelina’s case to apply it to 
the mastectomy skin to give it an oxygen boost and to help ensure 
adequate blood flow to her skin postoperatively.

To minimise scarring (after operation 3):BioCorneum: Rubbed into scars twice a day for 12 weeks – begin after the third operation once steri strips are removed.

Plus various medications needed for pain.
