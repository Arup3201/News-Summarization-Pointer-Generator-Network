A man shot on the US-Canada border in Washington state was in the country illegally and wanted in connection with a murder, according to officials.

The man, later identified as Jamison Childress, 20, was approached by two border agents after setting off ground sensors when crossing the border on Thursday afternoon, according to US Customs and Border Protection.

He displayed 'erratic and threatening' behavior toward the agents and sprayed one of them with an incapacitating spray, the agency said.

One of the agents then shot the man in the head and killed him about 300 yards from the border near Sumas, Washington.

Border authorities did not release the man's identity, which was later confirmed by a local medical examiner. He is thought to be from British Columbia.

Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo said that he was wanted in connection to a murder.

Childress was set to stand trial for 2013 assault and mischief charges on Tuesday in Prince George, British Columbia, according to the Abbotsford BC News.

He was also set to face charges for theft later this year. 

It was not clear where the murder he is connected to took place.

Lawyer Michael Reed represented Childress previously and said that he was surprised by news of a murder charge, The Canadian Press reported.

Reed expressed 'disbelief' about the incident.

'People cross the international border to bring crime and violence to our communities,' said at a news conference.

The agent who was sprayed with the chemical required medical attention but was not seriously hurt, the agency said. 

The incident occurred at the small border crossing of Sumas, about 100 miles north of Seattle, Washington

Both agents involved in the incident, who have served 10 and 19 years, were placed on administrative leave. They were not identified Friday.

A multiagency task force, including the sheriff's office, will investigate the shooting, which occurred shortly after 2.30 p.m. on Thursday. 

Sumas is about 100 miles north of Seattle.

Officials released few details at the news conference, saying the investigation was in the early stages.

They declined to release other details about the dead man. 

'We have not confirmed his citizenship,' Elfo said, though the man was confirmed to have entered the US from Canada.

'It was apparent he was erratic and aggressively approached the agents,' he said. 

A hatchet was found in the man's backpack, but it was not displayed at the agents. 

One agent's face was burned by the spray, which Elfo did not identify.

Previous media reports wrongly identified the dead man as Daniel Paul, 42, who is wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Vancouver. He is still at large.
