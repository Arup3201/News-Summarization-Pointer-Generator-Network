A five-year-old boy suffered severe cuts to his leg and head after falling off a children's ride at an amusement park in Brooklyn.

As the roller coaster at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park at Coney Island reached the top of the hill, the boy allegedly got scared and wanted to get off.

He climbed underneath the safety bar of the Sea Serpent Roller Coaster and fell in between the cars as the ride went around the track.

The boy, whose name has not been released, was taken to Bellevue Hospital where officials said he is in stable condition.

He
was travelling with his seven-year-old sister in the fifth out of six 
cars, Deano’s president co-owner Dennis Vourderis said, and became 
frightened then the ride reached the top of the hill.

‘He
was on the inside of the tracks. He had cuts all over and he wasn’t 
moving,’ witness LeRoy Mace, 40, of Brooklyn told New York Daily News.

‘I don’t think he was conscious. He was on the tracks for at least 20 minutes before they pulled him off.’

Treatment: The boy was taken to hospital with severe cuts to his left leg and head

Incident: The boy, aged five, was injured after he fell attempting to get off a kiddie ride on Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park at Coney Island

Mr Vourderis told WABC-TV the boy met the 36-inch height requirement for the Sea Serpent. He said there hasn't been an accident at the ride in its 15-year history.

‘Our prayers for a speedy recovery are with the young man and his family,’ Vourderis said.

The Department of Buildings is investigating the accident, and reported to have found no defects with the equipment.

Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park has about 17 rides for children and four adult rides. The 150-foot-high Wonder Wheel is an iconic part of Coney Island, and has been in operation since 1920.
