After a summer of discontent that saw hundreds of rioters roam the streets of the capital, the Metropolitan Police needed to take action.

And it appears that this imposing 10foot high steel structure is their answer to the problem.

The police cordon was erected at the north end of Whitehall near Trafalgar Square yesterday afternoon in an attempt to stop anti-cuts protesters heading towards Parliament.

Officers were also called in to help out paramedics after thousands of NHS workers went on strike.

Sealed off: The barrier was erected at the north end of Whitehall. It is used by police when they think a public order situation is developing to block people and cars

Officials said 42 per cent of London 
Ambulance Service workers walked out on strike - and the service 
received 30 per cent more calls than normal. The reason for the surge is
 unclear.

Police did not deal with 'critical incidents' where lives were at risk - but provided medical support where they could help out.

The Metropolitan Police said the barrier of steel 
structure is put in place when a potential public order situation is 
likely to develop and they need a physical barrier to block cars and 
people.

Yesterday officers stood behind the cordon 
using windows to lookout for troublemakers who had used today's public 
sector strikes as an excuse to protest.

The barrier was used after a group of protestors stormed Panton House in Leicester Square, with some making it on to the roof and setting off flares.

The group from Occupy London - the anti-capitalist protesters camped out
 in the churchyard of St Paul's Cathedral - said they were 'targeting' 
Mick Davis, the CEO of mining company Xstrata.

They began to unfurl a banner saying 'Power to the . . .' but were stopped before the building could be occupied.

An Occupy London spokesman said they 
were aiming the demonstration at Mr Davis because he was the highest 
paid CEO of all the FTSE 100 companies in the last year.

Some protesters close to Panton House lit flares during the protest, such as this man who walks down the centre of Haymarket in central London

He said that around 20 protesters were being held inside by riot police 
and that a 'few hundred' were being kettled in the street outside - a 
number of them were holding UK Uncut placards.

Karen Lincoln, supporter of Occupy London, said: 'Mick Davis is a prime 
example of the greedy 1 per cent lining their own pockets while denying workers' 
pensions.'

An Xstrata spokeswoman said: 'Xstrata confirms that a number of protesters have attempted to enter the company's offices in central London today.

'All executive pay is approved by the company's shareholders and is linked to company and individual performance.

Earlier in 
Hackney officers and a dog unit kettled campaigners, who were gathered 
outside a library in Dalston Lane, Dalston. Police made 37 arrests.

Witnesses
 said the protest, which began around 9am, started out peacefully but 
erupted into violence after police surrounded the group when they 
started playing music on a sound system.

One bystander said police started arresting people after two protesters attacked a PCSO.

'It
 was carnage,' he added. 'It all kicked off when two people attacked a 
PCSO.  'Then the police detained people. I think they were just worried 
about it escalating because they were very pleasant with the way they 
dealt with people.

'There 
had been rumours that there was going to be a couple of thousand 
protesters coming down here which I think is why there were so many 
police stationed here.

'Eventually they packed the protesters on a coach and took them away.'

Witnesses said the police had maintained a distance from the protest 
until they began blocking the road, when officers intervened.

Tony
 Aydan, who runs a dry cleaners across the road, said: 'The protest 
started out peacefully and there were women and children there.

'At one point they were blocking the road so the police moved them back.

'Then there were people turning up who looked like they didn't belong there. They were covering up their faces and looked like they wanted trouble. 

'Something must have happened because the police contained them at the side of the road and just started arresting people.

'If they had moved along it wouldn't have happened but I saw one woman pushing police officers. Any excuse to have a go.'

Kollin Bagura, who runs To the Jungle cafe, in Dalston Lane, said the police jumped on a group of protesters who had begun pushing and shoving.

'It seemed quite heavy handed but it contained them well,' he added.

'People were upset because they didn't think they had done anything wrong, but it did stop things escalating.'

Meanwhile another witness questioned the need to arrest protesters, labelling the move 'heavy-handed.'

'The only considerable breach of the peace was playing music on a sound system. Is that is a criminal activity?' he said.
