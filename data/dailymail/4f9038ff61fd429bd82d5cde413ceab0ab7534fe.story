Apple has begun sending out invites to a special event expected to see the launch of the iPad mini.

The firm sent journalists, analysts and others a colourful invite saying 'We've got a little more to show you'.

The event is expected to see the unveiling of a the much anticipated iPad mini - a smaller, cheaper version of the hugely successful tablet, but could also see new Macbook computers and even a new Mac Mini computer.

Online speculation over the gadget has been rampant, with everything from pictures to potential prices having been speculated on - despite Apple not even confirming next week's event will see the launch.

However, reports have pointed to the new device having a 7.85inch screen, compared to the 9.7 inch screen of the current iPad.

The timing of the event is also believed to have been carefully thought out by apple.

Invites were sent an hour after Microsoft confirmed the pricing of its Surface tablet.

The event will take place three days before Microsoft's Surface goes on sale, and a day before Amazon's Kindle fire tablet launches in the UK.

The Kindle Fire, which has a seven inch screen, will sell for £159 - but Apple's gadget will be able to run far more apps.

A top of the line, fully loaded iPad mini could set gadget fans back as much as £520, if leaked reports are to be believed.

A price list pictured by the site Mobile Geeks last week appears to give the cost and details of eight different iPad mini models.

The shot is purportedly an image of an inventory system used by Media Market / Saturn, which is a retail group with employees in Europe and Asia. 

The inventory list notes prices for 8,
16, 32, and 64 GB models with Wi-Fi, then a separate version of each 
model with integrated cellular radios for connection to mobile networks,
making for a total of eight models.

If the information is correct, the 
base model is €249 (£200), with a cost increase of €100 (£80) to double 
the storage and an additional €100 on top of that to add cellular.

The most impressive model, the 64 GB with cellular, would be €649 (about £520).

As AllThingsD reported in August, 
Apple will hold a special event this month, at which it is expected to 
showcase the new, smaller iPad.

The unveiling of the iPhone 5 and the 
2012 iPod line was held at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Centre for the 
Arts, leaving people to believe that this launch will be a smaller 
affair.

Apple's event is at the 1,122-seat California Theatre, an opera house dating back to 1927.

Sources say the iPad’s smaller sibling
will feature a 7.85in liquid-crystal display and a Lightning connector,
according to AllThingsD.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was 
apparently set against a smaller iPad, but relented in the 
months before his death last year, according to emails discussed in the 
Apple vs Samsung patent dispute.

During testimony during the ongoing 
trial, submitted court documents suggest Steve Jobs was tempted to enter
the seven-inch market.

He presented an email from Apple vice 
president Eddy Cue, who said: 'Having used a Samsung Galaxy Tab [a 
seven-inch Android tablet], I tend to agree with many of the comments 
below…

'I believe there will be a seven-inch market and we should do one.

'I expressed this to Steve several times since Thanksgiving and he seemed very receptive the last time.'
