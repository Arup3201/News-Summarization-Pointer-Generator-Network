So far, police have made no arrests in the shooting. Law enforcement officials are offering a $20,000 reward for information in the case.

The site AllMusic reports Newton, a native of Pittsburgh, got his start in hip hop in the late 1990s as part of the group Mob Figaz.

In 2001, Newton embarked on a solo career, releasing more than 40 independent albums over the past 14 years.

His music was featured in the gritty 2013 police-shooting drama Fruitvale Station, which won the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival that year. 

The Jacka's latest effort, an album titled What Happened To The World, was released just two months ago.

On Monday night, hundreds of The Jacka's fans and fellow artists took to Facebook and Twitter to mourn their loss.

Fellow West Coast rapper Freeway, with whom The Jacka recorded an album last year, wrote a prayer on his Instagram in honor of his friend.

‘O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him and give him strength and pardon him. Be generous to him and cause his entrance to be wide and wash him with water and snow and hail,’ the performer write. ‘Cleanse him of his transgressions as white cloth is cleansed of stains. Give him an abode better than his home, and a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife.

‘Take him into Paradise and protect him from the punishment of the grave [and from the punishment of Hell-fire].Ameen! Love you bro!!’

According to SF Weekly, Newton had converted to Islam in his youth and went by his Muslim name Shaheed Akbar for most of his adult life. 

Dominic Newton was born to a 14-year-old mother and a convict father who served 15 years in prison. In an article published by the Bay Area News Group in 2005, he explained that his stage name came from charges of carjacking and stealing.

As a young man, he had served one year for grand theft auto and armed robbery.

Two weeks ago, Newton posted this picture on his Instagram account showing him with two bags of cannabis he allegedly had purchased from a medical marijuana dispensary  

Newton’s friend Reggie Grant, 51, told NBC Bay Area that the rapper died while doing what he love most – making music.

According to Grant, just after 8pm Monday night Newton and a group of seven or eight men seated in a parked van were enjoying a jam session when someone opened fire, striking The Jacka in the head.

‘Bullets don't have no name. I don't know who did it,’ said Grant. ‘He had problems with nobody. He'd give you his shoes off his feet. He gave jobs to lots of people.’

Grant said he witnessed his friend draw his last breath as a neighbor held a towel to his head wound.

The 37-year-old performer reportedly leaves behind and wife and children.

Wu-Tang clan member Raekwon and Portland Trailblazers point guard Damian Lillard joined a chorus of condolences on Twitter, with the NBA star writing: ‘R.I.P to ‘The Jacka’ … Oakland Rap Legend ! Life was taken tonight IN OAKLAND. Got to do better toward our own man.’
