England's Young Lions advanced to the next stage of European Championship qualifying in style with a 3-1 victory over France on Thursday afternoon.

Goals from Chris Willock, Will Patching and Jay DaSilva guided John Peacock's side to a third victory from three this week and ensured they finished top of their group.

After wins over host nation Cyprus and Macedonia, England knew that a win over France would guarantee first place in Group 4 and lay down a marker as they bid to defend their European Championship title.

And another impressive performance in Paphos saw them a step further down the road to next summer's finals in Bulgaria.

West Ham defender Reece Oxford was named captain again after serving a one-match suspension for a red card in Saturday's opener against Cyprus and Manchester City's Cameron Humphreys made way.

Chances were few in the opening minutes though Arsenal youngster Willock saw a 25-yard shot saved by France goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of legend Zinedine.

France started to threaten and Maxime Pelican, totally unmarked from a corner, headed the ball into the ground and saw it bounce over the crossbar.

The contest had been even but England seized control with two goals in the 10 minutes leading up to half-time.

First, after Layton Ndukwu won a corner, Will Patching's quickly-taken delivery was put in by Willock at the far-post, a deflection helping its progress past Zidane.

And seconds before the half-time whistle, Tottenham's Marcus Edwards won a free-kick on the edge of the box after beating three defenders.

Edwards fancied the kick but Manchester City's Patching had other ideas and curled the ball into the bottom right corner for 2-0.

Inevitably, France, who had also won their opening two matches, returned stronger after the break and saw chances for captain Timothe Cognat and Yann Karamoh go begging.

But they halved the deficit on 62 minutes when Karamoh, a half-time substitute, curled home from 20 yards beyond the dive of goalkeeper Paul Woolston.

Peacock introduced Middlesbrough's Hayden Coulson and Liverpool's Herbie Kane to stem the French flow and England scored a minute or so later.

Chelsea's Da Silva thundered through the French defence and calmly slotted the ball past the goalkeeper to make absoilutely sure of England's win.

They now advance along with France into the elite round of qualifiers and the draw will be made in early December.
