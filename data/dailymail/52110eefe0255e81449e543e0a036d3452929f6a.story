A Saudi Arabian air force sergeant faces a minimum mandatory 35 years in state prison after a jury found him guilty of raping a 13-year-old boy at a Las Vegas Strip hotel last New Year's Eve.

Defendant Mazen Alotaibi, 24, remained seated, clenching his jaw but showing no outward emotion as the verdict was read in Nevada state court yesterday.

Sentencing for the 24-year-old Royal Saudi Air Force mechanic, who had been in the U.S. for military training, is set for Dec. 16.

Clark County District Court Judge Stefany Miley could sentence him to prison for life.

The jury of nine women and three men found Alotaibi guilty of sexual assault with a minor for forcing oral and anal sex on the boy in the bathroom of a sixth-floor room at the Circus Circus hotel, and lewdness with a child for fondling and kissing the boy on the way to the room.

Alotaibi decided not to testify in his defense.

Jurors instead saw a 70-minute videotaped police interview in which Alotaibi told detectives the boy offered sex for marijuana or money.

After several minutes of denials, Alotaibi acknowledged to police that he engaged in sex with the boy.

The Associated Press is withholding the boy's name because of his age and the nature of the case.

Nevada state law says a child under 
16 can't give consent. But Alotaibi's lawyer, Don Chairez, said Alotaibi
was too intoxicated after drinking all night at a strip club to know if
he was doing anything wrong.

Chairez spoke with jurors after the verdict and said outside court that he will appeal.

'I believe, with hindsight, that it was a mistake not to have Mazen testify,' Chairez said, explaining that he believes jurors were left with evidence that his client had forced the boy to have sex.

The defense attorney faulted himself for not fighting harder for the jury to be able to consider a lesser felony charge of statutory sexual seduction, which carries a possible sentence of probation or up to 10 years in prison.

Prosecutor Jacqueline Bluth said the state was happy with the outcome.

'We didn't believe this was consensual and that the defendant was drunk,' she said.

The Saudi Royal Consulate General in Los Angeles didn't respond Wednesday to messages about the case.

A consulate official attended at 
least one January court appearance. Chairez said he has been in contact 
with consulate officials before, during and after trial, but no 
government representatives attended the proceedings.

Jurors heard five days of testimony and spent just five hours deliberating.

Alotaibi had been charged with nine felonies, but was found guilty of six felonies and one misdemeanor.

The
jury acquitted him of two lewdness counts that were offered as lesser 
alternatives to the two most serious counts of sexual assault with a 
minor under 14.

Alotaibi was convicted of two other counts of lewdness with a child under 14 and one count of kidnapping, which each carry a possible sentence of 10 years to life in prison.

He was also found guilty of felony burglary for entering a building with intent to commit a crime, and of misdemeanor coercion.

The boy testified that he was waiting to go to breakfast with a friend when he approached Alotaibi and other men early Dec. 31 in a hallway at the Circus Circus because he smelled marijuana on their clothes and wanted pot.

The jury heard that other men who lounged and smoked in the room shooed the boy away after learning that he was 13.

Alotaibi followed the boy, out of the room, smoked marijuana with him outside the hotel, and asked the boy for sex, according to the boy's account.

Alotaibi was seen on elevator surveillance video leaning down and apparently kissing the boy's neck on their way back to the hotel room. The boy is seen running back to the elevator about 30 minutes later.

The boy testified that in the hotel room bathroom, Alotaibi blocked the door, offered him $150 and then doubled the amount, and forced him into oral and anal sex.

A man who was traveling with Alotaibi testified that he knocked several times on the locked bathroom door while Alotaibi and the boy were inside, but they didn't come out.

Bluth told the jury that Alotaibi wanted sex and wouldn't take no for an answer.

Alotaibi rejected a plea deal before trial that could have gotten him a possible sentence of probation or up to 80 years in prison for pleading guilty to two charges each of felony attempted sexual assault and attempted lewdness.

The boy testified last week that he was 'freaked out' and didn't know how to escape when Alotaibi made sexual advances toward him before raping him.

'It felt like I was trapped in a corner,' the boy said about the encounter at Circus Circus, his voice growing so quiet as he recounted the details that attorneys repeatedly told him to speak up.

'I was freaked out and I wanted to leave, but I didn't know what to do.'

The
air force sergeant had bloodshot eyes and smelled of marijuana, the 
teen said, and he ended up following the man to a room on promises of 
getting pot for himself.

He
said that while in the elevator, Alotaibi leaned into him and kissed 
his neck. The boy said he felt awkward and 'I knew something bad was 
going to happen', according to the Review Journal.

Shortly
after, the boy said, Alotaibi offered to pay him money for sex, and he 
verbally agreed to the offer in hopes of tricking the man and running 
away before anything happened.

The
teen said he ran off after the incident and reported the rape to hotel 
security, fearing that he may have contracted a sexually transmitted 
disease.

Alotaibi's lawyer, Don Chairez, questioned the boy about why he didn't bite, scratch or hit the sergeant during the encounter.

He
also pointed out that the teen has given different stories to different
people — he told detectives he'd been dragged into the room, but now 
says he went willingly.

'I made up part of story so I wouldn't get in trouble with my parents' over the marijuana, he explained.

Chairez has argued that Alotaibi was too limited in English and too unfamiliar with U.S. law to 
waive his right to have a lawyer with him while he answered police 
questions, the lawyer said.

Alotaibi,
sitting handcuffed in a police interview room, never asked for a 
translator and appeared at the beginning of the 70-minute videotaped 
interview to waive his right to have a lawyer present.

He also said he didn't understand why he was there.

Police reported collecting DNA evidence from a used condom and a soiled towel found in the bathroom.

The
prosecutor said DNA swabbed from the boy's neck, ear, chest and other 
body parts was consistent with two people, including Alotaibi.

Chairez has said the DNA evidence was inconclusive and showed no link to his client.

Alotaibi told police he was drinking 
Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied 
allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to 
have sex with him for money.

The
report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators 
that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of 
seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him.

McGrath
said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said
he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, 
Texas.

U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said.

Joint
Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated 
Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air
Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at 
Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a 
Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to 
improve their English-language skills.

The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower. Circus Circus has a total of 3,767 guest rooms in three towers and five three-story motor lodge-style buildings dubbed Circus Circus Manor.

Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic law, and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment.

Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liquor could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail. 

Alotaibi was being held on more than $1.7 million bail.
