Distressing footage has emerged of the moment Spanish police restrained a British tourist who died of a suspected cardiac arrest shortly afterwards.

The 30-second clip is believed to show former Rugby League player Luke Rhoden, 25, screaming as three officers grappled with him after he fell from a first-floor balcony in Ibiza.

Another tourist who witnessed the incident said it appeared that officers later stamped on Mr Rhoden's head - a claim which has sparked calls for an inquiry but is denied by Ibiza's police.

Tragic: Luke Rhoden died in Ibiza after an altercation with police. He had fallen from a first floor balcony

The footage first emerged on social media and was filmed by a tourist who said they witnessed the tragic incident. 

A source in Ibiza's Civil Guard said officers believed Mr Rhoden may have taken drugs on Tuesday night before he fell from the balcony at the popular Ibiza Rocks hotel, in Sant Antoni de Portmany.

He picked himself up and ran through the hotel screaming 'someone's trying to kill me', the police source claimed, before officers from the Civil Guard restrained him and put him into an ambulance to be sedated.

But a British tourist who witnessed the incident gave a distressing account to his son.

The 58-year-old asked not to be named, but phoned his 33-year-old son John Morrison from Poole, Dorset, after the incident unfolded.

Mr Morrison said his father was 'still very shaken up', adding: 'They are staying in an apartment pretty much opposite Ibiza Rocks. He heard police sirens underneath their balcony. He went out to the balcony and the police cars came round.

Anger: Mr Rhoden's father Norman has called for an investigation into the actions of the Spanish police

Mr Rhoden's father said: 'The feedback we have been getting on social media is suggesting something more untoward has happened as they were trying to contain him. That's what I want to get to the bottom of'

'He saw this guy backing out from the bar by Ibiza Rocks. He was backing off and there were a few police guys in front of him.

'He had gone to run away and that's when they started giving him a real pasting with batons.

'There was four or five of them. It was sustained.

'Dad said he managed to roll away on the floor and got to the other side of the road and that was when it looked like police started stamping on his head - two of them.

'By that time there was a crowd getting up and they were getting restless and that's when they stopped kicking the guy.' 

Today Mr Rhoden's father Norman called for a full investigation over the police's part in his son's death.

'The feedback we have been getting on social media is suggesting something more untoward or sinister has happened as they were trying to contain him,' he told the BBC.

'I'm not disagreeing that his behaviour may have been erratic, but what force have they used to subdue him? That's my concern, that's what I want to get to the bottom of.' 

Mr Morrison said according to his father, it was around half an hour before paramedics arrived.

They then worked for around 45 minutes to revive the man in the street before the Civil Guard arrived and his body was removed, the tourist claimed.

'Dad was really shaken up,' Mr Morrison added. 'He messaged me and my brother and said "never ever come to this place".'

Mr Rhoden, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, played prop forward as a junior for Wigan Warriors and for England's under 17 side. He also played for Oldham Roughyeds.

Police are investigating the circumstances around his death and the results of an autopsy, which would determine whether he had taken drugs, have not yet been released. 

A police source insisted yesterday: 'Our officers do not beat people up. They restrained him for his own safety and helped him into the ambulance where he was sedated.'

The source added: 'He was acting wildly and from his behaviour we believe he may have been taking drugs.

Probe: An autopsy will determine if Mr Rhoden took drugs, but its results have not yet been released

'Our officers restrained him for his own safety and put him into an ambulance so he could be sedated.

'The paramedics tried to revive him but he died in the ambulance. An autopsy will reveal the cause of death.' 

Popular: Mr Rhoden enjoying a night out with friends

Formerly called Club Paraiso Mediterraneo, the 368-room hotel opened in 1998 and was renamed Ibiza Rocks in 2008.

A spokesman for the venue denied police had been involved in the death.

She confirmed there was a 'balcony incident', that the man did not die 'on impact' and his death happened outside the hotel.

She said: 'We can confirm there was a fatality in Ibiza last night and our sincerest and heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the individual concerned at this very difficult time.

'We continue to assist the Spanish Police with their investigation and cannot make further comment about the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident until a full enquiry is complete.'

A source at the hotel added: 'Several of our staff witnessed him being restrained but nobody has reported seeing the police use excessive force or beating him.

'He had fallen from a balcony and then made his way through public areas of the hotel acting very strangely.

'He made it out into the street where the police took over.' 

Mr Rhoden's former club Wigan Warriors paid tribute to him, saying: 'Wigan Warriors are saddened to hear of the death of former youth player Luke Rhoden.

'Having come through the club's scholarship system Luke played for the Warriors academy in 2007 and 2008 before moving on to play semi-professionally at Oldham.' 

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had been informed of the death and was providing assistance to the man's family.

She said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
