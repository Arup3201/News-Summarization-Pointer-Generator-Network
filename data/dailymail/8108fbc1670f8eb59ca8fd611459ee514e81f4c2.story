They may not have been taken at the most flattering angle, but these dizzying photos capture the split second of delight - and terror - for thrill seekers aboard some of the world's scariest rides.

Photographer Lewis Whyld has developed a camera system which can take 360 degree pictures and attached it to rollercoasters across the UK.

These photographs - taken 
at the most exciting points on each of the rides - were captured
aboard ‘Colossus’ at Thorpe Park – the world’s first 10 inversion 
roller coaster.

The Swarm roller coaster in Thorpe Park corkscrews after going down the world's first inverted drop of 128ft

The RITA roller coaster in Alton Towers enters a high speed turn. The ride accelerates from 0-100kmph in 2.3 seconds

Thrill seekers are spun upside down 10 times and the ride features the UK's only quadruple roll.

On his site Mr Whyld said: 'Photography is all about freezing a moment in time forever.

'But now you can look around that moment, like time is standing still and everyone else is frozen except you.

'Roller coasters have been a source of entertainment and excitement for years.

'Before I could shoot these I had to design and build a camera system capable of safely shooting 360 degree pictures with split second timing at over 100km/h whilst pulling 5G… upside down.

'Once I’d solved that minor technicality, the fun began…'

Mr Whyld also has a body of work with serious subject matters, including haunting images of the Egyptian revolution.

His site includes the movable three dimensional images, which allows users to scroll in and out of, seeing 360 degrees around.

He said he came up with the technique following the London riots.

He said: 'During the riots I shot both video and still photographs and what we needed was a way to combine these two elements in a moving film for the internet.

'I came up with a technique for converting a still photograph into a 3 dimensional space that you can actually move around.'
