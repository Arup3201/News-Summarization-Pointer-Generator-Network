As the death toll in the single most deadly avalanche in Mt Everest history continues to grow, an American climber has written a touching tribute to the Sherpa who saved his life.

Jon Reiter of California is currently on his second attempt to summit the world's tallest mountain and was moving up to Camp 1 Friday morning when he heard a 'crack' sound and saw snow and ice come barreling down the mountain.

The 49-year-old says his first thought was to get his camera out and film the avalanche, but his quick-thinking Sherpa instead pushed him to safety behind some ice blocks.

No hope of survival: Rescuers on Mount Everest found the body of a 13th Nepalese guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak

In a blog post written Saturday, Reiter praises his Sherpa named Dawa, calling him an amazing man whom he has great respect for.

'He's a perfect example of the selfless Sherpa people that we entrust with out lives while on the mountain and who we quickly learn to call of friends [sic]'

In the post, he included a picture of Dawa just as the guide was leaving base camp Saturday.

'Dawa is the man who was by my side with the avalanche struck. He's the guy who spent all day yesterday digging his friends and neighbors out of the snow and sending their limp bodies hanging on a cable from the helicopter down to base camp.

'After a long 16 agonizing hours he showed up at my tent, before going to his own, to make sure I was ok,' Reiter wrote.

Should he stay or go? As of Saturday, Reiter seemed unsure whether he would continue with his attempt to summit Everest

So far 13 bodies have been pulled from the mountain and an additional three people are still missing. All of the dead were Sherpas, native Himalyans who guide foreign climbers up the mountain.

Reiter says the tragedy has shaken the Sherpa community on the mountain and that most of them have decided to go home and be with their families for a few days.

'This scene is a lot for us western climbers to take in so I can't imagine what our Sherpa partners are really feeling and thinking as we all witness the worst disaster in Everest history happening in front of our eyes,' he wrote.

Reiter also addressed the theories that over-crowing or litter on the mountain caused the devastating avalanche in the area of Everest known as the 'popcorn field'.

Reiter maintains that the avalanche was an accident and an act of nature.

'There were only about 40 of us in the entire icefall and we were spread out,' he writes. 'There was no one waiting for others in order to move up and no congestion anywhere in the icefall. It appeared to be perfect climbing conditions right up until the moment the thunder struck.'

And while littering has been a problem on the mountain in the past, Reiter says it couldn't possibly have played a role in Friday's tragedy.

'Excessive trash did not cause this to happen. There is absolutely no garbage that I saw anywhere in the icefall. Actually we should all be proud of how good this place really looks. This was a random act of nature.' 

Climbers declared a four-day halt to efforts to scale the 8,848-metre (29,029-ft) summit and, while some decided to abandon their mission, others said they would go ahead after talking to their guides.

Dangerous: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable

Relative await news: Seven climbers were rescued, including two airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment. The avalanche hit at a site known as the Khumbu icefall at more than 5,000 m altitude, as the climbers were ascending from the base camp to camp one

As of Saturday, Reiter seemed unsure 
of whether he would continue his summit attempt on Everest - fulfilling 
his goal of climbing the tallest mountain on every continent.

'Early
 this morning I read a comment written about me where the author said, 
"I hope he finds what he's looking for up there." I appreciated that 
notion because it got me to thinking about what am I looking for, and I 
think I have found it whether I see the summit of Everest or not,' 
Reiter wrote.

But Reiter may not have a choice in the matter. His wife Susan Reiter told MailOnline Sunday that the Sherpas are threatening to take down the ladders and ropes up to the summit if the Nepalese government doesn't reward the family's victims benefits.

The Sherpas have set a deadline for Tuesday, so that's when Reiter will know if he can attempt a summit or not.

If he doesn't make it this year, Mrs Reiter says he's likely to go back and try in 2015.

'I think he will. I mean, he says he won't but that's what he said last year when he had to turn around,' she told MailOnline.

When the Nepalese government released this list, only 12 were dead and four were missing. The latest reports have the number of fatalities up to 13 but they have not disclosed who is the new fatality.

The Sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in Nepal's alpine region, and many make their living as climbing guides on Everest and other Himalayan peaks

Although
 relatively low on the mountain, climbers say the icefall is one of the 
most dangerous places on Mount Everest. There are, however, no safer 
paths along the famous South Col route scaled by Sir Edmund Hillary and 
Tenzing Norgay in 1953.

Around
 100 climbers and guides had already passed beyond the Khumbu Icefall to
 prepare their attempts on the summit. They are safe, but a new path 
will have to be made to make it possible to continue the expeditions.

The
 area is considered particularly dangerous due to its steep slope and 
deep crevasses that cut through the snow and ice covering the pass year 
round.

Sherpas often make 
20-25 round trips to carry kit and supplies to advanced camps, exposing 
them to greater risk. The most endangered are the so-called Icefall 
Doctors - a team that maintains and fixes the route.

Authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak

'It's
 always the most dangerous part of the mountain to climb, because the 
ice is constantly moving, there are so many crevasses and seracs where 
you need to use ladders and ropes to get through the very technical 
terrain,' Californian climber Adrian Ballinger, of Alpenglow 
Expeditions, told Reuters.

It was first major avalanche of this year's climbing season on Everest, which has been scaled by more than 4,000 climbers.

The
 Sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in Nepal's alpine 
region, and many make their living as climbing guides on Everest and 
other Himalayan peaks.

More
 than 4,000 climbers have summited Everest since 1953, when it was first
 conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. 
Hundreds have died trying.

The
 worst recorded disaster on Everest had been a fierce blizzard on May 
11, 1996, that caused the deaths of eight climbers, including famed 
mountaineer Rob Hall, and was later memorialized in a book, 'Into Thin 
Air,' by Jon Krakauer. Six Nepalese guides were killed in an avalanche 
in 1970.

Earlier this year,
 Nepal announced several steps to better manage the heavy flow of 
climbers and speed up rescue operations. The steps included the dispatch
 of officials and security personnel to the base camp at (5,300 meters) 
17,380 feet, where they will stay throughout the spring climbing season,
 which ends in May.
