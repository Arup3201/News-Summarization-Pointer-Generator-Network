Australians enjoying a cold beverage may begin to notice something very suspicious on their drink's label, thanks to a new dodgy knock-off which has infiltrated the market.

People have taken to social media after spotting a major typo on the ‘Montheith’s Crushed Apple Cider’ labels, with many questioning if the person responsible had a tipple while working and made the error.

It’s been revealed that an imitation product, deceivingly named ‘Monteeth’s Apple Flavour Cider’, is on shelves and is fooling many customers, as it sports an almost identical label to the original brand.

Confused consumers have taken to social media to ask 'Monteiths' why there appears to be a strange typo on the label of some of their bottles

The original product: The Monteith's label to which the 'Monteeth's' product bears a striking resemblance

The original brand have issued a notice online to alert their customers to the 'imposter' product. 

‘There have been some very cheeky Sydney-siders who have created a counterfeit version of our Monteith’s Crushed Apple Cider,’ a spokesperson for Monteith’s confirmed on Facebook.

‘While it’s perfectly safe to consume, the sketchy beverage is made with apple juice concentrate,’ they claimed.

The replica's major difference to the real product is that the counterfeit is only 'apple-flavoured' because of the use of cheaper ingredients.

Ahh! The sweet taste of a counterfeit 'apple flavour' cider on a Sunday afternoon

There have been a number of posts on social media from people who are noticing the subtle difference on their drink label.

‘Discovered this suss typo – is this the real deal guys?’ asked one dissatisfied customer.

‘Nothing like kicking back on a Sunday & realising your cider is a counterfeit version!’ remarked another.

Many were quick to point out that not only was the dodgy version missing the letter ‘i’, it was missing the freshness they were expecting, thanks to ‘Monteeths’ use of apple concentrate rather than New Zealand apples.

For this apple cider consumer, the strange taste of the knock-off product alerted them to the fake

For some it was odd taste of the beverage which first alerted them to the mishap.

‘I noticed the flavour was off and then I saw the typo on the label (I should really pay more attention to what I am drinking! Lol),’ posted another.

‘Has something gone wrong with the new labels?? Is this even a Monteith product?’ they continued.

‘Has someone gotten into the cider before work?’

Monteith’s have asked customers to be on the lookout in bottle shops and to alert the company via their Facebook page or website if anyone spots the suspicious products.
