With one small tweet designed to have maximum effect, Andy Murray showed in the early hours of this morning that continually he has the capacity to surprise.

Finally he has held true to what he said after winning Wimbledon, that he would have his say on Scottish independence, having spent the whole time in between making excuses for not doing so.

Some of us have wearied of listening to his various reasons: 'I can’t vote anyway'/'Who cares what I think'/'It isn’t going to happen anyway' have been among his methods of batting away inquiries on the subject.

Every hint he has dropped – and there have been plenty – suggested that he was a No sympathiser, reluctant to break his cover for fear of alienating some of his fellow Scots. And then he comes out on the actual day of the referendum to endorse the breaking up of the United Kingdom based, he says, on the negativity of the Unionist campaign of the past few days.

His intervention happens to come on the day that Great Britain were drawn against USA at home in the first round of the Davis Cup World Group next season.

Murray’s desire to see the end of Great Britain in its present form calls into question whether he will make himself available for the tie, even if the outcome of the referendum is, as most pollsters and bookmakers predict, a rejection of independence.

Among the many contradictions in all this is that Murray has rarely played better than when wrapping himself in the Union Flag. He has only ever lost two singles rubbers in the Davis Cup while he was brilliant in the London Olympics in being carried to the singles gold medal on a tide of patriotic support.

It was the summer of 2012 when his relationship with the wider British public became distinctly warmer. First there was the raw emotion he showed after losing the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer, and then there was his considerable part in the incomparable surge of national pride that accompanied London 2012.

Suddenly many people started to believe what they may have read or heard in the media that he is a far more personable fellow than his often surly demeanour on court or in set-piece interviews would suggest.

He was a willing part of the public relations effort around him to nurture this effect after the overblown reaction to some silly joshing about the England football team all the way back in 2006.

So it is hugely admirable from one angle to stand up for his principles and throw all that to the wind in a probably doomed attempt to help secure victory for Alex Salmond, with the resulting chill in public attitudes towards him.

Slightly confusing, too. Murray stated that his mind had been swayed in the last few days by the ‘negative’ campaigning of the No campaign, yet the one politician he has spoken of in glowing terms before is Gordon Brown.

On Wednesday Brown gave what was described as the most passionate speech of his career in defence of the Union, the centrepiece of the No side’s late push. Even political commentators who have spent years haranguing the former Prime Minister praised it as the most inspiring of his career, yet it seems to have swayed Britain’s tennis number one in the other direction.

His brother Jamie also endorsed the Yes cause on Thursday morning while mother Judy is of a similar persuasion, despite being Fed Cup Captain of the British team.

But it is the far more celebrated younger brother who now faces the collateral damage from suddenly making his views known. His representatives are currently negotiating a new clothing deal worth around £3 million per year whose value is unlikely to be enhanced by alienating so many, especially at a time when he is struggling to recapture previous form on the court. The GB ticket is a big selling point.

You wonder how anti-independence Standard Life or their thousands of employees – facing being moved south or losing their jobs in the event of a Yes vote – will feel about their company spending millions on sponsoring an athlete who supports that outcome.

Murray now finds himself a social media hero among the separatists, while in the infinitely more trivial world of British tennis there will be trepidation over whether, regardless of the referendum outcome, he will turn out for GB again in the sport’s premier team competition.
