Ringleader: Gordon Coe recruited four accomplices to dupe unsuspecting Brits out of at least £26,000 by pretending to be charity collectors

A gang of bogus charity collectors who stole at least £26,000 from thousands of generous Brits were today jailed for a total of more than nine years.

Ringleader Gordon Coe, Pauline Hunt, Susan Christians, husband and wife Kim and Ben Chapman duped unsuspecting donators by shaking fundraising tins for Marie Curie Cancer Care.

But instead of giving the cash to help needy cancer patients, they pocketed the money.

For three years the con artists toured pubs and clubs across the south of England with fake charity tins and ID badges and urged revellers to donate money.

Thousands of people dug deep in the belief they were helping pay for vital palliative care nurses for dying cancer patients.

Instead, it was a sickening scam to fund the group's lavish lifestyle, a court heard.

All but one of them lived off benefits, unable to work, but still flew off on holidays together in the Dominican Republic, Tenerife and Greece.

One of the money launderers themselves even admitted they were ‘the most evil b******* going’.

Prosecutor Nicholas Tucker estimated the fivesome, led by Coe, pocketed more than £26,000, based on 260 trips yielding an average £100 each. But more than £40,000 of unaccounted for money was also found in their bank accounts.

A judge today jailed them for at least a year each and Coe to four years, to deter others from ‘even thinking about such a scheme’.

She told police that the group was 'the most evil bastards going'

Judge Derwent Hope, Honorary Recorder of Southampton, said the gang had shown ‘little or no remorse’ for scamming a ‘wonderful charity’.

He said: ‘This is a shocking case of fraud in which the public and a charity have been abused.

‘No one will ever know the true loss to the Marie Curie fund.I am satisfied they are a wonderful charity who bring relief to terminally ill people and their families, while properly accounting what they receive from generous donors.

‘That is why at the heart of this case there has been a massive breach of trust from each one of you, not just to the members of the public you targeted in public houses but also the Marie Curie fund you defrauded.

‘I sentence you not only to punish you who have committed these crimes but also to deter anyone else from ever thinking of such a scheme.’

Southampton Crown Court heard Coe, a former pub landlord from Southampton, Hampshire, masterminded the cruel conspiracy in an ‘almost professional’ way, Judge Hope said.

Coe applied to become a Marie Curie fundraiser in November 2008, filling in the paperwork and supplied two referees to say he was an honest man.

One of these was family friend Chapman, 43, who later joined his money-grabbing team.

After passing the vetting process, Coe was sent charity T-shirts, a volunteer fundraiser ID card and a paying-in book to help him collect around the city.

A local Marie Curie fundraising manager visited Coe, now 65, to give him about 12 collection tins and lay down their strict regulations.

He was forbidden from recruiting others to help him or collecting from pub-to-pub, rules he brazenly ignored.

Coe, an amputee, then rounded up his four accomplices to raise money for ill-gotten gains. He gave them fake ID badges from the charity, tins with home-printed logos and even forged letters of gratitude from the area's fundraising manager.

After a night's collecting - travelling to Brighton and even London - the crew would return to Coe's flat to split the takings among themselves.

They collected so much that Christians bought herself a washing machine, paid for entirely in coins.

Coe took the bulk of the proceeds. Over three years, he put just £263 into the charity bank account, but deposited £31,348 into his own.

Coe pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and concealing financial transactions - a trawl of his bank accounts revealed unexplained cash deposits of £31,348 dating back to 2009. He was jailed for four years and 44 months, to be served concurrently.

Sentencing Coe, Judge Hope said: ‘You made out you were someone honest the charity could trust and they provided you with all manner of materials.

‘You almost totally abused that trust by providing them with a miniscule amount of the money you and your co-defendants took.

‘You recruited a team of collectors who took up matters enthusiastically in an extensive tour from Bristol to Brighton and even to London and the Home Counties to target public houses.’

Coe was in and out of hospital from September 2010 to July 2011, following a heart attack and the other four carried on collecting on their own, the court heard. 

Even after the game was up, the fraudsters claimed they took only £20 to £30 petrol money and other ‘expenses’ at the time.

Alarm bells first rang in January 2010, when a customer at a Southampton pub challenged Hunt, 55, as she asked for money with a battered charity tin, clutching a tatty ID badge.

The suspicious customer also rang Marie Curie with his suspicions and concerned charity bosses alerted Hampshire Police as they did not have a woman registered to collect in that area. Organisers also tried to get in touch with Coe, who did not answering their letters and calls.

In March, he eventually admitted he knew Hunt and had given her permission to empty tins on his behalf.

Police dropped the case as no crime had apparently been committed and the scam grew, with the gang convinced they had the perfect system.

Driver Chapman, an electrician, ferried his 45-year-old wife and Christians, 65, from pub to pub to ask for money.

Chapman, the only one with employment, 
told police he thought he was earning himself a 'gold star' by doing a 
good turn for society.

A search of his bank accounts found £445 in unexplained deposits. He was jailed for 15 months.

Detectives discovered £860 unaccounted for in his unemployed wife's bank accounts and she was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and converting criminal property. She was given 20 months jail on each count to be served concurrently.

Coe's first recruit, Hunt, had an unexplained £4,753 stashed away in her bank account and jurors found her guilty of converting criminal property. She was jailed for 12 months.

Christians, 65, of Dibden, in New Forest, had £4,454 in her bank that could not be accounted for.

She cracked under police interview and admitted what had happened, saying: ‘I know it's a nasty thing to do but I've done it, I've got to live with it' adding they were “the most evil bastards going”.’She was jailed for 18 months.

A Marie Curie Cancer Care spokesman said: ‘We would like to reassure people this type of incident is extremely rare.

‘We shouldn't let one bad apple give legitimate charity collectors a bad name.

‘The vast majority of collectors are trustworthy and dedicated and, as a charity, we couldn't raise the vital funds we need without them.

‘Generous donations enable Marie Curie Nurses to provide free care to people with terminal illnesses in their own homes and in the charity's hospices.’
