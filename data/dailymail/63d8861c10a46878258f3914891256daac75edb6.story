Divock Origi’s loan spell at Lille took a turn for the worst on Thursday night after he was booed by his own supporters.

The Liverpool striker, who signed for the Reds after an encouraging World Cup for Belgium in the summer, missed a penalty in the Europa League in a 3-0 defeat against Wolfsburg.

Costing Brendan Rodgers £10million, Origi’s year back at Lille was seen as a chance to hone consistency in front of goal.

It is 923 minutes since the striker has scored and the fans showed their anger as they booed him off the pitch

But the teenager has now gone a staggering 923 minutes without finding the net – his last goal coming against Wolfsburg at the beginning of October.

Games: 19

Goals: 4

Games since his last goal: 10

And enough was enough for French fans, who heckled Origi’s every touch after his penalty was saved by Diego Benaglio.

They are worrying signs for Rodgers, whose own front men have spectacularly failed so far this season.

Without Luis Suarez – sold to Barcelona – and missing the injured Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool have scored just 19 goals in the Premier League.

Mario Balotelli has failed to live up to expectations since arriving at Anfield for £16m this summer

By this stage last season Luis Suarez had 15 League goals. So far this term, it's a totally different story for Liverpool front men...

Mario Balotelli – two goals in 14 games

Rickie Lambert – two goals in 18 games

Daniel Sturridge – one goal in three games

In all competitions, it’s been 442 minutes since a Liverpool striker last scored for them (Lambert v Ludogorets) 

Last season's second top goalscorer Daniel Sturridge has been sidelined for a number of months after suffering an injury whilst on England duty in early September.

Since then he has not played a single minute for Liverpool, having been hit with another injury (thigh) that will keep him out until the New Year.

The 25-year-old formed a formidable partnership with Luis Suarez, scoring 21 Premier League goals for the Reds last term. 

Sturridge has featured for Rodgers' side just three times in the League this season, scoring once against Southampton on the opening day.

His replacements have not been much more prolific either. Controversial £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli has netted only twice in 14 shows for the Merseyside club. 

Manager Brendan Rodgers has backed his decision to take a gamble on 24-year-old striker Balotelli

In addition, the former AC Milan striker regularly attracts the spotlight for his behaviour off the pitch, as well as on it.

With former Italy manager Giovanni Trapattoni saying on Thursday that the 24-year-old is wasting his career, he will be hoping to improve on his poor start to life in Liverpool as he returns from a groin injury to face Manchester United on Sunday.

Also on the list of misfiring forwards at the Anfield club is Rickie Lambert, who joined his hometown club in the summer.

Dream move it may have been, but the former Southampton man has an even worse record in front of goal than that of fellow strike partner Balotelli - just two in 18 games.

To make matters worse, manager Brendan Rodgers hauled him off at half time as Liverpool were eliminated form the Champions League after their 1-1 draw with Basle.
