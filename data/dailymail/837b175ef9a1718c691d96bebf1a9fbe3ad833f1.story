Louis van Gaal's first season with Manchester United is in danger of turning into a complete mess following the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal.

The Dutchman has enjoyed a stellar career but there are signs that he has yet to grasp the demands of the Barclays Premier League and his decisions have left United facing a huge fight to salvage some respectability. 

Here Sportsmail looks at some of the mistakes that Van Gaal has made.

Why sell Welbeck?

There was an inevitability the England striker would return to haunt Van Gaal. United's manager may have been happy to sanction that deal to Arsenal last summer but, in many ways, it was a mistake and shows the shifting values of United. 

Why did they allow a young English player whose best days are ahead of him to leave and replace him with someone on an extreme salary who was recovering from injury? United as a club develop players. 

Van Gaal prides himself on working with young talent, so keeping Welbeck should have made sense. The 'Galactico' policy they are pushing doesn't suit them. It caused shock against Arsenal that Falcao was overlooked when United were losing but has the Colombian really done anything to justify being at Old Trafford? 

Van Gaal's mistake was letting Welbeck leave and bringing in a player who wasn't guaranteed to suit English football.

Messing up in Milton Keynes

So much has happened during this season you could almost forget about the events of Tuesday, August 26. However, Van Gaal made an error that night by selecting a weak team to take on MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

With no European commitments, Van Gaal should have gone full strength to give United a chance of competing for silverware. Instead, he selected six players who are no longer at the club and that 4-0 capitulation increased scrutiny at an early stage.

No coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but that is what United did against League One opponents. Tumbling out of the FA Cup means this will be the first time since 1989 that United have gone two years without a trophy.

Not playing to Wayne Rooney's strengths

As Roy Keane observed after the Arsenal defeat, Rooney is 'as good as anyone' when he is deployed in a central striking role. 

To prove that, he has scored three goals in his last three games and is the one United outfield player who you would genuinely call world-class. 

But Van Gaal has muddied the picture by playing him deep at times and not utilising his talents. That has had a detrimental effect on results.

Rooney, remember, had a spell not long ago when he went nine matches without scoring.

What has happened to that style?

Keane made another pertinent observation when he said it is 'time to stop looking back at what United had before'.

They will not progress as a club if they keep harking back to the good old days of Sir Alex Ferguson. What United have lost, though, is the identity of how they play.

At their best, you associate United teams as being fast, dynamic and fearless, always prepared to take risks and stay on the front foot. 

Has Van Gaal presided over a performance this season that has been universally lauded for attractive football? No. It says everything about them that against Arsenal they finished off hoisting long-balls to Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling.

United have lacked a good style since Van Gaal took charge during the summer after the World Cup

Firing it up to Fellaini

Fellaini is a good player and he has made a contribution for Van Gaal this season but his continued presence in the team is now proving a hindrance.

Liverpool had the issue when Andy Carroll played for them in that it became too easy to smash a ball up to the big presence at the top of the field and United are falling in to that trap. 

Van Gaal is a coach whose teams historically play attractive football but Fellaini is making United a more primitive outfit.

How do you solve a problem like (Di) Maria?

Picture Angel di Maria in your mind and what do you see? It will probably be of a flying winger hurtling down a flank, the ball stuck to his foot like glue and a defender spinning and swerving to try and cut out the danger. 

Go back to last season's Champions League final and you will see countless examples. 

How many times have you see Di Maria do that in a Red shirt? Van Gaal talks of philosophies and systems but doesn't it just make sense to play players in their best positions? 

Di Maria looked majestic early on in his United career. Lately he looks to be confused by what Van Gaal wants.

Changing the formation

Football should, essentially, be a simple game but Van Gaal's tactics can be confusing and nothing shows that up more than whether he is playing three defenders or four. 

United pass the ball around at the back without really having a purpose and they now have a habit of getting themselves into a panic, as shown by the mistakes that led to Welbeck's goal. It says everything that United's fans sang '4-4-2!' when they played Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. 

Van Gaal's ego meant he was always going to be single-minded in his approach to this job but maybe he has underestimated how true United fans are to traditions. 

Ripping up a blueprint that had been successful for a quarter of a century has not had the desired effect. United are now too cautious and have lost their speed and threat. It also means they are losing their formidable reputation, too.
