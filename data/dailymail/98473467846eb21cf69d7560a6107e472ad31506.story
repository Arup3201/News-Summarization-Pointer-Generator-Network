A Miami park ranger was shocked to discover that an injured chicken that was almost dead when she rescued him last week was later found to have a number of bizarre items sewn into his flesh.

Items found inside the bird include what appears to be human hair, several drawings of skulls, and a photo of three seemingly happy youngsters.

The ranger – who hasn’t been named – believes the items may be ‘religious artifacts’ and that the animal have been used for a ritual related to the Santeria faith, which is practiced in the Miami area by some people of Cuban decent.

Trouper the chicken was found by a Miami park ranger wondering alone and close to death, it was later discovered that the bird had a number of bizarre items sewn into his flesh including this family photo

The ranger was on patrol at Larry & Penny Thompson Park in South Miami-Dade when the young chick walked toward her, she told Miami New Times.

The ranger offered the chick some food and upon inspecting him, she noticed that he was injured along his keel bone on his chest. 

She initially didn’t think that he would make it through the night, but she cleaned his wound and gave him some medication.

For the next three days she put the chicken on a course of dewormer, followed by several days of bird biotic.

When the bird was recused he was close to death, but after a series of meds plus regular feeding means that Trouper is now in good health

With each passing day the bird, who has been named Trouper, looked progressively better and was eating well. After several days and with the bird’s swelling having gone down she decided to give his injuries a closer look.

‘There were two-three round open marks on either side of the keel bone plus an odd injury right at the top point of the keel bone. It looked as though the keel bone was protruding out of the chest,’ she said.

It was then that she noticed that the injuries had been created by someone sewing what she has described as ‘religious artifacts’ into the poor bird’s skin.

The artifacts have been removed and the animal’s health has improved, but the question remains: Why would someone cut open a live chicken and sew a family photo inside?

There is some speculation that the items could have been placed inside the chicken as part of a ritual to help someone who wants their family members to join them in the U.S.

In the reader’s comments section of the Miami New Times' article some have speculated that it could be a ritual carried out by someone who wants their family members who join them in the U.S.

It isn’t uncommon for the slaughtered bodies of animals used in Santeria rituals – commonly chicken and goats – to be found in the Miami area.

Santeria blends Roman Catholicism with ancient West African traditions. Animal sacrifice for religious ceremony is not legal in Florida.
