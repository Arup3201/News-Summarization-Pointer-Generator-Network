A jealous boyfriend beat his 25-year-old girlfriend with a brick, bit her nose and threw a knife at her face because she wanted to go out without him, a court heard.

Kieron Hardy, 22, subjected Tammy Armstrong to a shocking 90-minute ordeal in Newcastle-upon- Tyne on Valentine’s Day - tearing off her dress, biting her eyebrow and throwing a laptop at her.

Mother Miss Armstrong managed to escape by clambering through a kitchen window, but Hardy followed her, picked up a brick and threw it at her head as she cowered on the ground.

Now Hardy, who also stabbed Miss Armstrong’s friend in the stomach on Christmas Day, has been jailed for seven years. After the hearing, Miss Armstrong said she feared she would die in the attack.

She said: ‘If I hadn’t got away I think he would have killed me. The blood was pouring out of my lip. He said he was going to kill me and I thought he would. I really thought I would be dead.

‘He bit my nose and tried to bite my eyebrow off. He said "if I can’t have you no one will". If that’s what he does to someone he’s supposed to love, I dread to think what he would do to someone he hates.’

Hardy’s crime career began at 13 when he and a notorious group of young men known as the ‘Scotswood Hoodies’ brought terror to the streets of the Scotswood area of Newcastle.

He has been in and out of prison most of his adult life and Miss Armstrong was aware of his reputation. But despite his criminal record, he had not been convicted of violence against a partner.

She said: ‘I knew what he had done in the past but I had never known him to hit women. I wouldn’t have got involved if I had. He was lovely when we first got together and it got serious quite quickly.

‘He said he wanted to settle down and have bairns. I never thought he would hurt me.’  But he went on a horrific campaign of violence when she told him she wanted to go to a rave on February 14.

Scary: Miss Armstrong managed to escape by clambering through a kitchen window, but Hardy followed her, picked up a brick and threw it at her

He was on a court curfew and was 
wearing an electronic tag, meaning he could not join her, and became 
furious - ripping off her dress and leaving her standing in 
her underwear.

He
 then lunged at her and bit her left eyebrow, causing it to bleed. Miss 
Armstrong ran to the kitchen to try to escape but the door was locked 
and Hardy followed her, shouting.

He then picked up an 8in knife and threw it at her from about 7ft. The blade hit her in the upper lip and she fell to the floor.

She ran into the living room but was followed by Hardy, who threw a plastic bottle, a laptop and music decks at her, backing her into a corner.

Newcastle Crown Court heard he then bit the end of her nose and also sank his teeth into her arm. He then said: ‘Oh God, look what I’ve done to you’.

When he went upstairs, she took her chance to get out through the kitchen window, and tried to raise the alarm with a neighbour. But Hardy saw her and followed her out, grabbing her by the hair and pulling it. He picked up a brick and threw it at her, hitting her behind the ear.

Miss Armstrong was left with cuts to her head, eyebrow, cheek and arm and bruising to her legs, ribcage, arm and other areas of her body.

She also lost a tooth, is scarred for life and is being assessed for nerve damage to her lip.

Miss Armstrong said: ‘I was locked in the house for about an hour and a half. At first I wasn’t that scared, I just thought he didn’t want me to go out. But then he punched me all over and ripped my dress off my back.

'Then he came back with a massive kitchen knife. When I saw the knife I knew what he was going to do. And then I got really scared. I just couldn’t believe it was happening. I still don’t believe it now. All I was thinking about was my kids. It didn’t feel real.’

After seeing him sentenced, Miss Armstrong is struggling to believe how she stayed with Hardy.

She said: ‘He kept saying sorry and I believed him. I thought things would get better. But I think he was like a ticking time bomb.

‘He said I was his first proper girlfriend and I don’t think he had ever been out of jail long enough to have a proper relationship. He always wanted to know where I was and what I was doing.’

Hardy had already attacked Miss Armstrong’s friend Caitlin Crawford last Christmas, when he stabbed her in the stomach with a screwdriver. Hardy, who has 49 previous convictions, admitted wounding with intent on Miss Armstrong and assault on Miss Crawford.

Jailing him, Judge Paul Sloan QC said pictures of Miss Armstrong’s injuries made ‘horrific viewing’. Paul Caulfield, defending, said he was ashamed and embarrassed.
