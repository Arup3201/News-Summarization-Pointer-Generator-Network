She may star in campaigns for some of the most high-profile designers in the industry, but that hasn't stopped Suki Waterhouse pushing her creative boundaries.

The 22-year-old Burberry model appears as the face of a range of unisex T-shirts featuring X-rated graphics of naked bodies in compromising positions.

The explicit tops which 'push the last taboos of sex' come from new fashion label True Love, the brainchild of independent magazine Prowl.

Suki, who is dating Hollywood actor Bradley Cooper, even art directed and edited the photo shoot.

The Londoner wears items - coming in at £25 each - with provocative names such as Serpent B***, Sexy Lips and Lady Finger.

The illustrations were all created by Jacob Escott, art director of the London-based magazine.

Suki's relationship with the magazine stems from its inception last year. The model was a huge fan of the poetry of Lisa Luxx, who is Prowl's so-called 'preditor in chief'.

Suki then approached Lisa and asked to be part of its pilot issue, subsequently becoming the publication's main backer.

She has been involved in Prowl's creative projects from the beginning, including performances at events and contributing with a regular photo column featuring her private imagery.

Soon after, umbrella company Prowl House, 'a creative network which celebrates the art of being human', decided to launch the True Love T-shirt line.

Suki - who has established design credentials with a capsule collection of trainers for Superga - was then made creative director of the new collection.

'[The True Love collection is] all about pushing the last taboos of sex into the public sphere, because as we say in the Indigo Kids issue of PROWL magazine, being flippant about these things totally levels the playing field,' say Prowl.

'Suki loves what Prowl represents because it gives fresh talent an uncensored international platform to celebrate their creativity,' a spokesperson for the magazine told the Telegraph.

'Basically, it means that unestablished artists can get print coverage without having to adhere to regular industry rules.'
