Detour: Carlos Guzman is accused of keeping a 12-year-old school girl captive for 20 minutes inside his school bus and trying to sexually assault her

A 44-year-old Houston bus driver has been arrested after allegedly holding a 12-year-old girl against her will aboard the bus and making sexual advances.

Court documents state that Carlos Guzman also planned his assault on the girl on May 5 and placed tape on the lenses of the front and rear bus cameras to obscure their view.

He is accused of not stopping for his alleged victim when she asked, pulling over and then trying to touch and rub the girl's leg.

Guzman reportedly hugged the girl and kissed her on the neck before she could push him away.

According to police the girl managed to block Guzman's advances with her violin and backpack.

Guzman allegedly told her he 'really liked her' and also said, 'I know you're only 12 but we could be together.'

The girl told police that she missed her normal stop in her way home from school and intended to get off at her friend's stop.

However, she apparently changed her mind and as Guzman continued on and refused to take her home she became concerned.

He allegedly told the girl, 'I came the wrong way, and don't want to get in trouble.'

According to police he finally took her home after being parked for 20 minutes and told her not to tell anyone.

She phoned the police immediately on getting home and his neighbors claimed to be in disbelief.

'I’ve known him for a long time. I’ve never seen any indication that he had any kind of problems like that,' said Lonna Holder to KHOU.

'There’s kids in the neighborhood, and I have a granddaughter. It is disturbing.'

Guzman is in the Harris County Jail on a felony charge of unlawful restraint. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office says more charges could be coming.

Alief ISD told KHOU Guzman was fired as soon as the allegations were made.
