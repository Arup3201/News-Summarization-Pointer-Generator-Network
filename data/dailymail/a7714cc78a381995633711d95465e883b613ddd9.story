The differing standards of hotel accommodation allocated to the BBC World Cup pundits in Rio isn’t going to help build much team spirit among the all-star cast.

Clarence Seedorf is staying in the grandest of Rio’s hotels, the Copacabana Palace, along with FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the FIFA ExCo, while Thierry Henry and his personal trainer, plus Rio Ferdinand, are in the equally plush Sofitel on Copacabana.

Meanwhile Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Alan Hansen, despite being the mainstay of the BBC’s domestic coverage on Match of the Day, are in a very modest hotel nearby, along with the rest of the Beeb’s football foot soldiers.

Disparity: Seedorf and Henry (left) are in luxury while other BBC pundits stay in more modest surroundings

Seedorf is said to be paying for his own accommodation, while Henry is footing the bill for the trainer keeping him fit for his Major League Soccer return. But Ferdinand and Henry being given a higher standard of hotel than the rest was part of their contractual agreement.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are staying in a very competitively priced hotel close to our production base, as befits a frugal BBC.

‘There is no problem among the talent and we have the best team spirit I can remember at a major tournament.’

Mind you, England said the same and look what happened to them.

David Moyes has recovered sufficiently from the trauma of losing his job at Manchester United after less than a season to take a pundit role for part of the World Cup.

Return: Moyes will join Richard Keys and Andy Gray as a pundit for BeIn Sports in Doha for one week

But Moyes, who turned down advances from the BBC and ITV earlier in the year because he was concerned about a backlash from United fans, has chosen to go to Doha rather than Rio.

He will be a studio analyst for BeIn Sport for a week, even if it means having to work with Richard Keys and Andy Gray.

A spat broke out between the BBC’s Dan Roan and Sky’s Nick Collins as to who should ask the first question in Roy Hodgson’s final broadcast media conference in Rio.

It was Roan’s turn in the rotation agreement with ITV and Sky, but Collins argued he had never had that opportunity when Hodgson was in the chair.

After 20 minutes of wrangling they agreed to toss a coin, but before that happened Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard came into the room.

Roan and Collins both put up a hand for the microphone and the FA chose Sky to go first.

Lucky Everton manager Roberto Martinez has kept his media roles at the World Cup despite Sports Agenda revealing his accreditation pass was withdrawn by FIFA after he blatantly broke the strict non-transferable rule by giving it to someone else to gain entry to Holland training. 

American TV network ESPN, who have Martinez as one of their pundits, say he will be working from their production studios in Rio for which he only needs an ESPN pass to gain entry. 

The Times said Martinez would continue as one of their columnists.

Dein shows FA the way 

The England party will be retreating en masse from Brazil tonight with none of Roy Hodgson’s coaching staff staying on at the tournament to see what they might learn.

Their brief stay in Brazil contrasts with that of former FA vice-chairman David Dein, who will be watching his 13th game of the World Cup when England take on Costa Rica and intends to see 25 games in all.

Dein, spotted boarding a private jet at Sao Paulo, is wealthy enough to have fast planes at his disposal taking him from game to game. 

But surely the FA should have found an administrator keen enough on football to embrace the World Cup in the same way.

Such a figure would have been far more useful in their delegation than the blazers who were just here for a jolly.

Leighton Baines, who has replaced Ashley Cole as England’s left back, might end up doing the same at Chelsea.

Replacement: Baines (lef) has taken Cole's place for England, and Mourinho wants him at Chelsea as well

Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho has made it clear on his summer travels that he has Baines on his radar, although that was before the Everton defender had a nightmare World Cup, especially in the opening defeat by Italy.
