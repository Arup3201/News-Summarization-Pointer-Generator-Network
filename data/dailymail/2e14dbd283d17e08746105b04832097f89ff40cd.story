Electronic signs are to be put up on motorways to expose service stations trying to rip off motorists with inflated charges.

They are part of a package of measures unveiled by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today to reduce the cost of motoring.

They include freezing the MoT test fee for a car at £54.85 until 2015,  and a review of the cost of taking a driving test and applying for a provisional licence.

Eye-catching: Signs will be installed on motorways detailing the exact cost of petrol and diesel at different service stations on the route

In the most eye-catching move, high-tech signs will be installed on motorways detailing the exact cost of petrol and diesel at different service stations on the route.

Ministers hope it will highlight the sums being charged by some garages that believe they have a ‘captive market’, and encourage them to compete for custom.

A recent investigation by the Office of Fair Trading found that petrol at motorway service stations costs an average of 7.5p more per litre and diesel 8.3p more than at other garages.

AA president Edmund King welcomed the new motorway signs, which will be trialled from next year, using wi-fi technology to update the cost of petrol on the route.

Mr King said: ‘Motorists in the UK often think they are treated as a cash cow and these proposals go some way to help keep down the costs.’

There will also be an attempt to end fraudulent whiplash claims by forcing motorists to have their injury confirmed by a panel of independent medical experts.

MPs have blamed the compensation culture driven by supposed whiplash injuries for driving up the cost of motor insurance premiums.

Mr Grayling’s department, the Ministry of Justice, has introduced a string of measures to try to crack down on the number of claims.

Lawyers can no longer double their fees if they win, at the expense of defendants and their insurers.

Ministers have banned ‘referral fees’ among lawyers, insurers, claims firms and garages for profitable cases.

They have also reduced the fees lawyers can charge insurers for processing basic claims for compensation for minor injuries suffered in road accidents from £1,200 to £500.

The AA says motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994, dropping by 12.3 per cent in the year to October for an average comprehensive policy, from £648 to £568.

The Ministry of Justice says the number of claims firms in the market has also fallen since the law changes, from a peak of 2,553 in December 2011 to 1,485 last month.

The ministry said that despite these successes, whiplash claims remained an issue that the Government would continue to fight.

Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said today’s announcements ‘will be cold comfort for motorists being squeezed on the road and at home’.

She added: ‘Prices have gone up faster than wages in 39 of the 40 months [David Cameron] has been Prime Minister and working people are almost £1,500 a year worse off.’
