A Boeing 737 that skidded off the runway and ran onto the grass as it landed was travelling at twice the speed it should have been, an investigation has revealed.

An inquiry into the botched landing found the pilot was rushing to clear the runway to make space for the next aircraft.

The 137 passengers on board were thrown from their seats and the plane's tyres and wheels were damaged in the landing at Birmingham airport.

Speed: The pilot leans out of the window of the stranded Boeing 737 that ran onto the grass beside the runway. An investigation has found the aircraft broke recommended speed limits

The plane was moving at 23mph when it landed last September. The recommended guideline is 11mph when taxiing on a runway.

An Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report has concluded that the plane’s pilot was rushing to make way for another aircraft that was travelling behind.

Flights
were suspended for two hours after the incident as a bus was sent 
to retrieve passengers and six crew members who were stranded on the 
plane.

Despite the chaos 
there were no injuries among the passengers on the Monarch Airlines 
flight, which was returning from Nice in France.

The
report stated: 'Initially the aircraft responded as expected but as the
turn progressed the aircraft became uncontrollable and started to skid 
towards the edge of the taxiway.

'The commander applied the brake pedals fully but the aircraft departed the taxiway onto adjacent grass and stopped.' 

Hurry: A report said the pilot landed at a greater speed because he was rushing to clear the runway for the plane behind him. The plane's wheels, pictured, were damaged in the incident

Problems: The same plane left 150 people stranded in Tenerife last year after one of its doors broke

The same plane, which was operated by Lithuanian firm Aurela Airlines, left 150 people stranded in Tenerife in August last year- after one of its doors broke.

Russell Ison, a spokesman from Monarch, said: 'Monarch terminated the contract with Air Aurela immediately after the incident at Birmingham Airport.

Speaking at the time of the incident, passenger Tim Witcherley said there had been a problem with the aircraft when it took off in Nice.

He said: 'When we were being taxied on the runway, the plane turned and there was a juddering noise, as if the brakes had locked up, like you get on a car.

'Then it took off and we had an uneventful journey until we got back to Birmingham.

'Again, it was when we turned right that the same juddering started, the plane tilted and we ended up on the grass.'

Another added: 'I found it terrifying, I don’t like flying at all, at one point I thought we were going to die.

'As soon as we hit the grass I thought were were going through the fence.'
