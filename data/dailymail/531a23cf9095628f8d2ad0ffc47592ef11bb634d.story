Arthur Hutchinson was sentenced to life for the murders of Basil Laitner, his wife Avril and their 28-year-old son Richard

Locking up Britain’s most evil criminals until they die does not breach their human rights, European judges ruled yesterday.

In a major victory for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Strasbourg backed ‘whole life’ prison sentences for horrific murders and other heinous crimes.

The European Court of Human Rights dismissed an appeal by a notorious triple killer against his ‘life means life’ tariff.

Arthur Hutchinson, 74, stabbed a bride’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and repeatedly raped a teenage house guest in a frenzied attack in October 1983.

The ruling means notorious prisoners, including Moors murderer Ian Brady and Mark Bridger, the paedophile killer of five-year-old April Jones, can be kept behind bars indefinitely.

After the decision, Mr Grayling said: ‘Those who commit the most heinous crimes deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison.

‘That is what the public want, and it is right that judges will continue to be able to hand down whole life orders to the very worst offenders.’

The ruling was a significant retreat for the European court’s grand chamber, which in July 2013 ruled that whole life terms were ‘inhuman and degrading’ and should be reviewed after 25 years.

It had claimed the lack of a proper review and hence the lack of hope, however remote, of eventual release was a major breach of prisoners’ human rights.

But Britain’s Court of Appeal said last February that the European court was wrong and ruled killers could potentially be released at the discretion of the Justice Secretary if ‘exceptional grounds’ existed, for example if they were terminally ill.

Yesterday, the Strasbourg-based court agreed and threw out Hutchinson’s appeal – ruling that his whole-life sentence did not violate the European Convention on Human Rights. It said Britain had ‘specifically addressed’ the issue and that the legal situation was ‘in line with human rights laws’.

The ruling is a further sign that the European courts are stepping back from interfering in British laws. It is also an important boost for the Conservative Party in the run-up to May’s General Election. 

Stinging criticism by MPs and ministers of meddling by Strasbourg appeared to have had some influence on the latest ruling, which may stem a drift of voters to Ukip.

European judges who strayed beyond their original brief were cited by the Tories in proposals published last year to claw back sovereignty and scrap the Human Rights Act in favour of a British bill of rights.

Dominic Raab, a Tory MP campaigning for reform of human rights legislation, said: ‘It’s welcome that this Government stood firm and Strasbourg has performed a U-turn.

‘But it also highlights the intensely political instincts of a court that meddles when it thinks it can get away with it. That’s why we need Conservative reforms of our relationship with Strasbourg, to safeguard the democratic right of our Supreme Court to have the last word on British justice.’

Last week Strasbourg judges agreed it was lawful to extradite to the US a terror suspect accused of being Abu Hamza’s trusted sidekick. And last August they saved British taxpayers millions by saying prisoners barred from voting should not get compensation. 

Frenzied attack: Arthur Hutchinson

Arthur Hutchinson carried out the bloody slaughter of Basil Laitner’s family at their home in October 1983.

The 59-year-old solicitor, his wife Avril, 55, and son Richard, 28, were all murdered on the day they spent celebrating the wedding of daughter Suzanne.

Armed with an eight-inch bowie knife, Hutchinson – nicknamed ‘The Fox’ – broke into the wealthy family’s home in Sheffield to carry out the killings.

He then grabbed hold of an 18-year-old woman who was staying at the house, forced her to walk through a pool of blood, took her to a marquee in the grounds and raped her.

Hutchinson was captured after weeks on the run and convicted thanks to the rape victim’s testimony and a wealth of forensic evidence, including his palm print on a bottle of wedding champagne. The judge in his 1984 trial at Sheffield Crown Court said he should serve 18 years but Home Secretary Leon Brittan later ruled he should face a whole life tariff.

Before the latest ruling ministers had been forced to consider scrapping ‘life means life’ sentences completely.

Instead of being told they must die in prison, it was thought offenders could be given an American-style jail sentence of up to 100 years that would have been subject to review.

Fifty-five inmates in England and Wales are serving whole life tariffs, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Rosemary West and one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan.

The longest serving whole life prisoner is Ian Brady, who committed the Moors Murders between 1963 and 1965. He is 76.
