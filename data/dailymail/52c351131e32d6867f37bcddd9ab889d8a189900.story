Government services across the US may have all but ground to a halt, but there is one that remains open for business as usual: the Presidential paradise of Camp David.

The woodland retreat has stayed immune to the shutdown because it falls under the aegis of the Department of Defence, whose staff are designated as active-duty military personnel.

More than 250 chefs, gardeners, electricians and anybody else who keeps the camp running in Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County, Maryland, should the President drop by are not only still working, but are also getting paid, according to website TMZ.

Meanwhile, almost a million federal workers across the nation are sitting at home wondering when their next paycheck will drop through the letterbox as they wait for a resolution to the long-running dispute.

But their situation showed little sign of improving today as lawmakers consumed day three of the shutdown with a stalling game revealing no end in sight until the next crisis hits Washington around October 17.

Meanwhile, in a speech at a Maryland 
construction company yesterday, Obama challenged Republicans to 'stop 
this farce' by allowing a straight vote on a spending bill. He 
reiterated he will not negotiate on the spending bill or the debt 
ceiling.

Danger: The situation gives 'every appearance of getting dangerously close to the conversation on the debt ceiling,' Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader of the House of Representatives

Obama said 
there were enough Republicans willing to pass a spending bill 
immediately if House Speaker John Boehner would allow a vote on a bill 
without partisan conditions attached, a so-called clean vote.

But Obama 
said the speaker was refusing to do so because 'he doesn't want to anger
the extremists in his party.'

The 180-acre compound has been a home from home for US presidents to relax in since  Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it in 1942 and renamed it 'Shangri-La', after the fictional Himalayan paradise.

It was renamed Camp David by Dwight D. Eisenhower, in honor of his father and grandson, both named David.

It has a swimming pool, tennis courts, a skeet range, a bathhouse, a bowling alley, a horseshoe pit and many cabins for the president's guests.

Camp David is not open to the general public. Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on its official park maps due to privacy and security concerns.

'My simple message today is 'Call a vote,'Obama said. 'Take a vote. Stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now.'

Congress
must raise the nation's borrowing authority or risk default by October 
17, and members of Congress now expect it to be the flashpoint for a 
larger clash over the U.S. budget as well as President Barack Obama's 
healthcare law.

The 
situation gives 'every appearance of getting dangerously close to the 
conversation on the debt ceiling,' Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority
Leader of the House of Representatives.

In fact, she said, 'we're in the conversation on the debt ceiling.'

At
the same time, hopes that the debt ceiling fight could be resolved 
without a catastrophe were raised by reports in The New York Times and 
Washington Post that House Speaker John Boehner told other lawmakers he 
would work to avoid default, even if it meant relying on the votes of 
Democrats, as he did in August of 2011.

A
spokesman for Boehner would neither confirm nor deny the reports, 
restating previous public statements by the Speaker that 'the United 
States will not default on its debt.'

Senator Charles Schumer, the 
second-ranking Senate Democrat, reacting to the reports, said, 'This 
could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough.'

The
New York senator added, 'Even coming close to the edge of default is 
very dangerous,' as he urged quick passage of legislation to raise the 
$16.7 trillion cap on borrowing.

There was little action along with 
the talk on Thursday. The Republican-controlled House continued what has
become a long process of voting to fund publicly popular federal 
agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service 
and the National Institutes of Health - that are now partially closed.

Republicans
know that neither the Democratic-controlled Senate or President Barack 
Obama will go along with such an approach, but it allows them to accuse 
Democrats of working against the interests of veterans, National Parks 
and cancer patients.

Up to one million U.S. federal workers have been on furloughs without pay since Tuesday morning.

All military personnel continued in a normal duty status but a large number of civilian employees may be temporarily furloughed.

The employees who have been put on unpaid leave are those classified as excepted workers, meaning that the president's staff of 1,265 at the White House will dwindle to 436.

Staff at National Parks and museums across the country were stopped from coming to work, closing those sites to the public.

Both domestic and international air travel  remained relatively unchanged as air traffic controllers will be kept at their posts and TSA agents will continue security checks. One problem may arise as the State

Department will be understaffed, meaning that while it will not stop processing passport applications.

Federal courts remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the federal judiciary will need to provide more guidance.

Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national food security, have stayed on the job.

House Republicans on Thursday began queuing up 11 more bills to fund targeted programs.

They
are to fund nutrition programs for low-income women and their children,
a program to secure nuclear weapons and non-proliferation, food and 
drug safety, intelligence-gathering, border patrols, American Indian and
Alaska Native health and education programs, weather monitoring, Head 
Start school programs for the poor and other aid for schools that rely 
heavily on federal assistance.

Disaster assistance also is slated 
for temporary renewal under the House measures, as well as a bill to 
provide retroactive pay to federal workers during the government 
shutdown.

'We're trying
to see if we can get the Senate and the president to start talking to 
us, on anything. They're just not talking to us,' said Republican 
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, explaining the tactic.

The
bills are likely to be debated on the House floor over coming days, not
all at once. Democrats have rejected the piecemeal approach and Obama 
has said he will veto the measures.

Work
in Congress was interrupted on Thursday afternoon when the U.S. Capitol
was locked down briefly due to gunshots fired outside the building. One
female suspect was shot dead after a brief car chase across downtown 
Washington. Police said it appeared to be an isolated incident.

The
security alert halted work in both the House and the Senate and briefly
diverted attention from the shutdown that took effect at midnight on 
Monday, leaving nearly a million federal workers sidelined without pay 
and many others in the private sector suffering from the knock-on 
effect.

The Capitol 
Police who responded to the incident are working without pay due to the 
shutdown - they are deemed essential so remain on the job, but their pay
is frozen.

In his 
speech earlier, Obama warned that as painful as the government shutdown 
was, a default caused by a failure to raise the debt limit would be 
dramatically worse for the economy.

Though some moderate Republicans have begun to question their party's strategy, Boehner so far has kept them largely united with the small bills to re-open national parks, restore health research and other parts of the government most visibly affected by the shutdown.

The Tea Party Express, one of the anti-tax groups in the conservative Tea Party that has led the fight against Obamacare, sent an email to supporters on Wednesday evening saying that as many as 12 Republicans had indicated they were willing to "give up on the fight" and join Democrats in voting for a funding bill without conditions.

'We need your immediate support to put pressure on the weak Republicans to pass a sensible solution that allows America to avoid the Obamacare train-wreck, while fully funding the federal government,' the group said in its email.
