After Google accidentally leaked shots of a new handset last month, images of its rumoured Nexus 5 phone have now made a brief appearance on the firm's official Play store.

The new handset was shown alongside Google's current Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 models with a price tag of $349.

Product shots discovered by fan site Android Police confirm the device will be called Nexus 5, hinted at how Android's new operating system KitKat will look, and showed an updated camera.

Google teamed up with Nestle last month to launch the next version of its Android operating system, called Android 4.4 KitKat.

There had been speculation that the latest version would be named Android Key Lime Pie because each release begins with the letter of the alphabet that follows the previous.

To mark the announcement, the KitKat homepage was redesigned as a parody of Google software releases.

The images and brief details were only visible for a short time before being taken down, but websites including The Next Web managed to take screenshots.

The device was shown alongside Google's Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 devices.

This leak is the latest in a line of leaks that have dogged the new handset.

A mysterious device that some believed was the new Nexus handset, was spotted in a promotional video 
for Google's new KitKat Android 4.4 operating system last month.

In the video, a Google employee can be
 seen snapping the proceedings using a phone with a Google Nexus and LG 
logo on it.

The employee in the video taking 
photos of the huge Android 'bug droid' composed of giant KitKats is 
holding a device that features a horizontal logo, similar to that seen 
on the new Nexus 7 tablet.

However,
 it also features a large camera lens and matte finish, which has not 
been seen on any similar Google devices before.

This new camera lens was also seen on the latest product shots.

Like the Play store images, the video was taken down after rumours began circulating online.

The images and brief details were only visible for a short time before being taken down, but websites including The Next Web managed to take screenshots, pictured. The device was shown alongside Google's Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 devices, with a price tag of $349

Last week, Italian website Tutto Android leaked supposed images of the device's screen and rear casing.

It
 is thought Google may be gearing up to announce its next flagship 
device as early as next month -  a year after the Nexus 4 was released.

The prices shown on the Play store for the Nexus 5 match what the Nexus 4 was sold at from launch.

In August, Google slashed the price of the Nexus 4 from £239 for the 8GB down to £159, adding fuel to the predictions a new handset is on its way.

The Nexus 5 would form part of Google's existing Nexus range that also includes the new Nexus 7 tablet, built by Asus.

It launched in July and has a seven-inch, 1980 x 1200 display that offers almost double the pixels per inch than the iPad mini despite being around £100 cheaper than Apple's £269 tablet.

It also has a 5MP rear-facing camera for the first time, and a faster 1.5Ghz processor compared to the first-generation Nexus 7 device and was the first gadget to be shipped on Google's Jelly Bean operating system, Android 4.3.
