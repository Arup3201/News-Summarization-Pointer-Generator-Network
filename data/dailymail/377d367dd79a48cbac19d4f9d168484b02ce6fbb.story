A teenager has died after a fire tore through her grandparents' home while she was house-sitting for them while they were on holiday.

The girl was found dead at the five-bedroom property in Abernant, near Aberdare in south Wales by firefighters who fought the blaze.

Neighbours said the 18-year-old was house-sitting for her relatives when the £450,000 home, owned by Keith and Ann Harris, went up in flam yesterday.

A teenager has died after fire tore through her grandparents' home. The five-bedroom property, pictured, in Abernant, near Aberdare in south Wales was destroyed by the blaze

Firefighters battled the flames for three hours before they discovered the 18-year-old's body inside. She is understood to have been house-sitting for her relatives

It is understood the couple were on holiday at the time and had asked their granddaughter to 'keep an eye' on their home.

Robbie Williams, who lives nearby, raised the alarm after spotting smoke billowing from the building.

He fought to get into the burning house, in a bid to reach anyone trapped inside.

'I jumped over the fence and dropped down into the garden, and the flames were so intense, blowing hard in the wind.

'I
wanted to get onto the veranda to help anyone inside, but there was no 
way I could get in. It wasn’t so much the flames, it was the heat which 
was incredible.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said her family will be 'devastated' at their loss.

'It's tragic, Mr and Mrs Harris went away leaving their granddaughter to keep an eye on things.

'They are lovely people are will be totally devastated by what's happened.'

Caterer Mr Williams, who lives in Aberdare, added: 'What had happened didn’t really hit me until I got to work. I was sweating and a bit shaken.

'If only I could have got in to the house but I just couldn’t. There was already no roof left when I got there.'

The cause of the blaze is the subject of a joint police and fire investigation

Firefighters battled for three hours to bring the blaze under control. The house was left destroyed by the fire, which caused the roof to collapse.

Fire officers found the teenager’s body when they entered the property.

Assistant Chief fire officer Andy Thomas said: 'A body believed to be that of a female was found inside the property.

'Despite
the tremendous efforts of the fire crews, the severity of the fire and 
the partial collapse of the building meant we were faced with a very 
difficult incident.'

He added: 'I would l like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased that has sadly lost their life today.

'The deceased has been identified and the family have been informed however we cannot give any further information on the identity of the person at this time.

'I would like to thank the fire crews for their sterling efforts under the difficult circumstances to attempt the rescue.'

South Wales Police said the cause of the fire, which broke out at 7.30am on Friday, was unknown and is the subject of an investigation. The scene remained cordoned off yesterday while inquiries continue.

The teenager’s grandparents have been told of the tragedy and returned home today.

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'The cause of the fire is unknown and is under investigation.

'Next of kin have been informed and are being supported at this difficult time.'

The girl has yet to be named by police.

According to the fire service, the incident was reported at 7.38am, and by 8.05am the roof space had collapsed into the property.

By 9.13am, emergency services requested the arrival of the urban search and rescue team, as the situation was becoming increasingly perilous.

Fire crews from Aberdare, Penywaun, Merthyr Tydfil, Pontypridd, Tonypandy and Rumney attended the blaze.
