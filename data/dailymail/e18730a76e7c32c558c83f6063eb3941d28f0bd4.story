Manchester City have announced that they have sold Javi Garcia to Zenit St Petersburg. 

The 27-year-old underwent a medical and agreed personal terms on Thursday, moving to Russia for £13million.

Garcia’s place among Manuel Pellegrini’s squad had been up in the air for some time given the number of foreign players they have at the club.

The Premier League champions had to trim two foreigners or risk paying players wages who weren’t registered to turn out for them.

The Spaniard never lived up to his billing at the Etihad Stadium since a 2012 move from Benfica. 

City will be pleased with their business over the last week having also offloaded Jack Rodwell to Sunderland for £10million. The money brought in by the pair of sales goes some way to offsetting the fee paid to Porto for central defender Eliaquim Mangala. 

Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit are top of the Russian Premier League with 100 per cent record after three games of the new season.
