A masked gunman broke into the home of multi-millionaire businessman Robert Stiff and attacked his wife and daughters

A masked gunman who broke into the home of a multi-millionaire entrepreneur and forced his wife and daughter to hand over their jewels, was at the centre of a manhunt.

Robert Stiff's wife, Catherine, and one of his two daughters, aged in her 20s, were left needing hospital treatment after their £5 million home was targeted by the 'dangerous and violent' robber.

The intruder, who was armed with a sawn off shotgun, punched Mrs Stiff, aged in her 50s, in the face.

Mr Stiff's other daughter, also aged in her 20s, who was also in the property at the time, was left shaken, but uninjured.

As well the expensive gems  the robber escaped with the contents of the family safe.

Police think the raider smashed his way in through the back of the six bedroom property in Epsom, Surrey.

They believe he staked out the gated mansion, that backs onto Kingswood Golf and Country Club, for a number of days before caring out the raid.

Detective Inspector Paul Gordon, leading the hunt, said: 'The offender is clearly a dangerous and violent individual who will go to great lengths to get what he wants.

'Although the investigation is still in the early stages, it is believed this was a targeted offence and it may be possible that the offender had carried out visits to the area prior to the burglary.'

African-born Mr Stiff is best known as the founder and former managing director of the leading healthcare recruitment company Team24. 

He sold the company for in excess of £25 million three years ago to The Capita Group.

The entrepreneur is a patron of the Prince's Trust and now spends a lot of time mentoring people and businesses throughout the UK.

Neighbours on the upmarket estate said the raid on the 'lovely family' had left everyone terrified.

'The family are in a terrible state after this terrible shocking incident,' said one, who declined to be named.

'It was really violent and they are in trauma.'

Another added: 'Everyone is terrified until this man is caught.' 

The Stiff family told police that the raider was a white man, about 6ft 4in and of stocky build.

He was wearing a balaclava, black jacket and black leather gloves, and spoke with a London accent.

Anyone with information about the robbery on Wednesday, November 12, at 5.45pm was asked to call Surrey Police on 101.

The businessman's mansion was said to back onto Kingswood Golf and Country Club which is pictured in this aerial image
