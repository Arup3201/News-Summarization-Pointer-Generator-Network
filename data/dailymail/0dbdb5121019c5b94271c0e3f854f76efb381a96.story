LeBron James is regularly labelled ‘cocky’ and ‘arrogant’ by his critics and judging from his latest line of Nike trainers they’ve got a fair point.

Photographs released of the new low-top version of the LeBron X trainer show the shoe features the wording ‘2-Time Champion’ - a rather bold claim considering James has won just one NBA title and his chances of a second win are hanging in the balance. 

The bold prediction is printed inside one shoe, while the other features the dates '11-12' and '12-13', a reference to the fact LeBron and the Miami Heat won the championship last year and supposedly a prediction about this year's eventual winners.

As things stand the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs are drawn 3-3 in the series with one game left to play on Thursday at the Heat’s 
home court.

If LeBron's  - and Nike's - blushes are to be spared the Heat need to win the final game to win the NBA Final.
