Paula Radcliffe has hit out at a German documentary maker for not handing over documents he claims show a famous British athlete gave suspicious blood samples.

Investigative journalist Hajo Seppelt alleged an IAAF Medical Commission whistleblower had provided him with a list of 150 athletes who gave suspicious samples between 2006 and 2008 - including a famous British name - that were not followed up by drugs testers.

But despite several requests from the sport’s governing body the IAAF, Seppelt has not shared his list and Radcliffe, who has campaigned against drugs cheats throughout her long career, is angry.

Paula Radcliffe breaks the world marathon record with a time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs in London in 2003 

‘This makes me so mad because he won’t give it to the IAAF,’ said the marathon world record holder. ‘The IAAF have no idea what he is talking about.

'They (the IAAF) won’t come out and say “we have nothing, none of our records show any of these people that you’re talking about” because no journalist has given them this list.’

Sportsmail, along with other newspapers, was shown the list by Seppelt in the media centre in Monaco during the IOC Congress.

Apart from the red marking against the British name, there was no other purported evidence detailed or actual blood values listed. And this list that has caused such controversy, wasn’t printed on official IAAF paper.

Seppelt said when showing around his list: 'I trust the source of these documents 100 per cent. They are genuine.'

Radcliffe was asked during a promotional appearance this week for the Great Manchester Run whether people have suspected her of doping during her career despite her great anti-drugs reputation.

She said: ‘Yes, I get it all the time.It does make you angry and it does make you think we have to put a system in place that protects those clean athletes. And also so that people watching can believe in it.’

In his documentary for German channel ARD, he also exposed a serial drugs scandal in Russia claiming 99 per cent of Russian athletes used banned substances as part of a state-sponsored regime.

The IAAF insisted they have yet to see the list and are now consulting their lawyers about whether to take action against Seppelt. A spokesman said: 'No-one at the IAAF has seen any list. We have repeatedly asked to see this list so that we are able to verify if this is, indeed an IAAF list at all and also to date it properly, because we did not consider information on blood data very reliable until 2009 when technology had evolved to the point where we were comfortable about introducing our Athletes Biological Passport.

‘Since we are now working with WADA we will request that WADA ask for this list so that it can be independently reviewed by them. We hope that this will help clear up misunderstandings about what this list contains, as well as to allow the IAAF to demonstrate what actions were, or were not, taken.’
