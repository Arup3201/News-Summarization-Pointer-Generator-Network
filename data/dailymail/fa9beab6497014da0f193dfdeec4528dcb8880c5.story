He looked fresh-faced and innocent in a school photo taken in 2001, but little did his classmates know years later Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab would attempt to take down a U.S. jetliner in his warped plan to carry out Islamic jihad.

Appearing a starkly different man, Abdulmutallab is later filmed bearing arms at an al Qaeda training camp - his expression hardened, his arms cradling a firearm, soon to seek out martyrdom.

The Nigerian-born 25-year-old would soon become infamous as the 'underpants bomber' - who pleaded guilty on Wednesday to eight charges in connection to his attempted 2009 Christmas Day bombing of an airplane over Detroit.

Abdulmutallab, a well-educated son 
of a wealthy banker, had told investigators he trained in Yemen, which 
is home base for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He said he targeted a
U.S.-bound flight at the urging of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical, 
American-born Muslim cleric recently killed by the U.S. military in 
Yemen and wanted to become a martyr when he boarded Northwest Airlines 
Flight 253 in Amsterdam.

Abdulmutallab, who told the judge he 
is 25, said he carried a bomb in his underwear onto the plane with the intention of killing the nearly 
300 people on board. The bomb didn't work, and passengers jumped on 
Abdulmutallab when they saw smoke and fire.

But eight years before the flight, 
Abdulmutallab appears to look like an an average teenager, even smiling 
as he poses with anti-war campaigner Brian Haw in front of Britain's 
Parliament with a group of fellow pupils from Lome's International 
School, Togo in 2001.

Death: Anwar al-Awlaki - a source of inspiration for Abdulmutallab - was killed 12 days ago in a drone strike in Yemen

A decade later, Abdulmutallab, who has
never denied the accusations against him, calmly answered questions 
from U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds before pleading guilty to all 
eight charges he faced, including conspiracy to commit terrorism and 
attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

On Wednesday, he told the court that 
the underwear bomb was a 'blessed weapon to save the lives of innocent 
Muslims', and issued his plea in a court outburst.

'The United States should be warned 
that if they continue to persist and promote the blasphemy of Mohammed 
and the prophets... the United States should await a great calamity that
will befall them through the hands of the mujahedeen soon,' 
Abdulmutallab said.

'If you laugh with us now we will laugh with you later on the day of judgement,' he said.

Abdulmutallab said he was 'guilty 
under U.S. law, but not under Islamic law,' and stated his belief that 
'committing jihad against the United States is one of ’the most virtuous
acts' a Muslim can perform.'

Prior to his admission, prosecutors' evidence was stacked high.

Abdulmutallab was badly burned in a plane full of witnesses.

The government said he told FBI agents
he was working for al Qaeda and directed by Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical,
American-born Muslim cleric recently killed by the U.S. in Yemen.

There were also photos of his scorched
shorts as well as video of Abdulmutallab explaining his suicide mission
before departing for the U.S.

In September 2010, Abdulmutallab 
suggested he wanted to plead guilty to some charges. But he didn't, and 
instead dropped his four-lawyer, publicly financed defense team and 
decided to represent himself. He said relying on others wasn't in his 
best interest.

Born in New Mexico in 1971, al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen but the family returned to their native Yemen in 1978.

In 1991 al-Awlaki came back to 
America to study civil engineering at Colorado State University, then 
education studies at San Diego State University and later doctoral work 
at George Washington University in Washington.

Authorities note that he was arrested in San Diego in 1996 and 1997 for soliciting prostitutes.

Al-Awlaki's family is well-known in Yemen. His father is a former agriculture minister, Nasser al-Awlaki.          

The terrorist was a former imam of mosques in Denver, San Diego and Falls Church, Virginia.

Two of those mosques were attended by some of the September 11, 2001, hijackers.

In 2004 he travelled to Yemen, 
where he taught at a university before he was arrested and imprisoned in
2006 for suspected links to al-Qaeda and involvement in attacks.

In December 2007 he was released 
because he said he had repented, a Yemeni security official said. But he
was later charged again on similar counts and went into hiding.

Last year U.S. administration authorised operations to capture or kill al-Awlaki.

'Al-Awlaki is a proven threat,' said a U.S. official at the time. 'He's being targeted.'

His lawyers at the time said they had 
talked to prosecutors about a possible plea deal. Abdulmutallab had 
asked the judge what he needed to do to plead guilty to some charges.

She referred him to Chambers.

Passenger Lori Haskell, 34, of 
Newport, watched Abdulmutallab's plea in an overflow room Wednesday. She
called his statement in court 'chilling,' but not surprising.

'I'm just really relieved that it's done with,' Haskell said.

The court heard yesterday dramatic 
details of how passengers screamed in terror at the young Nigerian 
accused of attempting to detonate a bomb in his underwear to bring down a
jetliner.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan 
Tuckel described Umar Farouk Abdulmattab as an alleged al Qaeda member 
who calmly attempted to blow up the plane and then sat expressionless 
while his underwear burned because he had fully accepted his mission of 
martyrdom.

Meanwhile, shocked passengers aboard the Christmas 2009 Northwest Airlines Flight 253 shouted at him, 'Your pants are on fire!'

His mission, his goal, was to blow it 
up,' Mr Tuckel said during his opening statement at the trial in U.S. 
District Court. 'It had to be blown up over U.S. soil.'

'There was a loud pop... smoke... a fireball... the fireball was on the defendant... he was engulfed,' the prosecutor said.

Michael Zantow a passenger aboard the 
flight who was seated one row away from Abdulmutallab said people were 
alarmed by the initial loud pop of the device. He said someone yelled, 
'Hey man, hey dude, your pants are on fire.'

'This guy’s pants is on fire,' another passenger yelled, according to Zantow.

Zantow said that passengers struggled 
to get Abdulmutallab’s seatbelt off and lifted him out of his seat and 
laid him down on the floor with his pants down to his knees and the 
device smoldering.

Decision: Judge Nancy Edmunds listens to Opening arguments in the trial of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. He has now pleaded guilty to charges relating to the attempted terror attack

Plea: In this courtroom drawing, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab appears in court accused of trying to bring down a jetliner

'It was bulky and they were burning,' Zantow said. 'It looked like my son’s Pampers.'

Zantow echoed Tuckel’s statement in 
his opening arguments that Abdulmutallab sat expressionless as he was 
enveloped by the flames.

'I never saw any reaction at all,' 
Zantow said about the 24-year-old Nigerian who faces terrorism charges 
for the attempted bombing and conspiracy allegedly organized by Al 
Qaeda.

Abdulmutallab made numerous trips to 
the bathroom and prayed and went through rituals before allegedly 
depressing a plunger on a syringe, setting off a chemical reaction of 
two high explosives, Tuckel said.

In the plane's bathroom, 'he was engaging in rituals. He was preparing to die and enter heaven,' Tukel said.

'He purified himself. He washed. He 
brushed his teeth. He put on perfume. He was praying and perfuming 
himself to get ready to die.'

After returning to his seat, 
Abdulmutallab pushed a small plunger on the chemical bomb in his 
underwear, an action that produced the 'pop,' the prosecutor told 
jurors.

The bomb didn't work as planned but 
Abdulmutallab was engulfed in flames, said Tukel, who displayed the 
flight's seating chart on a screen to show jurors where things happened 
on the plane.

Abdulmutallab, whose handcuffs were 
removed before the jury was seated, sat quietly watching the proceedings
wearing a gray and yellow dashiki and a skullcap.

His sentencing is scheduled for January 12.
