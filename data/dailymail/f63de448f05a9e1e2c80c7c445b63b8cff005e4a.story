A young British woman who plunged to her death at Kings Canyon in central Australia may have been posing for a photograph, it emerged today.

ABC journalist Jesse Dorsett revealed in a tweet that several witnesses had seen the woman, whom police have confirmed was 23 and from the UK, was on the highest part of the a canyon in Watarrka National Park, the Ridge Walk, when she posed for a photo.

It was then that she fell up to 100m to her death - although she was able to talk briefly to people before she died.

Because of the remoteness of the area - Watarrka is 450km south west of Alice Springs - her body was not recovered until 24 hours later. 

An English tourist, in her 20s, has fallen to her death while walking in the Watarrka National Park in remote Central Australia

The Kings Canyon walking trail is 100 metres high in some parts, and it is understood the tourist fell from one of the highest points known as the Rim Walk'

Police said she initially lost consciousness after falling up to 100m, but died while being treated by park rangers and paramedics. A helicopter was on its way but couldn't reach the remote canyon in time.

Other tourists managed to raise the alarm and police, park rangers and paramedics drove to the scene from Alice Springs. The woman was reportedly able to talk to paramedics while a helicopter was flown to airlift her out.

Northern Territory police Superintendent Kylie Proctor told Daily Mail Australia the woman had travelled to Watarrka National Park as part of a tour group, but was walking alone at the time of the incident.

'There are police on the ground investigating the incident, but I can't confirm whether she simply fell, was skylarking, or slipped,' Suptd Proctor said.

A Parks and Wildlife Commission spokesman also told Daily Mail Australia he was not aware of the exact circumstances which led to the woman's death, but confirmed the commission was assisting police with their inquires.

'How, or why she fell, I don't know,' Media Manager Edwin Edlund said.

'At this time of year, being much cooler, it is a popular place for tourists ... but generally speaking it is also quite an isolated area.'

The Wararrka National Park is surrounded by rough walking terrain and is difficult to reach in emergencies because of distance from the nearest regional centre, Alice Springs

He said he couldn't recall a death inside the park during his nine years with the Parks and Wildlife Commission, and most emergencies calls that do come through relate more to heat distress and heart attacks.

'But someone falling like this, I am not aware of it.'

He said more than 250,000 people visit the park each year, and it is most popular with interstate and overseas travellers.

Tourists visit Kings Canyon because of its spectacular scenery, historical links with the mythical Aboriginal 'Dreamtime' and the region's wildlife.

It offers three walking trails, the highest being the Rim Walk, and in order to reach the highest point people climb up a steep trail known as 'Heart Attack Hill'.
