A simple Facebook thread lamenting the loss of a New York bagel store turned into an amazing and unusual heartfelt apology from one 50-something man to another after he recognized the name of someone he had stolen from more than 30 years ago.

Michael Goodman was reading a thread about the closure of H&H Bagels on New York's Upper East Side when he recognized a name that brought memories flooding back from years before and an incident that he had never fully been able to forget.

That name was Claude Soffel, who Goodman recalled accosting on the steps of The Museum of Natural History sometime in the late 1970s and mugging for his bus pass.

Michael Goodman, right, was reading a Facebook thread about the closure of a New York bagel store when he recognized Claude Soffel's name, left, as the person he had robbed of his bus pass back in the late 1970s

‘For some reason there were undercover Police right there & I was arrested on the spot. My Father had to leave work & come & get me (I was minor at the time) & was not to (sic) happy with me to say the least!,’ wrote Goodman.

As well as confessing to his distant misdemeanor, Goodman also admitted that his brush with criminal activity had had a lasting impact on his life.

‘I have never forgotten the incident or your name (it has sort of haunted me a bit throughout my life) & then here I am on fb. reading about my favorite bagel store in the world closing down…. my brain was blown!,’ he wrote. 

‘Finally I can say ~ I"M VERY SORRY that you had to go through that crap that day long ago, I wish it had never happened but it did.

The apology came about after both men were reading a Facebook thread about the closure of H&H Bagels on New York's Upper East Side

'Like I said I was trying to look tough to impress some guy who didn't believe I was in a gang, pretty frickin' stupid huh ? So once again I'm truly sorry for taking your bus pass back then - forgive me & thanks for reading this "strange" & very long message! Peace & love to you my brother...!!!’

While the post enabled Goodman to get his guilt off his chest, it was not a foregone conclusion that Soffel would react or even remember the incident.

Goodman had to sweat it out for almost ten hours before Soffel replied to confirm that he too remembered their meeting so many years before.

‘Michael A. Goodman, clearly your a "bigger man" today. wow. Memory is a funny thing, I recognize your name now, as well. So, apology accepted,’ he wrote.

Soffel was not only willing to accept Goodman’s apology, but he went on to describe the man who had bullied him as a hero for being man enough to say he was sorry so publicly so many years later.

‘Interestingly, I have dedicated a large portion of my life to helping other men be the man they have always wanted to be, and moments like this one continue to fuel my faith that the battle may be uphill but so rewarding,’ wrote Soffel.

‘Any man who draws aline for himself, "Today I step forward for myself, my family, and humanity" is a hero to me. So let us now, jointly, put this in its proper place, behind us. With respect, Claude Soffel.’

Suddenly a Facebook thread about a closed bagel store had been transformed into a special moment which seemed to have finally brought closure for Goodman on an event which he had admitted had had a lasting impact on his life.

Other posters, touched by what they were reading, couldn’t resist and also had to comment on what they were reading.

‘Wow. I've been waiting for messages like that, but they never come. Good for both of you!,’ wrote Elyse HF Maxwell.

While Sharon D'Lugoff commented ‘Michael A. Goodman, this thread made my day.’

Scene of the crime: Goodman has admitted and apologized to stealing Soffel's bus pass on the steps of The Museum of Natural History sometime in the late 1970s

A clearly emotional Goodman, who now lives in Hilo, Hawaii, couldn’t leave it there and once again addressed Soffel with an open message to thank him for his graciousness.

‘Claude Soffel, thank you for your words & forgiveness... I'm also glad that this thread brought some joy to those who read it, I know I finally feel peace on this subject & dare I say even JOY!'

The original bagel-related thread was started last week by Kwame Alta. Soffel was one of the first to comment, recalling how he used to enjoy salt bagels from the store after he had been out drinking.

'2AM, 2 salt bagels and a night cap at the Dublin House,' he recalled.

In Goodman’s original message to Soffel he too admitted that he ‘used to go to (the bagel store) ALL the time, & get 1 onion & 1 salt bagel & eat it at the Dublin back in the day.’

Who knows perhaps Goodman and Soffel may have unwittingly passed each other in the bagel store or at the Dublin House over the years, but it took until a Facebook thread in 2013 for them to come to peace over the incident from some many years ago.
