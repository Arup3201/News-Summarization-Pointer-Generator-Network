A grieving Arizona mom whose baby's ashes were stolen by a heartless burglar  is begging the thief to bring the ashes back. 

Alyssa Ruiz said she returned home on Valentines Day to find that her house near 39th Avenue and Camelback Road in Phoenix had been ransacked by burglars and items had been stolen.

Her TV, DVD and laptop were all missing after the raid.

Empty: She found the silver keepsake box, in which she kept her dead baby's ashes, open and upside down

Commemoration: The box had her son's name Matthew Isaiah Hernandez engraved on it along with his birth date, a message, and a sealed bag containing his ashes 

But she says she was 'devastated' after she saw the silver keepsake box, in which she kept her dead baby's ashes, open and upside down.

She told Fox 10: 'I feel very violated by what they did but by taking my son's ashes I feel devastated, heartbroken.'

'I figured they had dropped it when they were grabbing stuff off the top of the dresser.

'I couldn't afford to bury him, but I wish I would have figured out the money because at least now he'd still be there and not God knows where he's at.

'I don't know what they were thinking. I don't know if they saw what was written on the box or whether they had no idea of what they were taking.'

The callous thief stole her baby's ashes from her home in the Estancia Del Sol apartment in the West Valley but oddly left the silver box that stored them behind.

Ruiz said: 'They can come at three in the morning and just put it by my door. I just want it back'

The box had her son's name Matthew Isaiah Hernandez engraved on it along with his birth date a message and a sealed bag containing his ashes 

She said: 'It's my child somewhere, so I'm hoping the people will just feed bad. They can come at three in the morning and just put it by my door. Whatever. I just want it back.'

Ruiz said she won't ask any questions in return for the ashes.

Next month marks the eighth anniversary that her infant son died.
