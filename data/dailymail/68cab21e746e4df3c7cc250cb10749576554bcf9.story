Last month he said that an 'Iraq first' attack was the best means to combat ISIS, but Obama has reportedly developed a new strategy to defeat the al Qaeda splinter group - starting with the removal of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.

Senior White House officials have told CNN that the national security team has met four times, including one meeting chaired by Obama, to orchestrate the new strategy.

The U.S. and many of its allies see President Assad as the reason ISIS have been able to gain strength in Syria.

Obama's initial approach was to fight ISIS on the ground in Iraq while the government put together their own rebel force that could go after the group.

However  the White House has subsequently run out of time, CNN reported.

'The long running Syria problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat (ISIS), we need not only a defeat in Iraq but a defeat in Syria,' the senior sources told CNN.

'Developments on the ground have caused the national security team to collectively conclude we may not have time for Iraq first.

'In an ideal world you would drive (ISIS) out of Iraq and pivot to Syria.

'But if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and (ISIS) is still there, that doesn’t help.'

Embarrassingly, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told CNN that the U.S. have not yet started preparing their Syrian opposition fighters, despite announcing the plan four months ago.

The plan asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip the 5,000 vetted rebels over the space of one year - but nothing has been done.

'The vetting hasn't started,' Admirable Kirby said.

Threats: ISIS have released videos showing the deaths of captives such as James Foley, pictured above. They have been exclusively from the United Kingdom and the U.S. - whose governments do not pay ransoms

'Once it does start, that will be about a three-to-five-month process and then it’s about 8-9 months of training after that.'

'So we still got a ways to go.'

The Washington Post reports that Obama's turnaround  comes after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent a private memo to Susan Rice detailing his reservations about the President's handle on Syria and Iraq.

Secretary of State John Kerry and other officials have also questioned the plan.  

ISIS hopes to to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of and are known for public execution-style killings.
