Scores of health-conscious New Yorkers panicked as the dark clouds of storm Juno loomed ominously over Manhattan.

But far from being worried about having enough blankets, candles and tinned soup to outlast the blizzard, they appeared to be more concerned about stocking up on a frilly green vegetable.

Kale is the in superfood among hipsters in New York and the nutrient-laden close cousin of wild cabbage was flying off the shelves at branches of Whole Foods from Brooklyn to the Bowery.

Residents of the five boroughs tweeted their concern about the shortage of kale, posting images of store aisles bare but for a few remaining shreds of green where piles of the popular vegetable once stood.

Some joked of an impending 'Kale-pocalypse' with not a trace of the health food to be found.   

Queues at grocery outlets in the city stretched round the block as residents rushed to stock up before the worst of Juno was set to hit.

The full fury of the storm was expected to strike at 11pm yesterday but the severe weather conditions which were forecast failed to materialize.

New Yorkers turned the streets of Manhattan into a playground last night as road and travel bans virtually emptied the streets.

They were captured having snowball fights in an almost deserted Times Square while others stood in the middle of the street to take pictures.

Tens of millions of Americans were caught in an unprecedented blizzard lockdown, with residents of five states effectively banned from going outside as states of emergency were declared.

Metro systems in New York City and Boston shut down and there were threats of $500 fines for drivers on roads barred in the evening to all but emergency vehicles.

A fifth of the population of the U.S. was advised to shelter from the storm, with a large swath of New York state, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts forced from the roads by driving bans to make room for plows, police and ambulances.
