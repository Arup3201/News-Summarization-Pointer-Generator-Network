Chelsea will be boosted by the return of Cesc Fabregas against Everton on Wednesday, with the Spanish midfielder returning to full training.

Fabregas, 27, picked up a hamstring injury during the Capital One Cup win over Liverpool and missed the games against Manchester City and Aston Villa.

But he was pictured at the Cobham training base on Tuesday morning with his team-mates, including new signing Juan Cuadrado.

'We coped with the situation but to have him back is important,' manager Jose Mourinho said.

Ramires has filled in for the playmaker in recent weeks, as Mourinho's side stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League over City to seven points with a draw  and a victory, most recently at Villa Park. 

Diego Costa and John Obi Mikel are the only absentees for Chelsea, with the Portuguese boss still cursing his luck that his star striker was out.

In fact, he still refuses to say his name in press conferences. 

'We don't have the player that is suspended so we have to stick with Didier (Drogba) and (Loic) Remy again,'

'We need the suspended player, but we have coped without him.'

Mourinho voiced his clear displeasure with the FA during the press conference, and gestured with an elbow in a clear reference to Van Persie's challenge on West Ham defender James Tomkins in Sunday's draw.

The Van Persie incident was dealt with by the match officials at Upton Park, so there is no scope for retrospective punishment for the United striker.

'I know that if it was one of mine, I know,' Mourinho added.

'Last season happened the same thing, when Ramires was suspended (for elbowing Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson).

'It was exactly the same thing. A Manchester City player kicked a player on the floor at Norwich and nothing happened.'

That was a reference to Yaya Toure's challenge on Ricky van Wolswinkel, which went unpunished.
