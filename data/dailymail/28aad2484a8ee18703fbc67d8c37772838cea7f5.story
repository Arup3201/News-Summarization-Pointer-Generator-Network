A little boy born with a rare brain disease that prevented him from being able to cry or feed properly, has died at just eight weeks old.

Yasmin and Michael Burley have shared a touching tribute to their son Tate, whose short and difficult life they documented on social media in the hope of raising awareness of the extremely rare brain disorder he suffered from: Miller Dieker Lissencephaly.

'Hey little fighter soon things will be brighter! My name is Tate Lindsay Burley I represent true humility. I am a gift, I will change lives and I can be at peace,' the family wrote on Friday.

'Tate passed away with his family surrounding him at 6.25pm.

Tate Lindsay Burley died of a rare brain disease that prevented him from being able to cry or feed properly, at just eight-weeks-old

Yasmin and Michael Burley, shared a touching tribute to their son, whose short and difficult life they documented on social media in the hope of raising awareness of Miller Dieker Lissencephaly

'Miller-Dieker Lissencephaly didn't win... Tate decided it was time to beat it for good... Tate won!

A rare birth defect of the brain caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17

People with lissencephaly have an abnormally smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves 

It causes intellectual disability, seizures, abnormal muscle stiffness, weak muscle tone

Feeding and swallowing problems are common, and can be complicated by aspiration pneumonia

Seizures usually begin before six months

Children with the condition usually die in infancy  from respiratory complications 

'Bless his soul may he rest in the heavens above... Tiny Tate you will forever be the fire inside each of us that reminds us of the gift of life and how blessed we each are to have what we have and to hold what we hold.

'Mummy, Dad, Zane and Kye love you to the Moon and back.'

Hundreds of messages of support and love from friends and strangers have since flooded the page titled The Tiny Tate Journey. 

The syndrome affects most of Tate's major neural systems and his parents were told his brain will not develop past the three month stage.

Tate's brain was abnormally smooth, without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses.

Tragically, his death came just hours after his family celebrated him turning eight weeks old and only one day after he experienced his first seizure.

'Last night however we witnessed Tate develop from a sleeping premie to a seizing newborn .. 15 hours of jolting , stiffness, staring, back bending, pale clamminess and at times hypo colour. A path we knew was coming but a corner I dreaded turning. Off to specialist today for more clarification,' Mrs Burley wrote on Friday.

'Lesson: there is no pain greater than helplessly watching him suffer. Yesterday was a good day… Today I just want to get through.'

Tate's story first came to light when friends and family launched a MyCause fundraising campaign to help pay for Tate's care and more research into the condition, with Mrs Burley telling the Sunday Telegraph: 'We just want him to cry'.

The campaign raised over $15,000 for the Brain Foundation which the family planned to partially use on a respiratory sleep machine and correct bedding and feeding apparatus.

'Lesson: there is no pain greater than helplessly watching him suffer. Yesterday was a good day… Today I just want to get through,' Mrs Burley wrote of watching her son suffer through seizures for the first time on Friday

Baby Tate was born at just 1.7kg and told he was unlikely to live past his fifth birthday

A milestone for the family was when Tate managed to suck 6-10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed. Another was when they heard him 'squeak'.

'Tate has no ability to cry however we also witnessed a sound today when he got restless .. Not a cry or scream but definitely a squeak!,' Ms Burley posted previously.

The family's first scare came after just four days at home when Tate developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency where he spent the next six days with his mother convinced he was dying.

Friends and family launched a MyCause fundraising campaign to help pay for Tate's care and more research into the condition 

'Granny and I watched Tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air, dropping saturations and an excessively weak heart rate, white with blue lips, eyes rolled in his head, body flopped,' she said.

'Today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things I cannot change for my son and except reality as it challenges me,' Ms Burley wrote on Saturday.

'No one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ...stand up, be an advocate for your child, don't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because I learnt today that I'm educated in what a palliative care patient is.'
