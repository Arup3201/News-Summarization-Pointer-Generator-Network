Former UFC heavyweight fighter Dave Herman was tased by Indiana police following an altercation in the early hours of Tuesday morning and his wife Madeleine captured the incident on her cell phone.

With her husband still in police custody on Wednesday, Madeleine has posted the footage online and called for the officers involved to be charged with assault.

According to the police, Herman - who had his wife and young son in his vehicle - led them on a three-mile chase after they tried to pull him over for speeding and driving without headlights just after 1am.

Police say Herman 'approached officers in an aggressive manner' which forced them to fire a taser.

According to Madeleine, her husband was simply looking for a well-lit place to stop before pulling over in a gas station near Fort Wayne.

'Dave, not wanting armed strangers walking up behind the vehicle, especially with our infant son in tow, stepped out of the vehicle and asked them if there was something he could help them with,' she explained in her video.

When Herman doesn't comply he is tased and then handcuffed. 

Officers then approach Madeleine. 'They then came up to the vehicle and saw that I was recording and were more than happy to show me some identification,' she said.

The ex-fighter has being charged with several criminal counts including resisting arrest and battery against an officer, neglect of a dependent and resisting law enforcement.

'They have not set bail for him or arraigned him,' Madeleine said. 

'They are refusing to give any information, except for through their Twitter account and their Facebook and have been defaming Dave with trumped-up charges.' 

DeKalb County Sheriff's Department initially posted a report on the incident on Facebook, but later took it down.

'David was given multiple warnings to get on the ground and failed to comply. David had to be tased in order to be taken into custody. An infant and adult female were also present in the vehicle.' read the report.
