More than a million young people are subjected to 'extreme cyberbullying' every day, according to the largest ever survey into online abuse.

The report found young people are twice as likely to be bullied on Facebook than any other social network.

Experts say cyberbullying can have a 'catastrophic' impact on self-esteem and have called for parents and regulators to recognise the seriousness of the issue.

A cyberbullying survey found more than a million youngsters suffer 'extreme' abuse online daily and more than half of 13 to 22-year-olds polled said they had been bullied on Facebook (file picture)

Liam Hackett, founder of national anti-bullying charity, Ditch The Label, which produced the report, said many people assume cyberbullying is not as hurtful as face-to-face abuse.

But he said it can be even more distressing because it is more public.

The survey of 10,000 13 to 22-year-olds found that levels of cyberbullying were much higher than previously reported.

It found that 70 per cent of youngsters had experienced cyberbullying and one in five said it had been 'extreme'.

Of those surveyed, almost 40 per cent said they were bullied online frequently.

Mr Hackett said: 'I think there's a 
tendency for older people to think that cyberbullying is a lesser form 
of bullying because there is this idea you can delete a comment or you 
can block it and it's gone.

'But
 actually, we have seen that content becomes viral very quickly and when
 comments are put out on a public platform it can be more distressing 
for the victim because a lot of people are exposed to this content, so 
it's incredibly harmful.'

Facebook, Ask.fm and Twitter were found 
to be the most likely sources of cyberbullying, and 54 per cent of Facebook users reported cyberbullying on the network, the survey said.

Ask.fm has 
faced growing criticism is recent months after being linked to the 
suicide of a number of teens.

 Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged at her Leicestershire home in August
 months of abuse on the site, where users are able to hide their 
identities.

Ditch The Label's research also suggested that young 
men and women are equally at risk of cyberbullying but transgender people were more likely to suffer online abuse.

Mr Hackett, who was bullied and 
cyberbullied while at school, said: 'We asked people to rate the impact 
cyberbullying had on their lives on a scale of one to 10, with one being
 not severe and 10 being incredibly severe.

'On
 average, the effect on their self-esteem was 7.5 out of 10, which can 
go on to affect their social lives and their optimism for the future.

'It's having a massive impact on young people and it's heartbreaking to 
read.'

Mr Hackett said he hoped the report would be used to educate young people, parents, schools and the Government about cyberbullying and how to report it.

He said: 'Social media outlets have a massive duty of care to teen users. They are already doing a lot but more investment needs to be put into the resources of moderation.

'There also needs to be stronger integration between the Government and social networks.

'What we believe social networks should have to do is produce an annual external audit which would measure cyberbullying activity on a network, how many people are reporting cyberbullying and what happened as a result, and we believe that those reports should be made public.'

A Facebook spokesman told The Independent: 'We don't tolerate bullying on Facebook and that's why we provide the best tools and support in the industry for people to report bullying to us or to someone else who can help them.' 

A Government spokesman said David Cameron expects social media websites to have mechanisms to report online abuse and 'to take action promptly when abuse is reported and to make it easier for users to turn off anonymous posts.'
