Dr. Dre celebrated his headphones deal with Apple last night by declaring himself the richest man in hip hop.

Stylish headphone maker Beats Electronics (also known as 'Beats By Dre') finalized a deal to sell to Apple for a reported $3.2 billion.

Within hours of the news, the star was seen in a video alongside R&B singer Tyrese Gibson boasting about the deal.

'First billionaire in hip-hop, right here on the mother-****** west coast,' Dre says to the camera.

Billionaire boys club for real homies: 'The Forbes list just changed,' says Tyrese, with Dre lurking in the background

Dr. Dre, who founded Beats electronics with record producer music producer Jimmy Iovine. The firm could now be sold to Apple.

Tyrese implores Forbes to change its 
Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in America although the deal 
may not be enough to get him on the list.

Dre’s
 stake in Beats currently stands at somewhere around 25%. After taxes he
 would likely be left with a net worth of around $800 million making him
 hip-hop’s richest man, toppling P. Diddy by $100 million.

Apple
 is in the market for a subscription-based music service to complement 
its 'iRadio' ad-based offering, launched in 2013 as part of an attempt 
to jump into a music-streaming arena then split between a handful of 
startups such as Pandora Inc.

Founded by 
rapper Dr. Dre and legendary music producer Jimmy Iovine, Beats 
Electronics is best known for its 'Beats by Dr Dre' line of trendy 
headphones that vie with the likes of Skullcandy Inc, Sennheiser 
Electronic and Bose Corp.

This year, it launched a music service that has won plaudits for its 
slick design and human music curation, versus the computer-algorithms 
that determine playlists for most of its rivals.

But
 analysts on Thursday questioned whether Beats, valued at just $1 
billion during its last funding round in September, was worth that 
price.

What a deal! Apple is orchestrating a $3.2 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker and music streaming distributor founded by hip-hop star Dr. Dre and record producer Jimmy Iovine

Apple
 had more than $130 billion in cash as of the end of March, but the vast
 majority of that is parked abroad and investors have called on the 
company to return more cash in the form of dividends and buybacks.

Apple-watchers
 have speculated that the company that upended the music industry - and 
today is the single largest seller of tunes - was contemplating a 
Spotify-like on-demand music service to go with iRadio service and 
iTunes.

'This
 is really puzzling,' said Forrester analyst James McQuivey, who said 
there was huge overlap between the two companies' customer base. 'You 
buy companies today to get technologies that no one else … or customers 
that no one has.'

'They must have something hidden … under the hood,' he said.

In
 two of the largest deals this year, Facebook paid $19 billion for 
WhatsApp and its half-billion users, and it paid $2 billion for Oculus 
VR and its cutting-edge virtual reality headset.

Apple
 declined to comment on the report. Beats Electronics did not respond to
 requests for comment on the news, which was reported first by the 
Financial Times.

The potential acquisition would add Beats Electronics' popular line of headphones and music streaming service to an Apple line-up that already includes digital music players and the iTunes store, the world's top music retailer

Apple
 has not made a billion-dollar acquisition in at least a decade. The 
company prefers to develop and design its products in-house, though it 
has tended to pay several hundred million dollars for small but 
important bits of technology to propel its core consumer electronics 
business, such as the acquisition of PA Semi in 2008 that led to the 
processor now found in all iPhones.

The
 company has been under pressure to try to revitalize growth as iPhone 
sales slow in a rapidly maturing market. Critics have also accused the 
company of slowly 'losing its cool' and innovative edge to new and 
upcoming technology companies, and missing the music-streaming 
bandwagon.

Technology
 giants Google and Amazon began jockeying for position in music last 
year, looking at ways to make streaming profitable and to develop a 
service seen as crucial to retaining users in an increasingly mobile 
environment.

For Google and Apple especially, the endeavor was critical to ensure users remain loyal to their mobile products.

Beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities, including Lady Gaga, to create endorsed  earphones.

They 
realized they had to stake out a place or risk ceding control of one of 
the largest components of mobile device usage. Analysts estimate roughly
 half of smartphone users listen to music on their device, making it the
 fourth most popular media-related activity after social networking, 
games and news.

Apple
 launched its own streaming music service last year, hoping to jump into
 the fast-expanding arena as growth of its iTunes service falters.

Apple's
 Chief Executive Tim Cook met with Iovine, the Beats CEO, last year on a
 potential partnership involving Beats's planned music-streaming 
service.

Dre - who guided the careers of a string of rap artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent - compared his company with Apple in 2011.

'We're trying to eventually be second to Apple. And I don't think that's a bad position,' Dre told The Fader music website.

Beats
 Electronics received a $500 million investment from Carlyle Group in 
September that valued the company at over $1 billion. It also bought 
back in September a 24.84 percent stake held by Taiwan smartphone maker 
HTC Corp, which once held as much as 50.1 percent of the company.
