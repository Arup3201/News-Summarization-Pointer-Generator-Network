The bodies of a pilot, his girlfriend and her nine-year-old daughter have been recovered from a plane wreckage in Utah a week after they vanished while flying home from Thanksgiving celebrations.

Matthew Ahrens, 37, Trista Meyer, 34, and her daughter Shyann Lenz were flying from Ahrens' family home in Bakersfield, California to Gillette, Wyoming, where they all live, on November 25 when they disappeared.

The trio stopped off in Fillmore, Utah to refuel and Meyer texted her sister to tell her she would be home in a few hours - but it was the last time they spoke.

After a week of searches by authorities in Utah, Colorado and Wyoming, a Utah Department of Public Safety helicopter spotted the wreckage in mountainous terrain Sevier County at 8.15am on Sunday.

Tragic: The bodies of Matthew Ahrens, 37, Trista Meyer, 34, and her daughter Shyann Lenz, 9, have been found a week after they vanished flying from California to Wyoming

Three bodies were recovered from the Piper Archer II plane, Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Ted Tingey told the Deseret News. The bodies of their dogs were also found.

An investigation has been launched into what caused the plane to crash. It did not have a radio beacon on board and there was not a flight plan for the journey.

Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Curtis added: 'They were just about clear at the top of the mountain. I
don't know if they got disoriented or couldn't get enough altitude. I 
don't know what it is.'

The sheriff's office will now help the National Transportation Safety 
Board and Federal Aviation Administration as they investigate the 
crash, the News added.

The trio had been visiting Ahrens' family in Bakersfield for Thanksgiving, and relatives described him as an experienced pilot.

The bodies have been taken to the state medical examiner's office to determine the cause of death.

Shyann's father, Mark Lenz, told the Deseret News he learned of his daughter's death on Sunday and said that it was a 'tragic loss' of three good people.

'They're in God's care now,' Lenz said. 'We don't have to worry 
about them being cold and we don't have to worry about them being out 
there anymore. They're on their way home.'

He added that he was so thankful to everyone involved in the search effort.

Family and friends have also flocked to a Facebook group, Prayers for Trista, Shy and Matt, to pass on their condolences and share their memories of the trio.

Shyann's father Mark added on the group: 'This week has been a tough one, with today being the toughest, many difficult days are ahead unfortunately.

'Trista, I will always love you and you will always be a part of me. Matt, I would be honored to call you my friend, you are a good man that Trista and Shy loved, thank you for making them happy.

Route: They took off from California on November 25 and crashed in Utah on the way to Wyoming

Remembered: Family, who prayed for the trio at a candle-lit vigil, said it is comforting to finally have an answer

'Shyann Amy I love you more than you know, you are my life, my heart and my soul.'

Her aunt Lori Koch added: 'We can now have a little peace knowing that they are in heaven... It's the missing them so badly, their voices, their laughs, their smiles, their everything.

'I just expect Tris to coming walking in the door in the morning for coffee and chatting, rambling, rambling. I am gonna miss that girl so much.'

The group is also raising funds to help return the bodies to Wyoming. Funds can be sent to Campco Federal Credit Union, PO Box 3169, Gillette, WY 82717 Account: BRING THEM HOME.
