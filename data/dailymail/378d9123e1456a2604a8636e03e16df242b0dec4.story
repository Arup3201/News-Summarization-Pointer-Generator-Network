Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba's former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the speculation has emerged close on the heels of the death of another high-profile person with the same name.

There has been no official confirmation that the 88-year old former leader of Cuba has died and social media has an impressive track record of prematurely announcing Castro's demise. 

Also casting doubt on today's speculation is the possibility that twitter users are confused by the name, after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died several days ago at the age of 41.

Media including a Venezeulan newspaper - Diario de Cuba - said that a government press conference was imminent, but no such broadcast emerged.

Cuban officials denied that Raul Castro- Cuba's leader and Fidel's brother - was due to speak live, saying no such programme had been planned.

Some later said it was 'a lie fabricated by anti Cuban elements in Miami'.

Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to Raul in 2008, became Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

Cuba's Fidel Castro (pictured left in 1976 and right in 1978) ushered in a long period of communism to the tiny island in what developed into a highly antagonistic relationship with the U.S.

He has lived in increasing seclusion ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. 

Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

Today his former Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Perez Silva told various outlets: 'Fidel is waiting for the right moment, because he is a great prophet who knows the right moment to say what needs to be said.'
