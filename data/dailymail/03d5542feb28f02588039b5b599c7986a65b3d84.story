Producers working on the remake of the Oscar-winning Ben Hur have been barred from shooting the epic chariot scene at the Circus Maximus.

Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December.

But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry.

The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005

However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site

The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported.

The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios.

The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert.

Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site.

The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000.

The ancient arena has been used for pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005.

But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns.

A spokesman for the Ministry for Cultural Affairs said it was investigating.
