A huge aquatic lizard has been discovered that terrorised European rivers 84 million years ago.Â The new species was discovered in Hungary is the first known example of a group of scaled reptiles to have lived in freshwater river environments.

They were the biggest and most dangerous predators in the water and occupied a similar niche to freshwater dolphins of today.

Mosasaurs were terrifying aquatic predators which evolved to live in both the seas and freshwater rivers.

Researchers believe the largest of the ancient lizards grew up to 20 feet (6m) long, though most would have been 10-13 feet (3-4m).

The new species was named Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus by the scientists who discovered it.

Armed with rows of sharp teeth they would have siezed and eaten anything they could get into their mouths.

It belonged to the mosasaur family which most fossil remains have show to be monstrous sea creatures.

But the fossil remains from Hungary are believed by scientists to have come from a freshwater predator that shared its tropical environment with crocodiles.

Fossil remains of the newly discovered creature represent a range of individuals, ranging from small juveniles to large adults.

They had limbs like a terrestrial lizard, a flattened, crocodile-like skull, and a tail unlike other known members of the mosasaur family.

The fossils were recovered from an open-pit mine in the Bakony Hills which were once flood-plains.

Some of the fossilised bones were so little weathered that the animal they belonged to is believed to have been washed away in a sudden flood and rapidly buried.

According to the study, this is the first known mosasaur that lived in freshwater and only the second to have been found in rocks that were not once deposited in the ocean.

Laszlo Makadi, of the Hungarian Natural History Museum who conducted the study with colleagues from the University of Alberta in Canada, said the ancient lizard family evolved to adapt to several different freshwater environments.

'The evidence we provide here makes it clear that similar to some lineages of cetaceans, mosasaurs quickly adapted to a variety of aquatic environments, with some groups re-invading available niches in freshwater habitats,' he said.'The size of Pannoniasaurus makes it the largest known predator in the waters of this paleo-environment.'

The Hungarian and Canadian research team added in their report, published in the journal PLoS ONE: 'We consider the crocodile-like flattened skull to be a useful adaptation for water-level ambush hunting of terrestrial and shallow water prey.'
