Scientists surveying the sea floor's gas deposits got a surprise when they spotted a crab snacking on frozen bubbles of methane streaming from a vent, which it mistook for food.

They spotted the hungry arthropod while exploring methane gas deposits off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

The deep sea crab scavenges for its meals by tracking vibrations created by movement and sound and was consequently attracted to the stream of bubbles.

Scientists surveying the sea floor's gas deposits got a surprise when they spotted a crab snacking on frozen bubbles of methane, which collected round its mouth to form a moustache

The icy bubbles might have seemed like a suitable snack to the crab, but froze onto its claws and mouth, creating an amusing moustache.

Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) caught the crab snacking and filmed the arthropod from a remotely operated vehicle offshore of Canada.

The underwater site situated just off Vancouver Island has naturally occurring methane vents where gas bubbles  emerge from the sea floor, Peter Walz, an MBARI research technician told Becky Oskin at Live Science.

'It was pretty obvious that the crab was intent on going to the gas vent, but we had no idea what he was going to do or why.

'The crab was doing his own investigation of what we were investigating,' he said.

The creature used its claws to 'catch' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth.

Its moustache formed because of the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor.

When the gas escapes around 1,260 metres below sea level, the bubbles have a frozen skin - methane hydrate - with the gas trapped inside the icy layer.

According to Mr Walz, the skin of the bubbles formed a layer on the crab's claws as when the crab moved them in the stream of bubbles, the gas turned to methane hydrate and stuck to the creature, which also transferred the substance to its mouth.

He told Live Science: 'The hydrate forms more readily with increased agitation or shaking, such as the movements of the crab.'

The hungry creature used its claws to 'catch' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth. Its moustache formed because the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor

The animal eventually scraped off the methane hydrate and scuttled away, leaving the distracted scientists to study the Bullseye Vent, which they had come to do in the first place.

As well as studying the strange behaviour of the crab, they found large pockets of the gas can change the shape of the seafloor.

Peter Brewer, senior scientist at MBARI, said the video illustrates the unusual property of hydrocarbon gas behaviour under the extreme pressure and cold temperatures.

The scientists believe it also serves as an example of how organisms living on the seafloor might interact with naturally occurring hydrocarbons.
