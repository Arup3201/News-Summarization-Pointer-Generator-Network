Police in California are toasting the arrest of an alleged thief dubbed ‘El Mustachio The Magician’ – after the offer of beer glasses printed with his signature facial hair led to a tip-off that identified him.

The suspect acquired his nickname for his ability ‘to make merchandise disappear from store shelves’, Santa Cruz Sheriff's Department said, as well as for his distinctive handlebar moustache.

Police said that the suspect in recent months had taken merchandise on a number of occasions from a Costco.

Police in California are toasting the arrest of an alleged thief dubbed ‘El Mustachio The Magician’ – after the offer of beer glasses printed with his signature facial hair led to a tip-off that identified him as one Shawn Fialho from Boulder Creek

He was captured on the store’s CCTV system on a number of occasions. Although he sported a variety of facial hair looks, he wore Ugg boots that firmed up police suspicions that they were looking at the same man each time.

The Sheriff’s Department asked for the public’s help in identifying him on its ‘Name That Thief’ blog, with the offer of commemorative El Mustachio beer glasses signed by police chief Kevin Vogel as an incentive for information.

An anonymous tip led to him being identified as 45-year-old Shawn Fialho from Boulder Creek.

Caught on camera: Suspected thief El Mustachio was spotted by a Costco's CCTV system on a number of occasions, each time sporting a slightly different look

A Sheriff’s Department blog said: ‘This fabulous and priceless reward did its job. He [Fialho] was picked up by the Sheriff’s Office in Soquel last week on an unrelated arrest. 

'We have attached our cases to his arrest for prosecution. Fialho has a long history of arrests for theft and drug related cases.’

It added: ‘Fialho's history of booking photos match the different looks he sported during his Costco heists. His latest booking photo shows the moustache is coming back.’
