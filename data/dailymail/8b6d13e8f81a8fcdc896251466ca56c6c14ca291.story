A woman claims she was raped in an impromptu campsite for fans queuing for tickets to see the Wimbledon final.

The 34-year-old called police while spending the night in a tent in a park just yards from the tournament.

Hundreds of people gathered in the open public space late last Saturday night in the hope of getting last minute tickets to watch Andy Murray.

Police arrested a 30-year-old man after the woman dialled 999 in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The alleged victim told them he subjected her to a serious sexual assault after she joined him in the makeshift tent.

A witness said his wife heard a commotion and another man trying to help the victim.

He told the BBC his wife heard a woman say: ‘Have you had your fun? I’m calling 999.’

Two tents were later taped off by the police so they could be examined by forensic experts. It is believed that neither had met each other before the evening and both had been drinking alcohol.

The alleged attack took place in Wimbledon Park, off Church Road, a stone’s throw from the All England Club.

A Met spokesman confirmed detectives from its specialist Sapphire unit are investigating.

He said: ‘We are investigating an allegation of serious sexual assault in the early hours of Sunday July 7.

‘We have arrested a 30-year-old man who has been bailed to September.

‘A 34-year-old woman is the victim. 
Inquiries are ongoing.’ Camping out overnight for tickets is one of the 
great traditions of Wimbledon finals.

Queues of tents and makeshift shelters build up around the club throughout the two-week tournament.

Wimbledon is one of a handful of major global sporting events where fans can buy the best tickets on the day of play.

As a result hundreds choose to camp out overnight in the hope of catching a glimpse of their heroes on finals day.

But Championship stewards enforce a strict code of conduct, backed by police, council officials and staff from Wimbledon Park golf club.

They will refuse entry to anyone acting antisocially, unreasonably or is heavily under the influence of alcohol.

This year the single queue for the men’s singles final snaked back hundreds of metres from the gate three turnstiles.

Officials patrol the queue 24 hours a day and publish detailed advice on how to make the best of the experience.

Those staying overnight are only allowed two-person tents. Barbecues and gazebos are banned as is music and balls games after 10pm.

On arriving, fans are issued a dated and numbered, non-transferable queue card showing their position in the queue.

They are woken up at 6am and asked to dismantle tents and other equipment, shortening the queue before being issued with wristbands.

Organisers set up a left luggage facility in Wimbledon Park, which is often used by fans to store their tents and camping equipment.
