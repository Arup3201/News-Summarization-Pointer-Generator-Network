A 59-year-old married father-of-two arrested on suspicion of murdering chef Claudia Lawrence (pictured) has been released on bail

The man arrested by police yesterday on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence has been released on bail, police say.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said the man, who is a 59-year-old married father-of-two from the York area, was released on bail 'to allow detectives time to follow up lines of inquiry'.

Searches at a linked property were completed last night, police said. Yesterday, officers could be seen searching a semi-detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. 

A spokesman said yesterday that Miss Lawrence, who was 35 when she went missing, had not been found.

Claudia's family have been informed about today's developments.

Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, repeated his plea for people not to identify the suspect.

He said: 'I am very grateful to the media and the public for supporting my request that this individual should under no circumstances be identified, either in traditional media or on social media platforms.

'That is because identification is an issue and publishing this man's identity could cause serious harm to my investigation.

'This continues to be the case, even though the man has been released on bail, and I must ask that the media and public continue to support me and make no attempt to identify him, his place of work or his home address.' 

Her parents, Peter and Joan, were told about the arrest shortly before it was made public and are being supported by trained officers. 

Officers from North Yorkshire Police were yesterday pictured searching a property in a quiet cul-de-sac in York. Another property was searched overnight, and the man was bailed earlier today

The father-of-two drank in the same pub as the missing university chef and lives within half a mile of her home in York.

Miss Lawrence was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at work in March 2009.

North Yorkshire Police began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of the city, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. 

A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

Mr Malyn said he was 'actively pursuing new leads' and that his team had made 'significant progress' since the force began reviewing the case in 2013.

The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef.

The family of Claudia Lawrence have been informed of today's developments, it has been reported. Yesterday her father, Peter, said the news of an arrest was 'encouraging'

The arrest came days after police released previously unseen CCTV of a mystery man caught on camera walking towards the back of her terraced house on the evening she was last known to be alive.

The footage, released to mark the anniversary of Miss Lawrence's disappearance, was taken at around 7.15pm on March 18 showing a man walking towards the rear of the missing chef;s house. The camera picks him up returning about one minute later and he appears to be carrying a bag over his shoulder.

As he walks back to the main road he is seen to stop briefly as another man walks in front of him. Police appealed for information to identify both men and the arrest came five days later.
