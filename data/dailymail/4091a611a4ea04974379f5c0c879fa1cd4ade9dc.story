A teenage cancer survivor who lost his leg to a rare form of the disease has been given a surprise police escort to his school ball.

Kieran Maxwell was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma childhood cancer when he was 12, and had an  above-knee amputation on his left leg on March 31, 2011 - six months after he was diagnosed.

But the operation to halt the spread of the bone cancer cut short his dream of one day becoming a police officer.

Cancer survivor  Kieran Maxwell who lost his leg to a rare form of the disease has been given a surprise police escort to his school ball

The police escort was made up of three police cars and two motorcycle outriders, which drove him and his date Nicole Maxwell, 15, the  ten-minute journey

Kieran's unique transport to the school prom was organised by his teachers  who wrote to the Police 
and Crime Commissioner Ron Hogg to see if they could help make the night a special one

However, thanks to a thoughtful teacher, Kieran was given a taste of what it would be like to ride with the 'blues and twos' on Friday night when off-duty police arrived at his house to take him and his date to the school prom at Hardwick Hall, in Sedgefield, County Durham.

Kieran, from Heighington, County Durham., said: 'It was absolutely incredible.

'I walked out my house and all I heard was sirens. I was like 'oh no', I thought they were coming to arrest someone. 

'I thought 'this is perfect, ruining my night!

'Then when they pulled up at my house I was like "Oh, it's me".'

The police escort was made up of three police cars and two motorcycle outriders, which drove him and his date Nicole Maxwell, 15, the  ten-minute journey.

Kieran's unique transport to the 
school prom was organised by his teachers at the Hummersknott Academy in
 Darlington, County Durham, who wrote to the Police and Crime 
Commissioner Ron Hogg to see if they could help make the night a special
 one.

Kieran said: 'It's amazing what they did for me and Nicole.

'I wasn't expecting it. It was the best surprise ever.

'I think everyone thought I was very posh when I turned up at school, but I definitely think I got the best ride there.

'It was pretty scary when they turned up, as I didn't know what was going on.

'But the escort was the best part of the day. It's something I will always remember.'

Mother Nicola said: 'Our neighbours thought there was a drugs raid going on when all the police turned up on the road.

'No-one could really believe it.

'We drove on ahead of him so we could watch him turn up at the school, and the kids were all amazed by what they were seeing.

'I think the last thing they expected was for Kieran to get out.

'Sirens
 and blue lights are the last thing you expect to see at your school 
prom - so when Kieran appeared with his date, no-one could believe their
 eyes.

'Everyone was 
cheering and they were so impressed. Everyone was taking pictures and 
asking him what it was like to go in a police car. I think they all 
wanted to have a go.

'It was
 so lovely to see him being a normal teenager surrounded by his friends,
 and we're so grateful to those off-duty police officers who gave up 
their time to make Kieran feel really special.

'He had to rough it on the way home with a trip in a normal car, which I think he was a bit disappointed about.

Kieran
 was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma at the age of 12 and he has 
undergone years of treatment, including the amputation of his leg due a 
number of untreatable tumours.

The teenager has never let his years of illness stand in his way and harbours dreams of competing in the Paralympic Games as a gymnast.

Before his illness he had aspired to become a police officer, which inspired one of his teachers to dream up the special treat.

Kieran had been desperate to become a police officer before his illness devastated his chances

Mrs Maxwell, 36, said: 'I knew about it and had to keep it a surprise but I still couldn't believe it when all these police started turning up. 

'The neighbours were looking out the windows - it was like nothing you've ever seen before. 

'It's so nice to see him enjoy something so much after everything he's been through. He deals with everything so well and he's so brave.'

Kieran has recently taken his exams and is going to Darlington College to undertake a Level 2 Diploma in Sports.

Mr Hogg said he was moved by the letter from Kieran's teacher asking for his help.

'I offered my full support and am extremely proud of the officers who have volunteered their services to fulfil Kieran's dream,' said Mr Hogg. 

'Helping people is what we are about and inspiring confidence in our communities is at the heart of our vision. Kieran is a young man who is an  inspiration to others and I am proud that we are able to support him on this special occasion.'
