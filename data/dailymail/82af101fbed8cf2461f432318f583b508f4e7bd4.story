Italian police have arrested 163 in a major crackdown on  the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia gang- said to be the most powerful crime organisation in the country.

The crime syndicate from Calabria, in Italy's deep south, are believed to be the biggest importers cocaine in Europe. Over the last two decades, they have outgrown rival gangs in Sicilian and Naples to be regarded as the most powerful mafia organisation in Italy.

Now Italian police have dealt a major blow to the gang as they carried out arrests across the country, with more than forty alleged members and associates detained in Calabria alone.

Officers also seized an incredible 1,300lb of drugs and found evidence of the trafficking of another 3,300lb of coke and hashish, Reuters reported.

The crackdown was coordinated by the national anti-mafia prosecutor and authorities in Bologna, who were expected to give further details of the operation later in the day.

Last week police made 31 arrests in connection with an alleged plot  by an offshoot of 'Ndrangheta to take control of Rome's cocaine trade.

Police were able to move in on the Roman operation thanks to a testimony from one of the four men arrested for Femia's murder, reported The Local Italy.

To extend its reach over the city's drug market, the 'Ndrangheta formed a hit squad to shoot dead a rival mob boss two years ago, police added. 

'The 'Ndrangheta considers Rome an integral part of its criminal project. Some members have said: 'Rome is the future',' anti-mafia magistrate Michele Prestipino said.

'The Rome marketplace is strategic and helps the clans accumulate criminal and economic power.' 

The group had logistical bases in Genoa, Milan and Turin, and sent representatives to liaise with the most violent Colombian cocaine cartels, Finance Police Commander Cosimo Di Gesu said. 

With businesses struggling to survive during six years of on-off recession in Italy, mafia groups have grown in Rome and other parts of Italy not normally associated with organised crime. 

Officers had seized more than half a ton of cocaine and cannabis, an arsenal of firearms, and a notebook detailing initiations into the mafia group.

The arrests led to police releasing previously-unseen secret footage of secret 'Ndrangheta initiation rites. 

New members swore allegiance and took an 'oath of poison' where they pledge to poison or shoot themselves if they betray their brothers.

Italian police have deciphered a mysterious document written in a secret code to reveal that it is a mafia initiation rite.

The encrypted pages were entirely covered in letters resembling Cyrillic, Arabic and ancient Chinese characters.

Investigators came across the document during a raid on the home of a murder suspect in Rome.

The document described the 'so-called baptism' into the 'Ndrangheta mafia, Italy's richest and most ruthless organised crime clan which is based in Calabria. 

Elsewhere it outlines the founding myth of Italy's mafia gangs. The 'Ndrangheta believes itself descended from one of three Spanish knights who saved the honour of their sister by killing a man, but were banished for their crime to the Sicilian island of Favignana.

There they wrote the first code of conduct and formulated the law of 'omertà' - the code of silence - before splitting up to form secret societies. 

One went to Sicily where he formed the Cosa Nostra; another went to Naples where he formed the Camorra; the third went to Calabria where he formed the 'Ndrangheta.

During the secret ceremony the recruit must use a knife to cut his skin before swearing a solemn oath of 'blood and honour'.

The initiate drinks his blood and swears 'eternal allegiance to the honoured society' promising to respect the rules of the clan, disown mother, father, brothers and sisters and settle all disputes cent for cent.'

The document lays down precise rules for the initiation rite 'For the baptism, five people are needed – no more and no less,' it said.

The oath must be recited three times as the number is considered powerful in Ndranghta tradition.

The ceremony should be carried out in a place that is consecrated by those present before with the process completed in reverse afterwards.

The three-page, hand-written document is steeped in quasi-religious superstition.

One section reads 'How should you recognise a man of honour? With a gold star on his forehead, a knight's cross on his chest and a gold palm in his hand.

'And how will you recognise these fine objects that you cannot see? Because he wears them in his flesh, skin and bone.'

The 21-letter enigma was cracked by two police officers with an interest in codes and puzzle-solving.

They were initially flummoxed but a breakthrough came when they recognised the symbol that represented the letter C, which allowed them to gradually replace the other symbols with letters.

The document provides the most complete picture of 'Ndrangheta initiations collected so far.
