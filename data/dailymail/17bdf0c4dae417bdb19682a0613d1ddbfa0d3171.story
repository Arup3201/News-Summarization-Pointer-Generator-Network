Marcus Tilley, 16, was struck by a train close to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire at a quarter to five on Monday evening.

The grief-stricken family of Mr Tilley issued a statement today through the Transport Police. They said: 'We would appreciate peace and quiet to 
grieve for and remember our beautiful son and brother, Marcus, who has 
left us all far too soon.

'Marcus had just started sixth form and was a high achiever who was doing well at school. It is both shocking and inexplicable to lose him so suddenly in such circumstances.

'We would like to thank everyone for their kind messages of support and goodwill, and to extend our sympathy to all of those who knew Marcus.'

The Headteacher of Bishop Stopford school Margret Holman said: "It is with great sadness that I report we were informed by authorities of the death of Marcus Tilley, a Year 12 student at Bishop Stopford School.

'We are profoundly shocked by this news, and our thoughts and prayers are with Marcus~ family and close friends.

'Marcus achieved highly in his GCSEs in the summer and had just begun his A Level studies. He was a popular, hard-working and committed student who will be deeply missed by all of us.
