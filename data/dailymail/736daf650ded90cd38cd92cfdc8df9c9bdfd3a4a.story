The inspiration behind one of science fiction's most fearsome characters was a simple chimney pot, it has today been claimed.

BBC designer Raymond Cusick is believed to have created Doctor Who's most evil nemesis- the Daleks - after seeing the futuristic flue atop a girls school.

According to residents close to the High School for Girls, Gloucester - where the chimney sits - it is common knowledge.

A spokeswoman at the school told the Sun: 'Whoever was working on Doctor Who saw it on top of the school.'

City
councillor Seb Field also confirmed it had been well known locally, 
saying: 'Residents told me all about it a couple of years ago.'

Mr Cusick told a BBC documentary that he picked up a pepper pot and moved it around the table, telling Mr Roberts: 'It's going to move like that - no visible means.'

Despite the success of his creation, Mr Cusick admitted that they did not work well from the beginning.

He said that on set when they moved over bumpy pavements 'they rattled like an old biscuit tin', so he had to add extra pneumatic wheels to stabilise them.

Alongside their catchphrase 'exterminate', the gliding movement became one of the Daleks' sinister defining features.

Dr Who is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.
