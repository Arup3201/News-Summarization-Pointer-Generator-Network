It was the ultimate show of respect for a disabled Vietnam war veteran on Memorial Day weekend.

Going above the call of duty, two San Diego police officers pushed Gilbert Larocque nearly two miles home after his 300-pound motorized scooter broke down on a busy road.

For the 67-year-old whose legs were injured when he worked as a door gunner in the Army, the officers' kindness is something he will never forget.

'You wouldn't expect them to do something like that … push you all the way home,' Larocque told ABC 10 News.

'I appreciate what they did. They went out of their way. How many people would stop?'

Above the call of duty: San Diego police officers Eric Cooper and Milo Shields pushed 67-year-old Vietnam veteran Gilbert Larocque nearly two miles home on his broken power scooter on Sunday

Officers Eric Cooper and Milo Shields spotted Larocque trying to flag down cars as they directed traffic on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard about 1.50pm Sunday.

When they couldn't get the scooter started, they offered to push Larocque home in the hot sun.

Cooper, the son of a veteran, and Shields, a veteran, said they didn't think twice about helping out the stranded local.

'The least I could do was push him, you know. That's the least I could do. He's sacrificed and given so much to this country,' Officer Shields said.

'We think about veterans one day a year.
 We should think about them more. Memorial Day and we move on, but every
 day to me is Memorial Day.'

However the kindhearted cops didn't anticipate how difficult pushing the 300 pound scooter would be. 

'We 
thought it was going to be like pushing a shopping cart, but we were 
fighting against the transmission the whole time,' Cooper told UT San Diego. 

Cooper told ABC 10 News: 'Whenever we got to an intersection, 
we'd be in the middle of an intersection, pushing this guy and it would 
just lock up, so we'd have to drag this thing through the intersection.'

After they got Larocque home, the SDPD 
sergeant who filmed the officers' kind gesture picked them up and returned them to their patrol car.

Larocque told Fox 5 San Diego he had only traveled three miles when his scooter died.

He was running errands for his 90-year-old father, a Pearl Harbor survivor, who he cares for.

He said he's had trouble walking ever since he suffered burn injuries in Vietnam.

'I was surprised that [the officers would] push me that far,' Larocque told Fox 5 News.
