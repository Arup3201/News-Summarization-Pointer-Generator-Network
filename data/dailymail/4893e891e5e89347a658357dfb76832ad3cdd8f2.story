Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has warned that, for many people, their standards of living are falling

The Archbishop of York has warned of the growth of a 'new poor' who have jobs and work hard but still live in poverty.

Dr John Sentamu, second in the hierarchy of the Church of England, told its General Synod that many people who previously enjoyed comfortable lifestyles were seeing their standard of living fall significantly.

Such people - who he called 'the new poor' - feel they are going 'down the social scale' through no fault of their own, he said.

'Unlike the chief executives, many hard-pressed people find that they are on a 'down escalator',' he said. 'That phrase captures more than just a shortage of money - it adds a sense of descending the social scale.'

Dr Sentamu added that many such people no longer believed that they could provide a better life for their children than they had enjoyed themselves.

'Formerly, each new generation enjoyed a higher standard of living than the previous one,' he said.

'That was the progress that everybody was taught to expect. It was a source of hope.

'But now the gains are being reversed. Many people believe their children will be worse off financially than they are.'

He added that while 'once upon a time, you could not really be living in poverty if you had regular wages', this was 'no longer so'.

Now, he said, 'you can be in work and still live in poverty', adding: 'Politicians often refer to hard-working families. They should speak instead of hard-pressed families.'

Speaking in his presidential address to the Gerneal Synod - the parliament of the Church of England - Dr Sentamu said the annual salaries of chief executives of Britain's 100 largest companies 'reached an average of Â£4.3 million last year, or 160 times average wages'.

Meanwhile, he said, 27,000 people in Leeds were diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition last year - 'not in Lesotho, not Liberia, not Lusaka, but Leeds.'

The NHS defines malnutrition as poor nutrition, and it can include people who eat too much or eat the wrong things as well as those who eat too little.

Dr Sentamu said such figures left a 'dark stain on our consciences' - but he added it was a 'hard economic fact' that wage rises were likely to lag behind price rises in future, as a result of global competition for jobs and technological advances.

'This is the new reality. Food banks are not going to go away any time soon,' the Archbishop said.

'Prices are rising more than three times faster than wages.

'This has been going on for 10 years now. And for people slipping into poverty, the reality is much harsher.'

Official poverty figures, which draw a poverty line at 60 per cent of average household income, have been showing that rising numbers of people with jobs have been falling into poverty since 2004 - three years before the onset of recession.

Last week a study for the York-based Joseph Rowntree Foundation by the left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research said that traditional families with stay-at-home mothers and fathers who work are now more likely than to be poor than any other kind of family.

There were more families with stay-at-home mothers in poverty than two-parent families where the household lives on benefits, or benefit dependent single-parent families, it found.

The study said nearly one in three - 30 per cent - of the families with children who live below the official poverty line are families where only one parent works.

The Archbishop said the need to combat poverty could provide the CofE with a moment similar to the foundation of Methodism 250 years ago, when John Wesley concentrated heavily on the poor and working people.

'The Church of England, I believe, has arrived at another such moment', Dr Sentamu said.

'Confronting poverty is again rising to the top of the agenda.'
