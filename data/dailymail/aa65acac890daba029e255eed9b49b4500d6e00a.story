The US is to speed up deliveries of missiles and surveillance drones to Iraq as the Baghdad government battles a resurgence of Al Qaeda linked militants.

Joe Biden, the US vice president, spoke by phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki yesterday and 'expressed concern for those Iraqis who are suffering at the hands of terrorists,' a statement said.

The Pentagon said Washington would accelerate the delivery of 100 more Hellfire missiles - which were due to be sent to Iraq in the next few months.

Colonel Steven Warren said an additional 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones would also be delivered.

Hellfire missiles, originally designed as an anti-tank weapon, can be fired from helicopters and warplanes. ScanEagle drones are a low-cost three-meter aircraft capable of flying 24 hours.

Officials reiterated today that American forces will not be sent in to assist military operations.

Col Warren said Washington was working with Iraq to develop a 'holistic strategy to isolate al Qaeda-affiliated groups so the tribes working with the security forces can drive them out of the populated areas.'

Instead, the United States will continue to provide intelligence to assist and advise the Iraqis at a 'ministerial level' through some 100 military personnel still based at the US Embassy in Baghdad.

The deliveries correspond to contracts already signed with Iraq. Some 75 Hellfire missiles were delivered to Baghdad in mid-December, US officials said.

Since then, Iraq has seen a resurgence of fighting in the province of Anbar, which was a key insurgent stronghold for years following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Mr al-Maliki has been urging residents of the city of Fallujah to expel Al Qaeda fighters or face all-out battle.

Mr Biden lent his support to Iraq's fight against the local al-Qaida branch, adding he was concerned about those suffering from terrorism.

Outbreak: A man stands by scores of empty shells. VP Joe Biden and Iraqi PM Nuri al-Maliki discussed the importance of working with Sunni leaders to isolate extremists

He spoke positively about recent co-operation between Iraq's military and tribal forces in Anbar, on the Syrian border, where Al Qaeda are among the most formidable trying to topple President Bashar Assad.

'Prime Minister Maliki affirmed the importance of working closely with Iraq's Sunni leaders and communities to isolate extremists,' the White House said.

With the US worried about the sectarian nature of the growing violence, Mr Biden also spoke to Iraqi parliament Speaker Osama al-Nujaifi - a Sunni leader and frequent critic of Mr al-Maliki's Shiite-led government.

The two discussed ways to continue co-operation between Sunni communities and the Shiite-led government and Mr al-Nujaifi said he was committed to fighting terrorism, the White House said.

Devastation: Damaged buildings in Fallujah. The US government denied violence in the country was down to a withdrawal of American forces

US officials denied suggestions renewed violence was down to the withdrawal of American forces.

Yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said such violence in Iraq took place even when there were 150,000 US troops there.

He said the US can assist, and will deliver more missiles and surveillance drones to Iraq this year, but insisted Iraq must take the lead.

'If members (of Congress) were suggesting that there should be American troops fighting and dying in Fallujah today, they should say so,' Mr Carney said.

'The president doesn't believe that.'
