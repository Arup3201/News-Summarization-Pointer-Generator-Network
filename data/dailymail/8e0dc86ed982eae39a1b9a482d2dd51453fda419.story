England captain Alastair Cook buried the hatchet with Shane Warne before receiving a barrage of criticism over his leadership as his side blew yet another golden opportunity on Thursday.

India recovered from 145 for seven to 290 for nine on day one of the second Investec Test at Lord’s after being put in to bat by Cook on a pitch perfectly suited to England’s battery of fast bowlers.

Cook’s tactics were labelled ‘dreadful’ and ‘unfathomable’ while former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said his side ‘completely lost the plot’ as centurion Ajinkya Rahane helped India add 150 runs in the evening session and England resorted to repeatedly bowling bouncers.

It also emerged that Warne, who 
described Cook’s captaincy at Headingley against Sri Lanka last month as
 ‘the worst I’ve ever seen’, had called the England captain to clear the
 air.

Off the hook: India ended the day 290 for 9 after recovering from 145 for seven after being sent in

Big call: Shane Warne sought out Cook's mobile number to arrange a chat about recent criticism

‘It was all starting to get a bit out of control,’ said Warne. ‘I asked for his number and I texted him to see if we could have five minutes on the phone. We spoke for about an hour about lots of different things. I had my say, he had his say. He told me how he felt and I told him how I felt about certain things. It was good to clear the air and it was amicable. It was just good to speak about stuff other than cricket as well.’

The England bowlers were more to blame for India wriggling off the hook on day one at Lord's but Cook’s captaincy was still criticised by Boycott and former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss.

Boycott said: ‘As a batsman, I start thinking that I’m going to get out if I get four good balls an over. England couldn’t manage that. They could only do it once an over. They then lost the plot when Liam Plunkett went round the wicket and started to bang it in. Cook is not going to make it as a tactical captain - the lads might like him in the dressing room, but not as a tactical captain. Sorry.’

Strauss added: ‘England have sat back here rather than make things happen. You can go a long way towards winning a game on the first morning at Lord’s but you have to make things happen. I can’t fathom some of the tactics.’

At least it was a good day for Gary Ballance, who was under the spotlight after his drunken, topless antics following the first Test in Nottingham. The Yorkshire batsman eased some of the pressure on him by snaffling two sharp slip catches in the morning session.

The ICC have appointed Australian judge Gordon Lewis to hear the code of conduct cases against Jimmy Anderson and Ravi Jadeja following last week’s Trent Bridge Test. There will be a preliminary hearing next Tuesday before a date is set for the final hearing which could see both men banned for part of the series.
