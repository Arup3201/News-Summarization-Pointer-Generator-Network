A Chinese man who chopped up his parents and kept their heads in a fridge has said it was their own fault for not treating him properly.

Chau Hoi-leung, 30, had been raised by his loving parents who gave him everything, according to friends.

But when his parents told him he should get a job and that they were reluctant to continue funding his lavish lifestyle, he severed ties with them and accused them of abandoning him.

On trial: Chau Hoi-Leung killed his parents, chopped their bodies and cooked them with rice, a court in Hong Kong has heard

Murder victims: Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, were chopped up and cooked with rice

Then, when Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, got an invitation to lunch at his flat in Hong Kong they thought he was prepared to put the matter behind him.

But with the help of his 36-year-old friend Tse Chun-kei, Chau chopped up the bodies and cooked them with rice.

The court where the pair are on trial for murder heard that they had prepared for the murder carefully over a three-month period.

They bought sharpened knives and large refrigerators in which to store the cut up bodies, as well as getting microwaves and a rice cooker.

Hardened detectives spoke of their shock when they turned up at the man's flat to look for clues after his parents were reported missing in March, and stumbled on the two heads that had been stored in the fridge.

Chau tried to plead guilty through diminished responsibility caused by the stress of his parents' treatment

Other body parts were found in the deep freeze and bloodstains were still on the floor. Parts of a body that had not fitted into the freezer had been salted and packed into lunchboxes.

But despite the carefully planned killing, Hong Kong's Court of First Instance heard that Chau claimed he was not to blame because he had been emotionally abandoned by his parents, and was therefore not in his right mind.

He tried to plead guilty through diminished responsibility caused by the stress of his parents' treatment, but this was rejected by prosecutors who have demanded the pair be convicted of murder.

He had also tried to cover up the deaths by reporting his parents missing and told police that the elderly pair had said they were going to mainland China to have some fun.

Suspicious detectives however had decided to search his flat and not only found the bodies, but also found notes and receipts detailing the careful planning that went into the two murders.

Michael Arthur, prosecuting, said: 'Their crime was greatly premeditated. Their planning was extensive.'

The trial continues.
