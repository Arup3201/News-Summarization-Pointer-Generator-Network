A testy exchange between IRS commissioner John Koskinen and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan broke out during a Ways and Means hearing on Friday, with Ryan shouting at the IRS chief at one point, 'I don't
 believe you! This is incredible!'

The explosive back and forth came after Koskinen testified that emails belonging to Lois Lerner and six other IRS officials were not 
necessarily 'lost' forever and claims made otherwise by Ways and Means chairman Rep. Dave Camp were 'inaccurate.'

'At this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives,' he said.

Koskinen told committee members that his agency isn't certain yet that it can't retrieve old emails from employees caught up in a scheme to target conservative organizations, which is why he didn't tell Congress that several hard drives containing copies of the emails had crashed until he was about them on Monday.

'This is not being forthcoming. This is being misleading again,' Republican Rep. Paul Ryan shouted IRS Commissioner John Koskinen during a House Ways and Means hearing today

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee today that it is still 'too early' know if Lois Lerner and other IRS officials' emails are irretrievable

At issue throughout the committee hearing was whether the IRS purposefully kept the missing emails and crashed hard drives a secret for months.

Koskinen did not inform the Ways and Means committee until last Friday about Lerner's computer crash despite having knowledge of it since February.

He did not tell the committee about the computer crashes affecting the emails of the other six IRS officials until the committee directly asked him for the information on Monday, even though the Department of Treasury sent him a letter last spring encouraging him to tell Congress about the situation as soon as possible.

'You say that you've lost the emails, but what you've lost is all credibility,' Camp said during his opening remarks.

During his testimony Koskinen said that in reviewing the emails his agency does still have on hand from Lois Lerner, the IRS found out that IRS tried to have the data from her damaged hard drive extracted - including her emails - before it was recycled and destroyed, but she was informed by employees on the IRS' technical team that it was 'unrecoverable.'

He also claimed it wasn't shocking that multiple employees within an agency as large as the IRS had computer malfunctions.

After Koskinen finished with his initial statement, Camp angrily told him, 'What I didn't hear was an apology.'

'I don't think that an apology is owed,' Koskinen fired back. 'Not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation.'

Every email has been produced or will be produced, he said.

The IRS chief blasted Camp for putting out a press release this week claiming that emails from the Chief of Staff for the former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, Nikole Flax, had been lost after her computer crashed.

If Camp had waited, Koskinen said, he would have found out that Flax had two computers - a work computer and a laptop.

'So it turns out that none of her emails were lost,' he said.

'Why should anyone believe you?' Rep. Kevin Brady asked Koskinen during his allotted Q and A period.

'This is the most corrupt and deceitful IRS in the history,' Brady said

'You say that you've lost the emails, but what you've lost is all credibility,' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp told Koskinen in his opening remarks

After Koskinen had been badgered by a handful of Republican members of the committee, including Brady, Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, apologized to the IRS head for his colleagues' behavior, and Lewis yielded his time for questioning to Koskinen so he could defend himself.

'To say that this is the most IRS corrupt IRS in history ignores a lot of history,' Koskinen said during his borrowed time.

When the questioning by Republicans resumed, Rep. Paul Ryan exploded at Lewis and Koskinen.

'This is unbelievable! The apology that ought to be given is to the American taxpayer, not to a government agency that is abusing it's power!,' he said.

'Nobody believes you!'

Ryan confronted the IRS head about not telling Congress about the six other crashed computers, to which Koskinen retorted, 'We told you on Monday.'

'Because we asked you,' Ryan fired back.

Koskinen tried to explain himself, but Ryan kept interrupting and shouting at him until another Democratic Rep. Sander Levin butted in.

'Will you let him answer the question?' Levin asked Ryan.

'I didn't ask him a a question!' Ryan shouted at his colleague.

'I am not yielding time, I control the time!'

Other members of Congress were hard on Koskinen during the hearing, but none as confrontational as Ryan.

Among Koskinen's defenders was the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Sander Levin, who posited that Lerner's computer crash wasn't a 'conspiracy' by the IRS to cover up malfeasance.

'There has not been any evidence of political motivation or White House involvement' in the targeting of conservative political groups, he said.

'The prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the Republicansâ€™ desire to stir their base, tie the problem to the White House and keep up this drum beat until the November election,' Levin claimed.
