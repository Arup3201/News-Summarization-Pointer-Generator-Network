As baby George makes the first in what is to be a string of public appearances, we can see clearly that he appears to have inherited his father's sandy locks, rather than Kate's dark mane.

Of course, many babies start off blonde, then darken as they get older. So he may well end up with his mother's chestnut locks. But for now, he and his father share a rather fluffy, fine, sandy thatch.

And both father and son's coiffures were left rather ruffled by the stiff New Zealand breeze.

George's little tufts went flying, as did his father's.

Kate - freshly tended to by on-board hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker (paid for by
 Prince Charles out of his private fortune) - looked eminently salon-worthy, if a little wind-whipped. A red pillbox hat secured her long hair.

Top stylist Cook Tucker charges £300 a day, plus 
travel costs, for her hairdressing services. She previously accompanied the Duchess of Cambridge on the Diamond 
Jubilee tour of the Far East in September 2012, when Prince Charles again footed the bill.

However, unlike Kate, the Duke of Cambridge and his crowning glory were left to face the elements without the administrations of a personal hairdresser, the protection of hairspray - or even a hat.

But the prince battled on, rubbing noses and shaking hands with local dignitaries, all the while looking very looking debonair in a navy suit, worn with blue and red tie and pale blue shirt.

The prince, at 31, is four years younger than his father Prince Charles was on his own tour of the Commonwealth in 1983.

Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales undertook a journey similar to that which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will tackle over the next few weeks - Princes William and George even the same age.
