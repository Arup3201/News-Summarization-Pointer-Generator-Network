Flanders fields today bears little sign of the four years of war that claimed so many thousands of lives and ravaged this small corner of the Western Front.

But further down, deep below the surface there remains a constant reminder of the bravery and daring of the men who risked their lives for their country.

Beneath the farmers ploughs, most of the tunnels and dug-outs hewn from the earth by English pitmen to literally undermine the German offensive remain intact, untouched for almost 100 years.

They were also the scene of fierce hand-to-hand combat between diggers from both armies, as portrayed in the Sebastian Faulks novel Birdsong.

The tunnel sealed off by British troops during the First World War was excavated in 1997 and found to be intact

Tunnel engineer Johan Wanderwalle discovered that the tunnels had flooded, but remained intact in the 80 years after the First World War

The British Tunnelling Companies were
formed in the early months of the war to counter the German miners who 
were blowing British trenches from shallow underground workings.

Pitmen from mining 
communities in Wales and the north and the ‘clay-kickers’ who built the 
London Underground and the Manchester sewers were recruited, some from 
infantry battalions others direct from civilian life.

Not only did, they offered vital support to the war effort, providing protected shelter for the troops.By
the time Armistice came the secret underground army had dug mile after 
mile of tunnel and hundreds of deep dug-outs designed to house 
headquarters, hospitals, stores and men.

The excavation uncovered a number items that had belonged to German soldiers such as bottles, a shoe, digging tools and even a gun and some bullets

These
never seen before images of one of the tunnels were taken by British 
photographer Jeff Moore during an excavation with tunnelling engineer 
Johan Wanderwalle in 1997.

And
the story behind the tunnel found by Mr Wanderwalle echoes the action 
in Birdsong, an adaptation of which is currently being screened by the 
BBC.

The
tunnel was being dug by British troops to undermine the Germans who were diggning in the opposite direction, Mr Moore told Mail Online.

But
the 
German soldiers realised what was happening and changed course and dug 
into the clay-kickers’ tunnel before the British troops had a chance to 
lay explosives.

In the novel Birdsong, Stephen Wraysford (played by Eddie Redmayne, pictured, in the current BBC adaptation) is trapped by an explosion in an underground tunnel

There was an underground fight before the British soldiers pulled out and sealed up the tunnel.

Such fighting was not uncommon. With so much mining activity being carried out by both sides, detection and breakthrough into each others tunnelling systems occurred frequently.

For this purpose the British diggers prepared a 'camouflet', a pre-prepared charge which was always ready during tunnelling.

If that wasn't detonated, vicious hand-to-hand fighting with picks, shovels and wood used as makeshift weapons might take place.

The restrictions and conditions of the underground tunnels meant the miners could not use their rifles.

If the opposing side were unsuccessful in repelling an attack, then enemy tunnels could be used for short periods to observe enemy tunnelling activity and direction.

During the 1997 excavation Mr Wanderwalle found a number of items belonging to the Germans - as well as the bodies of four dead soldiers.

Mr Wanderwalle said: ‘Above ground everything was cleaned up and re-built after the war and there is no sign that anything happened here but once you get underground you find everything just as it was all those years ago.’

'My first one was in 1990. No one had done it before then so my friends and I had to learn how to work underground. The entrances were filled up with earth and rubbish after the war so you have to carefully dig them out.

'Once you get past the entrance you find everything is as it had just been left, as if it had just happened. The waters came in and flooded it and preserved everything just as if it was yesterday.

'I have done so many now I can look at the entrance to a tunnel and I know by the way the timbers are arranged which of the Tunnelling Companies built it but inside everyone is different, you never know what you'll find.'

One of the first World War survivors who
was involved in protecting the tunnels first hand was Albert 'Smiler' 
Marshall who was serving in the trenches with the Essex Yeomanry in 1915
when he was caught in a mine blast.

Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were specialist units of the Corps of Royal Engineers within the British Army, formed to dig attacking tunnels under enemy lines during the First World War.

The stalemate situation in the early part of the war led to the deployment of tunnel warfare.

After the first German Empire attacks on 21 December 1914, through shallow tunnels underneath no man’s land and exploding ten mines under the trenches of the Indian Sirhind Brigade, the British began forming suitable units.

In February 1915, eight Tunnelling Companies were created and operational in Flanders from March 1915.

By mid-1916, the British Army had around 25,000 trained tunnellers, mostly taken from coal mining communities.

Almost twice that number of ‘attached infantry’ worked permanently alongside the trained miners to carry out grunt work.

From the spring of 1917 the war became more mobile, with grand offensives at Arras, Messines and Passchendaele.

The tactics and counter-tactics required deeper and deeper tunnelling, so offensive and defensive military mining largely ceased.

Underground work continued, though, with the tunnellers concentrating on deep dugouts for troop accommodation, a tactic used particularly in the Battle of Arras.

His experience was not dissimilar to 
that of Stephen Wraysford, the character from Sebastian Faulk novel 
Birdsong, who gets caught up in a blast from underground mines with his 
friend, a tunneller called Jack Firebrace.

In
an interview before he passed away 'Smiler' said: ‘We knew there was 
tunnelling going on around and about because our engineers were working 
there and we used to help them with carrying parties and protection and 
that sort of thing.

'Somehow
or other our intelligence got to know there was a German mine 
underneath us and when they were going to blow it up we came out of that
section of trench but we didn't come out far enough because we didn't 
know exactly the spot where it was or how much explosive they had.

'There
was this terrific bang and it made a damn great crater you could drop a
house into and two of our chaps got buried there. Others got buried 
with just their two legs, some were up to their waist and one had only 
just got his head out.

'I got hit. I'd have been alright if I hadn't fell down only there was so much dirt came down on us it knocked me on my back and as I laid on my back in the trench my leg got trapped and I couldn't move it.

'Eventually it settled down a bit and someone shouted “is Smiler alright?”, so I shouted out that I'm quite alright but I can't move and I'm lying on my back in the trench and I've got to wait 'till someone comes to dig me out.

'The voice was shouting "tell him to sing" so that was how they found me, lying down there singing Nearer My God To Thee. Two men were buried completely and that was their grave, we didn't have time to bury them properly.'

Smiler's comrades joined the list of 54,896 ‘missing; British soldiers who still lie in the fields in Ypres, their names recorded on the nearby Menin Gate, their bodies obliterated by shellfire or hastily interred in shallow graves and never found by the burial parties on their grim rounds after the war.
