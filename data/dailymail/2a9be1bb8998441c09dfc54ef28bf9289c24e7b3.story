Barcelona defender Gerard Pique says the penalty against him that got Real Madrid on their way to a 3-1 win was the right decision by Spanish referee Jesus Gil Manzano.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored in the 35th minute from the spot after Pique handled the ball in the area while attempting to block Marcelo's cross.

And the 27-year-old said: 'I went down and couldn't get my hand out of the way. I didn't mean to but it definitely touched my hand so it was a fair penalty.

Barcelona's Pique rubs his brow during the La Liga defeat against Real Madrid on Saturday evening

'In the first half we didn't suffer so much because we had more control of the game and went ahead early though Neymar's goal.

'But then they went 2-1 up and we tried to attack. Obviously when you try to attack in the Bernabeu, they can hit you on the counter attack. They are really quick and can hurt you.'

Real defender Sergio Ramos reiterated Pique's analysis that the home side's counter-attacking methods were too strong for La Liga rivals Barcelona.

Ramos said: 'Normally we play on the counter attack, especially against a team like Barcelona who are used to having the ball all the time.

'But (on Saturday) it was the opposite. We pushed into their half and managed to keep hold of it when we were there.

'I think those were the moments that they suffered the most. We are very happy about that, it was great work from the team.

'We will go home very happy for both reducing the points deficit and winning the game in this emphatic manner.'
