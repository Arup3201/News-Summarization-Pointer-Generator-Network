This is the bruised face of a prostitute who claims that she was assaulted by a leading economist after the pair smoked crack together.

Professor Douglas McWilliams, executive chairman of influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, allegedly attacked Beverly Shearon at her flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Ms Shearon reportedly called police after she was left with a black eye and an injury to her hand, claiming McWilliams had 'flipped out' when a neighbour arrived at the one-bedroom flat.

In the first image of the 47-year-old's injuries dark bruising to her right eye is clearly visible.

Accused: Douglas McWilliams outside his London home today. He was reportedly questioned under caution over claims he assaulted Beverley Shearon after the pair smoked crack together

She claims the pair had smoked crack cocaine together, and she had performed a sex act on the married 63-year-old when he visited her unannounced on New Year's Eve.

He reportedly left before police arrived, but was later questioned under caution by officers.  

 'I didn't want him to come in really, but because he was there and I was thinking of all the neighbours, I said OK, come in,' said Ms Shearon, who was trying to quit her drug habit. 

'I've told him that the last four times I've seen him, that I don't want to do that any more.

'He said: 'Oh come on, it's New Year's Eve, have one more smoke for me.'

'I was weak and I did.' 

Ms Shearon, who calls McWilliams 'Posh Rob', said his mood changed suddenly when a neighbour called in to wish her a Happy New Year.

She alleged McWilliams, who she said had been a regular visitor to her home in the past year, had then attacked her in front of the well-wisher, before leaving the flat. 

 'He smashed me so aggressively my head hit the wall really hard. He was on top of me, I couldn't breathe. I was trying to get him off, I was shouting: 'Help me, help me!'

Her neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I was paralysed, I was just in shock and couldn't believe my eyes. I feel awful that I didn't step in to help her, but I shouted, 'Call the police', and that spooked him and he ran off, but not before he got a few more punches in.' 

Ms Shearon said that she first met McWilliams in Camden Town after visiting a client and had known him for six years.

Ms Shearon said McWilliams changed his behaviour when a neighbour arrived at her home in St Albans (above) to wish her a Happy New Year

'I first met him in Camden Town, I was walking along, I'd been to see a client and he was obviously kerb crawling because he pulled up and asked me for crack.

'He took me to a hotel room that he'd already booked. A horrible dingy place. I gave him my phone number and he started seeing me. He'd come and pick me up and take me to a hotel every month. We'd binge and then he'd drop me off at the nearest train station, usually Kentish Town.

Miss Shearon said he'd come to see her in an Audi TT, a Jaguar and a blue Aston Martin.

'I thought I'd got rid of him, I was trying to come clean. But a few months ago he turned up out of the blue, and he was influencing me to take crack and was saying I should get heroin. He is an evil man.

'He'd come round for hours and sometimes I'd have to pretend I had a phone call to get him to leave.

'Sometimes he comes to my house and I just turn the lights off and keep quiet in the hope that he'll think I'm not in.

'He'd spend £1,000 on crack in one go. He'd bring other prostitutes around here that he'd picked up in Kings Cross.

'He called himself Rob and told me he was an advisor for British Telecom, and he'd say things like: 'I'm waiting for this deal to come through, that'll be a nice £50,000 for me.'

'Once he told me he had to rearrange because he had to be in the House of Commons.

Police arrived at the one-bedroom property and are said to have taken photographs of her injuries  

'He never wore a wedding ring, but I'd heard him on the phone to his wife lying and saying his car had broken down.

'I could hear her on the other end of the line saying: 'Just come home darling.'

'I was thinking, you scumbag.' 

'I told him I knew his real identity, but I told him he could trust me, because I've got other clients, barristers and a vicar for example, people I've known for years. You have to be discreet.

'But when he did this to me, I was shaken up. 

‘I think more women and girls might come forward. He hit me like it was nothing. I’m terrified he’s going to come round or send someone round to hurt me.

‘He’s the most horrible man I’ve ever met. He’s a raging crackhead, he really is.' 

'Police are investigating an ABH assault which is alleged to have occurred at an address in St Albans at around 5pm on Wednesday, December 31st,' a Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline.

'A woman reported she had been assaulted, she suffered an injury to her hand and bruising to her face.

'A 63-year-old man from London has been interviewed under caution and investigations are on-going at this time. No drug offences are being investigated.'

McWilliams has not commented on the claims. A CEBR spokesman told MailOnline the claims involving McWilliams were 'not a matter' for the think-tank.

A representative of McWilliams told The Sun he had been unable to contact the economist since Friday evening.

'I am aware he has denied this lady's allegation,' he said. 

Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'.

On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about his predictions regarding the British economy, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.'

He set up the think-tank in 1992 having previously served as Chief Economic Adviser to the Confederation of British Industry and Chief Economist for IBM UK. 

The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR's clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.'

It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.'

McWilliams has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off  by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget.

He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.'

In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world's fifth largest economy.

The growth in Britain's national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries.
