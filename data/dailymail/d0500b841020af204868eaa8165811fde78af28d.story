Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has landed himself in hot water after declaring on social media that all Egyptians are white and treated 'blacks as slaves'.

Social media users are urging people to boycott of Exodus: Gods and Kings, which tells the story of Moses, calling it ‘offensive’ and ‘unacceptable’ that white actors are playing the roles of Egyptians.

The News Corp owner tweeted a post declaring that he didn't see what the problem was with  film director Ridley Scott's decision to cast white people in the leading roles because Murdoch all Egyptians he knows are white.

Twitter followers launched into the 83-year-old who then dug an even bigger hole when trying to explain his remark.

Murdoch was told he was ignorant and misinformed in tweets

Murdoch then attempted to explain his stance which only angered Twitter followers even more

Mr Murdoch's post that started the Twitter outrage says: 'Moses film attacked on Twitter for all white cast. Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are.'

One follower sarcastically asked if Murdoch had attempted satire while simply asked him to 'STOP.' 

Omar X lashed out describing his statement as 'bull***t'.

'For someone who runs the world's media, you're a rather ill-informed moron.' he posted.

Someone who goes by the twitter handle - Heauxbehavior - echoed those sentiments.

'You're funny. And TERRIBLY misinformed. And beyond ignorant.'

While a woman named Amy ‏posted: 'Jesus Rupe, all that money and you know hee-haw about people.'

Murdoch then attempted to explain his stance by saying: 'Everybody-attacks last tweet. Of course Egyptians are Middle Eastern, but far from black. They treated blacks as slaves.'

However, Murdoch did not stop there and clearly became agitated by the negative comments 

This added fuel to the Twitter fire for followers

This only angered Twitter followers even more.

'It seems @rupertmurdoch's Twitter account has been hacked by @rupertmurdoch,' Richard Robbins posted.

'Ever tired of being wrong?' asked someone who goes by the Twitter handle: StopSelfServatives.

Twitter users did hold back on their thoughts of Murdoch's remarks

However, Murdoch did not stop there and clearly became agitated by the negative comments.

'Okay, there are many shades of color. Nothing racist about that, so calm down!' he posted.

'Uh oh, did Uncle Rupie say something racist again? #RacistRupert,' Jeff Cormier posted.

Shawn Pasternak suggested that Murdoch should stop while he's behind.

'@rupertmurdoch no really, delete your account,' he tweeted.

Cindy Chin asked Murdoch if he was referring to his' Egyptian cotton sheets'.

Director Ridley Scott said he would not have been able to finance its $40 millionUSD budget if he had hired unknown Egyptian actors instead of established Hollywood stars

The controversy has stemmed from Scott's decision to employ white actors in the leading roles claiming he would not have been able to finance its $40 millionUSD budget if he had hired unknown Egyptian actors instead of established Hollywood stars.

The title role is played by Christian Bale, which one Twitter user said was ‘akin to casting George Clooney to play Malcolm X’.

The film, which opens on Boxing Day, also features Sigourney Weaver, Australian Joel Edgerton and Aaron Paul, who is best known for his role as Jessie in the hit television series Breaking Bad.

While a number of ethnic minority actors have also been cast, including Sir Ben Kingsley, the majority of the non-white performers are in background roles, often even playing slaves or criminals. 

The hashtag #boycottexodusmovie has been trending on Twitter as posters express movie fans' anger over the film's casting of white actors as Egyptians.
