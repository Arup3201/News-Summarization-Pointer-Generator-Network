With Wayne Rooney being dragged back to Manchester United pre season training earlier than usual, he seems to be making the most of the summer break - and Turkey is his latest stop off.

Rooney has already made trips to Las Vegas and Barbados to end a busy summer that also saw him spend an all too brief spell with England in Brazil.

And with less than a week left until he starts what will likely be an intense pre season under new boss Louis van Gaal, Rooney is making the most of his final days away from the day job.

United’s
 players have been used to a month’s rest after major tournaments in the
 past, but the club are sticking to the three-week break stipulated in 
their contracts to ensure the majority of their big names are on show in
 the USA.

Van Gaal is anxious to have all the players together as soon as possible so he can start working with his new squad, and United are also mindful of their commercial obligations as they begin a £326million seven-year shirt sponsorship with American car giant Chevrolet.

United’s first game is the Chevrolet Cup against LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday July, 23, followed by three games against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup.

It means that Rooney and his England teammates Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw will board the transatlantic flight from Manchester just 23 days after touching down from Brazil.

They will be joined by the likes of Juan Mata, David De Gea, Nani, Antonio Valencia and Shinji Kagawa, although players whose countries reached the knockout stages of the World Cup will be given extra time off.

Holland coach Van Gaal has already told United that he is ready to go straight to work after the tournament.
