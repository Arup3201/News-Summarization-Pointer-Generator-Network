A New England Patriots player involved in a homicide investigation is being sued for allegedly shooting a friend in the face, it has emerged.

Tight end Aaron Hernandez has been questioned by police over the death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, whose body was found near his $1.3million home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

He has also been accused of injuring his friend and personal assistant Alexander Bradley during a fight at a Miami nightclub in February.

Bradley is suing the NFL star, claiming he lost one eye when a gun owned by Hernandez went off in his car as they drove away together following a heated argument.

Star: Aaron Hernandez is involved in a murder investigation and is also being sued over an alleged shooting

Victim: Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez

Hernandez, 23, is said to be a suspect in the 
death of Mr Lloyd, 27, a Boston Bandits players who was apparently shot 
dead in an industrial park less than a mile away from Hernandez's home 
on Monday evening.

Last week, the Patriots star was made the subject of a lawsuit filed by Mr Bradley,
who is seeking damages to compensate him for the loss of his eye, which
has apparently forced him to undergo several operations in hospital.

His lawyer David Jaroslawicz told ABC News: 'A bullet went through my client's arm and blew out his 
right eye. It has been 
enucleated - replaced with a prosthetic eye. He has also lost use of 
his right arm.'

Mr Bradley has also claimed that Hernandez did not have a licence for the gun that was discharged.

No criminal charges are believed to 
have been filed over the case, and Miami police have been unable to 
confirm whether or not they have any record of the incident, said to 
have taken place in February.

Odin Lloyd's uncle said he had last 
seen his nephew on Sunday and described as a 'good guy' who lived in 
Dorchester and loved football.

Since 2007, Lloyd had been a linebacker for the Bandits semi-pro football team, Olivier Bustin, the team’s head coach told Boston.com.

He
said Lloyd, a speedy pass rushing specialist listed at 5-foot-11 and 
215 pounds, learned to play football at the John D. O’Bryant School of 
Mathematics and Science, in Roxbury.

'We
had our first scrimmage on Saturday night,' he told the Boston Globe. 
'He participated. He played well. Was in good spirits. He was helping 
mentor a younger player.'

The scrimmage finished around 9:30pm and that was the last Bustin heard from Lloyd, he said.

'He
was a very personable player,' he said. 'Every person on our team got 
along with him. I can’t remember any player having any beef with him.'

Massachusetts State police spoke to Hernandez on Monday and are seeking a warrant to search his home in North Attleboro

A
neighbor of Odin’s told WBZ they had seen Hernandez in the neighborhood
and that Odin dated the sister of Hernandez’s girlfriend.

Massachusetts State police spoke to Hernandez on Monday and sought a warrant to search his home. Law enforcement sources described him as 'uncooperative'.

During the search on Monday, two men 
tried to leave the $1.3 million, 5,600-square foot home, which is 
outfitted with a home gym and a swimming pool, but were stopped on the 
drive by police.

According to ABC News, their car was also searched.

The
news service also said a hand-delivered package arrived addressed for 
Hernandez during the time of the search, from a well-known law firm.

A rental vehicle with Rhode Island plates was recovered near the scene, which led investigators to Hernandez, sources told ABC News.

The
jogger who found the body on Monday - who did not want to be identified -
described what he saw to WBZ-TV: 'I saw an African-American male, 
probably 25-35 years old, decently dressed.

'He
was stiff, motionless, one of the police officers came back later and 
said it looked the guy had been shot somewhere else and dumped here.'

A
fourth-round pick in the 2010 draft, Hernandez was named to the Pro 
Bowl in his second season. Last season he caught 51 passes and scored 
five touchdowns for the Patriots.

He is spending the off-season recovering from a shoulder scope.

Hernandez,
a University of Florida Graduate and native of Bristol, Connecticut., 
was drafted by the Patriots in 2010. He had five touchdowns for the Pats
during the 2012 season.

On
August 27, 2012, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a five-year 
extension, which included a $12.5 million signing bonus, the largest 
signing bonus ever given to an NFL tight end, and the second-largest 
extension ever, after teammate Rob Gronkowski's.
