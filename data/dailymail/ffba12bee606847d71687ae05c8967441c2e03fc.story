Four British have men appeared in court accused of a plot to smuggle £100  million  of cocaine into the UK.

Stephen Powell, 47, was arrested following the seizure  of about a ton of cocaine on a yacht Makayabella last week. The vessel was detained 200 miles off south-west Ireland in an operation involving the Irish Naval Service and Britain’s National Crime Agency.

Powell, of Guiseley, Leeds, was remanded in custody by Leeds magistrates yesterday, the NCA said. He will next appear at Leeds Crown Court on October 13.

Three men detained on board the yacht – including Powell’s father John, 70 – have been remanded in custody in Ireland.

Investigators yesterday also seized the 25ft motorboat Sea Breeze in Pwllheli, Gwynedd

The
 25ft Sea Breeze was to be used to ferry bales of the narcotics from the Makayabella yacht onto UK shores, an 
evasion tactic known as coopering, it is believed.

Three
 men - a 70-year-old skipper and two others, aged 35 and 28 from West 
Yorkshire - are being held in Ireland after being found onboard the 60ft
 vessel when armed navy teams stormed it 200 nautical miles off the
 Irish coast early on Tuesday morning.

Two others, aged 43 and 47, were arrested in follow-up raids in west Yorkshire on suspicion of involvement.

Some 41 bales of cocaine, bound for the north of England, were offloaded from the vessel in Cork harbour yesterday.

Detectives
 from the UK’s National Crime Agency today recovered the Sea Breeze at a marina at Pwllheli, a small coastal town on the 
Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd.

It is now being forensically examined.

Commander
 David Norris, of the crime agency, who is leading the investigation, said they 
have been granted more time to question the 47-year-old suspect still in
 custody in the UK.

He
 said: 'This has been a complex and fast-moving investigation, involving
 law enforcement agencies in the UK, Ireland, Europe and South America.'

The yacht has been tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being stormed by an elite Navy squad 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point

He said police wanted to speak with one other man in connection with the crime, a 29-year-old man from the Halton 
Moor area of Leeds, and encouraged him to 'contact us'.

Authorities say the
 Makayabella was skippered 
through its weeks-long Atlantic voyage by an old-age pensioner from West
 Yorkshire.

The
 70-year-old British suspect was arrested aboard the 60ft Makayabella 
along with two other men, allegedly with bales of 
cocaine so big they used them as makeshift furniture.

The 70-year-old is believed to have been an experienced sailor. The smugglers are believed to have planned to transfer the cocaine onto a smaller boat at sea before ferrying it to shore in North Wales.

Under armed guard yesterday, the one tonne haul of drugs was offloaded from the yacht onto the docks at Haulbowline naval base in Cork harbour, where it was towed to last night.

Members of the navy stand with the haul of cocaine thought to be worth in the region of £100million. If that value is confirmed it will be one of the biggest drug seizures in Europe this year.

The yacht 
was tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, 
stopping off in Trinidad, before being intercepted 200 nautical miles 
off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point.

During
 the tense night-time sea raid, two teams set off from the coastal 
patrol vessel LE Niamh on smaller inflatable boats, armed with pistols 
and batons.

Captain
 David Barry of the Irish Navy said it was a 'particularly dark night' 
and he believed those on board the Makayabella had  'no idea we were 
there until we were actually on board'.

The crew put up no resistance and no arms were found on board.

The passage 
around the south-west coast of Ireland has been well used in recent 
times by drugs smugglers bringing shipments from South America and 
Africa into Europe.

Authorities describe it as the western frontier of Europe.

In
 2007, a record £344 million of cocaine was seized in Dunlough Bay in 
west Cork when a UK gang botched an attempt to bring the massive haul 
ashore on a smaller boat and capsized in rough weather.

Most of the group, including two Englishmen, were arrested in follow-up operations and eventually given lengthy prison sentences.

Just a year later, a £312 million haul was intercepted on the Dances With Waves yacht about 150 miles off Mizen Head.

Three British men on board were later jailed for 10 years each for their part in the plot.

The mastermind, John Alan Brooks, was jailed for 28 years for the plot to bring the massive haul to England from Venezuela.
