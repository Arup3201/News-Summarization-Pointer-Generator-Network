The huge container port of Zeebrugge was at rest yesterday as church bells called Sunday worshippers to prayer. Under a leaden sky, Belgians huddled against the breeze drinking tea in beach huts, while kite-surfers skimmed across the sea next to the port where hundreds of metal containers – piled like giant Lego bricks and stamped with British company names – waited on the concrete to be lifted on to ferries for Channel crossings next week.

This is the port at the centre of a new immigration controversy: where 35 migrants, including children, were crammed into a container on a P&O ship which set sail to Tilbury in Essex on Friday night.

On Saturday at 6.15am, when the container was lifted off the boat on to the Tilbury dockside, the exhausted migrants screamed to be let out as their air inside began to give out.

Ready to risk all: Migrants from Asia at their makeshift camp in Zeebrugge, Belgium, yesterday

Containers: It is thought between 600 and 3,000 migrants a year slip through the port's security to Britain

One man had died in the horrific conditions, and the others were taken to hospital suffering from thirst, cold and exhaustion.

It had been a nightmare journey of nine hours across the Channel in the dark, airless 40ft long metal box. However the terrifying odyssey at least ended in the only country the migrants wanted to reach: the promised land of England.

In recent weeks, the eyes of the world have been on Calais, the French port where 1,300 Eritreans and Sudanese migrants have rioted as they battle for control of the best spot to jump on a lorry driving on to a ferry to the UK. Yet over 15 years of mass illegal migration to Britain, other ports along the French and Belgian north coasts have also become targets for migrants hoping to smuggle themselves to England.

They come from all over the world, and are mostly not Africans – like those who wait at Calais – but Afghans, Iranians, Iraqis, Chinese, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese.

At Zeebrugge, security fences have been put up, and containers are searched with body-heat-seeking devices, machines to detect human breath and sniffer dogs.

Hard to track: The ship on which the Afghan Sikhs hid had 50 other containers on board, all bound for Tilbury

‘This was a result of the growing numbers,’ a port official told the Mail recently. ‘We had to do something to stop Zeebrugge becoming a target like Calais.’

Whether this has worked is another matter. The scale of the task is daunting. At one stage, the port authority admitted only one container in four could be searched because there are not enough staff.

According to monitoring groups, during big waves of illegal migration 3,000 a year have slipped into containers on ferries and made it to England from Zeebrugge.

It is thought the number of those getting through is now around 600 a year – but the truth is that no one knows.

Grim: In makeshift camps near the port, some migrants have waited for a year or more

There are so many containers and so many ferries crossing the Channel. The ship on which the Afghan Sikhs hid had 50 other containers on board.

Most migrants arriving at the Belgian coast live in decrepit makeshift camps hidden among trees dotted along the motorway from France while they wait their chance to get to England.

Some have tents bought at the local supermarkets, but the majority exist in squalid improvised huts made from pieces of shed, black tarpaulin, sheets and blankets.

I visited two camps on the Belgian border near Zeebrugge yesterday morning. I talked to migrants as they cooked breakfast over open fires.

I met a doctor, an engineer and an architect from Iran, two Sikh students from the Indian Punjab, and dozens of Afghans who said they had not had a job in their home countries for years and were running away ‘to your England’.

The migrants from different cultures and countries have little in common – except they all have family in Britain, want to get there desperately, and have been put in the ‘holding’ camps by agents who operate along the Belgian and French coasts, and also smuggle them on to lorries for fat fees.

The agents are controlled by Mr Bigs in cities such as London and Paris, such shadowy figures that even the agents do not know the names of their bosses.

The agents set up the illicit journeys by mobile phone, and they, too, stay anonymous.

They give only their first names or even pseudonyms to the migrants, so they cannot be traced if police or border staff catch a stowaway at Zeebrugge or one of the other ports, such as Dunkirk.

The British police say they are launching a homicide inquiry into the dead migrant, and hope to catch the traffickers who put him – and the other Afghan Sikhs – into the container. It will, by any standards, be a tough job. Almost certainly, the Afghan Sikhs will not even know the identity of the trafficking agents who fixed their journey, let alone the names of those who pull the strings at the top of the operation.

There is one sliver of evidence: a CCTV camera caught a picture of the lorry with the container entering the port on Friday night.

It is believed they were smuggled across the 4,000 miles from Afghanistan to Western Europe by truck. Once in Belgium, they were put into an empty container, due to be shipped to the UK, and driven by lorry into the port area and on to the ferry.

Whether they were forced to wait in a camp until the ‘time was right’ for the illicit journey is unclear as yet. Certainly, the migrants I spoke to yesterday had not seen any Afghan Sikhs during the past two or three weeks.

Ideal: Some will pay another £1,500 to cross the Channel after already paying £20,000 for their journey so far

Increased security 'was a result of the growing numbers,' a port official told the Mail recently. 'We had to do something to stop Zeebrugge becoming a target like Calais’, the official added

There are only 3,000 Sikh families in Afghanistan. They have been oppressed by successive regimes for their religious beliefs.

The Taliban were particularly vicious, attacking and ostracising Sikhs for their perceived wealth as successful merchants, and their refusal to convert to Islam.

No wonder this particular group has turned its eyes to London in the past decade, where there is a thriving and established Afghan Sikh community, particularly in Southall, West London.

Relatives in London raise the large sums of money demanded by the trafficking organisations, often – I have been told – paying the fees into trafficking agents’ bank accounts in England.

The cost of a journey from Afghanistan to the Belgian coast is currently £20,000 a person, and then £1,500 per head to be taken across the Channel.

A well-used migrant route for Afghans is to head for Turkey by land and then travel over the porous border into Greece by boat, where they make their way to Italy and catch trains northwards to the Channel ports.

Challenge: The road to Zeebrugge is a long one, and for many it begins with a tourist visa to Italy

One migrant, 22-year-old Indian Sikh Hara Singh, said: 'I heard what had happened to the Sikhs from Afghanistan. It is terrible news for us, too. We are worried there will be more security on the container ships'

However, there is another migrant route which has become a favourite with those who have money. The illegals enter border-free Europe by plane on a tourist visa to Italy via Moscow.

‘A tourist visa into modern Europe means that you can go to any country apart from England without any trouble. Italy is full of tourists and gives the visas out easily, so it is a passport to Europe,’ an immigration official in Rome told me recently.

This was just the route taken by Hira Singh, a 22-year-old Indian Sikh I found at a camp in Grande Synthe, a French town near the Belgian border yesterday.

He told me: ‘I heard what had happened to the Sikhs from Afghanistan. It is terrible news for us, too. We are worried there will be more security on the container ships going out of the ports now.’

Then, with his toothbrush and toothpaste in hand as he went for a morning wash at the corner of the camp, he added emotionally: ‘I flew by Air India on a tourist visa from Delhi to Moscow, and then to Rome. I got a train here to northern France. I have been here a year and I am beginning to lose hope of getting to England.’

At a camp nearer Zeebrugge, another Indian Sikh, Ranjodh Singh, 22, his long hair tucked into a baseball cap, said: ‘I have relatives in Southall, in Birmingham and all over the north of England. I have been here for two weeks waiting for the agent to find me a place on a container or a lorry.

‘I came into Italy on a tourist visa and caught a train from there. My visa into Italy meant I could come to Belgium because there aren’t any borders in Europe any more, so it was easy.

With sincerity shining from his dark eyes, he added: ‘I don’t want to be here, though, only England.’

No doubt the 35 Sikhs from Afghanistan found at Tilbury in such a desperate state felt the same when they set off on their perilous journey.

And what is clear from their troubling and tragic story is that they certainly won’t be the last to take their lives in their hands in the hope of making it to their destination.
