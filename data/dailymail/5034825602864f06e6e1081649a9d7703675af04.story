The sad decline of Steven Finn reached a new low on Wednesday when, astonishingly, he became the third member of England’s Ashes squad to fail to see out the torturous tour of Australia.

Finn, among the leading fast bowlers in the world less than a year ago, joins Jonathan Trott and Graeme Swann in leaving early after being sent home almost as  a compassionate move when he simply became ‘unpickable’.

Such has been the collapse of Finn’s action and confidence that he has not been trusted in a single international match, even though England used a record 18 players in the Ashes. Enough is clearly enough.

'Unpickable': Fast bowler Steven Finn has been sent home from England's tour of Australia

Signing up: Finn, meeting a young fan, has not been trusted to make a single outing on this tour

He will return to Middlesex to start 
again, as first revealed by Mail Online Sport, with Ashley Giles, 
England’s one-day coach, admitting that Finn had been named in the 
provisional 30-man squad for the World Twenty20 in March ‘more in hope 
than expectation’.

The premature departure of Finn, with four 
one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches left against 
Australia, is perhaps the biggest blow yet for England because, at 24, 
he is so important to their rebuilding plans for a ‘new era’.

‘We 
feel this is the best thing for Steven,’ said Giles after his 
beleaguered team arrived in Brisbane ahead of tomorrow’s second  50-over
 game against Australia.

Fall from grace: Finn was seen as one of the best fast bowlers in the world less than a year ago

His problems began with his habit of knocking the bails off with his right knee in delivery stride, which led to a change in cricket’s laws to make it a new ball, and then he experimented with a shorter run up before going back to his original longer version. Now he just seems to have lost it altogether.

‘Sometimes through your career you go through these ups and downs and his timing’s out and that can affect your confidence,’ said Giles. ‘And it’s not coming out as quickly as he’d like either. He’s been in this state for at least a couple of months and it hasn’t worked so we feel it’s best to take him out of this. Sometimes you have to do that. At the moment he needs a bit of space and in the short term a couple of weeks away from cricket full stop.’

There is a theory that suggests Finn’s problems stem from conflicting advice from his coaches at Middlesex, Angus Fraser and Richard Johnson, and that he is receiving from England’s David Saker and Kevin Shine. Ultimately, though, Finn has to sort things out for himself.

Decision: England one-day coach Ashley Giles says he wants Finn back as quickly as possible

‘He’s not been bowling well enough to be 
selected and we feel the best place for him right now is to be out of 
that performance environment. We’re taking part in  the most difficult 
tour, along  with India, and Steven’s just not pickable at the moment.

‘So
 he will go back and work on the technical things he has to sort out. 
We’ve already had communication with Middlesex and we need to come up 
with a plan to get him back as quickly as we can.’

It is by any 
standards a remarkable collapse for Finn, who was taking the new ball 
ahead of Stuart Broad as recently as the first Test against New Zealand 
in Dunedin last year and was almost unplayable in the one-dayers on that
 tour.

His problems began with his habit of knocking the bails off 
with his right knee in delivery stride, which led to a change in 
cricket’s laws to make it a no-ball, and then he experimented with a 
shorter run up before going back to his original longer version. Now he 
seems to have lost it altogether.

Back home: Graeme Swann and Jonathan Trott have both returned to England earlier than planned

Giles said: ‘Sometimes through your
 career you go through these ups and downs and his timing’s out and that
 can affect his confidence. And it’s not coming out as quickly as he’d 
like either.

'He’s been in this state for at least a couple of months and
 it hasn’t worked so we feel it’s best to take him out of this. 
Sometimes you have to do that. At the moment he needs a bit of space and
 in the short term a couple of weeks away from cricket full-stop.’

There
 is a theory that suggests Finn’s problems stem from conflicting advice 
from his coaches at Middlesex, Angus Fraser and Richard Johnson, and 
England’s David Saker and Kevin Shine.

STEVE HARMISON:
 The best bowler in the world in 2004 was key to the 2005 Ashes victory 
but struggled on the next tour — serving up a memorably wild wide first 
ball at Brisbane.

PHIL TUFNELL:
 The spinner played the first four Tests in 1994-95 but, suffering with 
personal issues, trashed his hotel room in Perth and was taken to a 
psychiatric ward.

SAJID MAHMOOD: Impressed in his debut Test summer of 2006 but was inaccurate that winter and has not played a Test since Sydney 2007.

But here’s what can be done…

MITCHELL JOHNSON:
 The rapid leftie, whose lack of control made him a laughing stock, was 
dropped last March but recalled in time for the visit of England. The 
rest is history…

‘Whichever coach has been 
working with him, whether that’s at Middlesex or England, has only got 
the best interests of Steven Finn at heart,’ insisted Giles. ‘There is 
no squabbling over the sort of care he is getting. We just need to get 
him bowling again the way he can.

‘It’s not that long ago he was bowling close to his best in New Zealand where he was the spearhead of our one-day attack.

‘He’s
 a really key asset going  forward. In such a big business you would 
call him a million pound asset and when you’ve got assets like that you 
need to look after them. For now that means going home and sorting 
himself out.’

The ‘yips’ is a condition more associated in cricket 
with left-arm spinners than fast bowlers but could Finn’s problems be a 
case of them? ‘I hate that word and I don’t even want to say it,’ said 
Giles, a left-arm spinner himself. ‘That’s a very different thing from 
what I believe Steven has got. The important thing is that he doesn’t 
want anyone to think he’s  quitting. No-one would dream of saying that.

'We made this decision in conjunction with the guys back home. All the 
top bosses have been involved in this. The most important thing now, 
from our perspective and Middlesex’s, is that we move forward together.’

Giles was speaking in the same Brisbane hotel where England dropped
 the bombshell that  Trott was going home with a stress-related 
condition after the first Test.

It seems a long time ago now but the
 problems keep on coming for England and there are still seven matches 
on this tour to come. They will take place, as the previous six have, 
without Steven Finn.
