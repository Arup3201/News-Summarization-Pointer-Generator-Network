The felon who shot and ran over a Florida police officer as he tried to escape arrest said he opened fire because he 'felt like a caged rat'.

Marco Antonion Parilla Jr, 23, gunned down Charles Kondek, 45, after cops came to question him about neighbors' noise complaints. 

He was listed as a fugitive for violating his probation. It wasn't immediately clear what the violation was. 

Now detained on a first-degree murder charge, Parilla insists it was 'not my intention' and apologized to the family of veteran officer Kondek.

The shooting did not appear to have any connection to the ambush killings of two New York police officers a day earlier.

Authorities said Kondek responded to a noise call around 2 a.m. at an apartment complex in Tarpon Springs, about 30 miles northwest of Tampa. 

Parilla was pounding on doors, looking for a neighbor who 'dimed him out' to police, authorities said. 

When Parilla saw Kondek, he fired multiple rounds at the officer, striking him once above his bullet-proof vest.

Kondek later died of his injuries at a local hospital, the police department said. 

'We know we have the right guy in custody,' Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. 

'This guy knew what he was doing, he killed a cop and he needs to be held accountable for that.'

According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Parilla served more than two years in prison for several offenses, including drug charges, and was released in March.

Authorities say Kondek was a 17-year veteran of the Tarpon Springs PD and went to the department after serving in the NYPD for five years

A father of five, Kondek was a 17-year veteran of the local police department who moved there from New York after serving on the NYPD for more than five years.

His death followed a Saturday afternoon shooting in New York City, where a gunman shot dead two police officers and then killed himself about 3 p.m. in Brooklyn's crime-ridden Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Authorities said that shooter — Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, of Baltimore — had indicated on social media that he might seek revenge for recent police killings of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, in Missouri, and the chokehold death of Eric Garner, of New York. 

Mourners have been dropping flowers and cards outside the Tarpon Springs PD, outfitting a cruisers already decked with a large black band in Kondek's honor, WFLA reported. 

The last time an officer with the department was killed in the line of duty was  in 1969, according to the station.
