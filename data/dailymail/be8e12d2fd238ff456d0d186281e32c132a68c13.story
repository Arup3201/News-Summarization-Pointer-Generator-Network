New Manchester City signing Fernando hopes to establish himself as one of the club's greats - and would love the chance to play alongside Yaya Toure.

The Brazilian joined the Barclays Premier League champions from Porto for Â£12million last month, increasing a pool of midfield players that includes the influential Toure, compatriot Fernandinho and Javi Garcia.

Toure's future at the Etihad Stadium has been the subject of much speculation over the summer but 26-year-old Fernando is keen to play alongside the dynamic Ivorian.

Ambition: New Manchester City signing Fernando want to become one of the club's greats

Fernando told the club's website, www.mcfc.co.uk: 'City are known all over the world, football players are aware of Manchester City.

'It is a dream to be here and to be part of this great club. I also hope to become one of the club's great players.

'We know they are players with a lot of qualities - it won't be easy to get into that midfield, but with a lot of work, and I know how to give myself to work, every day I will give my best in order to have a chance to make a contribution to the team.

'The player I admire the most and I watch many of his games is Yaya Toure, he is a great player and it will be an honour to play alongside him.'

Fernando was previously linked with City in January but a deal failed to materialise before the transfer deadline.

Even this summer, Fernando concedes the deal was far from straightforward.

Patient: Fernando had been linked with a move to City in January but had to wait

He said: 'It was a very difficult transfer, we had to face a lot of challenges in order to be here today but, thanks to God, everything went well and I am here to help Manchester City in the best way possible.'

Asked what convinced him City was the right move, he added: 'The club itself.

'Also it is a very strong league, it is one of the best in the world; the players in this club are the best players in the world.

'So, all good reasons to be part of it and so I am here now.'

General: The 26-year-old will wear the No 6 shirt for his new club

Fernando, who will wear the number six shirt at City, feels he made his mark at Porto and hopes to continue in much the same vein at City.

He said: 'I left a good legacy at Porto. I hope I can repeat that at City, winning titles, playing regularly.

'That's what everyone can expect from me, willpower and dedication, always with the eyes on trophies, that's what City and I want.'

Fernando earned the nickname of 'Octopus' at Porto, because he seemed to be everywhere and have a lot of legs, but another one, likening him to American president Barack Obama has also emerged lately.

He said: 'The nickname is a bit complicated. I saw the photo and we have some resemblances, but it's better to call me Fernando!'
