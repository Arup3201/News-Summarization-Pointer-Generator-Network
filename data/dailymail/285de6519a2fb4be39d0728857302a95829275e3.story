The Russian dissident President Vladimir Putin ‘fears the most’ made a triumphant return to Moscow yesterday.

In scenes reminiscent of the end of the Soviet era, Alexei Navalny, 37, was greeted by thousands after being dramatically freed a day after being sentenced to five years’ hard labour for what he claims are trumped-up charges of embezzlement and fraud.

Navalny, who a judge ruled should remain free until he has exhausted all his appeals, immediately vowed to challenge Putin for power.

‘Together we are a huge powerful force and I am glad we have started realising this,’ he told cheering supporters at Yaroslavsky railway station after stepping off a train.

Pumping his fist in the air, he added: ‘Let’s fight for political power in the country.’

Riot police at the scene had earlier demanded the crowd disperse after a suspected bomb was discovered on a platform.

Navalny is first planning to challenge the Kremlin’s candidate for Moscow mayor in elections in September.

‘We are going to run and we  will win,’ Navalny told his supporters. ‘If it wasn’t for you,  I wouldn’t be standing here for the next five years.’

Navalny, an anti-corruption lawyer, came to prominence  with a blog accusing Putin’s power base of being ‘the party of swindlers and thieves’.

Two years ago he claimed the Russian president’s regime was so corrupt that Russia could face an Arab Spring-style revolt within five years.
