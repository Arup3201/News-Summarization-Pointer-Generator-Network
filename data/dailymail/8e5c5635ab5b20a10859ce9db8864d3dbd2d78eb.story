A care worker who stole from a partially blind pensioner has been jailed after she was caught on camera rifling through her handbag.

Angela Brownson, 54, visited Ruth Darling daily to assist with household tasks – but helped herself to cash from the 90-year-old’s purse when she was in the shower.

The carer was caught on a secret camera installed by a suspicious cleaner after Mrs Darling’s family noticed £6,000 had gone missing from her account.

Immoral: The woman, brazenly wearing her nurse's uniform, rifles through the pensioner's belongings in search of cash, left, before pulling out the cash and pocketing it

Brownson has been jailed for 48 weeks 
by magistrates in Peterlee, County Durham, for four thefts totalling 
£530. However large sums of Mrs Darling’s money are still unaccounted 
for.

The deception left the widow suicidal and afraid to live in her own home. She has since moved to a care home.

Mrs
 Darling’s family were tipped off to Brownson’s stealing after cleaner 
Victoria Williams, 46, noticed the carer  – who started looking after 
the pensioner in January last year – filling her supermarket trolley 
with expensive Prosecco while out shopping for ‘one of her oldies’.

A
 surveillance device disguised as a pen was then set up in Mrs Darling’s
 bedroom. Brownson was caught rifling through the pensioner’s handbag 
and taking money from her purse in July when her client was in the 
shower.

Brownson had been 
brought in because Mrs Darling needed help in the shower, but that was 
the moment the carer seized the opportunity to steal from her.

Mrs
 Williams told the Daily Mirror: ‘In December Mrs Darling became so 
frail that the only option left was for her to go into a care home, 
which is something she was determined she wouldn’t do.

‘Her only wish was to see out her days in her own home and Angela Brownson robbed her of that.

The
 stress and anxiety caused her to stop eating and she lost four stone in
 weight, she stopped sleeping because she was worried Brownson was going
 to come back and break into her home.

‘[Brownson]
 will serve her time in prison but what she suffers in jail will be 
nothing in comparison to the effect she’s had on poor Mrs Darling’s 
life.’

Brownson, of Ferryhill, County Durham, denied all the charges against her but was convicted following the trial.

Mike
 Clarke, defending, said that Brownson still refused to accept her 
guilt, but had been affected by the revelation at the hearing last 
Friday that Mrs Darling had been forced into care.

Alarm bells: A cleaner had seen Brownson buying Prosecco at the supermarket and the family agreed to set up a secret camera which showed her rummaging through her bag while she showered

Prosecutor
 Sarah Traynor told the court: ‘The defendant was seen stealing money 
while Mrs Darling was in the shower, which is exactly when she required 
assistance because of her mobility issues.’

Brownson
 worked for Consett-based firm Kelly Park Caring Agency, which is 
accredited by Durham County Council and registered with the Care Quality
 Commission (CQC).

Director Paul Sanders said she was fired as soon as the accusations came to light.

A
 CQC spokesman said they monitor all adult social care to ‘ensure 
services are safe, caring, effective and responsive to people’s needs’, 
and that ‘when care fails, our existing powers include issuing a warning
 notice, restricting services, removing registration or issuing a fine 
or prosecution.’
