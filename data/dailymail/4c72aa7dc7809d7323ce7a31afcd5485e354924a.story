A 7-foot-1 former NBA star has been arrested for attempted armed robbery after neighbors spotted him and a friend with masks over their faces trying to break into a rural Washington State home in broad daylight.

This is just the latest trouble for 29-year-old Robert Swift, who blew his NBA $20million earnings and was evicted from his Seattle home in 2013. At the time of his arrest, he was a fugitive from justice, wanted for failing to show up for court to answer charges of possession of a sawed-off shotgun from last November.

Swift and 28-year-old Carlos Abraham Anderson were busted on Tuesday near Gold Bar, Washington, as they were trying to break into a home there, police told to KIRO-TV. 

Fallen star: Robert Swift, 28, hasn't played in the NBA since 2009 and blew his $20million earnings within four years of leaving the league

Neighbors spotted the conspicuous pair and called police.

Sources told the TV station that Swift was 'heavily armed' and at least one of the men had a baseball bat. 

Swift told sheriff's deputies he was high on drugs at the time.  

Charges for the incident have not been filed, though both men are being held on previous warrants they had out for their arrest. 

Last November, Swift was arrested after police raided the home where he was living with the man who he said was his heroin dealer. 

Police seized this cache of weapons when they raided the home where Swift was living last year. Among the legal guns was an illegal sawed-off shotgun

They seized a massive cache of weapons - including a sawed-off shotgun, which is illegal without special permits. 

Cops also found heroin, meth and several prostitutes at the home. 

Swift, an admitted heroin addict, has seen his life fall apart after he was picked by the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the NBA draft at age 18.

He played four seasons of NBA basketball, but was saddled with injuries, but hasn't been on an NBA court since 2009. 

In 2013, his Swift was evicted from his suburban Seattle home and revealed that he was broke - despite earning $20million during his NBA career.
