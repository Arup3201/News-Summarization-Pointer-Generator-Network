Alan Hansen admits he was wrong to say Theo Walcott did not have a ‘football brain’ and has applauded the Arsenal star for ‘showing two fingers’ to his comment.

The Scot - who stepped down as a BBC and Match of the Day pundit following the World Cup final after more than two decades on the television - made the remark about the England forward four years ago.

But Hansen believes Walcott has proved that his judgement was wrong.

‘Four 
years ago, I said that Theo Walcott did not have a "football brain", 
without realising that my comments would be misinterpreted to such an 
extent,’ he wrote in his farewell column in the Daily Telegraph.

‘The
 meaning of my observation was not as brutal as it may have come across,
 but nonetheless, I was critical of Walcott’s ability and I am pleased 
to say that Theo has proved me wrong one million per cent.

‘He
 is a proper player and I have to admit that my comments about him were 
the only time that I have ever been happy to be wrong.

‘Theo
 is an intelligent boy, very bright, with genuine ability and he has 
given the best possible response to my remarks by pretty much showing 
two fingers to what I said.’
