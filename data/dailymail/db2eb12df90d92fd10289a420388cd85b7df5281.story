A teenager has been charged after Wycombe goalkeeper Jordan Archer was attacked in the closing stages of his side’s 1-0 League Two win over Gillingham.

A fan jumped on top of the 19-year-old goalkeeper during the final moments of his 
side's 1-0 League Two win over Gillingham last night.

The 19-year-old keeper, on loan from Tottenham, was placing the ball prior to taking a goal kick when a supporter entered the field and leapt towards him at the Priestfield Stadium last night.

Attack: Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Jordan Archer was laying the ball down to take a goal kick when a fan began to run at him from the terraces

Shameful: The fan can been seen leaping onto the unsuspecting goalkeeper

Shocking: The fan is pictured making contact with the goalkeeper. He then knocks the footballer to the floor

The fan was quickly apprehended by a steward and led away.

Kent Police said tonight that a 17-year-old boy, from Rochester, has been charged with common assault and Section 4 of the Football Offences Act.

He has been freed on bail and will appear at Medway Magistrates’ Court on March 12.

Gillingham manager Martin Allen was 
furious after the game and said the supporter's actions were 
'absolutely crazy' and that they were 'not a true reflection of our 
football club.'

Matt McClure hit a 85th minute 
winner for Wycombe as Gillingham missed the chance to return to 
the top of League Two.

Worried: The goalkeeper looks visibly shocked following the incident

Bewildered: Jordan Archer is left in a state of shock following the incident . He quickly turns around to confront his attacker

Angry: The frustrated goalkeeper makes his feelings clear as he confronts the fan

Foolish: He was quickly removed from the pitch by stewards

Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth said: 'He (the fan) will be dealt with by Gillingham and the authorities. I want to concentrate on the football really, what he did was wrong and he's given the rest of the Gillingham fans a bad name and they'll be as annoyed as anyone.

'I don't think it hurt the keeper. Jordan's a tough lad.'

Gillingham boss Martin Allen was quick to condemn the incident.

He said: 'As a football club we can't condone (what happened). None of us are happy with that. Our supporters have been fantastic but for one person to do something like that is crazy.

'I'm sure when he wakes up he'll be shocked, disappointed in himself. It's not a true reflection of the club since I've been here.'

The incident is the latest example of thugs running on to a football pitch to confront players.

In December, Manchester City fan Matthew Stott, 21, charged on to the pitch at the club's Etihad Stadium during a 2-0 derby defeat by Manchester United.

Invasion: Goalkeeper Joe Hart steps in between Stott and Rio Ferdinand

Taken away: Stott, pictured right outside Manchester Magistrates' Court, is taken from the pitch by police, left

Target: Rio Ferdinand suffered a cut above his eye when he was hit by a coin thrown by City fans

He had to be held back by goalkeeper 
Joe Hart to prevent him from confronting United defender Rio Ferdinand -
who suffered a cut to his face when he was hit by a coin thrown by fans
during the same game.

Stott,
a landscape gardener, last month received a three-year ban from 
attending football matches and a 56-day prison sentence, suspended for a
year.

He told the court he
had lost his job and his family had suffered death threats following 
the incident, which he blamed on drinking eight pints of lager before 
the game.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
