Pepe divides opinion among football fans but the Portugal defender proved a Good Samaritan as he paid for nine tonnes of food to be distributed to poor families of the Las Rozas district in the Spanish capital.

The 31-year-old, who comes from a working-class background in Brazil, lives in the area and ensured that the people of his neighbourhood will have a memorable Christmas.

Pepe was personally involved in distributing the packages to almost 200 impoverished families.

Pepe has played 180 for Real Madrid since the Portuguese defender signed from Porto in 2007

It is not the first time Pepe has helped the people of Las Rozas, either. 

After scoring the winner for Real Madrid against Espanyol last December, he donated money to the people of his town before turning up the following day to hand out almost five tonnes of food packages.

Pepe's quality as a footballer is not in doubt - he has represented the Spanish giants 180 times since he joined in 2007, winning the Champions league and La Liga titles. He has also won 65 caps for his adopted country Portugal.

The defender, however, is partial to the red mist and has been sent off 12 times in his career, including a dismissal against Germany at the World Cup in Brazil after butting Thomas Muller.
