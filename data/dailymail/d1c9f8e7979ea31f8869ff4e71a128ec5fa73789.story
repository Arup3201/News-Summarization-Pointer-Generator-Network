A woman who was arrested and charged with manslaughter for a crash that caused the death of a 5-year-old child showed no remorse for her actions according to court records.

Aaronessa Keaton of Phoenix, Arizona was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system when she collided head-on with a car carrying two children in February 2014, and one of the children later died from their injuries.

When told of this after her arrest, Keaton, 24, said; 'Sh*t happens.'

Keaton, who was also on probation for marijuana possession charges at the time, was indicted by a grand jury in February, and taken in Monday after she was pulled over for a traffic stop.

According to CBS 5, Keaton was driving southbound on February 28, 2014 when she swiped a car going north, and she then continued across the northbound lane until she struck a 2007 Nissan Frontier.

That car contained the child whose injuries were so severe they later died.

The other child in the car was in serious condition, but later made a full recovery, and both adults in the front seat suffered only minor injuries. 

Keaton was also rushed to the hospital where an emergency C-section was performed.

The baby, which had diazepenes and THC in their system as well, was in extremely critical condition after it was delivered.
