Attacker: Former 49ers and Raiders linesman Kwame Harris, 31, has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence and battery for beating his ex-boyfriend last year

Former 49ers linesman Kwame Harris has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence and battery for beating his ex-boyfriend after an argument over table manners.

Harris, 31, was found guilty on Monday for the August 21, 2012, attack which left Dimitri Geier in hospital with facial fractures.

However a jury in San Mateo County Superior Court acquitted Harris of felony domestic violence and felony assault counts.

According to court documents, Harris and Geier, 36, were having dinner at Su Hong restaurant in Menlo Park, California.

The pair had previously dated on and off for about four years and had lived together.

Following the meal, Harris was going to drive Geier to San Francisco International Airport for a flight.

But the men began to argue after Geier poured soy sauce on some rice, which upset Harris, according to a lawsuit Geier filed in San Mateo County in October 2012.

Geier later wrote on his Facebook that his actions 'started an argument about me not having manners and class and triggered his rage.'

Their argument escalated, with Harris refusing to take his ex-lover to the airport.

Geier agreed to take a cab instead, but as they went to get his bags from Harris' car the dispute turned violent.

Harris accused Geier, 36, of stealing his underwear - a game the men reportedly used to play - and tried to pull down Geier's trousers to prove it.

That's when the pair came to blows in the parking lot.

SFGate.com reported Harris, at 6'7'' and 240 pounds, pinned Geier against a plate-glass window and hit him 
several times in the face and head.

Geier was rushed to hospital. He underwent surgery and had a metal plate inserted at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose.

Harris' defense said the footballer acted in self-defense and only punched Geier once.

Geier did not appear in court. Jurors heard a transcript of his testimony from Harrisâ€™ preliminary hearing.

Harris was charged with felony domestic 
violence and assault using force, but was acquitted of these felonies in court on Monday, the last day of the five-day trial.

'We're
 relieved that they acquitted him of the felonies, which tells us that 
they believe the truth - that he did act in self-defense,' Alin Cintean, Harris' attorney, said.

Clintean said Harris plans to appeal the misdemeanor convictions.

Geier sued Harris in October 2012, but withdrew the complaint about six months ago, his attorney, Craig Charles, said.

'I had hoped that it would move forward, but ultimately, the decision is his,' Charles said.

Harris is scheduled to return to court on November 12 for sentencing. He faces up to a year in jail.

Harris,
 an offensive tackle, attended Stanford University and was the 49ers' 
top draft pick in 2003.

He spent five seasons with the team, then played
 for the Raiders in 2008, his last year in the NFL.

The criminal case exposed that Harris had been secretive about his sexual orientation before retiring from the NFL.

According to USA Today, his outing was met with a negative reaction from some players.

'You want to escape the despair and turmoil and your mind goes to dark places,' Harris said in March of keeping his sexuality secret.

'I'm happy today, and I'm glad they were just ideas and I didn't act on any of them.

'The cost was great in asking me to not speak candidly or be able to be open about myself in a complete manner.

'If I could have done it differently, I would have hoped I found the strength [to come out].'
