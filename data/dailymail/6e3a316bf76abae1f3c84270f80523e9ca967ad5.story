British taxpayers have spent nearly £3million on policing the Ecuadorian embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been claiming political asylum for the past eight months.

Scotland Yard said the bill has reached £2.9million, with Metropolitan Police officers being stationed outside the embassy in Knightsbridge round-the-clock since June last year.

The Ecuadorian government expressed concern at the 'significant' cost to taxpayers, but said it could be avoided if the Home Office guaranteed that the controversial figure will not be extradited to the United States.

Round the clock: The £2.9 million bill is for policing at the embassy from June last year to the end of January

The Met said the £2.9 million is an estimated total cost of policing the embassy between June and the end of January.

Of the total bill, £2.3 million is opportunity costs - police officer pay that would be incurred in normal duties - and £0.6 million in overtime.

Assange, 41, has been inside the embassy for nearly 250 days, with the cost per day of policing the building standing at nearly £13,000.

A spokesman at the Ecuadorian embassy said: 'The Ecuadorian government is concerned by the significant cost to the taxpayers of London of policing the embassy at the present time.

'However, we believe this expenditure could be avoided if the UK Government would provide the undertakings that the Ecuadorian government has sort that there will be no onward extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.

'The Home Office has the power to 
offer such an assurance but has so far declined to do so. Until we 
obtain these undertakings, the Ecuadorian government will continue to 
protect Julian Assange’s human rights that are enshrined in 
international law.'

Wanted: The controversial figure has made few public statements since he arrived at the embassy last June

The Australian is fighting extradition to Sweden on sex charges, which he denies. He fears he will be sent to the United States and has been granted political asylum by Ecuador.

His WikiLeaks website has published thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables and confidential documents, which include some connected with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Assange has described his high-profiled staying in the embassy as like living in a space station.

The costs have been revealed days after one of Assange's celebrity backers, Jemima Khan, who put up the bail money, turned on him for acting as he he is 'above the law'.

She criticised his decision to skip bail and said that his female accusers in Sweden have human rights as well.

Divided opinion: The embassy has attracted protests both in favour and against Australian Assange
