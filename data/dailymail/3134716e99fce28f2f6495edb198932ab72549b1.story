Nature documentary in aid of the Tusk Trust for which Wills is Royal patron

Film is directed by Keith Scholey and Alastair Fothergill and narrated by Hollywood star Patrick Stewart

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge walked the red carpet last night as they highlighted Africa's threatened wildlife at the UK premiere of a big cats film.

William and Kate were dazzled by dozen of flashbulbs when they arrived for the screening of the nature documentary raising funds for the Duke's UK-based animal conservation charity Tusk Trust.

The royal couple, who celebrate their first wedding anniversary on Sunday, stepped from their chauffeur-driven car and walked the short distance to the BFI Southbank in London as banks of photographers shouted for their attention.

A true gent! William protects his wife from the rain as they arrive at the BFI Southbank for the premiere of African Cats, a nature documentary set to raise money for charity Tusk Trust

The
 Duke of Cambridge, a patron of the animal welfare charity, and the Duchess of 
Cambridge were greeted by Amanda Neville head of the BFI, at tonight's 
event

Kate wore a grey Matthew Williamson dress with subtle peplum detail and jade green beading trim for the event - which was protected from the rain by her husband's chivalrous way with the umbrella, she also accessorised with courts and matching clutch by British shoe designer Emmy Scarterfield

Kate was in high spirits at the event, despite the sombre weather. The film she was to attend tells the story of life on Kenya's plains for a pride of lions and a family of cheetahs as they battle for survival

Kate was wearing a Matthew Williamson 
grey dress with three-quarter-length sleeves and deep turquoise and gold beaded details around the neck and sleeves. She  accessorised with dark court shoes and matching clutch by British shoe designer Emmy Scarterfield (www.emmyshoes.co.uk). William meanwhile 
looked smart in a navy suit.

Mark Knopfler, legendary guitarist of Dire Straits, was among the guests along with filmmaker Guy 
Ritchie and Dragons' Den judge Deborah Meaden, a patron of Tusk Trust.

The wildlife film tells the story of 
life on Kenya's plains for a pride of lions and a family of cheetahs as 
they battle for survival.

Hollywood star Patrick Stewart 
narrates the true-life story of cheetah Sita bringing up her five cubs 
in the Masai Mara game reserve and of Mara, a six month-old lion cub 
being raised by her mother Layla.

William is a self-confessed lover of 
Africa, its people and wildlife, and has worries about the current 
animal welfare crisis that has seen renewed interest from poachers in 
elephant ivory and rhino horns.

Demand from consumers in the Far East and China has seen prices for the animal products rise significantly in recent years.

Charlie Mayhew, co-founder of Tusk 
Trust which has William as its royal patron, said about the Duke:

'He's 
passionate about Africa and he's very concerned about the current 
crisis.

'We are now seeing daily reports of 
elephants being poached across the continent and in South Africa, the 
country has lost 170 rhinos already this year.'

The Duchess of Cambridge's hair and make up, the latter of which she is known to do herself, were impeccable, as usual

Kate's Matthew Williamson dress is from the British designer's pre-fall 2012 collection and features the design house's signature flourishes - turquoise beading and gold detail

The persistent April showers refused to let up for the Royal guests - but fortunately William came prepared

He added that the number of cheetahs 
on the continent stands at around 10,000 to 12,000, while estimates 
suggest only 25,000 lions are left in Africa.

Mr Mayhew described the Duke's ability
 to get the wildlife message across to the public as vital for his 
charity's work and the efforts of others.

He said: 'It's enormously important 
and enormously valuable to have as our royal patron Prince William. His 
role, despite the Tusk agenda, on the global stage (is important) not 
just for our work but communicating the conservation message that 
everybody in conservation wants to get across. He's a powerful advocate 
for conservation in general.'

He added: 'Kate as we know got engaged
 to Prince William out in Africa and she's got the same general love of 
the continent as he has. She very kindly came to LA (with William) to 
launch our USA patrons circle. I cannot tell you how successful that 
was.'

Kate's slim waist was accentuated by the cut of her dress, while Wills looked smart in a dark suit

William proposed to Kate in Africa, and the two have a general love for the continent, which they have visited many times
