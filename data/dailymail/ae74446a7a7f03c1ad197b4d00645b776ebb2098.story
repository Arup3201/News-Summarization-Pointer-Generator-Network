Trapped: Pensioner Alastair McFadyen, 77, survived by soaking his handkerchief in rainwater and dabbing it onto his lips

A pensioner has told how he survived for over three days trapped in an upturned car at the bottom of a ravine by dipping his handkerchief into rainwater and using it to moisten his lips.

Dr Alastair McFadyen, 77, crashed 30ft down a steep ravine in wild countryside near Glenbranter, Argyll in Scotland, on his way back from a shopping trip on Wednesday last week.

His Renault car was left on its side half submerged in the river Cur and invisible from the road.

His mobile phone and the food he had just bought in town were in the boot and he couldn't reach down to scoop up the river water.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'It was about 4pm when I went off the road.

'I tried shouting for help but it didn’t work. The food I had just bought was in the boot along with my mobile. I couldn’t get to them.

'I was able to dip a handkerchief into raindrops on the outside of the vehicle to moisten my lips.

'Every evening as it got dark I made sure I was in a position well clear of the water just in case. But then the river rose a bit so that was worrying.'

Dr McFadyen, a retired historian and president of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society, was eventually found by a local man who was out picking mushrooms.

In an incredible stroke of luck, wildlife
manager Leif Brag had ventured out on Saturday evening at around 8pm 
last week to go back to a spot where he'd earlier seen some wild 
mushrooms growing.

After spotted skid marks on the road leading off to the grass verge he looked down to see the car lying on its side in the river.

He told the Argyllshire Standard: 'I shouted to see if anyone was in there – and he replied, so I said to him to stay calm and I would get help.'

Mr Brag found Dr McFadyen shaking but nopt suffering from any obvious.

Dr McFadyen, from Cowal, was rushed to hospital where he was yesterday continuing to recover.
