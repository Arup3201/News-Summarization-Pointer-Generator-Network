Police are searching for the person responsible for beating and burning a horse in Florida over the weekend.

Lisa Hensley returned to her mini-farm in Marion County after a camping trip Monday to find 'Sassy', a 14-year-old Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse she cares for, with bruises on her stomach and burns on her left hind leg, possibly made by paint, The Ocala Star-Banner and WKMG reported.

'She was hiding in a dark corner of the barn. She could barely stand or walk,' Hensley told the Star-Banner.

Attacked: A Florida woman came home from a weekend trip to find the horse she cares for had been attacked brutally attacked. The horse named Sassy, pictured, is a Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse

Sassy's owner, Dr Todd Overcash, told WKMG he believed the horse was burned by acid.

'Her pain is pretty severe, and those wounds have to be scrubbed down twice a day, and we have to dose her,' said Overcash, an Ocala surgeon.

Because the wounds were fairly shallow, a veterinarian who treated the horse said they were likely not caused by acid, but by paint that can burn skin, according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office report.

Farm: Sassy, the horse who was attacked, was staying at a barn in Ocala's Meadow Wood Farms when someone beat her and burned her, possibly with paint

Overcash told the Stat-Banner it appeared Sassy's attacker also kicked her repeatedly.

'She is one of the most gentle horses you could ever be around,' Overcash said.

Looking for answers: Sassy's owner, Dr Todd Overcash, said his horse was in severe pain. He is offering a reward to anyone who has information about the attack

A neighbor saw a man walking around the two-acre property at Meadow Wood Farms on Friday, according to WKMG. The man was driving a red car.

But police still have few leads, with no broken gates, finger prints or other incriminating evidence.

Overcash is offering a reward for anyone who knows who might be responsible for Sassy's injuries.

'I'm just overwhelmed by it,' That horse is the love of a 4-year-old boy,‚Äù Overcash told the Star-Banner.

Hensley's son, Heath, loves Sassy, but is confused about her injuries.

'He
knows she is hurt, but doesn't really understand what happened,' 
Hensley said. 'He didn't want to go to school today so he could be with 
her.'

Sassy was taken to an equestrian hospital where she's being given round-the-clock care.

'Barring infection, she should make it,' Overcash told the Star-Banner. 'I'm worried about how it will affect her walk.'

The Marion County Sheriff asks anyone with information about the attack to call their office.
