Sam Allardyce was delighted with West Ham's win over Liverpool, as the Hammers boss boasted his side caught the Merseyside outfit by surprise.

West Ham triumphed 3-1 at Upton Park thanks to goals from Winston Reid, Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano, with Raheem Sterling netting for the Reds.

The minor upset in east London was a huge boost for the Hammers who climb above Liverpool in the table, which left Allardyce purring over his side's impressive performance.

'The first half was outstanding,' Allardyce told Sky Sports. 'From our point of view, the way we got about our job, we took Liverpool by surprise.

'We tried improving our finishing over summer and it's there to see. We could have been three or four goals up at half-time. We knew Liverpool would come back but the first half was outstanding.'

Allardyce also admitted his side targeted the Reds at set-pieces, with a free-kick move scored by Reid giving the Hammers the lead after only 75 seconds.

'We think so. Everyone is vulnerable to set-pieces and then you have excellent headers of the ball like James Tomkins. Stewart's Downing's cross to the far post was excellent too.

'I was disappointed Liverpool scored in the first half as they only had one shot on target. It was a good defensive performance. We got a deserved victory, it wasn't a lucky one.'
