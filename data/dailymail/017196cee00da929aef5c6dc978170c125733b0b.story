Changing tyre: Nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full-size spare wheel as standard, according to research undertaken by a car website

The reluctance of car-makers to provide traditional spare tyres has led to a huge rise in puncture call-outs in just four years, research reveals today.

Nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full-size spare wheel as standard, according to car website HonestJohn.co.uk.

Around a quarter (27 per cent) are fitted with the ‘space-saver’ tyre, which cannot be used for long distances, and less than half (46 per cent) come with a repair kit – usually comprising an air-pump and a self-sealant.

Other alternatives include cars fitted with ‘run-flats’, tyres that are reinforced to allow the motorist to continue driving on a puncture for a limited time.

The trend has led to a huge rise in the number of wheel-related call-outs to breakdown organisations. The RAC alone says it has seen the number of motorists calling for roadside recovery due to tyre-related breakdowns rocket from 293,000 in 2010 to 357,000 in 2013 – an increase of nearly a quarter.

The rise in calls from drivers without a traditional spare tyre is even more dramatic – up from 29,000 in 2010 to nearly 94,000 in 2013.

Remarkably, the RAC predicts it will handle more than quarter of a million such calls next year – a near nine-fold increase on 2010.

The RAC has developed its own ‘universal spare wheel ‘ which – which fits eight out of ten cars - and has been used more than 30,000 times since launch in January. A smaller version is being tested for cars like Ford Fiestas and Fiat Puntos .

The HonestJohn report says that among the worst manufacturers for lack of a traditional spare tyre or ‘space-saver’ are Volvo, Vauxhall, Porsche, MINI, Mazda, Dacia and BMW, which don’t provide one. Among the best are Italy’s Alfa Romeo, Korean car-maker SsangYong and Japan’s Suzuki which do.

It notes: ‘The phasing out of the spare wheel by car manufacturers has resulted in a surge of tyre and puncture related problems, with almost one in three of HonestJohn.co.uk readers reporting a tyre-related breakdown in the past two years.

‘With puncture and other tyre-related breakdowns on the rise, these cutbacks can come at a huge cost to the consumer, with some having to pay more than £600 to buy a full-size spare, in addition to the necessary jacking kit and brace.’

The report notes that the smaller ‘space-saver’ tyres were the most likely spare wheel fitted as ‘standard’ and were provided in just over a quarter (27per cent) of all cars in the research.

But the report notes: ‘However, the space-saver is not designed to be driven for long distances, with most having a maximum recommended speed of around 50 mph, restricting drivers to short distances.’

The demise of the spare tyre is being accelerated by European Union pressure on car-makers to cut pollution and CO2 emissions from vehicles while improving fuel efficiency, say experts.

Dan Powell, managing editor of HonestJohn.co.uk explained that the EU test-cycle for determining a car’s CO2 emissions uses a car’s weight to calibrate the rolling road for the test.

The heavier a car, the more fuel it uses and the more CO2 emissions it generally produces.

Governments – including the UK – tax a car according to how much CO2 emissions a car produces according to a ‘polluter pays’ principle. So lighter cars usually qualify for lower tax.

Mr Powell said: ‘For many car manufacturers, the spare wheel is seen as an easy route to cut weight. A typical 17-inch alloy wheel weighs about 20kg, which can add up to nine grams of CO2 to the vehicle’s emissions.

'In the short run, the owner benefits from lower vehicle tax, but in the long run they could be punished by a costly call out at the roadside.’

RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘The motor industry is under pressure to meet European and UK greenhouse gas emissions targets and reducing the weight from cars by scrapping the spare wheel helps to make vehicles more fuel efficient.

‘So car manufacturers are increasingly supplying emergency puncture repair kits consisting of a tyre sealant and inflator pack instead of a spare wheel.’

But many drivers find emergency tyre repair kits ‘awkward and messy to use’, he said. And often they can’t drive the car away afterwards as sealant kits only work with small holes.

Mr Bizley added: ‘Many people don’t realise they don’t have a spare this until it’ s too late. They often say I’ve just spent £20,000 to £30,000 on a new car and I don’t get a spare.’
