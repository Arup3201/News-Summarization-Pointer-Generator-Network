The troubled FA Cup will be subject to a major internal review by the FA to form part of a new strategic plan from 2015 to 2019.

And the scope of the inquiry, revealed in a letter sent by chairman Greg Dyke to all councillors and staff members following the last FA board meeting, suggests the world’s most famous club knockout tournament will have a radical makeover.

Dyke writes: ‘The review will consider the Cup’s audience, attendances, format, place in the fixture calendar, prize and rewards and brand and rights. They will report to the board before the end of the season and recommendations will form part of the new plan.’

Cup of joy: Arsenal ended their trophy drought with a Wembley win in May, but the competition faces an overhaul

The FA know they must do something about their historic competition, which still has no sponsor for next season and has prize-money for the winner less than the fee Premier League clubs receive for a single live match.

An FA spokesman said: ‘The review is all about the FA Cup remaining relevant to a young audience.’

The Ageas Bowl proved a difficult venue for the third Test, with poor crowds, unsatisfactory transport arrangements — the park-and-ride system was cancelled on Thursday — and a ground that resembled a building site in places. 

Yet Ian Botham and Shane Warne, who just happened to have been house guests of Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove during the Test, were conspicuous for the way they sang their praises of the ground while commentating for Sky.

Tough times: The Ageas bowl was not well attended and transport links were poor

Greg Rutherford, who answered his critics by winning gold in the Commonwealth Games long jump, is known to be upset most with BBC athletics pundit Jonathan Edwards. He described Rutherford as ‘fragile’ and ‘lucky’ to win Olympic gold.

Rutherford, who missed the indoor season through injury, was watching the BBC coverage at home when Edwards put the boot in.

However, former Olympic and world champion triple jumper Edwards was one of the first to tweet his congratulations to Rutherford.

Sacha Gemili, mother of Commonwealth Games 100 metres silver medallist Adam, has set herself up as an agent for her son as well as some other female runners and young footballers. 

But the dilemma for Sacha, who demands that her clients conduct themselves well, is how she much she is prepared to promote 20-year-old Adam when athletics is briefly in the spotlight, as opposed to protecting family privacy.

Celtic’s poor exchange

Reaching the Champions League group stage is reckoned to be worth £20million. 

And Celtic must now overturn a three-goal deficit against Legia Warsaw in the second leg of the third qualifying round at Edinburgh’s Murrayfield because Parkhead will still be out of commission after staging the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.

Glasgow 2014 will not reveal what they paid to hire Parkhead. But even an estimated £1.5million will seem very poor value to Celtic fans if it contributes to their Champions League demise.

Sky Sports supremo Barney Francis has invited selected media to view the new Sky Sports News studio with its state-of-the-art technology. 

But there will be no demonstrations of sport being filmed in 3D. Having spent many millions developing it — especially for live football — Sky refuse to say if they will show any games in 3D in this Premier League season. Instead, expect 3D to be kicked into the long grass.

Final word — hopefully for a long time — on the loathsome Piers Morgan. He’ s so fickle that he’s even been cuddling up on Twitter to the equally odious Brian Moore due to their shared dislike of your Sports Agenda columnist.

Only last week the gruesome twosome were acrimoniously swapping insults on talkSPORT in a row about Kevin Pietersen. 

You can’t believe a word either of them says.
