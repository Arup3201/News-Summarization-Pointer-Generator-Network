The Premier League is to be investigated by Ofcom under the Competition Act after concerns were raised about how it sells broadcast rights for live football.

The Office of Communications, the government approved regulator for the broadcast industry, has intervened after a complaint made by Virgin Media in September. The investigation could lead to a major shake-up in how much live football is shown on TV.

Virgin Media want more than the current 41 per cent of live matches sold to TV, claiming the present situation leads to higher subscription costs for consumers.

Ofcom have promised to consult the Football Supporters' Federation and other supporters' groups. The screening of live football on TV is a sensitive issue and there are concerns that it could affect attendance and atmosphere at stadiums on match days, particularly for 3pm kick-offs.

BSkyB and BT currently share the rights to televise Premier League football games. The price for the latest rights deal - covering 2013-16 - is a staggering £3bn, a 71 per cent increase on the last agreement. This investigation, which will begin immediately, is likely to delay the bidding process for the next set of rights from 2016 onwards.

A Premier League statement said: 'We note that Ofcom has launched an inquiry.

'Ofcom has stated that this is at an early stage and it has not reached a view as to whether there is sufficient evidence of any infringement.

'The Premier League currently sells its audio-visual rights in a way that is compatible with UK and EU competition law and will continue to do so.

'We will be able to demonstrate that as part of this process.' 

Virgin Media's specific complaint is that the current arrangement 'for the collective selling of live UK television rights by the Premier League for matches played by its member clubs is in breach of competition law.'

Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder in Virgin Media, who have complained about the way TV rights are sold

The company, which Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder in, has raised concerns about the number of Premier League matches for which live broadcasting rights are made available.

'Virgin Media argues that the proportion of matches made available for live television broadcast under the current Premier League rights deals - at 41% - is lower than some other leading European leagues, where more matches are available for live television broadcast,' said Ofcom in a statement.

In their initial complaint to Ofcom, Virgin Media highlighted the fact that UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. They pointed out the disparity of the fact fans in the UK have to pay £51 monthly for access to all top-flight matches on TV, while it is £21 in Germany, £18 in Spain and as little as £10 in France.
