As Australia's greyhound racing industry goes into damage control mode after it was revealed that the sport's top trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to mechanical lures and using them as live bait to train the dogs, another trainer has been suspended and three inquiries have been launched.

A tale of horror and death was told by ABC's Four Corners program on Monday night, revealing irrefutable evidence of live baiting during secretly filmed training sessions.

The live piglets, possums and rabbits were strapped to lures before being sent around the private tracks before being chased and killed by dogs.

Six NSW greyhound trainers, 10 in Victoria and several in Queensland, have stood down after property inspections by the RSPCA.

One of the men stood down - Paul Anderton - was a former steward for Greyhound Racing Victoria.

On Tuesday, Greyhound Racing NSW chief executive Brent Hogan said NSW trainer John Thompson had also been suspended in the wake of the report.

Comment was being sought from Mr Thompson, who is reportedly based in the state's north, at Shannon Brook.

'John Thompson was stood down last night,' Mr Hogan told Fairfax Radio.

'We only became aware of John Thompson's involvement through the broadcast last night.

'He's registered in NSW, he's been suspended and we're now working with Racing Queensland in relation to that matter.'

In the show, two-time Australian Greyhound Trainer of the Year Darren McDonald, who has won more than $4 million in prize money, was filmed tying a terrified piglet to a mechanical lure to be savaged by dogs.

Another long-time successful trainer, Tom Noble, was filmed taking a baby possum from its mother so the mother could be used for live baiting.

The Racing Integrity Commissioner Sal Perna believes the live baiting is probably an isolated incident

On Tuesday, GRNSW announced that a taskforce headed by former High Court justice Michael McHugh would investigate live baiting in the industry.

Mr Hogan has called for greater powers to stamp out animal cruelty in the industry.

The allegations of animal cruelty come as the NSW government oversees a scheduled five-year statutory review of the Greyhound Racing Act 2009.

In light of the report, the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing has extended the time for submissions for a further two weeks, until March 2.

NSW opposition leader Luke Foley has called for an urgent, independent investigation to root out the 'bad apples' in the industry, and urged life bans.

NSW Greens MP John Kaye is urging GRNSW to be broken up for failing to detect live baiting.

Meanwhile, Victoria's racing integrity commissioner believes the illegal practice of live baiting is isolated in the greyhound industry.

Sal Perna says the allegations of live baiting aired in an ABC report were a shock and he was only aware of one instance, which was disproved, in his five years in the job.

Mr Perna says the extent of the practice isn't known.

'My guess is that it is isolated but I really don't know yet,' he told reporters on Tuesday.

He says he will investigate the extent of the problem.

Mr Perna said he would conduct a wide-ranging inquiry.

'I want to talk to people in the industry who know about this - whether it's current, or whether it's historical, or whether this is isolated or not.'

He said it would be premature to stop greyhound racing when the extent of the problem was not known.

Twenty-three greyhound industry participants in Victoria, NSW and Queensland have been stood down for allegedly being involved in live baiting.

Mr Perna said reform was needed to stop trainers getting around sanctions by transferring ownership of dogs to relatives.

'If it doesn't have any effect because they can move a dog over to someone else and continue to be doing what they did, they're not working and they need to be addressed,' he said of sanctions.

Tasmania has also promised to review animal welfare processes in its greyhound industry following the Four Corners expose that highlighted the use of live bait in other states.

Tasmania's minister for racing says the revelations aired on Monday night by ABC's Four Corners were horrifying.

'The use of live bait is illegal, disgusting and totally unacceptable. This is an extremely serious animal welfare crime,' Jeremy Rockliff Rockliff said in a statement on Tuesday.

'The Tasracing chief executive officer Dr Eliot Forbes has today assured that there is no evidence to date that this abhorrent practice is occurring in Tasmania.'

Mr Rockliff has since directed the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Director of Racing to review Tasmania's arrangements for animal welfare in the greyhound racing industry.

In Tasmania, live baiting currently attracts a fine up to $28,000 and imprisonment of up to 18 months.

Animal rights activist Hayley Cotton said what they discovered on the secret footage was brutal.

'On the tapes was probably the most horrific cruelty that you would ever come across involving dogs and animals,' she told the ABC on Monday.

Scores of owners and trainers including some of the biggest names in the business were shown secretly blooding their dogs with live bait.

'It's a practice that they believe will give their dogs a distinct advantage over other competitors not exposed to the practice, for the simple reason that their blood lust is up,' Four Corners presenter Kerry O'Brien explained.

However, it's the cheating that is maybe the worst thing as hundreds of thousands of punters bet more than $4 billion a year on greyhound racing, but what most of them don't know is that this illegal activity is taking place.

Two famous greyhound owners are former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting and St Kilda and Sydney Swans AFL great, Tony Lockett. Both were pictured in the program with their winning greyhounds that were trained by Mr McDonald. However, they would have had absolutely no connection with Mr McDonald's cruel methods.

'Darren McDonald's dogs have won millions of dollars in prize money, so I'm sure there'll be people without and within the racing industry who'll be questioning whether his winning advantage has been gained through illegal and quite horrific live baiting training practices,' Lyn White of Animals Australia said.

Tracking dogs and their trainers from private training facilities and on to official race meets and using undercover investigators to infiltrate the industry, the Four Corners program discovered the integrity of potentially thousands of races and millions of dollars in prize money is now in question.

Live baiting has been banned and criminalised for decades. Those found guilty of it can face up to two years in jail and a life ban from greyhound racing, but at tracks at New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria the practice was obviously still thriving.

Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker said an independent review of all systems relating to animal welfare and integrity would be run in the wake of the allegations.

He said live baiting was 'abhorrent'.

Greyhound Racing NSW chief steward Clint Bentley said the decision to stand down the trainers was made because of the seriousness of the allegations against them.

'While the investigations are only beginning, the allegations are of such a serious nature that we felt it imperative to suspend the five participants immediately,' Mr Bentley said in a statement on Friday.

Greyhound Racing Victoria Chief Executive Adam Wallish said 10 people had been suspended over the allegations.

'The use of live bait in the training of greyhounds is disgusting and has no place in our sport,' Mr Wallish said in a statement.

'Any person engaged in live baiting can expect to be disqualified and prosecuted. We have zero tolerance for these individuals.'

Mr Wallish confirmed that live baiting is a criminal offence punishable under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 and can attract a jail term of up to two years and a fine of more than $30,000.
