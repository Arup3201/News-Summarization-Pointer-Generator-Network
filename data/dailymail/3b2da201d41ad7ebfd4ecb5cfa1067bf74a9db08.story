A new father has told how he dived 12ft to catch his newborn baby after his girlfriend suddenly gave birth on the toilet - despite having no idea she was pregnant.

Karl Ford, 37, leapt into action after his partner Hilary Crump rushed into the bathroom with severe stomach cramps.

He then called NHS 111 and spoke to a health advisor, who quickly realised Miss Crump's symptoms indicated she had just gone into labour.

Surprise: Karl Ford dived 12ft to catch his newborn baby after his girlfriend Hilary suddenly gave birth on the toilet - despite having no idea she was pregnant

Just minutes later, she gave birth while crouching over the toilet but Mr Ford, an accountant, was forced to fling himself across the floor to catch the baby before he plunged into the bowl.

An ambulance took the shocked couple, and their new 5lbs 1.5oz son Benjamin, to hospital.

They were discharged six days later on February 22 and returned to their home in Malvern, Worcestershire. 

Miss Crump, 26, a care worker, had no idea she was pregnant and even lost weight before her unexpected birth.

She had been taking the Pill and had not missed any periods.

Unexpected: Mr Ford ended up delivering baby Benjamin last month - just after his mother had complained of stomach cramps

Mr Ford said: 'Hilary was crouching over the toilet and Benjamin tried to dive in head-first. I was about 12ft away so I had to move swiftly to dive and catch him'

Mr Ford, a keen cricket fan, said: 'Hilary was crouching over the toilet and Benjamin tried to dive in head-first.

According to studies, the phenomenon of surprise birth is not as rare as one might  imagine.

Statistics show that one in 600 mothers-to-be will be unaware they are pregnant until they give birth, or just before.

The situation tends to occur in busy women, those who may already be overweight, and those approaching the menopause.

It tends to happen in menopausal women and younger busy women because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking for signs

Also, bleeding during pregnancy is common, especially during the first few months when the baby is bedding in, so women can think they are still menstruating.

'I was about 12ft away so I had to move swiftly to dive and catch him.

'It was a bit surreal, but I just launched myself like some kind of super wicket keeper into the air and caught him just before he fell into the toilet.

'You don’t think you will be able to cope, but when it happens, you just do it - you don’t have time to think.

'It was a bit of a surprise to be delivering my child.'

Miss Crump said: 'I woke up at 3am and had cramps, took two paracetamol and went back to sleep.

'Then
 I woke up at half four and the pain kept coming. I suppose looking back
 it was textbook contractions, but you don’t expect it when you don’t 
think you’re pregnant.

'I gave birth about 20 minutes after being on the phone to the NHS 111 woman.

'I was in the bathroom because I felt a pressure and didn’t know what was happening at first. I just said "there’s something coming out of me" and out he came in one big push.

'I was on the loo and I stood up with the pain so Karl had to run and jump to catch him before he went down the toilet.

'Our friends joke that we should have called him Louie.

'I thought something horrendous was happening to me, but it turned out to be something wonderful.'
