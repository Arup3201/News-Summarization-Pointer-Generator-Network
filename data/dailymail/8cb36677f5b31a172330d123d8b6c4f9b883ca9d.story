Shake-up: Harriet Harman said allowing Scottish MPs to vote on laws that only affect England is an ‘anomaly’ that must be addressed

Ed Miliband faced open revolt over English home rule last night after Labour’s deputy leader called for the issue to be tackled.

Harriet Harman said allowing Scottish MPs to vote on laws that only affect England is an ‘anomaly’ that must be addressed.

After days of the Labour leadership refusing to back the idea, she told LBC Radio: ‘We do have to recognise there’s an anomaly and look at different ways we can address that.’

With senior MPs joining forces to create a new group called the English Labour Party, there were also warnings that Mr Miliband is not speaking ‘clearly or loudly enough’ about strengthening the influence of English MPs.

Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw, who yesterday attended the inaugural meeting of the new group, said Labour must be ‘clear we are fighting for England’.

And Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk warned that Mr Miliband will have a ‘real problem’ in his party conference speech today unless he addresses the issue of Scottish MPs being allowed to continue voting on laws that only apply in England.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday became the latest senior figure to reject David Cameron’s plans to introduce ‘English votes for English laws’.

He refused a total of six times to agree that it was ‘unfair’ for Scottish MPs to vote on English issues in Parliament as the fallout continued from last week’s No vote in the independence referendum and the promise of new powers for Holyrood.

Mr Miliband himself dodged the question 13 times when asked whether England should get the same rights promised to Scotland in a TV interview on Sunday.

There is now increasing alarm in Labour ranks that the party leadership appears to have no answer to Mr Cameron’s plans.

Labour is reluctant to see any dilution of the rights of its 40 Scottish MPs at Westminster – fearing it would be unable to pass laws on key areas such as health, education and tax if it wins the next election.

Tony Blair only succeeded in passing legislation on foundation hospitals and tuition fees thanks to MPs with seats north of the border – even though their constituents are unaffected by them.

The Conservatives say the situation will become untenable once further powers over tax, welfare and spending are devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Former Culture Secretary Mr Bradshaw told the Western Morning News: ‘Our leadership has to be much clearer that there’s a problem that needs addressing. But I haven’t heard clearly or loudly enough from the leadership that there is a problem that needs addressing.’

Although the Exeter MP said the Tory plan was a ‘stitch-up in Westminster’, he claimed there was an ‘imbalance and unfairness in our constitutional settlement’.

Mr Bradshaw later told the BBC there should be an immediate constitutional convention. ‘Let’s get on with it,’ he added.

‘This is a historic moment Labour must not miss.’ Mr Danczuk said he was ‘surprised’ and ‘disappointed’ that Mr Miliband did not have a set of proposals on English home rule following last week’s independence referendum result.

‘If he doesn’t address it tomorrow then he’s got a real problem... then we are really on the back foot,’ he said. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Balls insisted the Prime Minister was ‘playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union’. ‘I want fairness, but I’m not going to say there’s an easy and fair solution to the question you’re raising,’ he added.

Len McCluskey, general-secretary of the union Unite, told the Labour conference in Manchester: ‘We don’t want a constitution made by posh boys in Chequers.’

Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith also rejected the plan, calling it a ‘tawdry trick’ to buy off critics.
