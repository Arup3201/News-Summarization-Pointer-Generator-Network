The mixed martial arts fighter known as 'War Machine' pleaded 'not guilty' today to 32 felony charges including attempted murder during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtroom.

Prosecutors, who originally charged Jonathan Koppenhaven with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013.

The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault.Â

Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, a mixed martial arts fighter known as War Machine, appeared in court Wednesday in Las Vegas. Koppenhaver was scheduled for arraignment on battery, lewdness, assault and coercion charges in the August 8 attack on adult film actress Christy Mack and her male friend at a Las Vegas home, but prosecutors charged him with additional felonies including kidnapping and assault and accused him of attacking Mack multiple times over 15 months

Ms Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife

Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaven held without bail, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she feared for her life.

Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping.

She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault.

Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages.

According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver.

Ms Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife.

She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife.

She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego.

'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me.

'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating.

'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.'

Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth.

Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Ms Mack posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11

She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side.

'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote.

'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife.

'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die.

'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.'Ms Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her.

'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard.

Koppenhaver, who pleaded not guilty, was ordered held without bail during his initial appearance in court Wednesday

'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.'

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife.

'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house.

'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.'

Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past.

After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt.

The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007.

He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year.

He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.
