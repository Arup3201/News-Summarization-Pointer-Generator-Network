For many people, discarded chewing gum is filthy rubbish that costs thousands to clean off the pavements.

But for one street artist, a piece of gum left on the road is a tiny canvas onto which he can paint a miniature masterpiece. 

Talented Ben Wilson can spend as long as 10 hours hunched over the gum painting his eye-catching, colourful pictures on to the sticky surface, which measure no more than an inch in length.

The talented artist said he took up his 'pavement art' hobby to brighten his neighbourhood in Muswell Hill

He spends up to 10 hours carefully painting each piece of chewing gum to turn it into a unique piece of art

He starts by heating the gum with a small blow torch, then adds lacquer to harden the chewy substance.

His designs are then added with special acrylic paints.

Mr Wilson started his bizarre hobby as a way of brightening up his neighbourhood in Muswell Hill, north London, and has since created his ‘pavement art’ throughout the UK and abroad.

His most recent work has seen him decorate the unsightly mess across Sunderland as part of the Cultural Spring Project, which is bringing art to council wards across the north of the city and in South Tyneside.

The artist ventured into the city centre last week, where his unique take on the art form proved an immediate hit with the public.

'Ben has been doing this for about 10 or 12 years and before that he was a wood sculptor, so he has always been involved with recycled art,' said Cultural Spring’s Garry Hunter.

'The reaction to his work is incredibly positive - no-one has ever seen anything like it before.

'It is all about bringing art out of the gallery and onto the street.

Mr Wilson, a former wood sculptor, has been decorating discarded chewing gum for the last 10 to 12 years

Since starting his hobby in north London, the creative artist has taken his 'pavement art' around the world

Mr Hunter said: 'Ben’s happy to talk to anyone, so if you see a man lying on the pavement, come and say hello'

“There is a pretentiousness about a lot of art that can be intimidating.

'What we are doing is taking it out on to the streets so that everybody can see it and everybody can enjoy it.
