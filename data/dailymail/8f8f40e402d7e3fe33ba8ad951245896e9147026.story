The parents of a seven-year-old western Pennsylvania boy say he has been suspended from school - and could be expelled - after telling a teacher that he accidentally brought a toy gun to school.

Chris Simak and Jennifer Mathabell say their son, Darin Simak, a first grader, was suspended from Martin School in New Kensington Tuesday.

Mathabell says the boy left his regular book bag at a friend's house, so she packed him another one, not realizing the toy was in it.

Suspended: First grader Darin Simak was suspended after he handed in a toy gun to his teacher which his mother had inadvertently sent him to school with in a backpack

Policy: Darin handed the toy gun in to the teacher because he knew it was against the rules, but was suspended anyway

The boy's parents Darin immediately gave it to a teacher because he knew it was against the rules.

The school superintendent John Pallone says bringing a gun to school violates their policy at the highest level and requires suspension until a meeting can be held to discuss the issue and decide if punishment is necessary.

Mathabell had to go and pick her son up from school and was told not to bring him in for classes Thursday, reports WTAE.

She decided to take Darin to school as normal Friday because she doesn't believe he's done anything wrong.

'I'm sending him to school because he's entitled to be in school and be educated.

The principal called her and told her to take her son back home and placed Darin in in-school suspension until his father could pick him up.

School rules: Darin Simak's parents say he shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing, while the school district says bringing a fake weapon to school violates policy at the highest level

Indignant: Jennifer Mathabell took her son to school Friday but he was placed in in-school detention and his father had to pick him up again

The boy faces an expulsion hearing Friday.

New Kensington-Arnold superintendent John Pallone wouldn't comment on Darin Simak specifically.

The district's policy calls for a one-year expulsion for 'replicas of weapons' but also allows the superintendent to modify the punishment on a case-by-case basis.

Darin Simak is confused, because he believes he did the right thing yet is still being punished for it.

'Of course I did [the right thing],' he told WTAE.

Chris Simak told Fox News that his son 'did the right thing, and we're trying to teach him the right way, and now they're teaching him the wrong way.'
