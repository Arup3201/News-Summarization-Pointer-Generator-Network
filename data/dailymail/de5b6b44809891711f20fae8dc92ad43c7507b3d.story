Guests at an upscale US hotel can choose to stay in historic train cars that have been transformed into luxury suites and rest on their original tracks.

Built within a major rail station, the Crowne Plaza in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, features 13 authentic 1920s Pullman train cars that offer a king or two double-sized beds and all the usual amenities of an ordinary hotel room.

While paying tribute to a romantic period of rail travel, each car is named after prominent 20th century personalities such as Winston Churchill, actor Charlie Chaplin and jazz musician Louis Armstrong.  

All aboard: Historic train cars that have been transformed into luxury suites rest on their original tracks at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Downtown Union Station hotel

For added effect, statues of train conductors and passengers dressed in authentic period clothing surround the hallways of the hotel, which opened in 1999 and has undergone £32m in restorations.

The unique rooms are a nod to the Crowne Plaza’s surroundings. The hotel is located within Union Station, which opened in 1853 and is now a hub for Amtrak. 

Guests who spend the night in one of the train cars may think they are riding the rails as the muffled rumblings of trains passing through the station regularly vibrate through the hotel.

Listed in the US National Register of Historic Places, Union Station is teeming with history.

It once employed inventor Thomas Edison as a telegraph operator and served as a travel route for about 500,000 passengers monthly, including US president Abraham Lincoln before he was assassinated.

But the station almost met the wrecking ball on at least one occasions.

After being threatened with demolition as railroad service diminished, a local architect formed a committee to save and restore the building.
