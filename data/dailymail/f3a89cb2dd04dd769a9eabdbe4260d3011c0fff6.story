Topshop is set to auction off five custom-made dresses worn on the red carpet at this year’s Met Gala in New York City. 

The bespoke gowns, which were modeled by Kendall Jenner, Chanel Iman, Jourdan Dunn, Toni Garrn and Zoe Kravitz at the glamorous event in May, will be placed on eBay on November 27 for a bidding period of ten days. 

All proceeds will benefit Fashion Targets Breast Cancer, an organization dedicated to raising awareness and finding a cure for the disease.

Think you can fit into these gowns? Kendall Jenner, Chanel Iman, Jourdan Dunn and Toni Garrn (left to right) all wore Topshop to the Met Gala in May 2014. The dresses will go up for auction on November 27

Lady in red! Zoe Kravitz, also in Topshop, wore a sultry gown with a high slit and plunging neckline 

The satin gowns were all tailor-made for the wearer and inspired by Charles James - the late British fashion designer whose work inspired the theme of the event. 

Ms Dunn wore a vibrant yellow dress with a deep V-neck, structured seams and a dramatic train trailing behind her on the red carpet.

Ms Garrn's baby blue gown had ruffles on the bodice and a cut that was tight around the waist and flared below the knees. 

Ms Jenner's champagne dress was also a mermaid style, but with a corset-like bodice and  puzzle-like seaming along the sides.

Ms Dunn and Ms Kravitz modeled more risqué designs; the former stunned in a silvery gown with a paneled, side-less top while the latter in a sultry red dress with a slit up the front. 

All the gowns were handmade in Topshop's London atelier, according to Women's Wear Daily, and easily stood up to the brand's couture counterparts - like Lanvin and Chanel - which were worn by other attendees.

The Met Gala is a annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.

The invite list is determined by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who chairs the party. For those who do not receive an invite, tickets cost $25,000 each. 

The event's theme is always determined by the topic of the Met's yearly Costume Institute exhibit. In years past, themes have included 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (2011), 'Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations' (2012) and 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (2013).
