Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has been cleared of any wrongdoing after comparing the shape of a new Japanese car to the Elephant Man.

Controversial Clarkson said theÂ  Japanese car and camper van hybrid looked like 'people with growths on their faces'.

He then mimicked the famous disfigured Victorian man Joseph Merrick - played by actor John Hurt in the 1980 film - as he spoke about the car.

Cleared: Jeremy Clarkson likened a Japanese car to the Elephant Man (the label given to Joseph Merrick, right)

Clarkson said the  Japanese car and camper van hybrid looked like 'people with growths on their faces' during a Top Gear episode in February. The brand of the car was not mentioned on the show but is believed to be a Prius

The star slurred his speech saying that the car resembled something you would not talk to at a party. Richard Hammond then dubbed it the 'elephant car'.

His behaviour on the BBC motoring show Top Gear in February sparked outrage with the boss of a disfigurement charity saying such comments led to ridicule and bullying.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 41 complaints from outraged viewers and the BBC more than 55.

But despite this, Ofcom announced its decision today not to proceed with the complaints.

A spokesman said that, after careful assessment, Ofcom had decided not to pursue them because they did not raise issues warranting investigation.

He said: 'Ofcom recognises that the comments were potentially offensive to individuals living with facial disfigurement.

'However, on balance, we believe that they would not have exceeded the likely expectation of the audience, and any potential offence was justified by the context.'

But he added: 'We have informed the BBC of the issues raised by the complainants so they can be taken into consideration for future programmes.'

Controversial: Jeremy Clarkson jokes that striking public sector workers should be shot as he appears on BBC 1's The One Show

Reaction: Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones react to the remarks which sparked around 31,700 complaints

During the BBC2 show on February 5, a Japanese car-camper van hybrid was discussed. The brand was not mentioned although it is believed to be a Prius.

Clarkson compared it to 'people with growths on their faces' in the programme - repeated the following Thursday.

James Partridge, chief executive of the charity Changing Faces, said that Clarkson's remarks 'create a culture of ridicule and bullying' against people who are ill, disabled or have unusual features.

The uproar came after Clarkson said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'.

Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark, made on The One Show, sparked around 31,700 complaints. But he was cleared by the regulator.

In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'.

In November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

And just last month, Clarkson sparked controversy by suggesting that long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism'.

The presenter said that delays were caused because immigration officials could no longer use their discretion to wave certain passengers through.
