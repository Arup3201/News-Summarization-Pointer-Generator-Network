Visitors to an exhibition of Titanic artifacts were left with a genuine sinking feeling - after turning up to discover it was closed due to water damage.

The display, understood to be taking place at the Premier Exhibition Center in Atlanta, features authentic objects salvaged from the doomed liner as well as recreations of some of its most famous rooms.

But visitors were left chuckling in disbelief after turning up to be 
confronted by a sign informing them that the exhibition is 'currently 
closed due to water damage'.

Visitors to an exhibition of artifacts from the doomed liner Titanic were confronted with this sign

With an unerring degree of accuracy, promotional material states visitors arriving at the exhibition 'will be drawn back in time to April 1912'.

It reads: 'The Exhibition has been designed with a focus on the legendary RMS Titanic’s compelling human stories as best told through these authentic artifacts and extensive room re-creations. 

'Perfume from a maker who was traveling to New York, china etched with the logo of the elite White Star Line, even the Ship’s D-Deck door -- these and many other authentic objects offer haunting, emotional connections to lives abruptly ended or forever altered.'

Doomed: the Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage

Pictures of the sign quickly went viral on the internet prompting a flurry of jokes and ridicule.

It is not clear exactly when the sign appeared or how long the exhibition was closed.
