Jimmy Bullard and Kendra Wilkinson bit off more than they could chew in Thursday night's 'I'm a Celeb' Bush Tucker Trial. 

Sitting down at a table-for-two the duo nervously checked in to the make-shift pub named the 'Terror Tavern', where you'd be more likely to be served a gin-and-vomit than a spritzy cocktail.

In order to collect the ten stars up for grabs, the former Premier League midfielder and the ex-glamour model were told they must each eat five courses of unappetising bush-themed dishes.

In keeping with the pub theme, the pair were instructed to throw darts at a specially designed board in order to determine the size of the portions they would eat.

With the board divided into 'small' and 'large' sections, Jimmy Bullard was confident his skills with an arrow would help him in the task.

'I'm hoping that a bit of the fear has gone since the first (Bush Tucker Trial),' he said.   

Stepping up to the oche first in the 'jungle's finest gastro pub' was former Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, who threw off-centre to be faced with a large portion of the aptly named 'prawn cocktail'.

Served with a side of salad, Wilkinson had to eat two sections of bush deer penis.

'Is that a pubic hair? There’s a pubic hair on it,' she squealed. 

'The penis is in my throat right now!' she added.

The trial included the infamous Witchetty grub, which Bullard had the pleasure of facing (dips included)

Next up was Bullard, who hit a double top to receive a small portion of 'ham, egg and (cow's) lips'.

Downing in one, Bullard and his cultured palate noted a 'bit of a beef taste'.

Hitting small on her second shot with a dart, Wilkinson had to devour a morsel of blended cockroaches, crickets, meal worms and cheese fruit, served on a bed of rice. She did so with aplomb.

With the accuracy expected from a former professional footballer, Bullard hit another double top and successfully necked a live Witchetty grub, not without wincing as it slithered down his throat.

Following suit with another small portion of 'mixed gill' (fish eye), the American Wilkinson popped her way through the unusual fishy dish: 'I don't even eat seafood,' she squirmed.

Bullard then saw off a large serving of 'pig eye steak', working his way through four pig eyes served on a platter with chips, peas and a grilled tomato.

No pub would be worth it's salt without the presence of pork scratchings, but in this case Wilkinson got her serving in a packet labelled 'pork snifflings', or more bluntly, a pig's nose.

'It tastes like I'm swallowing farm,' the American moaned.

The pair were made to test their throwing skills on the specially designed 'large or small' dart board

The foul trial proved too much for Bullard, who got on all fours to try and get over his disgusting dinner

With another double top, Bullard faced a round of 'mixed nuts', but in this quirky version of the classic pub dish the former Wigan man had to swallow a sheep's testicle.

When asked how it tasted by host Ant McPartlin, Bullard replied: 'that's just f****** filth!'

With the final round of grizzly meals to come, Williamson chowed down on a large helping of 'cheesy nach-toes', or ostrich foot to be precise.

With the offer of an alcoholic drink for all camp-mates on the cards, Bullard's last task took on an added incentive.

True to form, the ex-Fulham joker hit small, and begrudgingly nibbled at two pieces of camel hump from a cocktail stick as the matted mounds of camel fur sat in front of him.  

McPartlin again quizzed the ex-footballer: 'Would you come back (to the Terror Tavern)?' 

Bullard didn't leave much to the imagination when he responded, 'no its a f****** s***hole!'

With 10/10 stars, the successful partnership went back to camp with a big smile.

'I ain't leaving a tip,' Wilkinson joked.
