Cuppa: Downing Street said it had been unable to boil the kettle after being told not to turn on the taps in Number 10

David Cameron had to go without his afternoon cuppa while MPs were forced to cross their legs as Parliament’s toilets were shut after Whitehall’s water supply was cut off.

A blunder by workmen saw a hole cut in an 18-inch water pipe serving government departments, the House of Commons and Wellington Barracks as temperatures soared to almost 30 degrees.

Hundreds of gallons of water surged into the road near Buckingham Palace, although royal insiders insisted their supply was unaffected.

Civil servants working in Whitehall were told not to turn on taps as supplies dried up yesterday afternoon.

It left the Prime Minister and his team unable to have a brew.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Number 10 had no water for at least two hours and the Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall was also affected.

‘It meant that obviously we were unable to make a cup of tea or have a drink of water, but I think it was resolved fairly promptly.’

Supplies were affected for five hours until around 7pm, leaving some MPs forced to take refuge in Parliament's bars in search of refreshment.

Tory party vice-chairman Michael Fabricant revealed on Twitter that there was a parliamentary ‘crisis in the loo department’.

He added: Nearly all House of Commons loos closed owing to burst water main in Whitehall. #constipated.’

It is thought gas engineers cut through the water main in Birdcage Walk, close to the Buckingham Palace. A Palace spokeswoman said: ‘Our supplies were unaffected.’

However, the authorities are calling for an investigation to ensure there is not a repeat of the fiasco.

Councillor Ed Argar, Westminster council's cabinet member for city management, said: ‘We want assurances from both utility companies involved that they will work around the clock to fix this as quickly as possible and to the highest standards.

‘Our businesses, residents and visitors cannot afford to have roads closed to traffic in the centre of London and major Government departments cannot be left without water.’

A spokesman for Thames Water said: ‘Our engineers were on the scene immediately.

‘We are now working to fix the damaged pipe, and restore normal service to all affected customers by re-routing water from other parts of our network.’
