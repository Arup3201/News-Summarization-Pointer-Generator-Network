Treatment: The Professional Footballers’ Association of Ireland has said Ched Evans is 'being treated like the Guildford Four' in an article which describes the convicted rapist's crime as 'alleged'

The Professional Footballers’ Association of Ireland has said Ched Evans is 'being treated like the Guildford Four' in a statement which also describes the convicted rapist's crime as 'alleged'.

An article written by the union's solicitor and published on its official website claims the former Wales international could be innocent, and that even if guilty, he deserves a chance of redemption.

Lawyer Stuart Gilhooly also refers to Evans’ crime as alleged despite the fact he was found guilty in court and served half of a five-year jail sentence.

'This crime, as alleged, was at the bottom end,' he wrote in the article, which was later removed. 

'There was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it. This, I hasten to add, does not make it right, or anything close to it, but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor.

'It’s not easy to muster up too much sympathy for Evans but there is surely nothing worse than being accused of a crime which you genuinely believe you didn’t commit.

'The argument against that is that a jury convicted him of the crime. The same applied to the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. They got no public sympathy either.'

Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, north Wales.

The striker had denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.

He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence.

An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name as he apologised to girlfriend Natasha Massey for his infidelity.

Last week the 25-year-old footballer was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United, but the decision sparked a backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Olympic gold medal winner Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said she would ask for her name to removed from the club's ground if he returns full-time.

It has since been reported that the club may not offer Evans a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'.

However, in his article Mr Gilhooly wrote that another club, if not Sheffield United, would eventually make a move for him.

'How can Evans apologise?,' he wrote.

'He is convinced, and has a good argument, that he is not guilty of rape. If he apologised, then he is admitting a crime he feels he didn’t commit. Who would do that?

'But Ched Evans has served his time, whether he is innocent or guilty. He puts the ball in the net so eventually someone will take a chance on him.'

The Guildford Four were released from jail in 1989 after their convictions for alleged roles in IRA bombings were overturned, while the Birmingham Six - jailed over similar allegations - had their convictions quashed in 1991.  

Mr Gilhooly's comments were removed from the website this morning and while he insisted he had no problem with the decision, he stood by the views.

'It was not taken down at my behest, but was removed with my consent and I have no difficulty with the PFA Ireland's decision to do so,' he said.

'The article reflected my opinion of the situation and did not seek to represent the views of the PFA Ireland or its members.

'I stand over its contents.'

Stephen McGuinness, general secretary of the PFAI, confirmed that it had been the association's decision to remove the article from the website.

'We decided to take it down, it was our decision. We decided to take it down this morning as soon as we came in,' he said.

'The decision was not at the behest of Stuart, it was our decision to take it down.' 

Mr Gilhooly's comments came as a fourth high-profile Sheffield United patron resigned over the ongoing row.

Former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton stepped down as a patron of Sheffield United’s Community Foundation, following the examples of TV presenter Charlie Webster, 60s pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham since Evans returned to training with the Yorkshire club.

He added: 'I firmly believe that Ched Evans has the right to rebuild his career in football but rebuilding a career should not involve walking straight out of prison and into the shirt of the club he so badly let down.

'I believe he needs to move away and move on, and the club itself needs to lift its reputation out of the gutter.'

Campaigners against sexual violence have also criticised the club’s decision to allow Evans to train with the team. 

Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training.

Twitter abuse was aimed at  local hero Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people.

She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans.

'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said.

'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.'

Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.'

The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse.

People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said.

Gerry Conlon, Paul Hill, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong served 14 years of a life sentence after they were wrongly convicted of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings.

They had been sentenced at the Old Bailey, after being found guilty over the deadly IRA attack on the Horse and Groom pub killed five people, including four off-duty soldiers, and injured 65.

But the attack, and others in Woolwich and Birmingham, became better known for the huge miscarriages of justices they led to in the aftermath, with the public demanding the perpetrators be brought to justice.

Mr Conlon, Mr Armstrong, Mr Hill and Ms Richardson were jailed in 1975 for the Guildford bombing, while Mr Hill and Mr Armstrong were also jailed for the Woolwich bombing in which two people died.

In a separate trial, The Birmingham Six - Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker - were convicted for carrying out the Midlands bombings.

Later Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, and members of the Maguire family - who became known as the Maguire Seven - were arrested and jailed for possessing and supplying the IRA with the explosives for the bombs.

But all those involved protested their innocence and after years of campaigning their convictions were overturned.

In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four after they had served 14 years behind bars, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them.

An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the case.

Emerging from the Court of Appeal a free man, Mr Conlon declared: 'I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent.

'The Maguire Seven are innocent. Let's hope the Birmingham Six are freed.'

In July 2000 the Prime Minister Tony Blair became the first senior politician to apologise to the Guildford Four.

Giuseppe Conlon died in prison in 1980, still protesting his innocence, and never saw his son freed.

In June 1991 Giuseppe's sentence was posthumously overturned by the Court of Appeal along with those of the Maguires.

The Birmingham Six also had their convictions overturned on appeal in 1991.

Although the Guildford Four scandal has been known for 30 years the case files remain classified.

Along with the Birmingham Six the material associated with the investigation and prosecution is held under the Official Secrets Act where it can remain shut to the public for 75 years.

Mr Conlon, the best known of the Guildford Four, died in June of this year aged 60 after a long illness. His story was told in the 1993 film In The Name Of Our Father, in which he was played by Daniel Day Lewis.
