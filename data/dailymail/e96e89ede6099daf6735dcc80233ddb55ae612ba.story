High-ranking Chinese politicians have been accused of taking part in an orgy after more than 100 pictures showing three naked men and two nude women were uploaded to a social media website.

The photos, which appeared on China's Twitter equivalent Weibo, reportedly show the group engaging in sexual acts in a hotel room.

It is claimed the men are the Party secretary of Lujiang county in Anhui Province, Wang Minsheng, his deputy, Jiang Dabin, and the party's youth leader at Hefei University, Wang Yu.

Gone viral: One of the pictures uploaded to micro-blogging site Weibo which reportedly shows three high-ranking Chinese politicians posing with two women during an alleged orgy

Threesomes are technically illegal in China and suspects can be prosecuted under a 'group licentiousness' statute added to the criminal code in 1997, according to reports.

Minsheng has denied any part in the scandal, which has spread like wildfire across the country, and believes the allegations have been made against him because he is currently handling a corruption case.

He claims the images have been doctored by his political enemies.

Yu, however, has admitted being in the pictures and said one of the women was his school teacher wife.

Denials: At least one of the officials allegedly involved has denied that it is him in the photos - claiming instead that opponents have somehow doctored the images

The Global Times, which is affiliated
 with the Communist Party, cited a police officer with the Lujiang 
county public security bureau as confirming the case was under 
investigation, but did not confirm if a suspect had been arrested, 
according to The Huffington Post.

The
 images, which went viral on Weibo last week, have sparked so much 
attention on the micro-blogging site that the State Council Information 
Office, China's top web censor, has stepped in.

It
 has issued an official directive stating that 'all websites must stop 
following and hyping the so-called "Lujiang Indecent Photos Incident."'

The scandal comes as Gu Kailai (left), the wife of disgraced Communist official Bo Xilai, stands trial accused of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood (right)

Phrases such as 'naked photos' and 'vulgar photos' have been banned from the site, according to www.gawker.com.

Chinese authorities are understood to have revoked the mens' party membership and Wang Yu has since been fired.
