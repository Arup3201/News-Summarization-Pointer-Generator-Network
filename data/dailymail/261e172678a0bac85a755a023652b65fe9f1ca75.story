One of Australia's top criminal prosecutors is trying to stop a corruption watchdog inquiry, investigating accusations that she advised her son's girlfriend to pretend to have chest pains after a car accident to avoid a blood alcohol test.

NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, is understood to have launched legal action in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday against a planned Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry into the allegations.

The action, which is expected to be heard in the coming days, will argue the inquiry falls outside the ICAC's jurisdiction.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating whether Ms Cunneen and her son Stephen Wyllie, 26, advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid being breath tested after a car crash on May 31.  

NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen is considering quitting over a corruption investigation into a car crash involving her son's girlfriend

Sophia Tilley was involved in a car accident at Willoughby on May 31. Her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie is the son of Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC. Ms Cunneen and Mr Wylie are accused of counselling Ms Tilley to face chest pain at the crash site.

The highly-respected has stood aside from her duties until the investigation is resolved. 

She revealed to Daily Mail Australia that she is considering quitting her job in response to what she says is a baseless corruption investigation targeting her and her son.

'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw,' Ms Cunneen told Daily Mail Australia. 'After 38 years in the service of our state.'

The court challenge comes after former Supreme Court judge David Levine QC, who is now the Inspector of the ICAC, reportedly asked the commission to justify its inquiry into Ms Cunneen.

Mr Levine's audit requires ICAC to hand over material related to the investigation.

It's claimed she and her son Stephen Wyllie in May advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains to avoid a blood alcohol test at scene of a car crash.

Ms Tilley allegedly took the advice.

Ms Cunneen denies what she's described as the 'malicious' allegations made to the watchdog.

Former Queensland Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Commissioner Alan MacSporran QC will preside over the three-day public inquiry starting on November 10, should Ms Cunneen's legal challenge be unsuccessful. 

Ms Cunneen, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, told Daily Mail Australia that she is devastated by the effect of the investigation on her family.

Margaret Cunneen has had a distinguished 38-year career in public service. She is considering quitting due to allegations she and her son attempted to pervert the course of justice in relation to a car accident involving her son's girlfriend.

ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August.

Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore, on May 31. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. 

Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured.

The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. The Mondeo was a write-off.  

None of those at the crash scene knew of any investigation until ICAC officers executed simultaneous warrants on July 31 at the home of Ms Cunneen and that of Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley. Each of their mobile telephones was seized. 

Ms Cunneen has successfully prosecuted paedophiles Robert 'Dolly' Dunn, Colin Fisk and Phillip Bell as well as pack rapist Bilal Skaf and his gang of thugs. Despite, or because, of her accomplishments, she has been criticised by some defence lawyers for being too close to crime victims. 

In late 2012, Ms Cunneen was appointed to preside over a special commission of inquiry into allegations of police interference in child sex abuse cases in the Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. The day before the accident she had delivered her report to the then Governor, Dame Marie Bashir.

Ms Cunneen is unsure what happened in the two months between the accident and her phone being seized to initiate an investigation but believes the inquiry was sparked by a 'malicious complaint' from someone out to damage her reputation. 

She has stood aside from her job pending the outcome of the investigation. 

In August, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were called before ICAC for private hearings. Again, the matter seemed to be stalled until Mr Wyllie, Ms Tilley and Ms Cunneen were served with summonses to appear before a public hearing on Wednesday night.

Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen says she may quit her job over ICAC's investigation into allegations she counselled her son Stephen Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to face chest pains after a car accident

The following day ICAC announced it would hold public hearings as part of what it is calling Operation Hale. The hearings would examine 'allegations that on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident'.

The public hearing is set for three days, staring on November 10, when the commission is expected to hear from police and ambulance officers who attended the crash as well as members of the public who were present at the scene.

Daily Mail Australia can reveal that since the announcement of the public hearing a new witness to accident has come forward stating she heard and saw 'nothing untoward' at the crash scene. 

Ms Cunneen has received widespread support from prominent Australians, particularly in the legal community. The architect of the ICAC, Gary Sturgess, has described the investigation as 'appalling'.

'That's a joke, really that's a joke,' Mr Sturgess told The Daily Telegraph.

'If that is the best they have got to do then frankly they should be handing some money back. It's appalling.' 

Former premier Nick Greiner, who set up the ICAC in 1989, has also criticised the corruption watchdog's investigation into Ms Cunneen for straying beyond its 'core task'.

Mr Greiner told The Sydney Morning Herald he had a 'sneaking view' that if Ms Cunneen had a lower profile 'I doubt this would have happened'.
