FA Cup heroes Bradford City have the chance of a third Wembley visit in two years after landing a quarter-final home draw to Championship Reading.

The Bantams – 2-0 winners over Sunderland on Sunday - had hoped to be paired with Manchester United at Valley Parade but will now be favourites to make it through to the last four for the first time since winning the competition in 1911.

Meanwhile,  Manchester United will host FA Cup holders Arsenal in the sixth round at Old Trafford.

Ties to be played March 7 and 8.

Liverpool host  Blackburn Rovers at Anfield, while there will be a Midlands Derby with Aston Villa playing West Brom. But Bradford will be looking to steal the headlines once again. 

Phil Parkinson’s side were League Cup runners-up in 2013 before triumphing in the League Two play-off final.

Playmaker Billy Knott only joined the club in the summer and, after last night’s favourable draw, now wants a piece of the Wembley action.

‘I honestly think we can beat anyone at Valley Parade,’ he said. ‘With a home tie the fans will come out in force and it showed against Sunderland they really are the 12th man.

‘It’s hard for us not to perform in front of them, it makes such a difference. We’ll respect Reading, like we do every team, but we’ve got great belief in ourselves right now.

‘It is every boy's dream to play at Wembley and the next game is like a final for us.’

Meanwhile, the BBC is in discussions with the FA about delaying their decision on which matches to choose for live coverage.

The broadcaster received criticism for not showing Bradford’s victory but defended that choice by revealing they had to make their selection before the outcome of the fourth-round replay between Sunderland and Fulham.

BBC football editor Mark Cole said: ‘We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it’s tricky for them.

‘Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections.

‘But we hope there’s a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like Sunday.’
