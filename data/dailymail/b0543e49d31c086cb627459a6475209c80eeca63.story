Controversial: Tory councillor Danny Mayzes, 25, was suspended from his post after suggesting a violent film featiuring an electric border fence offered good ideas for dealing with immigration

A Conservative Party councillor who said a film featuring gun-toting border vigilantes offered a good way of dealing with immigrants has been allowed to keep his post after issuing an apology.

Danny Mayzes, 25, of Clacton, Essex, was watching Machete, in which vigilantes patrol an electric security fence on the Mexican border, when he took to Twitter, saying: 'Am watching Machete - now that's how you DEAL with immigration.'

He added: '#turn_on_your_ tv_Theresa' in what is believed to have been a reference to Home Secretary, Theresa May.

Mr Mayzes has been on Tendring District Council since he was 19 and was the youngest ever chairman of the council until he stepped down last May.

After posting his tweet last October, he was suspended from both the council and the Conservative Association in Clacton for 'breaching sufficient group rules'.

Labour councillors criticised Mr Mayzes for his 'totally unacceptable' suggestion, but Essex Police later said no action would be taken against him.

Yesterday the former Tendring council chairman, who quit both Twitter and Facebook after the incident, was reinstated.Â  He apologised and said he intended to go on a social media training course.

Mr Mayzes told fellow councillors he: 'Completely accepted the decision of the Conservative group' and backed a report which concluded that he had breached the members' code of conduct.

He went on: 'I have voluntarily suggested undertaking media training 
(including social media) and hope to complete this training as soon as 
the council can facilitate it.'

In
 a separate statement, he said: 'The message that was sent on Twitter was extremely far from the character in which people know me by.

Violence: The gory 2010 film Machete stars Robert De Niro as a senator campaigning to incite racial hatred

'We all make silly mistakes and hopefully lightning won't strike twice.

'I
 hope that the council can now move on from such a lengthy investigation
 and that we, as councillors, can concentrate on doing the things that 
matter to our residents; electing a leader, strengthening stability and 
carrying on with the successful work that this council has been 
delivering for the people of Tendring including free parking, low 
council tax and excellent frontline services.

'That is the kind of work that I want to feel proud of being part of.'

Machete was made in 2010 and stars Robert De Niro, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan and Steven Seagal, and shows violent scenes between police, border guards and illegal immigrants on the Mexican border.
