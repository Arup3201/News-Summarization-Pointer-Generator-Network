A young man is believed to have suffered injuries after a reckless driving stunt on a highway in Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi man fell off a car while its driver attempted to speed down the road on two wheels.

The video was recorded by a person sitting in the car behind, and was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday and has been viewed by nearly 60,000. 

Risky game: A Saudi man can be seen sitting on the roof of a car driving on two wheels

The video shows a white SUV driving down a highway in Saudi Arabia, balancing on two tyres.

The man, wearing traditional clothing, sits on the car roof, with his feet still inside the car.

When the car slams back down on four wheels, the man, who has been sitting with his weight on the roof, falls flat on his face on the highway.

The video was picked up by local newspaper Sada, but there has been no mention of whether the young man was injured in the fall.

Ouch! The man falls face-first into the asphalt on the highway at an unknown location in Saudi Arabia

Bad joke: The video was posted on YouTube, but it is not known if the man suffered any injuries
