Military chiefs have drawn up plans for a 'show of force' to warn Argentina against hostile action over the Falkland Islands.

There are fears of Buenos Aires-sanctioned aggression after March's referendum if islanders as expected, vote in favour of retaining links with Britain.

In response, extra troops, another warship and an additional RAF Typhoon fighter jet could be deployed or high-profile military exercises carried out in the South Atlantic as a deterrent.

This could also involve the deployment of the Royal Navy’s Response Task Force Group, a flotilla comprising destroyers, a frigate, a submarine and commandos.

Defence chiefs could also dispatch elements of the Army’s 16 Air Assault Brigade — the airborne task force which includes members of the Parachute Regiment — which has just completed a series of demanding exercises in Spain preparing for 'general war'.

Islanders will vote on March 11 on whether they wish to remain an overseas territory of the UK.

It is expected there will be a 100 per cent 'yes' vote, which intelligence officials have warned the Prime Minister could lead to an aggressive 'stunt' by Argentina, such as planting the country's flag on the island.

Warning: David Cameron says he would be prepared to use military force again should tensions over the Falkland Islands escalate further

Other possibilities include the harassment by the Argentine Navy of the Falklands’ fishing fleet and the disruption of British oil and gas exploration.

It is feared such a move would escalate tensions quickly if the Royal Navy was ordered to intervene.

A senior defence source told the paper: 'Britain needs to be in a situation to respond very quickly to a whole series of threats - that is why we have contingency plans. Our posture has not changed but neither are we complacent.

'There are a number of contingencies to deal with any threat to the Falklands and they are currently being reviewed. No orders have been given to any military unit at this stage but prudent planning within all units who could be deployed in the event of a crisis is taking place.

'That is quite normal. Commanders like to be two steps ahead rather than two steps behind.'

It is understood elements of force — such as a 150-strong company group — can be flown to the Falklands via Ascension Island, in a matter of hours if needed.

Members of 3 Para recently returned from the islands as part of a routine deployment and would be perfectly placed to brief additional troops deploying at short notice.

About 1,500 troops are permanently based on the islands, together with four RAF Typhoon jets and anti-aircraft and artillery batteries.

Prince William recently served with the RAF’s search and rescue helicopter unit based at Port Stanley.

A Royal Navy destroyer, currently HMS Edinburgh, is always on duty in the South Atlantic, working alongside the patrol ship HMS Clyde, the fleet tanker HMS Gold and the ice patrol ship HMS Protector.

One of the Royal Navy’s nuclear powered submarines is always on notice to move to the region if the diplomatic situation deteriorates.

Last year HMS Dauntless, a Type 45 destroyer and one of the Royal Navy’s most capable vessels was dispatched to the South Atlantic during the 30th commemoration of the war.

Despite hostile rhetoric from Argentine president Cristina Kirchner, the British government believes that Buenos Aries currently lacks both the political will and military capability to recapture the islands.

But the Prime Minister has told his cabinet and senior defence chiefs that Britain should not be complacent and must be fully prepared for every eventuality.

Just last week the Mr Cameron insisted that Britain would not shirk from defending the islands if Argentina attempted another invasion.

Referring to a recent briefing on the Falklands at a National Security Council meeting, the Prime Minister said: 'I get regular reports on this entire issue because I want to know that our defences are strong, our resolve is extremely strong.

'We have strong defences in place on the Falkland Islands, that is absolutely key, that we have fast jets stationed there, we have troops stationed on the Falklands.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, said: 'Our overall military posture on the Falkland Islands remains unchanged and they remain well-defended.

'The Ministry of Defence has always had contingency plans in place to increase the military footprint in the South Atlantic if required.'
