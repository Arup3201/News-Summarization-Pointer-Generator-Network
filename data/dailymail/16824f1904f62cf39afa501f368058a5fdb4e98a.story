Sixteen years ago tennis player Andrea Jaeger was so touched by the devastating massacre of 16 children at Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996 that she flew 5,000 miles to help and helped inspire U.S. Open champion Andy Murray.

Today she unfortunately found herself once again at the scene of a brutal school shooting as she arrived to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial of Sandy Hook Elementary.

Speaking of her humanitarian work with her Little Star foundation, Andrea, 47, said she hoped that one child from the tragic Connecticut school could one day emulate Murray.

'I was helping the recovery relief of Sandy in Staten Island when I heard of the shooting,' said Angela.

'Sandy Hook and Dunblane are so similar in a way - they are both close knit communities, so rural and quiet.

'They have both been hit so badly by the tragedies they have both endured.'

Arriving to offer the elementary school any assistance she can, Andrea hopes to be as important to the community's recovery as she was to Dunblane and Andy Murray.

'I arrived around one week after the 
attack and brought as many tennis rackets as I could with me from 
Colorado,' said Andrea (who was a former world number two and retired in 
1987).

'The kids were shaken up, but some like Andy who had to hide (during the shootings) were quiet and seemed haunted.

'We set up a net and a court, and we played a game of tennis.

'Andy
was already playing tennis by then and he definitely had an idea of how
to hold a grip and he successfully passed me on the court.

'He was small but pretty good.

'Of course he had to hide during the attack (carried out by the 43-year-old gunman Thomas Hamilton) and a lot of people didn't really know till recently that he was even there during the massacre.'

Andrea said that she believes Andy expressed himself on court and now that hopes one day a child from Sandy Hook could go on to be as successful.

Murray is current world number three and won the 2012 U.S. Open in September.

'He has only recently begun to discuss the events of 16 years ago,' said Andrea.

'Did I know then that he would go on to win Olympic Gold and the U.S. Open?' Andrea asked herself.

'No,' she admits, before adding that she saw Murray's mother Judy 2 years ago, who thanked Jaeger for what she did.

Saying that she knows from her experience with Dunblane that the tragedy will never leave the children, Andrea hopes the community can come together to heal.

'How we react to this is something personal,' said Andrea.

'I came to lay flowers and offer my help.

'One boy from Dunblane told me he had to hide while blood dropped onto his head. That never leaves you - but I still get letters from kids from the school.'

Asked if she thought Andy Murray would come to visit Sandy Hook, Andrea said she believed that people in Connecticut were in his thoughts.

'I think Andy has had enough - but I know he is thinking of them all.'

On 13 March 1996, unemployed former shopkeeper Thomas Hamilton, 43, walked into the Dunblane Primary School armed with four handguns. He shot and killed 16 children and one adult before committing suicide.

Future tennis champion 
Andy Murray attended the school at the time and was forced to take cover
in a classroom. Murray has previously stated that he was too young to 
understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in 
interviews.

In his autobiography Hitting Back he 
states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his 
mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car.

Hamilton entered the school and made his way to the gymnasium where he opened fire on a class of five- and six-year-olds, killing or wounding all but one person. Fifteen children died together with their class teacher, Gwen Mayor, who was killed trying to protect the children.

Hamilton then left the gymnasium and shot into a mobile classroom, where children were hiding under tables. Hamilton then shot at children in the corridor, injuring a teacher.

He then returned to the gym and killed himself.

Eleven children and three adults were rushed to the hospital. Another child was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

Following the tragedy at Dunblane the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 were enacted, which effectively made private ownership of handguns illegal in the United Kingdom.
