Jordan Blackford amazed medics with his miracle recovery after he was almost killed in a car crash.

But five months after the smash the teenager, from Walker, Newcastle, is still in hospital because of a mystery condition.

The 14-year-old's hopes of returning home hit a setback when he was diagnosed with a liver problem while being treated for his injuries.

But while the youngster may be frustrated at not being able to go home, the family who came so close to losing him are just delighted he is still with them.

His father Terry, 47, said: 'He's been doing great. He's absolutely fantastic now. He talks and walks and everything.

'Of course he's bored and frustrated and wants to get out but we are over the moon. It's like a huge weight has been lifted off our shoulders.

'We just take one day at a time now.'

Jordan's family feared they had lost him after he was hit by a car near his home on December 21.

He was flung into the air and suffered a serious head injury in the incident.

The schoolboy's devastated parents feared the worst as they kept vigil by his bedside over Christmas while Jordan spent two weeks in an induced coma.

But Mr

Chelsea, Naomi, and Jake breathed a sigh of relief when he began to make
 an amazing recovery.

The family had hoped that they would have him home by now.

Adults have 50 and 80 milligrammes of copper in their body, mostly in muscle and the liver.

Copper helps make melanin, bone, and connective tissue and helps with many other processes in the body. It is absorbed through the diet, in foods like liver, seafood and beans.

Various medical problems can disrupt normal copper levels, causing the sufferer to have too little copper, a condition called copper deficiency, or too much copper, called copper toxicity.

With certain conditions, copper builds up in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. Over time, high copper levels can cause life-threatening organ damage.

However, doctors treating his injuries at the Royal Victoria Infirmary have now discovered a problem with the levels of copper in his liver.

'He's got a problem with his liver that actually had nothing to do with the accident, but if that hadn't have happened we wouldn't have know about it,' Mr Blackford said.

'The consultant said it's not life-threatening. But they need to know exactly what it is before they can treat it and he can go home.'

With no discharge date in sight the Jordan is now beginning lessons at the hospital in a bid to help him catch up with the work he has missed.

Terry added: 'He's going to go to a residential school which is part of the hospital now as because of his head injury he won't learn as well as other people will. Once he gets there they think he will come on even quicker.'

A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He is currently on police bail.
