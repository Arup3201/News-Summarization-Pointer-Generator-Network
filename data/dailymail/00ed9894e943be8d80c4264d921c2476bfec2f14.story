Rod Stewart has shrugged off the complaints of a fan whose nose was broken by a soccer ball the singer booted into the audience at a Las Vegas concert.

When TMZ questioned Stewart about the alleged injury, the singer - who is a long-time soccer fan and plays regularly - responded coolly: 'It's a contact sport.'

A 53-year-old Southern California man who says he has lingering injuries after his nose was broken by the ball has filed a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages of at least $10,000.

Mostafa Kashe's civil negligence complaint alleges that he didn't expect to be hit in the face by a ball kicked by the raspy-voiced British singer from the stage during a show at the Caesars Palace resort in October 2012.

The complaint dwells mainly on Stewart's footballing skills. 'Stewart has significant experience in the sport of soccer and experience in kicking soccer balls, having previously tried out for a professional soccer team in the UK and regularly playing in amateur soccer leagues since his youth,' it states. 

'Stewart either knew or should have known that his actions could cause injury to unsuspecting patrons of his concerts.'

Mostafa Kashe claims Stewart intentionally kick​ed the soccer ball into the audience with 'sufficient force so as to potentially injure patrons'

The singer is known to be passionate about the sport, and even has a professional-standard pitch in the garden of his Essex home, where he plays regularly. 

Stewart, 69, also has his own seat in the directors’ box of Celtic FC, where he famously Rod Stewart wept tears of joy after his team beat Barcelona in 2012.

He even had trials with Brentford FC, then a Third Division club, after leaving school in the early 1960s,and was rumored to have been signed up as an apprentice.

Mr Kashe claims that the British rock star intentionally kick​ed the soccer ball into the audience with 'sufficient force so as to potentially injure patrons,' according to the lawsuit filed in Clark County Court​ in Nevada​.

His claim is apparently based on lost wages and legal and medical fees. 

The kicking of soccer balls into the audience, usually during the song Hot Legs, has long been a part of Stewart's shows.

'The show wouldn't be the show if I stopped kicking out those footballs,' he has said. The balls, which Stewart usually autographs, are often resold.

Representatives of Stewart, promoter AEG Live and Caesars Entertainment Corp, did not immediately comment  on the lawsuit filed against them. Yesterday, Michael Roth, of AEG Live, said his firm had not yet been served with the complaint.

Kashe, an electrical engineer from Diamond Bar, California, is seeking the unspecified damages of at least $10,000 plus attorney fees.

His attorney, Larry Weinsteen, said Kashe and his wife were big Stewart fans who traveled to Las Vegas primarily for the concert.

The lawyer said his client was treated by a hotel medic and filed an injury report with Caesars before being left with 'substantial' injuries including an impaired sense of smell.
