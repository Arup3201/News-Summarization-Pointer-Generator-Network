If there were any doubts of a schism inside the Republican Party, three conservatives' veiled slaps at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Wednesday should erase them.

Hours before Time magazine unveiled its next weekly cover, featuring a silhouette of Christie and the headline 'The Elephant In The Room,' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer that Christie is a 'moderate ... who can win in New Jersey.'

'What that means about the national party – I'm not sure there's an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party,' he said, before insisting that 'the party in general is more conservative.'

'Moderate Republicans' are fighting words from conservatives trying to paint their rivals as weak centrists who agree with some Democrats' initiatives. Paul, like Christie, is considered a likely 2016 presidential candidate.

Rand Paul said Wednesday that it was a 'conflict of interest' for federal funds to support an economic development ad campaign that included shots of Chris Christie, his presumed rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination

Christie went back to work on Thursday, greeting a troop of Girl Scouts at the state capitol in Trenton, N.J.

Gov. Christie appeared briefly in several ads, paid for with federal disaster recovery dollars, which touted the New Jersey shore's recovery after Superstorm Sandy

Christie briefly found the national spotlight in 2012 as a possibly running mate for presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, but fell out of favor with many on the party's right wing after he praised President Obama following Superstorm Sandy.

'I'm a conservative,' he insisted Tuesday during a separate CNN interview. 'I've governed as a conservative in this state, and I think that's led to some people disagreeing with me in our state, because it's generally a left-of-center, blue state.'

'The difference has been, is, I haven't tried to hide it or mask it as something different.'

Paul has steadily pushed himself toward the tea party base, announcing Wednesday that he will move his weekly opinion column from the right-leaning Washington Times to the still more conservative Breitbart.com blog.

That shift followed accusations, and admissions, related to alleged plagiarism in Paul's 2012 book 'Government Bullies' and in several of his public speeches.

His criticism of Christie turned decidedly aggressive during a Senate hearing Wednesday afternoon, when he slammed a series of federally funded post-Sandy economic development ads that included brief on-screen quotes from the New Jersey governor and his family.

Time's new cover, complete with elephant references, was probably meant as a Republican pun but was immediately associated with jokes about the governor's weight

The ads, which promoted the Jersey Shore's recovery, included Christie's son saying it 'looks like the word is spreading,' and the governor adding, 'We're stronger than the storm and open for everyone.'

Christie was a candidate for re-election at the time.

'People running for office put their mug all over these ads while they're in the middle of a political campaign,' Paul complained to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan in a clear jab at Christie.

'In
 New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running
 for political office. I'm thinking there might be a conflict of 
interest there. That's a real problem. And that's why, when people are 
trying to do good and trying to use the taxpayer's money wisely, they're
 offended to see our money spent on political ads. That's just 
offensive.'

At the time, however, the Center for Public Integrity's top watchdog Bill Buzenberg told USA Today that Christie's two-second cameo was no big deal.

'I can't say it's unethical,' Buzenberg
 said, 'because it's not unusual for a governor to be involved in a 
tourism campaign. When you drive into a state, you see the welcome signs
 with the governor's picture. The pictures are usually bigger in an 
election year.'

Governor Christie, a self-professed conservative who has at times embraced bipartisanship, said Tuesday night that Washington politicians should look to New Jersey as an example of what's possible for the GOP

Four more years? (Two more years?) Christie is the governor until he decides not to be, an outcome that could accompany a presidential primary run in 2015

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two more tea party-backed possible entrants into the White House sweepstakes a few years from now, also launched rhetorical mortars at Christie after his 60 per cent landslide showing in his re-election race.

'I think we need to understand that some of these races don't apply to future races,' Rubio said on CNN.  Every race is different – it has a different set of factors – but I congratulate [Christie] on his win.'

'Clearly he was able to speak to the hopes and aspirations of people within New Jersey. That's important. ... Governor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey – in states like New Jersey.'

Cruz took his own veiled swipe at the New Jersey governor.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz (R) is among the conservative pols linnig up to take pot shots at Chris Christie, the GOP political darling of the moment who is reveling in his brand of centrism

They keep their jobs too: Staffers in the governor's office applauded the boss after he won a second term Tuesday night in sweeping fashion

'I think it is terrific that he is brash, that he is outspoken and that he won his race," he told ABC News.

'But
 I think we need more leaders in Washington with the courage to stand 
for principle. And in particular, Obamacare is not working.'

That was a jab at Christie's decision to expand Medicaid in his state by raising the income limit for eligibility, a move made possible when the Affordable Care Act became law.

During his victory speech Tuesday night, Christie showed disapproval for a perceived civil war that has pitted conservative purists against more broad-minded centrists whose appeal extends equally to independent voters.

'Listen, I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, maybe the folks in Washington, D.C. should tune in their TVs right now, see how it's done,' he said.
