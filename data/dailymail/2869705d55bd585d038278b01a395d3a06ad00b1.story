Teachers are wasting valuable lesson time dealing with pupils playing with their mobile phones, a report has found.

Children swinging on chairs, making silly comments to get attention and passing notes were other problems staff said they face.

The Ofsted report, based on a survey of teachers and parents – as well as more than 3,000 school inspections – found that a vast amount of learning time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils.

And many teachers complained that when they do attempt to dole out discipline, head teachers are failing to back them up. In light of the findings, the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw will warn this week that poor behaviour in classrooms is dragging down standards.

He said the chances of pupils enjoying a well-ordered learning environment had become ‘something of a lottery’ – and that many teachers have come to believe bad behaviour is an inevitable part of life in the classroom.

However teaching unions have accused Sir Michael of ‘talking nonsense’ by suggesting that teachers accept poor discipline.

Chris Keates, general secretary of union NASUWT, said her members acknowledge there is a problem with low-level disruption.

But she added: ‘The chief inspector is talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it. What teachers do say is that... they are frequently unsupported by school leaders.’

Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that according to Ofsted ‘behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving’.
