Health campaigners stormed out of a meeting of NHS bosses today after under fire chief executive Sir David Nicholson was given a vote of confidence by his board.

A member of the public shouted 'shameful' as Professor Malcolm Grant, chairman of the NHS Commissioning Board, said Sir David was the person 'we wish very strongly' to lead the organisation.

Sir David has faced calls to quit following the publication of the Francis Report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009.

Anger: Health campaigners stormed out of a meeting of NHS bosses today as under fire chief executive Sir David Nicholson was given a vote of confidence by his board

The stormy meeting came after it emerged today that the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust may be placed into administration by health bosses.

Regulator Monitor said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients.

If the move goes ahead, the trust will be the first foundation trust in the country to be put under the charge of special administrators.

The
families of patients caught up in the Stafford Hospital scandal staged a
protest outside the meeting of NHS bosses today and renewed their calls for the
resignation of Sir David.

The campaigners 
stood in silence outside the meeting in Manchester of the NHS 
Commissioning Board (NHS CB), which Sir David heads.

Around a dozen 
people, who had travelled from Staffordshire, held placards displaying 
Sir David’s photograph accompanied by the words 'Resign', 'The man with 
no shame' and 'Too many deaths, no accountability'.

Leading
the protest outside was Julie Bailey, who set up the organisation Cure 
The NHS after her mother, Bella, died at Stafford Hospital in 2007.

Speaking outside the meeting, Mrs Bailey said the families 'simply want a safer NHS'.

She
added: 'We campaigned for three years for a public inquiry in the hope 
that at the end of it we would get accountability and justice for all 
the loved ones that we have lost.

'We want accountability and safety for everyone in the NHS and we believe that won’t happen until people are held to account.'

She
said Sir David was 'not a scapegoat', adding: 'He is the chief 
executive of the NHS and holds ultimate responsibility for the failings.

'He
is paid an awful amount of money to ensure people are safe in hospital.
It’s not a difficult thing to do but he seems to have taken the eye off
safety and prioritised finances instead.

'We believe that, as he is ultimately responsible for the NHS, he should do the honourable thing and resign immediately.

'It’s disappointing that we’re having to be here, after all this time, trying to hold people to account and get justice.'

She
said her message to the NHS board today was: 'How can we start to cure 
the NHS when the person who was in charge of those failings is now 
expected to be in charge of putting it right?'

But speaking at the meeting, Sir 
David defended his position. He said: 'The enemy is complacency that 
things will be all right in the face of 
criticism of NHS services.

'What we need to do is absorb the criticism,
understand it in a deep way and do something about it.

'I'm very passionate about improving services for patients, I'm very 
ambitious about the NHS and what that sometimes turns into is 
intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response "Just get it right" when actually we need to be more reflective, think 
about why people are doing the things they do.'

He said it was important that standards are set in a way patients can understand and help enforce.

'If we had hundreds of thousands of inspectors going round hospitals 
looking at that, we wouldn't pick up all the poor care that happens.

'Patient safety is the top of the tree. We need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety.' 

At the meeting, Prof Grant said he had been 'deeply worried' by speculation in the media about Sir David's future.

He added: 'Over the recent weeks I have reflected on several occasions with David about what has been said in the press.

'I
have discussed it personally with each of the directors of the 
Commissioning Board and I have discussed it collectively with the 
non-executive directors of the board.

'We have come to a clear view 
that David Nicholson is the chief executive of the board, he is the 
person who we wish very strongly to lead a strong executive team on the 
board.

'He is the person whose command of the detail of the NHS, and 
his commitment and his passion to its future, we believe to be 
fundamental to the success of the board.'

The chairman said his 
statement was a 'statement of strength' and added: 'We look, David, to 
you to provide us with the leadership as we take through an 
exceptionally challenging set of changes.'

Robin Bastin, of the campaign group Cure the NHS, was one of those who walked out of the meeting.

Speaking
afterwards, he said: 'It's outrageous for him (Sir David) to say he 
needed to go on running this when he has been responsible for all that 
has happened.

'He was in charge of the strategic health authority when all this was going on. I'm disgusted.'

The NHS trust at the centre of the Stafford Hospital scandal could become the first foundation trust in the country to be put into administration, it emerged today.

Regulator Monitor said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients

Last year, South London Healthcare 
NHS Trust (SLHT) became the first ever NHS trust to be put into 
administration after it started losing around £1.3 million a week.

But now Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust  could be the first foundation trust - a supposed marker of 
excellence in the health service - to face the same fate.

Monitor, the watchdog which regulates foundation trusts, said it was consulting the Health Secretary and key organisations about the prospective appointment of trust special administrators.

An independent review into the trust, conducted on behalf of Monitor, concluded that the organisation was neither clinically nor financially sustainable in its current form.

Monitor said that if administrators are appointed, they will devise a plan for the reorganisation and delivery of services. A spokesman said the plan would be subject to public consultation.

David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said: 'We are now consulting on whether to appoint trust special administrators with the expertise to reorganise services in a way which is clinically robust and sustainable.

'Their priority will be to make sure that patients can continue to access the services that they need and they will work with the local community to do this.

'Taking into account the consultation process, it would be several weeks before trust special administrators were in place. In the meantime, the trust board will continue to ensure the current range of services are delivered for patients and trust special administrators would then continue that responsibility.'

Yesterday it was revealed that death rates at another hospital are being investigated following the discovery that an 'unusually high number' of deaths were 'coded' as due to septicaemia.

Bolton NHS Foundation Trust’s acting chief executive, Dr Jackie Bene, has stepped aside pending the inquiry.

Septicaemia, a severe infection which enters the bloodstream, is coded, or tagged, in a different way from other illnesses and infections, which means deaths caused by septicaemia do not affect hospital mortality figures.

In the wake of the findings, NHS 
medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh called on all hospitals to 
'behave openly and honestly about their performance' and said they would
be 'monitoring the situation'.

According
to a report in the Bolton News, the trust recorded 800 cases of 
septicaemia between March 2011 and April 2012 - a similar sized trust 
would expect to have just 200.

Dr Bene, as former medical director, was in charge of recording the information.

The independent watchdog which is auditing the data is understood to be investigating 200 cases, the Bolton News reported.

Its interim findings for 50 of the cases show 'cause for concern'.

In a statement, the trust said: 'While this work is taking place, Dr Jackie Bene, who as a trust consultant and medical director oversaw coding, has agreed to step aside as acting chief executive, to allow a fully independent view to be taken.

'We do not believe that there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients, but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes.'
