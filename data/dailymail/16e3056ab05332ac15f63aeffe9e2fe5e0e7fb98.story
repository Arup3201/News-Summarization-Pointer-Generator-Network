This takes the cockney rhyming slang 'dog and bone' to a whole new level.

A new gadget helps facilitate video calls between pooches and their overanxious owners.

The iCPooch unit, priced at $150, has an  adjustable mount where a computer tablet can be placed at animal eye level.

An accompanying app then allows a human user to dial into the device remotely and have a 'chat' with their pet at home.

Brian Stump from Hoboken, New Jersey, says he loves the piece of kit.

He used to hate leaving his rescue puppy Walter alone at their apartment when he went to work.

'The point of having a dog is to interact with him and spend time with him, when you spend eight hours a day away from him, it just helps to bridge that gap,' he said.

The iCPooch even allows users to dispense a treat for their dog.

When the 'drop cookie' button is pressed on the app button a message is sent to the stationary unit at home and a biscuit is unleashed.

Mr Stump says he loves seeing how Walter reacts to the gizmo when he drops him a line. 

'He hears you, he sees your face, I think the big part of the confusion for him is he can't smell you.'

iCPooch was the brainchild of 15-year-old Brooke Martin from Spokane, Washington.

The teenager built it with her father's help and recently showed it off at the Purina Better With Pets Summit in New York.

So far she's sold hundreds online and she hopes her product for pooches will be available in stores before the holidays.

As well as selling the device, iCPooch also sells its own dog treats.

According to the company, an estimated 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety, as well as many pet owners.
