Writer Simon Kernick was taken ill with stomach pains which resulted in his appendix 'exploding'

Thriller
 writer Simon Kernick prided himself on being fit and healthy, so when 
he developed stomach ache after eating cherries earlier this summer, he 
assumed he'd just over-indulged.

Yet rather than getting any better, over the next day the pain intensified.

'It
 was all over my stomach,' recalls Simon, 48, a divorced father-of-two 
from Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. 'I do a lot of Thai cookery so I 
thought the king prawns I'd had earlier that day might be to blame. 
Google just scared me as it suggested bowel cancer, Crohn's disease, 
irritable bowel syndrome or appendicitis.

'I ruled out appendicitis 
as my brother Nick had appendicitis when he was six, and I knew his scar
 was low down on the right side of his stomach. My pain was from under 
my ribcage to below my navel.'

In fact, he did have appendicitis - 
and within five days of the first symptoms,  his appendix had burst and 
he was undergoing emergency surgery.

But in the meantime, oblivious 
to this, he took some paracetamol. That night he slept fitfully and the 
next day, he went to his GP. She felt the lower right part of his 
abdomen to check for appendicitis. Yet because Simon didn't feel any 
discomfort there, she concluded he had a stomach virus and prescribed 
painkillers.

Although the pain had gone by the next day, Simon still
 felt unwell. 'I'd no energy at all, but assumed my strength was going 
into fighting my stomach bug. I can walk 25 miles - I enjoy the odd long
 trek - but that day I couldn't walk 25 yards,' he says.

By day five,
 the pain had returned, this time on the right side of his abdomen, and 
was so intense Simon was  bent double. 'I couldn't sleep on my right 
side, and when I got up that morning, I was on my knees in unbearable 
pain. I rang my dad, John, who lives nearby, to take me to the hospital 
seven miles away. Just getting into his car had me screaming in pain. 
When we arrived at the hospital I staggered in, holding on to the wall 
for support.'

An immediate scan revealed the cause of Simon's pain. 
'One side of my appendix had literally been blown away because of the 
extent of the infection,' he says. 'A doctor said my insides were like a
 war zone. My appendix was behind my large bowel, which is why I didn't 
feel any tenderness when my GP examined me initially.'

Appendicitis 
is common - around 7 per cent of people will experience it, typically 
between the ages of ten to 20, although why it should be more common at 
this age is not clear. But older people can develop it, too.

The 
appendix - a narrow, finger-like pouch between 5cm and 10cm long - is 
attached to the beginning of the large intestine on the right side of 
the abdomen. But because of its length, the tip can lie in different 
positions, in the pelvis, in front of the bowel or, as Simon's was, 
behind the bowel.

He underwent keyhole surgery to remove the infection

So although people often think severe stomach ache
 can only be appendicitis if it's on the right side of the abdomen, most
 patients, like Simon, find the pain starts in the centre. And some 
people won't have stomach ache at all.

'A young child with 
appendicitis may have no pain, but might have a fever or be short of 
breath and looking poorly,' explains Neil Pearce, a general surgery 
consultant at Southampton General Hospital.Children under five are 
often much more difficult to diagnose because of their limited 
communication skills, adds Colin Elton, a colorectal and laparoscopic 
surgeon at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Spire Bushey 
Hospital in Watford, Hertfordshire.

'A lot of appendicitis cases in 
children are misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis or a virus,' says Mr Elton.
 'Adults with appendicitis may have one or more other  symptoms, such as
 nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and a high temperature.

'As
 symptoms can vary it can easily be confused with other conditions. In 
up to 30 per cent of cases involving women, the diagnosis is wrong and a
 normal appendix may be removed, when in fact the pain has been caused 
by ovarian cysts, a pelvic infection or a urine infection.'

Appendicitis
 begins as a result of a blockage at its entrance most commonly caused 
by a hard piece of stool (a faecolith), which can be between 5mm and 
10mm. With children or adolescents, it can occur a week or so after a 
viral infection.

As Mr Elton explains: 'This is because the appendix
 is a lymphoid organ - a structure that drains infection from other 
parts of the body. The lymph follicles in the appendix can swell up so 
much during a virus infection that they block it.'

Once the appendix 
is blocked, bacteria inside it start multiplying and it becomes 
inflamed. As well as pain this can lead to the other symptoms, including
 diarrhoea and a high temperature.

The best treatment for 
appendicitis is to remove the appendix, suggests Mr Elton. 'Sometimes 
people are given antibiotics if their pain settles down, but 20 per cent
 of these will have a recurrence of the symptoms.'

An appendicectomy -
 removal of the appendix - is the most common emergency abdominal 
surgery in the UK. Most are carried out by keyhole surgery.

Yet if 
diagnosis is delayed, the appendix can continue to swell, and in a fifth
 of cases goes on to burst, releasing bacteria, which can spread to the 
peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the 
abdomen, causing inflammation, or peritonitis. This is potentially 
fatal, as the infection can then spread to major organs, causing organ 
failure.

'We never know how long we have from the start of 
appendicitis to the appendix bursting - in some cases the pressure 
builds up quickly, within a few hours, but in other cases a patient can 
have appendicitis for several days,' explains Mr Elton.

The problem is that if there is  no pain or if it comes and goes, diagnosis can be delayed.

'The
 pain might settle down  and the patient will think they're getting 
better,' says Mr Elton, 'but what's happening is the omentum, a large 
apron of fat that acts as the guardian of the abdomen, wraps itself 
around the appendix as the body tries to protect itself from infection.'

They used about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away

Appendicitis
 can be diagnosed with blood tests. 'The white cell count may increase 
with infection,' says Mr Elton. 'We can also use an ultrasound 
examination or a CT scan to look at the appendix.'

The diagnosis is 
usually confirmed in hospital as GPs surgeries, adds Mr Elton, 'don't 
have all the equipment in their surgeries that we have in hospital. We 
usually have a diagnosis within 24 hours in hospital'.

A laparoscopy -
 where a tiny camera is inserted through a small incision near the navel
 to get a look at the appendix - can be carried out under general 
anaesthetic. If appendicitis is confirmed, an appendicectomy is carried 
out at the same time.

Simon Kernick's burst appendix was picked up 
just in time. He underwent three-and-a-half hours of keyhole surgery 
after arriving at A&E. 'When I came round they said they'd used 
about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away,' he says.

His
 mother, Pauline, father, and daughters, Amy, 15, and, Rachel, 11, were 
waiting for him on his ward. 'My mum used to be a nurse and after I was 
discharged from hospital she told me the first death she'd dealt with 
was caused by a burst appendix - it had worried her while I was in 
hospital.'

But even after his surgery, Simon was not out of the woods
 - two days later, while he was still in hospital, his temperature 
started to climb. A scan revealed he'd developed an abscess in his 
pelvis.

These are more common in people who have had a burst appendix
 and can appear up to five days after surgery, says Mr Elton, and 
patients who've already been discharged can find themselves being 
readmitted urgently for this reason. Symptoms include stomach pain, 
flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea.

A pelvic abscess is usually drained 
by radiologists guided by ultrasound. Simon stayed in hospital for six 
days, and left with antibiotics. He had lost five kilos (nearly 8lb) in 
that time.

However, seven weeks on, his appetite has returned and he
 is as active as ever. 'I am running again, weight lifting and my 
stamina feels as good as ever it was,' he says.

'I don't blame my GP for not diagnosing appendicitis. The experience has made me realise how lucky I am.'
