A woman who had twins with a long-time friend is locked in a complicated custody battle after he told her he was gay, had only used her as a surrogate and was keeping the children with his partner.

Cindy Close, 48, met businessman Marvin McMurrey in Houston, Texas in 2005 and, as they were both in their 40s, not married and without families, they decided to have children together.

'I've always wanted to be a mom,' Close told Fox. 'That's my biggest dream and it always has been. He came across as a very kind man, a very good man, and I trusted him.'

The pair, who had planned to co-parent the children, decided to use in-vitro fertilization with anonymous donor eggs for the pregnancy. McMurrey paid for the procedure, the lawsuit claims.

When she found out earlier this year that, after two rounds of IVF, she was pregnant with twins, 'I was absolutely thrilled,' Close said. 'I always wanted twins.'

But feelings of joy were quickly replaced with betrayal when she gave birth to a boy and a girl in July - and McMurrey told her he was taking the children.

'The social worker came to me and said we 
had a surrogate situation,' she said. '[The worker] claimed I was a surrogate for him and his
domestic partner that I didn't even know he had.'

He became so enraged when he saw Close breastfeeding the children in hospital, he took out a restraining order against her, she said.

Battle: Close said that even though she used donor eggs to get pregnant there was never a surrogate contract

Cindy Close's case is complicated as a doctor advised her to use donor eggs due to her age, so she is not the children's biological mother.

Marvin McMarrey claims she was a surrogate, but typically, a contract must be agreed and the mother and father are spelled out if this is the case.

However, attorneys said Texas law does not exclude other arrangements for surrogates, which is an issue the courts may take up here.

In normal surrogate cases, the intended mother's eggs are used inside a different woman. Even though the intended mother does not carry the children, she is legally the 'mother' due to an agreement. In this case, an anonymous donor was used and the child would have no legal mother, as is required.

An issue that could also work 
against McMurrey, who wants to bring up the children with his gay partner, is that the intended parents have to be married for a
surrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.

Traditional surrogacy - where parents use a surrogate woman's eggs and body to carry a child - is not recognised in Texas.

McMurrey filed a lawsuit against 
Close in August, demanding he be named as the father as she was simply a
surrogate and had no rights.

He has temporary custody of the children, and they are now living with McMurrey's partner, Phong Nguyen - even though the father does not live there.

Close said she is only allowed to see 
her children for two hours a day on Monday to Friday, and claims the 
couple has placed cameras in the room to watch her as she holds her 
babies.

'I only ever wanted to be a mom and... after giving me my dream, he's taking that away,' she said, breaking down in tears.

The courts will now determine what rights Close has as she struggles to define in legal terms what it means to be a mother.

'We've alleged he duped Cindy into have 
her children on the basis on him attempting to have her declared a 
surrogate once they were born,' her attorney, Grady Reiff, said.

He
explained that, in Texas, the mother does not need to prove she is the 
parent but McMurrey must prove Close was a surrogate. They never signed a
contract or agreement, he said.

'This was not a surrogacy, so it never 
occurred to me that I would ever need a written agreement,' Close told the Houston Chronicle. 'If anything, I thought he would lose 
interest because I didn't expect him to be a very involved father.'

Reiff
added: 'It's our position that a woman who gives
birth is the mother, unless there is a [surrogate] agreement.' If 
McMurrey had his way, the children would have no legal 'mother'.

Taking a stand: Attorney Grady Reiff said Cindy was duped and McMurrey must prove she was a surrogate

In surrogate cases, the intended 
mother's eggs are used and, while she does not carry the child, she is 
the 'mother' because of the agreement.

In Texas, it's not the mother's burden to prove she is the parent, Reiff, said, so the onus is now on McMurrey to prove Close was a surrogate.

Another issue that could work 
against McMurrey is that the intended parents have to be married for a
surrogacy to be a valid contract in Texas. Same-sex marriage is not recognised by the state.

'The father is arguing a very technical 
legal position,' Jim Paulsen, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said. 'But it's one of those cases that you 
hope the judge will be able to look at more than just preliminary 
technical matters.'

McMurrey's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, did not comment on the case. He and Close will appear in court on Monday.
