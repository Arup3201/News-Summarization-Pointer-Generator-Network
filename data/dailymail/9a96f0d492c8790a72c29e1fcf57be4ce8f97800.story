A Broncos star and his pregnant country singer wife have posed for a photo spread in GQ showing off the latest jean trends and her baby bump.

Jessie James is seven months pregnant with her first child and she posed alongside husband Eric Decker in the photo shoot for the men’s magazine.

The couple are accustomed to working together as they starred in their own reality show about their romance and wedding last year.

Baby on the way: Jessie James and her husband Eric Decker are expecting a daughter in March and he posed for a photo spread in GQ which had him modeling the fall trends for jeans

Dressed for different occasions: The football player and country singer did not sport their regular uniforms in the spread

The first season of the show, Eric and
 Jessie: Game On, ended on November 3 when the football season started 
back up and it has been a busy few months for the pair.

Decker, 26, has become one of 
the breakout stars of the Denver Broncos with career highs for both the 
number of receptions he made and the number of receiving yards.

The team is headed into the playoffs for the Superbowl this weekend as they match up against the Patriots on Sunday.

He said that his teammates have been supportive of the reality show, which airs on E.

Sharing with the world: Both Decker and James are very active on social media and regularly interact with their thousands of followers

On display: The couple described their show as being light on the drama and more like a 'romantic comedy'

Dream home: The first season of the show depicted the engaged couple's road to the alter and getting settled down in Denver before ending the season on a high note with their wedding

'You'd be surprised. A lot of guys wanted to try and get on the show after the first couple of episodes,' he said.

James announced her pregnancy via Twitter in September and later revealed they were having a daughter due in March.

She has been frequently updating her more than 264,000 followers with news about her pregnancy, posting photos from her baby shower in December and telling how morning sickness was difficult to deal with.

Staying in the spotlight: Their reality show has been renewed for a second season which will air this year

Incorporating her music: James used the video of her wedding in the music video for the song 'I do' which she wrote for the occasion

In the brief interview that runs alongside the shots of Decker modelling the fall fashion trends- and James showing her pregnancy bump in short shorts and cropped tops- he said that she was the more fearless one in terms of their career. 

The photos were shot by photographer Ben Watts, who is the Academy Award actress Naomi's brother.

'It’s hard to replace the rush you get with football, the noise and the stadium and all that,' he told the magazine.

'But for Jessie, people are right there in front of you, no helmet on, nothing, and nobody to take their eyes off of you.'

The couple that works out together: James shared this snap of them in a gym months before her pregnancy

Valuable asset: Decker had two career highs this year and the Broncos are headed to a playoff game this weekend to determine whether or not they will head to the Superbowl
