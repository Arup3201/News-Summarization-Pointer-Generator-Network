Cosmetics tycoon Leonard Lauder has donated his $1billion collection of Cubist art to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The Chairman Emeritus of the Estee Lauder company has pledged 78 works including pieces from Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris - said to be one of the world's foremost collections of Cubist art.

Along with the donation, described by museum director Thomas Campbell as 'truly inspirational', Mr Lauder has also contributed funds to a $22million research centre for modern art which will bear his name.

The collection, which will go on display at the museum in 2014, includes 33 works by Pablo Picasso, 17 by Georges Braque, and 14 each from Juan Gris and Fernand Léger.

Some of its most esteemed pieces include Picasso's The Scallop Shell from 1912, Eva's Woman in an Armchair from 1913 and Braque's Trees at L'Estaque from 1908.

Mr Campbell, director of the museum, said: 'Leonard's gift is truly transformational for the Metropolitan Museum.

'Although the Met is unique in its ability to exhibit over 5,000 years of art history, we have long lacked this critical dimension in the story of modernism.

'Now, Cubism will be represented with some of its greatest masterpieces, demonstrating both its role as the groundbreaking movement of the 20th century and the foundation for an artistic dialogue that continues today.

'This is an extraordinary gift to our Museum and our City.'

Mr Lauder said of his donation in a statement: 'This is a gift to the people who live and work in New York and those from around the world who come to visit our great arts institutions.

'The arts are a cornerstone of the cultural, educational, and economic vitality of the City.

'I selected the Met as the way to share this collection because I feel that it’s essential that Cubism—and the art that follows it, for that matter— be seen and studied within the collections of one of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world.

'The Met’s collection of modernism, together with those of MoMA, the Guggenheim, and the Whitney, reinforce the City’s standing as the center for 20th century art and fuel New York’s ongoing role as the art capital of the world.'

Mr Lauder, who is worth an estimated $7.9billion, began his collection in 1976 and made his most recent purchase - a Juan Gris collage - only last month.

He has pledged to continue to add to the museum's collection by buying additional works.

Influential: Pablo Picasso is pictured in the 1960s

Cubism was the most influential art movement of the 20th century: it radically destroyed traditional illusionism in painting, revolutionized the way we see the world (as Juan Gris said), and paved the way for the pure abstraction that dominated Western art for the next 50 years.

Led by Picasso and Braque, the Cubists dismantled traditional perspective and modeling in the round in order to emphasize the two-dimensional picture plane.

Cubist collage introduced fragments of mass-produced popular culture into pictures, thereby changing the very definition of art.

More than half of the Lauder Collection focuses on the six-year period, 1909-14, during which Braque and Picasso - the two founders of the Cubist movement - closely collaborated. 

Their partnership began in earnest in the fall of 1908, when the visionary dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler exhibited Braque’s most recent paintings in his Paris gallery. 

Henri Matisse is known to have disparaged Braque’s pictures as 'painting made of small cubes' and the term Cubism first appeared in print in Louis Vauxcelles’s review of the Kahnweiler exhibition.

The Lauder Collection includes two landscapes from this historic show: Terrace at the Hotel Mistral, l’Estaque (1907), which marks Braque’s transition from Fauvism to Cubism, and the iconic Trees at L’Estaque (1908), which inaugurates Cubism.

By 1909, Braque and Picasso were inseparable.

As Picasso later recounted: 'Almost every evening, either I went to Braque’s studio or he came to mine.

Famous: Pablo Picasso's Still Life with a Cake

'Each of us HAD to see what the other had done during the day.

'We criticized each other’s work. A canvas wasn’t finished until both of us felt it was.'

A pair of identically sized paintings from 1911 the Lauder Collection - Braque’s Bottle and Clarinet and Picasso’s Pedestal Table with Wine Glasses, Cup, and Mandolin - exemplify a pivotal moment in the history of Cubism when the two artists began to picture objects from different points of view in an increasingly shallow space. 

Only a few clues were retained to help viewers decode the picture, the profile of an instrument or the tassel of a curtain. 

As the works hovered on the brink of illegibility, Braque and Picasso began to introduce 'certainties', as Braque called them: painted letters and words and, soon after, actual pieces of rope, newspaper, sheet music, and brand labels.  

They inspired other artists to incorporate all kinds of unorthodox materials into works of art.
