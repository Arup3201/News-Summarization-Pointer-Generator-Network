Dr Ikram Malik, 75, died after his trouser leg became caught in a passing car as he crossed the road in Nelson, Lancashire

A family doctor who was honoured by the Queen fell to his death in a freak road accident after his trouser leg became entangled in the wheel of a passing car.

GP Dr Ikram Malik, 75, was crossing the road to attend prayers at his local mosque when his clothing became caught under the front passenger wheel of a passing Vauxhall Astra.

Dr Malik shouted to the driver to stop - banging his hands on the side of the car - but he fell backwards, hitting his head on the kerb, and died in hospital five days later.

Details of the tragedy emerged at an inquest into Dr Malik’s death where his family criticised police for their investigation.

The GP, who received an MBE in 1999 for his voluntary work, was still practising and in 2009 had received an award from then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith for being one of the 'unsung heroes' of the Muslim community in Britain.

His wife, Raisa, who was also a doctor had just retired, and two of their three children were also GPs, the inquest heard.

The tragedy occurred in September last year after Dr Malik, who moved to Britain from his native Pakistan in the 1960s, began his regular Friday journey to prayers from his surgery in Nelson, Lancashire.

He was on his way to Markazi Jamia Ghousi Mosque when he stepped off the pavement on Pendle Street and became entangled with the Astra which was moving off from the junction at a roundabout.

Driver Caroline Schofield, a school worker, was waiting to move off and told the inquest she had been looking to her right and had not seen Dr Malik on her left.

She told Burnley Coroner's Court: 'I came to a stop at the roundabout. I indicated to turn right and looked to the right, another vehicle indicated to go left.

The inquest heard that Dr Malik was at a roundabout in Nelson, pictured, when the accident happened

'I started to set off. I am confident I hadn’t noticed him. As I set off I saw him, he put his hands on the side of my car where the mirror is, below the wing mirror at the side of the car. He shouted "Stop".

'He seemed to lose his balance, he seemed to fall and stumble to the ground, he wasn’t at the front of the car

'He was off the footpath, he must have been standing in the road.

'I just stopped, I had just moved slightly. He seemed to lose his balance, he stumbled and he fell to the floor. It happened so quickly.'

She added: 'I didn’t look to my left. You give way to the right. It was a roundabout - you don’t expect pedestrians to step off a pavement on a roundabout. It wasn’t a pelican crossing.'

She added that her wheels must only have 'turned twice', and that after the collision she got out of her car and saw Dr Malik.

Another witness Leonard Tolliday said: 'He stepped off the kerb in front of the lady in the car. The traffic was clear and she moved gradually forward.

'He put out his arms onto the bonnet and fell back and his head hit the road. It was horrendous. I could see his trouser leg was trapped under the car.'

Police later said Mrs Schofield was not to blame for the tragedy.

But Dr Malik’s daughter Shazia, who is also a doctor, criticised the way the investigation was carried out after she discovered it had taken four weeks for the driver of the Astra to be interviewed.

She said: 'The investigation process I feel has been inconsistent, incomplete and inadequate. It just makes me feel that the evidence available could have been better.

Despite his advanced years, Dr Malik was still working as a family GP at this surgery in Nelson, Lancashire

Dr Malik's wife Raisa, left with relative, was a doctor, as are two of their three children, the inquest heard

'I was always on the back foot looking for witnesses because the key is getting them at the time. I’m just so upset.'

East Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor returned an accidental death verdict and said: 'I believe Dr Malik felt that he had sufficient time to cross that road.

'The contact between Mrs Schofield’s vehicle and Dr Malik is accepted as being slight, the car stopped almost immediately and somehow Dr Malik’s trouser leg was caught underneath the car.

'It is very difficult to say exactly how that happened but as a result he was unable to move out of the way with any degree of safety, and as a result of that he clearly overbalanced causing his fatal injury.'

Dr Malik was chairman of a number of a number of local community groups and a former vice-chairman of the National Association of the Racial Equality Council’s North West region.

After the case Dr Malik’s son Dr Shahzad Malik said: 'His death was not only a tragic loss for the family but the Pakistani community.

'We bear no vengeance towards the lady involved.'

'At his funeral there was a quiet dignity which is how he led his life and which I hope we composed ourself the same today. We tried to compose ourselves in a way that he would have himself, with the same quiet dignity as my father would have wanted.

'It is not to say that the wounds are not still very very fresh.'
