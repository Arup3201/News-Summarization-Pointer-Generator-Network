Martin Murray earned himself a shot at world champion Gennady Golovkin after his fight with Domenico Spada was stopped on a cut in the seventh round.

The St Helens middleweight battled his way past the dogged Italian in front of a sizeable travelling support in Monte Carlo.

And he will return to the principality on February 21 to face the hard-hitting and unbeaten Kazakh.

It will be Murray's third world title shot and the reward for three victories this year under his promoter Golden Gloves.

The South Africa-based outfit have played a vital role in re-energising the 32-year-old's career after a period of stagnation.

Murray's previous tilts at a world title saw him draw with Felix Sturm in 2011 before losing narrowly to Sergio Martinez in Argentina last year.

His third challenge will be even more formidable as Golovkin, who holds the IBO and WBA 'Super' belts looks for his 19th consecutive stoppage.

The 32-year-old, who now lives in California, was taken seven rounds by Osumanu Adama on his last visit to Monaco earlier this year.

And he was ringside at the Salles des etoiles to see his next challenge survive an early scare before the fight was stopped.

All three judges had Murray ahead at the time by scores of 67-66, 68-63 and 69-67.

Spada made a bright start, landing several clean shots to the body in his opening round.

The Italian took Murray's fellow Brit Darren Barker the distance in a European title fight three years ago and his rugged and awkward style reared it's head again from the second round.

But it was Murray who was deducted a point in the third after a clash of heads left Spada cut above his right eye. It was that cut which would later curtail the fight prematurely.

By the end of the fourth session, however, all three judges had Murray one round up, as revealed by the WBC's open scoring.

And certainly, the Brit was beginning to time his shots and avoid being dragged into a dog fight.

Golovkin, meanwhile, looked on unperturbed, his boyish grin suggesting he wouldn't lose sleep over his next assignment.

By the halfway stage, Murray was finding a home for his hooks which stopped the marauding Spada in his tracks.

In the seventh, the referee called on the ringside doctor to examine the challenger's cut for a second time before he waved the fight off.

Spada was visibly upset at the decision while Murray must now focus on the toughest challenge of his career.
