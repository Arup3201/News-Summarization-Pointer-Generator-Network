Nasri can expose Alves

‘He was thinking about his next Instagram pose’ was how one Catalan match report described Dani Alves’ error that led to Malaga’s winner on Saturday. 

The Brazilian has been accused of letting the showbusiness replace the real business on the pitch during recent seasons. Samir Nasri will lead the charge down City’s left. 

He does not have the raw speed of Jesus Navas, who will zoom down the right, but the Frenchman has more than enough in his locker to take advantage of any lapses Alves may have.

Aguero can leave Mascherano trailing

Coach Luis Enrique saw enough during the World Cup to be reminded of just how good a midfielder Mascherano is. 

But needs must at Barcelona and with Thomas Vermaelen still injured, the Argentine still finds himself at centre-back. His aerial limitations are obvious, while he can be too cavalier in his tackling.

Sergio Aguero will know his compatriot’s game inside out and the worry for Barcelona is that Aguero has just started to find his rhythm; he has the appetite to do to Barcelona what he did to Bayern Munich in November.

Iniesta is off the boil

For a player of his enormous talent, Iniesta doesn’t score enough. And a startling statistic is that he has no goals or assists in La Liga so far this campaign. 

With Xavi in decline he needed to take control of Barcelona’s midfield. So far he hasn’t. City, however, will be wary. 

Iniesta provided the glorious pass that led to the penalty in the corresponding game next season. With Yaya Toure unavailable, Fernando and Fernandinho will have to keep their wits about them.

The keeper is rusty

Barca’s German keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was signed by Barcelona’s Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta to replace Victor Valdes. He is excellent with his feet, great at making one on one saves and commands his area well, but there is a problem: Stegen only plays cup games because Enrique favours Chilean Claudio Bravo. He could be undercooked.

Should David Silva get on the ball frequently, City could have plenty of opportunities to test how rusty Stegen is.

Pellegrini can win the tactical battle

Luis Enrique is condemned to be forever compared unfavourably with Pep Guardiola. They both played for Barcelona and both coached the youth side before the first team. 

For many, the similarities stop there. Guardiola’s ability to change games mid-match does not seem to be a quality Enrique possesses. 

After going 1-0 down against Malaga he made three changes but the substitutions seemed to confuse Barcelona more than their opponents. City will hope to exploit this.
