Good Samaritan: Lauren Mohr, 34, died early Thursday after stopping to help car-crash victims on I-91 in New Haven, Connecticut

A kind-hearted waitress who stopped to help people involved in a car accident in Connecticut was killed after after falling off a highway bridge.

State police say 34-year-old Lauren Mohr, of Wallingford, had just finished a shift at Barcelona Restaurant in New Haven at around 12.30am when she witnessed a hit-and-run crash on nortbound Interstate 91 and pulled over to help the victims. 

She was waiting for police to arrive on the scene when she allegedly jumped over a concrete wall in an attempt to evade an oncoming car and fell 40 feet from an overpass bridge to her death. 

She was rushed to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.  

A Quinnipiac University spokesman said Mohr was a temporary admissions aide at that school, where her stepmother, Joan Mohr, was the vice president of admissions. 

'Lauren was courageous and optimistic, and had faced a lot of challenges in her life, which made her a caring and wise person. Friends and family would seek her advice and she will be remembered as our hero,' Lauren's father Lawrence Mohr, said in a statement issued by the university.

One of Mohr's co-workers at Barcelona said he wasn't at all surprised that she would have pulled over to help the crash victims.

'She was just a kind soul and that's just the way she lived her life,' Bart Maldonado told WFSB. 'That's just the way she was.'

Before working at Quinnipiac and Barcelona, Mohr served for four years in the US Air Force and was trained as a medical technician. She was also an organ donor. 

She recently received her associate's degree in social work and planned to continue her studies in the field next fall at Southern Connecticut State University.

None of the five people in the two cars involved in the accident was injured. One of the drivers,

Elvin Ayala, 33, has been identified as the driver of the 2005 Infiniti G35 that plowed into the back of Elizabeth Kranz's Mercedes-Benz on I-91 and then fled the scene, reported NBC Connecticut. 

The driver later turned himself in to police and was charged with operating a vehicle with a suspended license and following too closely. Police said he will not be charged in connection with Mohr’s death. 

Selfless: Mohr, an Air Force veteran and trained medical technician, was remembered by family and friends as a kind-hearted woman who was studying to become a social worker

Lynn Bushnell, vice president for public affairs at Quinnipiac University, said the college community was saddened to learn of Mohr's death.

'The university would like to extend its sincerest condolences to the Mohr family and ask that you continue to keep Lauren's family and her many friends in your thoughts and prayers,' she said.

The 34-year-old woman leaves behind her husband, Nate, her parents and stepmother, sister Arwen, as well as her beloved cat, Becky.
