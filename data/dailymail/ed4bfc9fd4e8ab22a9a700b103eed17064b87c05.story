A British D-Day veteran who was personally invited to a World War Two film set by actor Brad Pitt was forced to look him up online because he had no idea who the Hollywood star was.

The superstar, worth more than £100 million, met with 90-year-old Peter Comfort to talk about his latest film Fury but the WWII veteran admitted he had to use the internet to find out who Pitt was.

The famous actor had invited Mr Comfort to the set of the new blockbuster in Hertfordshire to hear a first-hand account of life inside an amphibious Sherman tank.

Who are you? WWII veteran had to use Google to work out who Brad Pitt (pictured together) was before meeting him on the set of the Hollywood actor's new movie about WWII Sherman tanks

Mr Comfort went to meet him and left the film crew laughing when he admitted he had to check out who Pitt was on the internet first.

He said: ‘Mr Pitt was very friendly and charming actually but I didn't know who he was.

‘I said to him “Until last night I didn't have a clue who you were and then I googled you and you've been in quite a lot of films”.’

‘They all rolled about laughing when I said that.

‘I don't do modern films. I am a fan of actors like Alec Guinness, but of course he is dead now.’

Mr Comfort, the last Second World War survivor of the 13/18th Royal Hussars, was assigned to the Sherman tanks at just 21-years-old.

He landed at Sword beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944 with the tanks going into the water 500 yards from the shore, something the Germans had not seen before. 

By the end of that day 140 of his colleagues were killed and 350 more were wounded.

In the new wartime thriller, the Ocean’s Eleven star plays the commander of a DD Sherman tank.

Mr Comfort, from Ripple, near Dover, Kent, said: ‘My regiment, the Light Dragoons, got in contact with me about three weeks ago.

'I don't do modern films': Mr Comfort was not familiar with the movies starring Brad Pitt (left) but said he was a fan of actors such as Alec Guinness (right) but 'of course he is dead now'

‘They'd been approached by an ex-officer who worked for a film company and asked if there were any old boys left.

‘Then Brad Pitt phoned me and said he wanted to speak about Sherman tanks for a film.

‘He talked me into going and, I have to say, I was extremely well treated.

‘They wanted a lot of information to make it accurate and fired a lot of questions at me.

‘Luckily there weren't any questions I didn't know the answer to.

‘The film crew got me up on the tank for a few pictures and wanted to know everything about it.

‘They wanted to know where we slept, where we spent a penny, the living conditions and what it was like in action, so I told them.

‘I don't like to talk about it because I saw too many people killed but Mr Pitt was very nice and I will be interested to see the film.’

A grandfather-of-six, Mr Comfort has now been invited to the British premiere of Fury which will probably be in November next year.
