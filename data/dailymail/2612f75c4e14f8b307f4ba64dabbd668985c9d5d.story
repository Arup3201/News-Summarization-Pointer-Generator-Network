Even the most ardent fan of Blackpool will concede the seaside town has little in common with Dallas. Any tans you might spot on England’s North-West coast tend to come from bottles rather than hours spent in the golden Texan sunshine.

And the only cowboys you’ll find on the golden mile are builders.

But soon that could all change. In an extraordinary announcement, gas prospectors have revealed that the Fylde Coast of Lancashire is poised to become the centre of one of the biggest gas drilling operations in Europe.

Towering prospect: Blackpool could turn into Texas-by-the-sea

Rich: Dallas grew into a hugely prosperous city thanks to the nearby oil reserves

UK energy consortium Cuadrilla Resources has discovered that Lancashire is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘shale gas’ in Europe.

According to results from its test wells, there are 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground, trapped in a layer of compacted mud.

If the gas can be recovered, it could provide Britain with enough fuel to last 50 years, plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced North Sea gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs.

And it could turn Blackpool from the leisure capital of the North, to the centre of England’s oil and gas industry — a Texas-by-the-sea.

Two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas. It is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the North Sea. It’s one-fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world, and the volume of 66,666 Royal Albert Halls.

The prospect of 400 gas wells across Lancashire and thousands of new jobs — not to mention all those tax revenues — couldn’t have come at a better time for the Chancellor. But there is one problem: in gas and oil exploration, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

Protesters who gathered in Blackpool yesterday say shale gas extraction in Britain is untested, expensive and dangerous.

The gas has to be exploded out of the shale rocks using a technique called ‘fracking’, which can trigger earthquakes and contaminate water supplies with toxic chemicals.

In America, opponents have even claimed that methane escapes into nearby water sources and can emerge from bathroom taps.

Commercial fracking is new to Britain, but the shale gas it releases has been known about for more than a century.

In 1875, geologists sank a borehole in the Weald of West Sussex to investigate shale — a fine-grained rock made of compacted mud. During the experiment, a naked light was lowered into the hole which exploded dramatically.

Serious research into exploiting shale gas got under way in the U.S. after World War II. By the 1990s, drilling technology had evolved to tap into the vast amounts of fuel locked away deep in the ground.

Although shale reserves beneath the land are much easier to access than North Sea fields far offshore, the gas is harder to extract.

North Sea gas forms mostly within sandstone. Once a drill has reached the sandstone, the gas flows up and out into the world.

Shale gas is more obstinate, and stays locked away in the dense rock. Engineers must first drill straight down through thousands of feet of earth to reach the relatively shallow layer of shale, and then turn their drills sideways to bore horizontally.

Vast amounts of water, sand and chemicals are then pumped into the hole under pressure — a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Under this huge strain, fissures appear in the rock, allowing the gas locked up in the shale to escape along the bore and up the well to the surface.

Until this week, the British Geological Survey had estimated that the shale under the North-West of England stored five trilllion cubic feet of gas. But the figure announced is beyond their wildest predictions.

If Cuadrilla is right, it marks the start of a new age of gas production for Britain — and a lifeline for the economy.

Within five years, some of the UK’s biggest coal-fired power stations will have been shut down under European pollution regulations, while by 2023 all our nuclear plants — apart from Sizewell B in Suffolk — will have been mothballed. Some of the resulting energy deficit will be met by the thousands of new wind turbines going up in the next eight years. But on a still, cold January day when the turbines are still, new supplies of gas could be invaluable.

A new move towards for gas will be good news for energy security, too. With the North Sea gs fields running dry, the UK will become increasingly reliant on imports from Russia, Algeria and Qatar.

But for all that enthusiasm, many geologists are already questioning Cuadrilla’s figures. Professor Al Fraser, an expert in gas and oil at Imperial College, London, said: ‘I’m sceptical about these numbers and I think they could be out by a factor of 10. There’s a lot of variability in these wells. It’s a classic case of the money going in before the science. We don’t know what makes a good or bad deposit, and we don’t understand the impact of fracking on the environment.’

Certainly, the prospect of exploding areas of rock underneath Lancashire has alarmed critics.

On April 1, a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook the North-West. It originated less than two miles from an experimental shale gas well near Blackpool run by Cuadrilla.

A second tremor occurred on May 27 with a magnitude of 1.5. The epicentre was within 500 yards of the well.

Professor Mike Stephenson, head of energy at British Geological Survey, said: ‘Our work seems to show that there is probably a link between the fracking that went on and  the earthquake.

‘But the quakes were minute in scale — on the edge of human sensitivity. If you pump high-pressure water into rocks that are already naturally stressed by pressure, it will tend to make them move. But it doesn’t mean catastrophic movement.’

The earthquakes may be alarming, but they are unlikely to be dangerous. However, growing concerns over pollution are more real.

During fracking, chemicals such as benzene are added to the water to kill off bacteria that could clog the fissure in the rocks, and to improve the efficiency of the process.

In America, chemicals have already escaped from badly-sealed shale gas wells. In 2008, researchers found benzene in a water well in Wyoming, close to a large gas field.

Sceptics also point to the fact that fracking has already been banned in France, New York and New Jersey, as well as in Quebec and parts of Switzerland.

Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends Of The Earth, says: ‘There are serious environmental and public health concerns over this. Britain has abundant renewable energy resources — the place we need to be putting our focus is wind, wave, solar and tidal.’

A predictable enough response, you may say. But there is no doubt a major shale gas development in England will meet with considerable opposition. That said, if in  the coming months geologists  confirm the claims made for the  size of this reserve, it could indeed prove to be a seismic development  for Britain.
