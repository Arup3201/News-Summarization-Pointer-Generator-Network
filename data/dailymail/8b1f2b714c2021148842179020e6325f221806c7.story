With Halloween just weeks away, parents across the country will be no doubt planning to turn a pumpkin or two into Jack O'Lantern to scare would-be trick-or-treaters.

But anyone wanting to use this particular vegetable for their frightful plans may want to start carving now.

The giant vegetable stands one metre high and weighs more than 1,100lbs.

Ian and Stuart Paton, 51, who grow flowers for a living, have nurtured 
the gigantic vegetable for the past six months in their bid to grow the 
largest one for miles around.

Ian, from Pennington, Hampshire, has been growing pumpkins - which are part of the squash family - for 40 years and currently holds the national record for a 1,300lbs specimen.

The gardener has been hard at work all year to overcome the poor weather conditions in his attempt to retain the winning title at the Jubilee Sailing Trust’s pumpkin festival next month.

He said: 'This year was not very good because of the weather. We got three good pumpkins after planting out six.

'That’s really important. But there are a couple of other good growers around that we need to watch out for.'

'Our secret is just very good feeds and keeping them topped up with a balanced diet of waters and fertilisers.

Ambition: The growers hope to break the world record next year

Toddler Bailey Martin, one, was pictured having fun climbing over the gigantic gourd - which sits at a staggering one metre high - at their nursery near Lymington, Hampshire.

The record for the world's heaviest pumpkin has been shattered twice in the US in the past five days.

On Sunday, organisers at the Topsfield Fair in Rhode Island said Ron Wallace of Greene, Rhode Island, had broken the world record with a pumpkin weighing in at 2,009lbs.

Just a few days earlier, on Thursday last week, a pumpkin grown by Steve Geddes of Boscawen, New Hampshire, weighed in at 1,843.50lbs.

Organisers at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire claimed then that Geddes' gourd had broken the world record.

Despite this year's poor weather, Mr Paton has stated his determination to beat the world record next year.

He added: 'We’re going to put the flowers under a shade and put buckets of ice with the plants to keep them nice and cool.

'Because we grow flowers for a living, we have a bit of an advantage.

'We’re definitely going to go after that world record next year - we want to be remembered in the books.

'It’s a costly hobby, keeping a 650sq foot greenhouse going, but its worth it to see the kids’ faces at the show.'

The brothers will be using a small truck and a forklift to carry the pumpkin, plus its 800lbs and 900lbs neighbours, to the show.

In previous years, pumpkins have been carved into miniature boats with motors and massive jack-o-lanterns.

The pair have said that all money raised will go straight to charity.

Some of the UK's most super-sized vegetables are showcased every year at the UK National Giant Vegetables Championships.

The monster veg can be so gigantic that forklift trucks are used to move them into display.

A new world-record breaking 18.5ft parsnip was one of more than 200 vegetables unveiled at the competition in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet last month.

The
 root vegetable is an eye-popping 36 times bigger than the standard 
parsnip and was lovingly grown by Peter Glazebrook, 68, from Newark, 
Nottinghamshire.

The retired chartered surveyor has previously held the world record for a 8lbs 40oz potato.

He has also been the double Guinness World Record holder for the heaviest parsnip, at 13lb, and the longest beetroot, at 21ft.

The veteran grower's record-busting reputation is rivalled by Joe Atherton, 56, from Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. He snapped up the world record for the longest carrot, which he grew to an enormous 19ft 2inches in 2007.

He also held the world record for the heaviest leek, at 6.6kg, in 2001.
