Accusations: SNP MP Angus MacNeil contacted Scotland Yard after former Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott claimed the practice remained rife

Pressure increased on the Liberal Democrats last night as police confirmed they were reviewing claims party chiefs offered peerages to donors.

Scotland Yard wrote to SNP MP Angus MacNeil to confirm it was ‘considering’ his letter urging police to look at the matter.

He contacted the force after former Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott claimed the practice remained rife.

The letter has been passed to Commander Graham McNulty, who was responsible for the cash-for-honours probe that engulfed Labour eight years ago.

Mr MacNeil, who uncovered the 2006 cash-for-honours inquiry, said: ‘I’m glad these recent revelations are being given the attention they deserve.

‘While the Liberal Democrats concede the House of Lords is outdated and undemocratic they continue to stuff it with cronies.

‘The SNP’s long-standing position is that we believe those making laws should be elected by the people, and therefore we do not nominate members to the House of Lords.’

Lord Oakeshott, a close ally of Vince Cable, quit the Lib Dems last month after calling for Nick Clegg to be replaced as leader.

In his resignation statement he said: ‘My efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected, have failed.’

His comments prompted Mr MacNeil to write to Scotland Yard and urge investigators to return to the thorny issue once again.

Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick replied to say that the letter has been passed to Mr McNulty in the force’s Specialist Crimes and Operations Directorate.

The officer was in charge of the 2006 investigation which saw a sitting Prime Minister interviewed by police for the first time when Tony Blair was questioned as a witness.

Three others, chief fundraiser Lord Levy, Downing Street aide Ruth Turner and Labour Party backer Sir Christopher Evans were arrested but never charged.

Hints: Lord Oakeshott said his resignation statement that he had 'failed' in his efforts 'to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own'

Mr MacNeil, MP for the Western Isles, is a fierce critic of the House of Lords and said the forthcoming vote on independence could rid people north of the border of its cost.

He added: ‘If the rest of the UK want to keep funding the House of Lords, it is a matter for them.

‘A Yes vote would mean that people in Scotland could get rid of the expensive and unrepresentative Westminster tier – saving around £50m a year in not sending MPs and peers to London.’

Lib Dem funding has fallen sharply since they went into Government and the party has become increasingly reliant on big donations.

Earlier this month it emerged how the party’s three biggest donors – who have provided two-fifths of all the party’s donations – have been given peerages by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

The three Lords – Ministry of Sound magnate James Palumbo, Domino’s Pizza founder Rumi Verjee and clothes tycoon Raj Loomba – donated around £600,000 between them.

They are among 34 Lib Dems who have been given life peerages by Mr Clegg since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009.

This is despite his complaints that the House of Lords is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies.

Earlier this month Mr Clegg denied that anything improper has taken place and insisted the claims are demeaning to wealthy donors.

He said businessmen were ‘perfectly’ entitled to give the Lib Dems huge sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not then be made peers.

Mr Clegg said he is ‘delighted’ that they have joined the ‘Lib Dem team’, adding: ‘They’ve got a huge amount of experience, a lot of business nous.’

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It is completely untrue that Liberal Democrats engage in cash for peerages.’
