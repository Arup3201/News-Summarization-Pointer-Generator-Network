With no sign of her wedding ring, Max Clifford’s wife Jo spent the trial well away from the courtroom.

She was ‘very, very angry’ and ‘just waiting for guilty verdicts and then she’s going to divorce him for everything he’s got’, a friend said.

Mrs Clifford – the publicist’s former PA whom he married in April 2010, seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz – declined to comment on the suggestion she has been speaking to top London divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth.

At her husband’s trial, she was not called as a character witness and did not attend court by his side as a show of support.

As Clifford waited for the verdicts, his wife was strolling in the Cotswolds village where she has a three-bedroom £600,000 stone cottage.

She fought back tears after hearing he had been convicted.

When asked if it was true she had left her husband, Mrs Clifford said: ‘I really can’t comment on that.’

The sex predator was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court, for offences carried out between 1977 and 1984.

As Clifford was driven off to prison, it emerged police are considering further sex assault charges against him.

Twenty-three
 women originally came forward – with prosecutors selecting the seven 
strongest cases to take to trial – and several others are understood to 
have come forward since.

Scotland
 Yard sources described the new allegations as ‘significant’ and said 
they would be taken ‘very seriously’ by police and prosecutors.

One
 said: ‘The evidence which emerged during the trial gave a number of 
women the confidence to come forward and make new allegations against 
him. Now that he has gone to jail, yet more victims may contact police.

‘Clifford was clearly a prolific offender and the idea he stopped attacking girls decades ago is difficult to believe.

‘If
 anything, his arrogance – and the fact he kept getting away with it – 
are likely to have resulted in him committing more offences.’

Clifford repeatedly shook his head in 
the dock as he was sentenced for the eight sex attacks on four victims 
between 1977 and 1984.

The 
judge said that if the offences had taken place today – since sentencing
 guidelines were toughened in 2003 – Clifford would have been regarded 
as a multiple rapist for which he would have been locked up for life. 

The maximum sentence for indecent assault at the time was two years.

For
 Clifford’s eight offences, the judge gave him a series of sentences of 
12 months, 18 months, 24 months, six months, 21 months and 15 months, 
some to run concurrently and some consecutively, to arrive at a total of
 eight years. His lawyer said he might appeal.
