Kevin Pietersen hit 29 from 27 balls, but was upstaged by big-hitting Jason Roy as Surrey beat Worcestershire by three-wicket in the NatWest t20 Blast quarter-final at the Kia Oval.

Roy’s stunning 52 from 23 balls, including three sixes and eight fours, took his run tally to 619 from 14 innings in this summer’s Twenty20 competition at an average of 47.61 and helped Surrey overhaul Worcestershire’s modest 141 for nine with 3.3 overs to spare.

There was a little bit of a wobble after Roy’s exit, with Worcestershire fighting hard in the field to take seven Surrey wickets on a slowish pitch, but Robin Peterson finished matters in the 17th over by swinging Shaaiq Choudhry’s left-arm spin for six and then driving the next ball through mid-off for four.

Star performer: Jason Roy hit 52 from just 23 balls during Surrey's convincing t20 Blast win 

Mitch McClenaghan’s first two overs went for 33 runs as he bore the brunt of Roy’s strokemaking.

When Roy was out, mis-hitting Shantry to mid-on from the fourth ball of the sixth over, it was left to Pietersen and the rest of Surrey’s international-packed middle order to complete the job.

Pietersen hit five fours, but he then pulled Joe Leach to mid-on at the start of the 12th over and Surrey made rather heavy weather of the remaining chase.

Next best: Kevin Pietersen was also in good form for the winning side, scoring 29 off 27 balls

In the end, Peterson — who finished on 24 not out from 12 balls, with a six and three fours — saw them home in the company of Gareth Batty.

Having been put into bat, Worcestershire suffered from losing wickets at regular intervals, with Jade Dernbach, Matthew Dunn and Peterson claiming two wickets apiece.

The visitors were reduced to 97 for six when opener Richard Oliver was dismissed by Peterson for a 36-ball 34 — Worcestershire’s top score — and never recovered.
