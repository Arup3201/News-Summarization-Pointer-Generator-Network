Finland’s largest airline is asking customers to fry with them as it becomes the latest carrier to use a mix of recycled cooking oil and jet fuel to power a long-distance flight.

Finnair is using the biofuel to drive the engines of an Airbus A330 aircraft on a nine-hour demonstration flight from Helsinki to New York on Tuesday.

It will be the airline’s inaugural transatlantic flight using a fuel mix containing the type of oil used to fry fish, chips or chicken.

Come fry with me: Finnair is using recycled cooking oil to power a flight from Helsinki to New York

Finnair said it will be able to reduce its net carbon dioxide emission by 50 to 80 per cent by switching to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly fuel source.

But biofuel is more than twice the price of conventionally produced jet fuel and it is too costly for any airline to operate with it exclusively. 

Tuesday’s flight coincides with the opening day of the UN Climate Summit in New York.

Kati Ihamaki, Finnair’s vice-president of sustainable development, said: ‘The UN Climate Summit is an important gathering to fight climate change, and we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the climate benefits of more widespread adoption of environmentally sustainable biofuels in aviation.

Let's fry away: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has been using cooking-oil-based fuel on flights in Europe since 2011

Finnair's biofuel mixture is being provided by SkyNRG Nordic, a joint venture between SkyNRG and Statoil Aviation, and is partly manufactured with cooking oil from restaurants.

Finnair isn’t breaking new ground with its Helsinki-to-New York flight, however.

It first flew with biofuel in 2011 and several airlines have been using the mixture for years.

But Finnair said it is hoping to establish a biofuel hub with its partners to develop the supply chain and lower the cost of sustainable biofuel while reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.
