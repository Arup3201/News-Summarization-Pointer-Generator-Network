'I spent most of Tuesday and Wednesday with Matt and Lyndal … they were asking me every couple of hours, how our guys were going. 

'Even at a time of immense personal tragedy, they were still looking out for other people.' 

A Carols by Candlelight event went ahead as scheduled at Warradale Park on Friday nightattended by the toddler’s family and hundreds of other well-wishers and mourners.

Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, say their little boy went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors

Sam's grandfather Geoff has asked search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song 

'If you've got little drains, you know, he's autistic, so he may not play with normal toys, so he could be hiding in the garden.

'He could be hiding somewhere, he could be wandering around he may well have got tired and laid down for a sleep.'

Police have praised the community saying the help so far has been 'overwhelming'. 

Sam went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors. 

'I heard the fridge door beep because he was in the fridge, I said 'shut the door Sam'. Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn't there,' Ms Trott told Perth Now.

'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore.

'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn't see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name.

'He doesn't know how to open doors but the door was wide open.'
