Richard Dart pictured after he had converted to Islam

A filmmaker attempts to understand his stepbrother's journey from middle-class white boy to convicted terrorist in a new documentary. 

In 2010 Robb Leech spent a year filming his stepbrother Richard Dart after he turned his back on the world he grew up in to become a fundamentalist Muslim called Salahuddin. 

The pair grew up together after Robb's father married Richard's mother.

At the weekends they would play with the family dog in their garden in Weymouth, Dorset, and enjoyed swimming and playing football.

Family holidays were often spent camping in France. 

In his mid-teens Richard moved to the Isle of Wight to live with his father and the boys saw less of each other. 

By his early twenties, Richard went to the U.S. to work with children in a summer camp. 

However, when he came back Richard told people he had found religion and was now a Christian.

By the following year, things had changed dramatically in Richard's life.

He had converted to Islam and changed his name to Salahuddin al-Britani.

Robb went to meet his stepbrother in Mile End, east London, and was shocked to discover Richard wearing robes and sporting a long beard. 

Robb told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was shocked. I tried to connect with him but he preached for five hours. I went away thinking he'd been brainwashed.'

To make some sense of it all, Robb began filming with his stepbrother.

However, in 2012 Dart was arrested on terrorist charges. 

Dart, who is married and has a daughter, was arrested as he tried to leave for terrorist training in Pakistan. 

He was converted to Islam by hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who also inspired a plot to attack the London Stock Exchange.

Dart was sentenced to six years in prison alongside Jahangir Alom, 26, a former Met police community support officer, and unemployed Imran Mahmood, 22.

Mahmood, caught bringing two rucksacks with traces of explosives on them back from Pakistan, was jailed for nine years, nine months.

Alom, who the court heard served in the Territorial Army in G Company of the 7th Battalion the Rifles, was jailed for four years, six months.

The court appearance was the last time Robb saw his stepbrother.

Despite his conviction Robb hopes his brother will turn his life around when he is released.

His wife, Ayan Hadi, 31 and from West Acton, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for failing to give police information about her husband.

My Brother The Terrorist will be aired on BBC Three at 9pm tomorrow (Monday).
