Two North Carolina men are facing the death penalty in the murder of a young volunteer firefighter last December - but the victim’s wife says she has already forgiven them.

Jalend Turner, 19, and Khari McClelland, 23, have been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly gunning down 25-year-old Marcus Kauffman during a burglary at his Rowan County home in December 2013.

Kauffman, who served on the Scotch Irish Volunteer Fire Department, was shot in the head and died three weeks later from his injuries at Carolinas Medical Center.

Marcus' wife, Maryann, was seven months pregnant at the time of the shooting. The slain firefighter passed away without getting to meet his son, Marcus Landon, who was born in February. 

On Friday, the Rowan County District Attorney’s Office announced that prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Turner and McClelland. The 24-year-old is believed to have fired the round that fatally injured Kauffman.

District Attorney Brandy Cook said the murder trials of the two suspects will be tried as capital cases, reported Charlotte Observer.

The pair's alleged accomplices, Tramel Hart, 18, and Michael Teasley, 25, were charged with accessory after the fact.

Just hours after the announcement, Maryann Kauffman, Marcus' widow, wrote a comment on the news site WBTV in reaction to an article about the case, asking the public not to hate the men who allegedly killed her husband.

‘For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins,’ she quoted from Scripture, Matthew 6:14-15.

‘I don't see any exceptions in the bible depending on how terrible the sin is, or how much it hurts me,’ Mrs Kauffman went on. ‘Jesus forgave me, I can forgive them.

‘Thank you all for caring, but please don't feel hate towards them on our behalf. I don't want that, and Marcus wouldn't want that.’

Maryann, a devout Christian who met her husband in Bible camp, had said in the past that in her view, it was not the suspected burlglars’ plan to murder her husband.

On December 2, 2013, Marcus 'Marco' Kauffman and his newlywed wife were coming back from spending Thanksgiving weekend with family when they spotted a suspicious blue car with its hood up near their home.

So full of life: Marcus was a six-year veteran of a local volunteer fire department. The couple met at a Bible camp and got married in September 2012 

Kauffman drove up to the vehicle and asked the driver if he needed help, but the man sitting behind the wheel did not respond, according to a message posted on a Facebook page dedicated to the slain firefighter.

Marcus took Maryann to a neighbor's home and then went back to check on their house on Chenault Road.

Prosecutors said the 25-year-old father-to-be walked in on a group of robbers ransacking his home. Kauffman was able to dial 911 to report shots fired as he fled the house.

Officers who arrived on the scene a short time later discovered Kauffman with a gunshot wound to the back of the head in his car, which crashed in the woods near a cornfield. The rear window was shot out. 

Officers were able to track down and apprehend Turner and McClelland a week later. Arrest warrants stated the intruders removed two computers, an Xbox and a gun from the Kauffmans’ residence.
