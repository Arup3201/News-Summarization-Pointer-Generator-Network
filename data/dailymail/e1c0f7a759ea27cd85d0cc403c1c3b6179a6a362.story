It is the second most expensive street in Britain, with some of the most sought after properties in the country.

But behind the doors of many of the mansions on so-called Billionaires Row, in The Bishops Avenue, north London, there is little in the way of opulence and luxury.

It is estimated that a third of the homes, worth an estimated £350million, are in a terrible state of disrepair after lying vacant for a quarter of a century.

Some are derelict after being left to the mercy of the elements, with water streaming down the walls of former ballrooms, collapsed ceilings around chandeliers, ferns and other plants growing up staircases and out of roofs. In others, rubble and bird droppings, as well as the carcasses of dead pigeons litter the floor.

Houses on the street are out of the price range of most Londoners and instead attract wealthy buyers from overseas.

The empty buildings include a row of 10 mansions, worth £73m, which are thought to be owned by members of the Saudi royal family, supposedly purchased between 1989 and 1993 as boltholes to escape the turbulence in the Middle East during Saddam Hussain’s dictatorship in Iraq.

Also empty is 14-bedroomed Heath Hall, which was built for the founder of the Tate & Lyle sugar empire, and is currently on sale for £65million.

Of those that are occupied, some are used infrequently by their owners for short periods each year, with residents complaining that there is little in the way of a ‘community.’

Most are registered to companies in tax havens including the British Virgin Islands, Curaçao, the Bahamas, Panama, and the Channel Islands, meaning their foreign owners were able to remain anonymous and avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in stamp duty when they were purchased.

Egyptian-born Dr Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, a surgeon and businessman who has rented a home on the road for seven years, said he had never met his neighbours and reckoned only three of the houses were occupied full-time.

Another resident, an Iranian who asked not to be named, said: ‘Ninety-five per cent of the people who live here don’t actually live here. It is a terrible place to live really. It is very boring and the road is very busy. I don’t think many people want to live in such big houses anyway.’

Property developer Anil Varma, who is renovating the former Saudi homes, told the Guardian that the area had become ‘one of the most expensive wastelands in the world.’

‘Not many true local residents live on the road,’ he said. ‘It is the likes of the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Brunei. They buy a property and don’t do anything with it. No one has lived in some of these homes for 25 years and they are decaying.

‘When we did the searches on some of them the water authorities said they had no records of any water being used.’

There are more than 700,000 empty houses in England but politicians are divided on how they can be used to solve the national housing shortage, which is increasing by an estimated 100,000 homes a year.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, put himself on a collision course with the Government when he called for higher council tax for owners who fail to live in or rent out their properties for more than two years, saying ‘London homes aren’t ... just blocks of bullion in the sky.’

David Ireland, chief executive of the Homes from Empty Homes campaign group, said The Bishops Avenue epitomised ‘everything that is wrong with the London housing market.’ ‘The high values are being used as an extreme investment vehicle at the expense of homes being homes,’ he said.

Around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty

‘London’s shortage of homes is so great that this feels immoral and dysfunctional. There are countless people in inadequate housing and here are homes on The Bishops Avenue that could be used.’ But estate agents say high vacancy rates in London, which attracts wealthy property buyers come from all over the world, are inevitable.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, founder of Glentree Estates, who has overseen more than 100 house sales on The Bishops Avenue over the past 40 years, said any attempt to interfere with what owners do with their property would be wrong.

‘One of the things people love about this country is its freedom and liberal views,’ he said. ‘You can’t start affecting what people do with their assets. That is sacrosanct.’
