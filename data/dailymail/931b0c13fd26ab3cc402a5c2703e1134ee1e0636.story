Pregnant women who are overweight should be sent to slimming classes to help tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, politicians say.

Doctors should challenge the ‘fallacy’ that eating for two will produce a fit and healthy child.

An all-party group of MPs and peers called for GPs and midwives to be trained in ‘body weight levels for pregnant women’.

According to NHS guidelines, most women are expected to gain between 22 and 26lb during pregnancy. But the report recommends that those who are too heavy when they become pregnant should be referred to Weight Watchers or Slimming World, saying: ‘GPs and midwives should offer pregnant women funded referral to lifestyle weight management programmes.’

It said action was needed as soon as a woman becomes pregnant, as children of obese parents are more likely to be overweight themselves, adding: ‘Obesity is a family affair and it starts early.’

The new advice is contained in a report by the all-party Parliamentary group on a fit and healthy childhood, which says Britain faces a ‘child obesity epidemic of intractable nature’.

The report said a Cabinet-level minister should be responsible for tackling the potentially ‘devastating’ problem.

Under the proposals, parents would receive ‘healthy eating and lifestyle advice’ for their toddlers, and family liaison workers based in schools would help encourage children to exercise, eat nutritious food and spend less time in front of the computer or TV.

The report also said that breastfeeding should become the ‘desirable norm’ in the UK, pointing out that in Europe, television advertisements about breastfeeding are ‘perfectly acceptable’. It claimed that mothers could be persuaded to avoid fattening formula milk if there were more places to feed children in workplaces, shops and leisure facilities.

The group called on local authorities to provide better outdoor play facilities so children don’t spend all day in front of computers. And it suggested that councils should carry out fitness checks in schools.

Former Play School presenter Baroness Floella Benjamin, who led the all-party Parliamentary group, said: ‘It is now widely acknowledged that the nation is in the grip of a child obesity epidemic. This report will help families and the professionals who support them to turn the tide and establish new and healthy patterns of living for all our children.’

Slimming World spokesman Jenny Caven praised the report, saying: ‘If we don’t take steps now to do something to support families to adopt healthier patterns, our children will die before us.’

But Mark Littlewood, from think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘This is the nanny state in the most literal sense, with the Government peering over parents’ shoulders at every turn.

‘The all-party group seems set on hectoring the public from the cradle to the grave.

‘Their intrusive and expensive policy proposals are unlikely to achieve anything other than making parents feel patronised and spied upon.’
