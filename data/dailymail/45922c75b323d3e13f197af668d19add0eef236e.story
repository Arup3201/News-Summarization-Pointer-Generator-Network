A toddler had to have part of his body built from scratch when he was born, due to a rare condition.

George Dibb, now 16-months-old, had an entire part of his digestive system missing so just hours into his life he underwent major surgery, which saw doctors build him a replica duodenum.

The condition, which affects 1 in 50,000 births in the UK, occurs when there is a build up of amniotic fluid in the womb, causing an absence of the vital organ and a ‘double-bubble’ becomes visible on diagnostic x-rays of the abdomen.

Happy families: George, now 16-months old with proud parents Emma and David. The rare condition affects 1 in 50,000 births in the UK

His mother Emma Grainger had to have eight litres of fluid drained from her baby bump before she could give birth to him - enough to fill four large coca-cola bottles.

Emma, 27, said: 'I first knew there was something wrong because of the size of my bump, which appeared really quickly.

'George was my first baby but I’d seen other pregnant women, including my sister, and I was much bigger.

'I am naturally tall and skinny, but it looked like I had a basketball shoved up my top.'

While doctors were not initially concerned, they soon became bothered 32-weeks into Emma’s pregnancy, when they noticed she had an excessive amount of amniotic fluid in her womb.

An ultrasound confirmed that her baby had ‘double bubble’ which occurred as George’s stomach was not attached to his bowel.

The increase in fluid meant he could not swallow all of the fluid while in the womb and absorbed it into his digestive tract.

Doctors whisked baby George into life-saving surgery hours after birth. Without the operation, he would have slowly starved to death

When Emma and her fiance David, from Doncaster, South Yorks, were told of their unborn baby’s condition, they were given the option, almost seven months into the pregnancy, to abort it.

Emma said: 'I was speechless and in complete shock. Until now, everything had seemed completely normal.

'But there was no way we were going to get rid of him. We were so excited to meet him and we wouldn’t have given him up for anything.'

The only way doctors could allow George to be born was to drain the excess fluid from her stomach, using a huge needle, which was inserted into her stomach.

Eight litres was siphoned from Emma’s stomach before medics confirmed it was safe for George to be born at 38 weeks - just a fortnight before his due date.

After a caesarean section at Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, George was born last April, and immediately whisked away to the nearby Children’s Hospital for constructive surgery on his abdomen.

He required a duodenum, the first section of the small intestine, which is crucial for digestion.

Without the operation, he would have 
been unable to digest any food and if the condition had not been 
discovered, he would have slowly starved to death.

David, 27, a buyer for a pharmaceutical company, said: 'They basically open him up and start plumbing.

'They built a pipe and fed it into his digestive system to sit between his small intestine and his bowel.

The condition - which is caused by a build-up of amniotic fluid - can be detected by a diagnostic x-ray. Eight litres of fluid were drained from Emma's womb before it was safe to deliver George at 38 weeks

For new-mum Emma, she didn’t see her son for days, and was simply given a number of photos and a breast pump while George underwent life-saving surgery.'

'It was devastating not being able to 
see him,' she said. 'I’d undergone surgery myself having a caesarean so I
couldn’t get out of bed and go and see him.'

'When I did see him, he had all these tubes coming out of him. As a first-time mum, it was very scary. I was devastated.'

After a fortnight, Emma and David were able to bring George home for the first time and the youngster is now a happy and healthy little boy.

Emma added: 'We were at the hospital everyday with him for two weeks. To see each tube come out and notice a bit more development was amazing.

'The doctors were impressed that I still wanted to breast feed. I watched the milk go through his tubes and I think it helped him to get better.

'He’s our happy, smiling, bouncing baby boy now, and we’re so proud of everything he’s been through in his short life.'
