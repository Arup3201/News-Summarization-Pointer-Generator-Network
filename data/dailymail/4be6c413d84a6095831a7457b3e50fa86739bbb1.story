Naked, drawn by a robot and painted in his own blood, a Brooklyn artist may have just created the ultimate selfie.

Ted Lawson's bizarre latest piece - titled 'Ghost in the Machine (blood robot selfie)' - is exactly what it says on the tin.

In order to bring it to life, Mr Lawson had to connect the robot artist to a vein in his arm, via a medical tube.

Blood, sweat and tears: The creation took hours of coding and a lot of Ted Lawson's blood

Finished product: Mr Lawson had to sit for hours with the robot attached to a vein in his arm while it 'painted'

He wrote thousands of lines of code to direct the machine, and then sat for hours as the it sketched out his likeness, while sucking blood from his arm for the ink.

'I'm always trying to find the intersection between technology and existential human experience,' he said.

'I was trying to work out a way to program the machine to draw with a brush and ink when it occurred to me that I could hook myself up to the machine directly.

Modern art: Mr Lawson is used to creating unorthodox pieces, and focuses largely on the human form

'I've never really been a huge fan of self portraits, and was not really into putting my nude self out there, but conceptually it made sense.

'I wanted to show, in a poetic way, the connection we all have with technology and how it has permeated our inner selves in different ways.' 

Much of Mr Lawson's artwork is quite gruesome and features the human form. One of his pieces, titled 'Eve', is a circle of eight sculptures of a woman, starting out extremely thin and skeletal and ending up grotesquely fat.

He also creates sculptures from crude oil and does paintings of abstract space scenes. 

His website bio reads: 'Using figurative representation and geometric abstraction, Ted Lawson creates a narrative progression of forms that reveals something conceptually greater than the sum of their parts.

'Ted’s large scale works combine digital technology with highly crafted traditional sculpting methods to seamlessly produce conceptual objects that express the underlying analog truth within his subject matter.

'His working process in an exploration into the human existential experience through imagined models of the universe as physical form.'

Mr Lawson is not the only artist to recreate himself in blood. Young British Artists member Marc Quinn has made a series of sculptures of his own head made from frozen blood. 

He makes a new version every five years for the project, titled 'Self', with the first head being made from 4.5 litres of his own blood taken from him over five months.

Charles Saatchi bought the original in 1991 for a rumoured £13,000, before selling it to an American collector for £1.5m in April 2005.
