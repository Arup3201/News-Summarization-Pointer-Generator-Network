Chelsea ace Eden Hazard admits he was upset at Juan Mata's move to Manchester United, but confesses it was inevitable after he was frozen out by Blues boss Jose Mourinho.

Mata made the move to United for a fee of £37.1 million in January 2014, and will face his old club for the first time on Sunday afternoon.

One of the opponents lining up against him is old friend Hazard, who has spoken of his sadness at the Spain midfielder's exit.

'I was sad when Juan left because he was such a good player,' Hazard told the Sunday Mirror. 'But at the end of his time at Chelsea, he was on the bench and he didn't play a lot.'

'When you're a great player, it's normal that you want to play, so I respect his choice, but I wanted him to stay here because it was a pleasure to play with him.'

Chelsea sit top of the Premier League and, after Manchester City's slip-up yesterday, the Blues can go six points clear after just nine matches if they beat United at Old Trafford.

This raises the importance of an already feisty derby; one which Hazard reveals he is fully focused on. Despite his friendship with Mata, he has not made contact in the lead-up to Sunday's match.

'Juan is my friend, but on Sunday he plays for Man United, I play for Chelsea and I want to win. I've not been in touch with him this season. Last season, yes, but not this one.'
