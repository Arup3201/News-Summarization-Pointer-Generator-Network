Kyle Randall was dragged 300ft in his car following a collision with a moving train in Jefferson, Oregon

An alleged drunk driver who was dragged 300ft after his car collided with a moving train managed to free himself from the wreckage before knocking on strangers' doors to ask for a place to sleep.

Police have said Kyle Randall is believed to have driven through a stop sign before colliding with the moving train in Jefferson, Oregon.

The train reportedly dragged the car 300ft before continuing on its journey towards Independence, Oregon.

Following the collision however, the 24-year-old managed to free himself from the wreckage.

He then went to seek shelter at nearby homes, investigators have claimed.

Marion County deputies were first called to the area on Saturday morning after residents reported a man knocking on doors asking for somewhere to sleep, Fox 12 Oregon has reported.

Officers discovered Randall's burnt out car after a plume of smoke caught their attention.

Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sergeant Chris Baldridge told the Statesman Journal that Randall was being charged with a misdemeanor DUI.

He said: 'In order for it to be a felony, you have to have multiple convictions of DUI.'

Randall is reportedly facing a single charge because damage was only caused to his property.

He is due to appear in court on May 12.
