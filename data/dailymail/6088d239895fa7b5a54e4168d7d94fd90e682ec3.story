The group were able to free him from the wheelchair, lifting him back onto the platform before a train arrives on the platform. 

They rescue took about one minute. Thankfully a train did not arrive while they were on the tracks.

Metro Trains released a statement today advising passengers on wheelchairs to be wary on platforms.

'We ask all of our customers using wheelchairs or traveling with prams to be extra vigilant around trains, as some of our platforms slope towards the tracks,' they said.

The injured man is believed to be recovering in hospital in a stable condition.
