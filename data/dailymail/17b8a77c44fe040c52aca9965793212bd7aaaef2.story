It is not always easy to be the odd one out, but this young elephant does not seem to mind.

The calf joined its herd of white elephants for a bath in their enclosure near the Uppatasanti Pagoda in Naypyitaw, the capital of Burma. 

The baby is kept with five white elephants, who have all been captured in the wild for their unusual colouring and are seen as sacred signs of good fortune, peace and wealth in predominantly Buddhist Burma.

Five of the rare white elephants have been found and captured in Burma between 2001 and 2010, and now live in the capital.

White elephants have been revered for centuries in South-East Asian countries such as Burma, Thailand and Laos.

Historically, white elephants were kept  by monarchs and considered a symbol of royal power and prosperity.

Many in Burma still believes white elephants only emerge in places where the practice of Buddhism flourishes and rulers govern justly.
