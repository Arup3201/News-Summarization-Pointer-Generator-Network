A six-foot wide house which doesn't even have room for an indoor bathroom has gone on the market for a sizable £77,000.

The tiny property, thought to be one of Britain's smallest, has one bedroom, a living room, a small kitchenette and a landing.

But there’s no room for an indoor toilet - and instead, it is located in a shed at the bottom of the garden.

This tiny two-bedroom home in Colchester, Essex, has gone on sale for £77,000 despite not having an indoor toilet. Pictured is the home's modest kitchenette, which appears to lead towards the garden and shed

The current owner of the property, pictured right, will only take cash for the two-storey home

The two-storey house measures 8ft 7in at the front and reduces to just 6ft 3in towards the back.

Owner Malcolm Cross, who will only take cash for the property, has used the house in Colchester, Essex, as a commercial store for electrical equipment for the last 30 years.

He said: 'Unfortunately we haven’t got bathroom facilities here. We’ve only got cold water and there’s a WC outside.

'I bought it from an elderly lady who lived here with her son. It has been perfect for what I’ve used it for.

'I love it to this day. It would be a nice little cottage for somebody if they were willing to do some work on it.'

The house is a short walk from the town centre and is close to shops, schools and a railway station.

Estate agents Fenn Wright describe the house as 'a charming Victorian end of terrace cottage' requiring modernisation.

Any interested parties have already been told only cash buyers will be accepted.

The house, described as a 'charming Victorian end of terrace cottage' in its listing, is a short walk from the town centre - close to shops, schools and a railway station

The listing reads: 'A charming Victorian end of terrace cottage currently used as commercial premises and requiring modernisation.

'The property is quite possibly the smallest house in the oldest recorded town in England.'

Despite its tiny dimensions the property is not the smallest house in the UK.

The current record holder is one in the Welsh fishing village of Conwg just 10ft tall and 6ft wide.

Britain's actual smallest house is this tiny red cottage in Conwg, Wales - which is just 10dt tall and 6ft wide
