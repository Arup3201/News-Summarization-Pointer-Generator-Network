Double Grand National-winning jockey Carl Llewellyn has somehow been invited back on to the same Cheltenham preview panel on which he made a vile racist comment.

Llewellyn was fined £1,500 by the British Horseracing Authority, axed as a Jockey Club racecourse host and interviewed under caution by Gloucester Police after inexcusably telling an audience of 140 punters at famous racing pub, the Hollow Bottom that ‘There are no n*****s in here because Hugh (the owner) doesn’t allow them in.’

Minister of Sport Helen Grant called his remark ‘horrific’.

Llewellyn, assistant trainer for Nigel Twiston-Davies, apologised and after his BHA disciplinary he said: ‘I’m very aware that any success I’ve had in racing brings with it responsibility. On that evening I failed to live up to that responsibility.’

Yet despite the huge sensitivity around racism in sport, the Hollow Bottom is staging its pre-Cheltenham Festival event with exactly the same cast list as last year — including Llewellyn.

The decision will exasperate those trying to change racing’s often insular attitude but pub owner Hugh Kelly said: ‘It’s entirely appropriate Carl is on the panel. He has paid his dues so why shouldn’t I employ him.’

A BHA spokesman said: ‘This issue was dealt with at the time. We cannot tell the Hollow Bottom how to conduct their business.’

Rory McLeod, the only British Muslim on the snooker circuit, was wearing a waistcoat logo badge bearing the initials ISIS in his match against Ronnie O’Sullivan in the Welsh Open, causing a furore on social media. McLeod explained that accountants ISIS Business Solutions - rather than an Islamic terror organisation - had been his personal sponsors for 14 years.

David Beckham’s relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson has thawed somewhat since the infamous boot-in-the-face incident was followed by his transfer to Real Madrid. Still, it was a surprise to see the pair separated only by Beckham’s spokesman Simon Oliveira at the Parc des Princes as they watched Chelsea draw with Paris Saint-Germain. The seating plan was said to be concidence. Ferguson was in Paris on holiday with his wife, while Beckham  played briefly for PSG before his retirement.

Aston Villa have not only gone for a new manager in Tim Sherwood, who was sacked by Spurs but also appointed a chief commercial officer Charlie Wijeratna, who was axed by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy for failing to find new sponsors. Wijeratna has had a more successful time as commercial director for the inauguaral European Games in Baku 2015, but is leaving before a UK broadcasting deal is signed and what will be a difficult ticket sale process. Meanwhile well-travelled former ECB and ICC communications chief Colin Gibson is expected to take up the same role in Baku.

Figo swerves race row

Luis Figo’s advisers have switched Thursday’s launch of his FIFA presidential campaign manifesto from Stamford Bridge to Wembley to avoid the furore over Chelsea fans’ racist behaviour overshadowing the event. Figo has been vocal about racism issues in the past, calling it ‘not a football problem, but a wider social ill’.

Going to the national stadium could be awkward as the FA are supporting Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan. But the prince has no problem over the change of venue, with Sepp Blatter’s three challengers effectively acting in concert to maximise opposition to a fifth term.

Surrey chairman Richard Thompson outlined his serious concerns about the future of Test cricket to an MCC audience who took on board the message. Thompson fears agreeing a future tours programme of Test cricket after 2019 will be hugely difficult such is the dominance of white-ball cricket. West Indies are one of those countries in which Test cricket is in steep decline and a seriously sub-standard Test series in the Caribbean against England in April could mark the beginning of the end for the five-day game. Thompson has implored MCC to do all they can to preserve Test cricket as the game’s most important format.
