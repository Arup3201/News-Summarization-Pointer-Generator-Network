Consumers who buy Halal-certified products could be funding Islamic extremism, an Australian politician claims.

Nationals MP George Christensen has questioned whether shoppers who buy goods with the Halal logo are funding a push for Sharia law or even backing terrorists in an opinion article titled Terror In The Tucker Box on his website.

He said it was 'outrageous' his grocery dollars were going towards a 'religious tax' on products with Halal certification, including Vegemite, Corn Flakes and Freddo Frogs.

'Worse still, I don't know whether my grocery spend is going to fund extremist versions of that religion or extremist religious activities that I would rather not see in Australia,' Mr Christensen wrote.

'While it’s not terrorism, there is no doubt that halal certification is funding organisations with extremist views and activities in Australia. 

'It’s lovely to know a jar of the salty black stuff (Vegemite) is sponsoring the advocacy of robbing women of all of their marital property rights.'

In an opinion article titled Terror In The Tucker Box on his website, Mr Christensen said there's no way to know where the funds from Halal-certified goods end up

Mr Christensen says there's no way to know where the funds from Halal-certified goods end up, despite conceding one certifier - Australian Federation of Islamic Councils - builds mosques and funds education programs with the money.

The Nationals deputy whip said it was 'entirely feasible' to think some Halal certifiers could be financing groups like Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood, citing cases in the US where such links were found.

Controversy over Halal certification has come to a boil over the past few weeks.

Mr Christensen said it was 'outrageous' his grocery dollars were going towards a 'religious tax' on products with Halal certification, including Vegemite

He said with a vast range of products that are now halal approved, like Corns Flakes and Freddo Frogs, it was impossible to escape it 

South Australian dairy producer Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt Company was forced drop its Halal certification after receiving threats on social media.

As a result, the company lost a $50,000 deal it had with Middle Eastern airline Emirates.

Sales and marketing manager Nick Hutchinson said they pulled the pin due to negative publicity, but hoped the ditched deal wouldn't effect redundancies or lost hours for employees.
