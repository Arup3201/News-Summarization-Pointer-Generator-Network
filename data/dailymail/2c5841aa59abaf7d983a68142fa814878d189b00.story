 

The alleged Aussie mastermind of the Syrian jihadist network lives peacefully on welfare payments in suburbia with one of reportedly two wives in a quiet cul de sac in south-western Sydney.

Hamdi Alqudsi, the 39-year-old who has been charged with recruiting seven Australians as terrorist fighters to Syria, is free on bail and living in a four bedroom brick home on a large suburban block at St Helens Park as he awaits a committal hearing.

Three young Australians connected with Mr Alqudsi, a disability pensioner, have been sent to their death in Syria, including former Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum.

Alleged mastermind: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday after appearing briefly in the Downing Centre Local Court in central Sydney) is, police claim, the chief recruiter in Australia of young men who want to go and fight in Syria against government forces with groups such as the extremists in ISIS

 Mr Alqudsi, who lives in his rented home on a large suburban block with his Australian Muslim convert wife Carnita Matthews, is briefly appeared at the Downing Centre Court on Tuesday and is due before a magistrate again this month.

He is the first Australian to be charged under the foreign incursion laws since the establishment of the extemist ISIS group in Syria.

He is charged with seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria'. 

Another terror accused: Fatima Elomar (pictured on Tuesday outside a central Sydney court) has also been accused on planning hostile foreign incursions after she was arrested boarding an international flgiht, allegedly to go to Syria to join her husband.

Soccer nut: Mehmet Biber, a 21-year-old Turkish-Australian from Merrylands, Sydney, who loved poetry and soccer, became radicalised and was then recruited allegedly by Hamdi Alqudsi and crossed the Turkish border into Syria, from where he has posted photographs of bloodied aid workers injured in fighting

 But Mr Alqudsi, whose bail money was raised by Sydney Muslim groups, is preparing to apply to have the charges quashed by the High Court of Australia on the grounds they are unconstitutional. He is also suing Federal police for allegedly roughing him up during the recent Sydney terror raids, according to an ABC-TV report.

As another Australian man charged under Australia's terrorism laws, Omarjan Azari, remains in maximum security on remand, Mr Alqudsi's alleged middleman in the Australian recruitment network, Mohamed Ali Baryalei is believed to have been killed in Syria.

Police believe Baryalei left Australia to work in Turkey in conjunction with Alqudsi, the alleged main go-between for the Aussie recruits and the extremist group, Jabhat Al Nusra, which is linked to Al-Qaeda.

Packed and ready: Lawyer Zali Burrows (pictured, centre) with accused terror client, Fatima Elomar, and her children covered in blankets leaving a Sydney court in July, says Hamdi Alqudsi is innocent and will apply to have his charges under the foreign incursion act thrown out as 'unconstitutional'.

 Police will allege Alqudsi accessed funds for fares and expenses for the recruits, all of whom were in their 20s or early 30s.

Allegedly, Mr Alqudsi would instruct the men to fly to Turkey and cross the border into Syria, where they would meet up with pre-arranged contacts.

Police allege Tyler Casey was recruited between June and August last year. Casey is believed to have flown with his beautiful 22-year-old graphic arts graduate wife, Amira Karroum, to Syria before Christmas. 

Dangerous company: Renamed Yusf Ali and preaching (above) on Sydney streets, Tyler Casey was recruited, police allege, by Sydney suburban father and disability pensioner, Hamdi Alqudsi, and sent to Syria where he was shot and killed in the northern city of Aleppo within weeks of arriving

The pair was killed in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in mid-January, Reports say Ms Karroum was lined up against a wall and shot, and her body dismembered.

 Police claim Mr Alqusdi recruited former Australian infantry soldier Canal Temel in the same period.

Mr Temel, 22, from the Sydney suburb of Auburn, was shot in the head during a siege in January.

Mr Alqusdi's next alleged recruit was Turkish-Australian Mehmet Biber - jihadi name is Abu Malik - of the western Sydney suburb of Merrylands.

 The 21-year-old onetime poet and soccer nut is believed to still be fighting in Syria and has posted on Facebook graphic photographs of aid workers injured in rebel battles.

Another would-be soldier for the ISIS forces in Syria, Amin Mohamed, 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities.

Authorities believe three other alleged recruits - Mahmoud Aboshi, aka Abu Alem, of Melbourne, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh, aka Abu Hassa, and Nassim Elbahsa - are fighting in Syria.

Mr Alqudsi was arrested at his St Helens Park home last December.

Alqudsi was remanded in custody and his passport confiscated.

After he claimed he only had $500 and would struggle to make the $10,000 surety imposed by a magistrate, Sydney groups Hizb ut-Tahrir and Al Risalah held an emergency protest meeting.

Supporters, including those from Sydney's Muslim community, raised the funds for his bail, and he was released a day later, on strict conditions.

Mr Alqudsi has claimed to live a quiet, 'modest' life with his family.

Neverthless, three years ago he was part of a noisy protest outside a Sydney court where his wife was appearing.

Carnita Matthews was initially found guilty of falsely accusing a traffic policemen with trying to rip off her burqa when she was pulled over for a random breath test and declined to remove her facial covering for identification.

She successfully appealed the conviction, which was overturned. 

Mr Alqudsi, who is also known as Ibrahim Gabriel and was named in 2011 as a devotee of controversial cleric Sheik Feiz Mohammed, chanted with other men outside the Sydney District Court, calling themselves part of the ‘Islamic Brotherhood Worldwide’.

The following year, Mr Alqudsi, who called himself ‘Hamdi, Father of Ibrahim’, was reportedly among participants at Sydney's 2012 Muslim protest which led to riots in Hyde Park.

Ms Matthews successfully appealed the charge, which was overturned

Mr Alqudsi's lawyer, Sydney solicitor Zali Burrows told Daily Mail Australia she was preparing to mount a High Court challenge on his behalf against the foreign incursion laws.

Ms Burrows is also challenging the laws for her another client, the wife of Syrian-based Australian ISIS fighter, Mohamed Elomar.

Elomar posted photos of himself from Syria early this year holding the severed heads of Syrian soldiers.

Fatima Elomar, is facing foreign incursion charges under the Crimes Act, which deems it illegal to travel to a foreign state, or help someone to travel, with the intention of engaging in hostile activity.

The offence carries a maximum ten years imprisonment.

Ms Burrows said Ms Elomar and Mr Alqudsi would both strenuously defend their innocence.
