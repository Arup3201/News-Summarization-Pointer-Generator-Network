An 80-year-old dementia patient who fell over in a hospital ward was left alone on a trolley, covered in horrific bruises.

Agnes Stephens was getting ready to be discharged from Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert, Scotland when her daughter noticed a lump on her head and bruising all over her legs.

Carrie, 45, said it looked like her mother had been in a 'car crash' while nurses claimed she had 'wriggled off' a bed pan when she was left unattended.

The 80-year-old was originally taken to the hospital as a precaution after she had fallen off her bed at a care home.

But when Carrie arrived, she saw a lump on her mother's head and bruises down her left leg. She also discovered Agnes had fallen off a commode the day before when she read through the medical notes.

Carrie said: 'My mum looked like she had been in a car crash. I was absolutely disgusted and really upset. I was frightened that her hip had been broken

'She fell on a step in her bedroom and as a precaution she was taken to hospital to have an X-ray on her hip.

Injuries: Her daughter, Carrie, found her with lumps on her head and bruises over the rest of her body as she was preparing to be discharged

Family: Carrie Stephens said her 80-year-old mother was left 'very confused' by the terrible incident

'She was about to be discharged but needed the toilet and a nurse went to get a bedpan.

'I was basically asked to leave the cubicle. The next thing I saw was my mum being walked to the bathroom held up by two nurses. I found that quite odd because my mum wasn’t to be walking.

'When I went back into the cubicle I saw the mess of her. The nurses told me they had put her on the bedpan and left her unattended. They said she must have wriggled off. I was furious.'

Carrie said her mother was left 'very confused' after the fall and should never have been left alone.

She was also stunned to read medical notes the next day which stated that Agnes fallen off a commode.

Suffering: Along with the injuries to her legs and head, Agnes' mental condition also deteriorated as a result

Carrie added: 'I was appalled at what I read. It’s all blatant lies to cover up their negligence.

'There was no medical accident report written up and the nurses had changed their story.

'There is CCTV in the department and that will show that no commode was brought into the cubicle. I could see the cubicle from where I was.

'The nurses were made aware that my mum had dementia when she was admitted but it wasn’t taken on board.

'When she was brought in she knew where she was and what day it was but after the fall she had no idea what town she was in.

'There have been so many mistakes made and I really don’t want this to happen to anyone else’s mum or dad.

'We’ve yet to receive an apology.'

A spokesman for NHS Forth Valley said: 'We are extremely sorry this patient experienced a fall while she was in hospital and appreciate this must have been very distressing.

'An internal investigation is underway to look at the circumstances surrounding this accident and, in the meantime, we have offered to meet with the family so we can formally apologise.'

A spokeswoman for Alzheimer Scotland added: 'Up to a quarter of patients in an average acute hospital will have some form of dementia.

'They are all entitled to care and support that recognises their needs as people with dementia, delivered by staff who understand the effects and impact of the illness, within a system that is safe, dignified, rights-based and person-centred.'
