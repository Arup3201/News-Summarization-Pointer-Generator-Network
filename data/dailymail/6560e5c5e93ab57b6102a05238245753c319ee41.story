A former Christian radio host from Michigan was sentenced Monday to 25-50 years in prison for performing vile sex acts on a young boy.

John Balyo, 35, was arrested in a June as part of a sex trafficking ring bust, and in September he pleaded guilty to having sex with an 11-year-old boy in a Battle Creek hotel.

Balyo, a former host at the WCSG station in Grand Rapids, will spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars, receiving credit for 143 days served in jail.

Vile crime: Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 35, (pictured with an unidentified child), was sentenced to 25-50 years for having sex with a minor in May

The sentence will run concurrent with the prison term he is expected to receive in December on federal charges of child pornography and sexual exploitation.

If he lives long enough to be released from prison, Balyo will be required to register as a sex offender and wear an electronic monitor for the rest of his life, Battle Creek Inquirer reported. 

‘I just want to take this opportunity to say I am feeling very deep and constant remorse for my actions,’ Balyo said in court Monday. ‘And I want the family to know I am very sorry and wish I could do something to correct what has been done.’

The victim’s mother wrote in an impact statement, which was read to the court during the sentencing hearing, saying that children should be loved and respected, not ‘used and abused’ by adults.

‘No child should be scared of people or of life itself,’ the woman stated. ‘I think you should sit and rot in jail the rest of your miserable life.’

In August, Balyo pleaded guilty to photographing sex acts with the 11-year-old in May after paying him, then handcuffing the child to a bed. 

The boy's family were in court for the August plea hearing in Grand Rapids and wept as details of sexual assault were heard, Freep.com reported.  

Act of contrition: Balyo, (pictured in his June mugshot), apologized to his victim's family during the sentencing 

Balyo told the court: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.'

The 35-year-old was a host at WCSG until his arrest in June at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. 

Balyo admitted in June that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit' of handcuffs, chains and duct tape, a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. 

It is claimed that Balyo paid a man to arrange a sex session with a minor for him. 

Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township. 

A padlock, rubber gloves and children's socks were also seized, MLive reported.

Balyo additionally had piles of articles about missing children and children's obituaries, it was reported, along with an erotic photography magazine. 

Balyo is married and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post. Balyo tied the knot around the same time he committed the sex crime.

The DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy through a website he ran. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at a home with a boy. 

According to Mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed.

His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent.

The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said.

The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money.

The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'.

Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims. The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.
