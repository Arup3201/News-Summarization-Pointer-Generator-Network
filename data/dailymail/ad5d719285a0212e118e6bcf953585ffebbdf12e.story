After turning 40, Kate Moss made 2014 one of her most successful - and lucrative - years.

Despite ruling the fashion industry for over a decade, Kate clocked up campaigns for Burberry and Rimmel, launched a clothing range for Topshop and landed a contributing editor job at British Vogue.

Clearly her career shows no sign of slowing down as she heads into 2015 as the icon has just been unveiled as the face of Matchless's 115th anniversary campaign.

Fashion icon Kate Moss has kicked off 2015 with a new campaign modelling for Matchless

The 40-year-old supermodel has teamed up with the British motorcycle brand for the fourth time to front the label's celebratory collection marking its foundation in 1899.

Kate stars in the campaign, which was shot in a desolate-looking field in Ibiza, alongside male model, Clément Chabernaud.

The mother-of-one can be seen reclining on a motorcycle in iconic studded leather creations from the label's spring 2015 line, including the Kate vent waistcoat and a cropped leather jacket called the Miss Kate Blouson.

The Croydon-born beauty also had a hand in styling the ads with Ludivine Poiblanc, while famed photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott shot the campaign.

The brand's owners Manuele and Michele Malenotti have chosen the fashion icon to front their campaigns since their Autumn 2013 collection.

Managing director Michele said Kate, 'epitomises the Matchless spirit through her energy and status as a Londoner'.

The supermodel recently enjoyed a post-Christmas break in Trancoso, Brazil, with husband Jamie Hince, daughter Lila-Grace and supermodel pal Naomi Campbell.

The mother-of-one will turn 41 on January 16 but she's not expected to  outdo last year's partying marathon, when her well-heeled pals clocked up more than 100 hours of celebrating between them.

She held a four-day Glastonbury-themed bash at her Cotswolds home that was expected to have cost the star upwards of £100,000.
