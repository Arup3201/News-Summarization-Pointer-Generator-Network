A Boy Scout troop has been closed down after refusing to sack their openly gay Scout Master Geoff McGrath

The Boy Scouts of America have shut down a Seattle troop after they refused to sack their openly gay scout master.

Eagle Scout Geoff McGrath, 49, was invited to help set up Troop 98 at an inclusive Methodist church in Seattle last year, but was sacked at the start of the month by BSA officials after they found out he was gay.

However, the church's pastor and members of the troop refused to remove Mr McGrath and now the BSA have revoked the group's charters, a move that has left Mr McGrath 'stunned.'

He said: 'I'm stunned and disappointed to hear the news. Pastor Corsaro specifically sought out someone with my Scouting background to help get these units off the ground, and her church is now being told to violate their religious convictions. It's unconscionable and irreverent.'

Despite the BSA's move, McGrath said that the church will continue to hold meetings for the 15 cubs and scouts who attend, even if they can't use the scouting name.

He added: 'It's one of the best things I do. One of the things that really makes my week is spending time with these kids.'

'Nobody likes to be rejected from the company of people that you have valued.

'I've had to move on and accept that BSA, both national and regional, is not ready to be properly fully inclusive for all youth and adult leadership.'

The 49-year-old software developer says the decision has left him 'stunned' and vowed he will continue holding meetings without using the Boy Scout name

Mr McGarth was invited to set up Troop 98 in Seattle last year by the pastor of an inclusive Methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials

Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality: 'The Boy Scouts’ decisions only serve to hurt a group of boys who need the values and leadership of someone like Scoutmaster McGrath.

'Unfortunately, the BSA’s decision calls into question its commitment to leadership and values by perpetuating an outmoded policy rooted in fear and discrimination.

'History will show that today’s announcement is a self-inflicted wound.'

In January the BSA voted to allow gay youths into the scouts for the first time, but their rules still do not allow gay adults to run the troops.

The organisation said they had been left with 'no choice' but to sack Mr McGrath after he discussed his sexuality while being profiled by NBC, and said it was 'saddened' by the latest developments.

Rev. Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist church said it was important the the church remained open and inclusive to all, adding that she has obtained legal counsel.

Before his sacking, McGrath believed he was the only openly-gay troop leader in the country.

At the time McGarth said: 'It’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership.

'They
 are complaining that the problem is a distraction to Scouting and they 
don’t seem to understand that the distraction is self-inflicted.'

McGrath
 started leading Troop 98 last fall after he was asked by Reverand 
Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist Church.

No gay leaders: The Boy Scouts of America voted to allow gay youth into their ranks starting this year but that rule does not pertain to adult leaders. Above, McGrath addresses his troop at a parade

Rev
 Corsaro wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth, and reached
 out to McGrath who attends the church with his husband of 20 years.

McGrath was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the BSA.

When
 he was 22-years-old, McGrath was offered the position of Assistant 
Scoutmaster but that job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured 
out he was gay.

The troop was also sponsored by his Mormon church, and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion.

He agreed to start the program, in part inspired by the work of his straight twin-brother Dave who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts.

'If you don’t participate, you're not part of the conversation,' McGrath, a software engineer, said.  'Yelling from the outside is not conversing. So we're on the inside doing good work. Talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do—it's the smallest part.'

But McGrath makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt, but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids.

And his troop at Rainier Beach, including their parents, thank him for his work.

'Anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported, and Geoff has done an excellent job,' said Denise Mimura, whose son, 14-year-old son Jonathan is in the troop. 'If anyone has an issue with this, then where are they?'

Won't stop: McGrath says he will continue to lead the troop until relieved by his church's reverend

The troop currently consists of all 
straight boys, but gay high-schooler Koyle Kendrick, 17, says he plans 
to join the troops after the end of the school year.

Kendrick left another troop last year because it didn't feel gay-friendly.

'I'll
 be more comfortable going back into Scouting and being in an inclusive 
troop,' he said, adding that McGrath will 'understand where I'm coming 
from.'

McGrath certainly understands Kendrick's perspective, having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around.

'One of the things that’s different now with our troop from when I was a youth in the Scouts, was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults,' McGrath said.

For his part, McGrath hopes that 'cooler minds will prevail' and he will be allowed to continue as Scoutmaster.

'That's what I believe. If it doesn't happen today, that will be disappointing. But it doesn't mean it won't ever happen,' he said.
