It comes as a surprise to hear Rob Green’s goalkeeping howler for England against the United States in the last World Cup was not the worst moment of his career. Nor was the aftermath of blame, or being relegated from the Premier League with West Ham the following May.

Far worse was the powerlessness of not playing for Queens Park Rangers last season, watching helplessly from the substitutes’ bench as the club ‘imploded’ and sank into the Championship saddled by £177million of debt. Of all his travails over the past four years, it was this experience that hurt Green the most.

The 34-year-old has the chance to help make amends next Saturday, when QPR meet Derby County in the Championship play-off final at Wembley, and seems energised by the chance to make a difference. In the meantime, he is determined not to ‘waste energy’ on a dream he believes is out of his control.

Dejection: QPR goalkeeper Rob Green says the powerlessness of not playing last season was worse than his World Cup blunder against the USA in South Africa

Gaffe: Green allowed a routine shot to fall out of his grasp with England drawing the game 1-1

The Championship play-off final is the most lucrative fixture in the whole of global sport because the winner gets access to Premier League riches.

This year’s play-off is worth at least £134million — and that is a worse-case scenario. It is £62m of Premier League prize money even if finishing bottom next season, plus four years of subsequent ‘parachute’ payments totalling a further £72m at least.

However, if QPR win, they face the horror prospect of being hit with a fine of perhaps £60m or more because of financial fair play rules.

The goalkeeper has started just one match for England since allowing Clint Dempsey’s shot to slip through his hands in Rustenburg in June 2010. His name was not even mentioned as Roy Hodgson revealed his World Cup squad this week.

Green, however, is not bitter. Nor does he look for sympathy. Instead, he says the intervening years have been the best of his life, bringing marriage and two children, even if the 2012-13 season brought another crushing low professionally.

He said: ‘My wife went for lunch with neighbours and the neighbour said, “My husband’s really sorry for what happened at the World Cup”.

‘Why? Heavens, we’re still surviving. I’m still a professional footballer living an amazing life. It’s not like I’ve suffered. It’s been tough professionally and personally because your pride gets hit, but it’s a big picture.

Disdain: Mark Hughes brought in Green and then promptly signed Julio Cesar to replace him as No 1

‘The England thing was beyond football but last year was the worst year in the best part of 20 years of professional football. I’ve been in teams that have struggled but I have not sat on the side and watched a team implode or disintegrate or combust into nothing thinking “I can help”. It’s a tough experience.’

Green can scarcely hide his disdain for former QPR boss Mark Hughes, who signed him on a free transfer from West Ham in the summer of 2012 and then dropped him when Brazil international Julio Cesar suddenly arrived on £80,000 a week. Green found out only when watching Sky Sports News.

By late November QPR were bottom of the Premier League and Hughes had been sacked. But although new boss Harry Redknapp initially brought Green back into the team, the Englishman endured another four months on the sidelines before being recognised as Rangers’ No 1.

Relegation came as little surprise to Green, who had seen the warning signs in pre-season when his new club splurged almost £7m on agents’ fees alone. He is frank enough to acknowledge QPR’s problems are not over yet, either.

First choice: Harry Redknapp has reinstalled Green as his No 1 this season

Loan stars: Green's former replacement Julio Cesar is still Brazil's first choice in goal

Highly-paid 
players such as Cesar, Loic Remy and Adel Taarabt have been sent on loan
 to reduce a wage bill that is higher than that of Spanish champions and
 Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid, but the £120m bounty of 
promotion could be hit by the threat of a £62.1m fine for breaching the 
Football League’s Financial Fair Play regulations. QPR had losses of 
£65.4m last year, far in excess of the £8m allowed in the second tier.

Green
 said: ‘We sat in pre-season and there was me, Shaun Derry, Clint Hill, 
Jamie Mackie, Heidar Helguson and we said, “There will be a week at one 
point in the season and we’ll all be there and we’ll know we’re in 
trouble”. The guys who come-and-go came and went. We played a game in 
December and we were all playing and we realised we were bang in it 
because something was going terribly wrong.

‘There
 are people at the club who are still fighting fires and, come the 
summer, will have a lot of headaches because of previous decisions. You 
have a group of guys that have gone out on loan and are coming back and 
won’t want to be at the club.

Fees: Tony Fernandes and the club are facing fines of £60m for breaking Financial Fair Play

‘I’m not 
picking on people but you look at a guy like Adel who has gone to AC 
Milan. If we get promoted does he want to come to a Premier League scrap
 when he has cruised through a Serie A season? People like Loic. Does he
 want to take a step backwards or sideways?

‘Some of these guys have got their own agendas and, regardless of Saturday’s outcome, you need to draw the line somewhere.’

It
 feels like Green has drawn a line under England, too, although he 
insists he will ‘never say never’. He has not been involved since June 
2012 but has no expectations of that changing while he plays in the 
Championship.

‘This season was never going to be about getting into a World Cup squad,’ he said. ‘It was always going to be about playing football regularly again. To go beyond that is folly, really, because you’re wasting effort and energy.’

Fabio Capello’s predecessor, Steve McClaren, will be in the opposition’s dugout next week, prompting Green to issue a blunt assessment of his experience with England during the Derby manager’s reign. ‘None,’ he says.

Time, age and experience seem to have brought a clearer sense of perspective to this engaging, erudite footballer.
