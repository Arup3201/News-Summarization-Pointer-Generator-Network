By day, Abi Steel is a sharp-suited queen of the boardroom whose tenacity and talent have brought her enviable success as an international educational consultant.

But at home, the 32-year-old mother is the epitome of an old-fashioned wife, ensuring the house runs like clockwork. Still, there's one daily ritual she adamantly refuses to take part in - eating with her husband, Tristan.

'I've made a very calculated decision to limit the times we sit and eat together. It's just so unappealing,' she says.

Worried she'll look unattractive: Abi doesn't want her husband to see her eating

'I want my husband always to find me attractive, and munching away in front of him is the last thing he needs to see.'

Instead, Abi, from Newbury, Berkshire, dines with their four children: Lewis, 12, Alliyah, 11, Verity, eight, and Jessica, six.

Abi, a slender size 10, says her attitude towards food had been set long before she met Tristan. The daughter of a teacher and a policeman, she had it drummed into her from an early age that her attractiveness was inextricably linked to what and how she ate.

'Eating cereal is a particular problem,' she says. 'The noise is simply unbearable. Corn on the cob is even worse - messily eating with your fingers makes you so unappealing.

'It's a relief not to have to eat with Tristan and also that he is happy to dine while I sit and chat to him.

'At the weekends, when we do eat together as a family, I will only eat a small portion - half a chicken breast and a few vegetables - so I still look elegant and self-controlled.'

But surely an intimate dinner as a couple is one of life's pleasures? There is something delicious about sharing an indulgent pudding with your partner, and men often comment that they find a hearty appetite appealing in a woman.

Not Tristan. He is grateful that Abi largely keeps the unedifying business of eating away from his gaze - and appreciates her constant efforts to keep her weight in check.

'It shows she cares about how she behaves in front of me; too many women don't. She doesn't make a big issue out of it and is very discreet. I would find it unattractive to see Abi tucking into huge portions or unhealthy meals.'

Dr Jessamy Hibberd, a chartered clinical psychologist and author of several books about our relationships with food, says it's surprisingly common for women to feel uneasy dining in front of their partner. 

Discreet: Abi is happy to eat in the kitchen away from her husband's eyes

'We are socially conditioned to feel negative about our bodies, even when we're slim, which naturally makes us self-conscious about what we are seen to eat,' she explains.

'Many of us use food as a means of communicating something about ourselves - ordering a salad or refusing chocolate, for example, makes us think that others will be impressed by our restraint. We fear being judged and that our choices reflect not just our figures but also our personalities.'

Abi has been self-disciplined from her first date with Tristan, 38, a company director - inconveniently, at a steak restaurant in Portsmouth, where she opted for a light chicken dish and side salad.

'I ordered a panna cotta for dessert but ate just two small mouthfuls before declaring that although it was delicious, I was full. To me, that portrayed femininity.

'I behave in exactly the same way in front of my friends and so do they. I can't remember the last time one of them ordered something masculine such as pie or chips.'

Although Abi may surreptitiously enjoy a biscuit with a cup of tea if she's on her own, in the evening she will lay just one setting at the dining table. 

'I'm happy watching Tristan eat a manly steak or large portions. I do all the cooking in our household, and consider feeding him well as another way of showing that I care.'

Melanie Carson's fear of dining with her doctor husband Matthew, 43, however, is inextricably linked to gaining almost two stone since they met five years ago.

The 35-year-old blog editor has gone from a petite size 8 to a 12 and is now ashamed to sit at the same dinner table as him.

'I've hardly eaten in front of Matthew since our wedding three years ago,' says Melanie, who lives in North London.

'It's had a huge impact on our social life. Last weekend, we went to our favourite French restaurant but while he tucked into three courses, the only thing I ate was a starter of fried courgettes. Not because I'm on a diet, but because I simply didn't want to appear indulgent in front of him.'

Fears looking greedy: Ali's awkwardness about eating with her husband stems from worries about her weight

Her awkwardness first manifested itself in early 2011, 18 months into their relationship, by which point she'd gained around 10lb through a mixture of contentment, work commitments and little time to exercise.

'We were wedding planning in the pub over a Sunday roast, and I'd already decided I'd order sticky toffee pudding for dessert,' she recalls. 'Then Matthew started talking about how he'd upped his gym regime ahead of the wedding and I stared down at my big plate of food, disgusted.

'How could I eat like that in front of the man I was going to marry when I was already bulging out of my clothes? Matthew's never said or done anything to make me feel self-conscious. But I've been so vocal about hating my weight gain that it seems hypocritical to then be seen eating.

'Perhaps because of his job as a psychiatrist, Matthew doesn't question my behaviour or make an issue of it, he just tells me I look great and encourages me to join a netball team or the gym.'

Only one in ten British families sit down and eat a meal together, and a fifth of those will spend fewer than ten minutes at the table

In fact, Matthew admits that he feels 'uncomfortable' when Melanie hides away to eat in the kitchen, especially when he's in the house. 'I miss seeing her looking happy and relaxed at the dinner table,' he says. 'I honestly never scrutinise Melanie's weight or what she eats. To me, she is still the beautiful woman I married.'

Although Ali Ogilvie, 35, a project manager from Shropshire, is not yet at the stage where she avoids eating in front of husband Stu, 36, a consultant in the travel industry, altogether, she empathises with Melanie's angst.

'In restaurants, I'll pick the smallest piece of bread from the basket and pass the rest to Stu, and order lean chicken instead of the juicy steak I'd prefer.

'If he's at work on a Saturday, I see that as my opportunity to eat whatever I want.'

Ali's issues also relate to her weight - she was a size 10 when she and Stu started dating in 1999 but is now a 16.

Stu, on the other hand, has always been sporty and has spent the past decade regularly running marathons. 'He has the metabolism of a horse, so eats like one,' Ali says.

Frustrated: Stu wants his wife to be happy and worry less about what she eats

Ali began feeling awkward eating in front of her husband a year after their wedding in 2003. 'I remember devouring a stack of pancakes for breakfast one morning on holiday in America, then reading on the menu that they contained 1,400 calories. I was horrified that I looked greedy in front of Stu, although he insisted he was not bothered.

'For the past decade I've tried to make sure my portions are feminine compared to Stu's because I don't want to appear greedy.'

Ali admits her willpower is part of her personality: 'I am highly organised and quite controlling so I feel like a failure because I'm not in control of my eating habits - which is why, publicly at least, I try to look like I am in control.'

Yet Stu admits his wife's private war over meal times makes him sad.

'I just want her to be happy and healthy and to eat what she truly wants to. It's frustrating to see her restricting what she eats as I know it detracts from her enjoyment of a meal.

'I think men are much easier going than we are given credit for and I don't think most men judge women on what they eat.

'There's far too much pressure on people, especially women, to look, be and eat a certain way.

'I wish Ali could find a way to balance food and physical activity so that she worries less about what she eats.

'The day we order a cheeseboard for two in a restaurant and I can sit and watch her indulge to her heart's content is one I will cherish.'
