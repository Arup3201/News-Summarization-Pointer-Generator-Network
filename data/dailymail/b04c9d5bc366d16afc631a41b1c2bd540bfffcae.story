More underwater vehicles may be used in the search for the wreckage of MH370 after a high-tech robotic submarine was forced to return to the surface by the bone-crushing water pressure close to the ocean floor.

The search area proved too deep for the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, which was sent down some 2000km north west of Perth to begin scouring the seabed for the missing Boeing 777 after no possible black box pings were detected for six days.

But just six hours into its planned 16-hour mission on the sea bed, it exceeded its maximum depth limit of 4.5km and its built-in safety feature automatically returned it to the surface.

Out of its depth: The U.S. Navy's robotic submarine  Bluefin-21 is hauled aboard the  Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield. The search area for MH370 is proving too deep for it to operate, so other vessels may now be deployed

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities were 'very confident' the four strong underwater signals that were detected were from the black boxes on Flight MH370

Now Angus Houston, the search co-ordinator, has said larger vessels may be required because some parts of the ocean floor are inaccessible to the deep water probe.

He said the possibility of more vessels is 'being looked at as we speak' during a press conference.

Meanwhile, the data Bluefin-21 had collected was analysed but 
nothing of interest was found, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. Search
 crews were hoping to send it back under water today, if weather 
conditions permit.

The autonomous underwater vehicle was 
due to scour the Ocean floor for 16 hours - but it was brought back up 
after just six hours because it had reached and then exceeded its 
maximum operational depth of 4.5km.

Any lower and the water pressure could have caused major damage to the mini submarine.

'Its built-in safety feature returned it to the surface,' the joint search committee said in a statement.

Authorities knew that any possible wreckage from Flight 370 would likely be lying at the limit of the Bluefin's dive capabilities. Deeper diving submersibles have been evaluated, but none is yet available to help. 

The Bluefin was programmed to hover 30
 meters over the seafloor as it moved through the search area, but ended
 up reaching its maximum depth, triggering the safety feature that 
returned it to the surface, the U.S. Navy said.

It wasn't damaged and is being reprogrammed to account for the inconsistencies in the seafloor's depth.

A
 safety margin would have been included in the sub's program to protect 
the device from harm if it went a bit deeper than its 4,500-meter limit,
 said Stefan Williams, a professor of marine robotics at the University 
of Sydney.

He said: 'Maybe some areas where they are doing the survey are a little bit deeper than they are expecting.

'They
 may not have very reliable prior data for the area, so they have a 
general idea. But there may be some variability on the sea floor that 
they also can't see from the surface.'

Meanwhile, officials were 
investigating an oil slick about 5.5km from the area where the last 
underwater sounds were detected, said Angus Houston, the head of a joint
 agency coordinating the search off Australia's west coast.

Crews
 have collected an oil sample and are sending it back to Perth in 
western Australia for analysis, a process that will take several days.

Mr
 Houston said it does not appear to be from any of the ships in the 
area, but cautioned against jumping to conclusions about its source.

The
 Bluefin can create a three-dimensional sonar map of any debris on the 
ocean floor. But the search in this area is more challenging because the
 seabed is covered in silt that could potentially cover part of the 
plane.

'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370

'What they're 
going to have to be looking for is contrast between hard objects, like 
bits of a fuselage, and that silty bottom,' Mr Williams said.

'With
 the types of sonars they are using, if stuff is sitting up on top of 
the silt, say a wing was there, you could likely see that ... but small 
items might sink down into the silt and be covered and then it's going 
to be a lot more challenging.'

The
 search moved below the surface after crews picked up a series of 
underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with 
signals from an aircraft's black boxes, which record flight data and 
cockpit conversations.

The
 devices emit 'pings' so they can be more easily found, but their 
batteries only last about a month and are now believed to be dead.

Australian
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said 
authorities were 'very confident' the four strong underwater signals 
that were detected were from the black boxes on Flight 370, which 
disappeared March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to 
Beijing with 239 people on board, mostly Chinese.

But
 Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public 
needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews in the 
extremely remote, deep patch of ocean.

'I
 would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the 
autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the 
aircraft wreckage,' Houston said Monday. 'It may not.'

More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared

The
 submarine takes 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to dive to
 the bottom, 16 hours to search the seafloor, two hours to return to the
 surface, and four hours to download the data.

The
 black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what 
happened to Flight 370. Investigators believe the plane went down in the
 southern Indian Ocean based on a flight path calculated from its 
contacts with a satellite and an analysis of its speed and fuel 
capacity. But they still don't know why.

On
 Tuesday, Malaysia's defense minister, Hishamuddin Hussein, pledged to 
reveal the full contents of the black boxes, if they are ever found.

'It's about finding out the truth,' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. 'There is no question of it not being released.'

Up
 to 11 planes and as many ships were on Tuesday scouring a 62,000 square
 kilometer patch of ocean about 2,200km northwest of Perth, hunting for 
any floating debris.

But
 the weeks-long surface search was expected to end in the next two days.
 Officials haven't found a single piece of debris confirmed to be from 
the plane, and Houston said the chances that any would be found have 
'greatly diminished.'
