They look as if they are the work of an artist, or at least the set for a film based on some far-away planet.

But these incredible pictures in fact show the Danxia, or 'rosy cloud', mountains near the city of Zhangye, in the Gansu province of China, captured in all their splendour in the evening light.

The mountains have been formed from reddish sandstone which over millions of years has eroded to create this alien-looking landscape.

Amazing landscape: These incredible mountains have been formed over millions of years as reddish sandstone has eroded

Popular: The area is increasingly becoming popular with tourists who enjoy walking through the colourful landscape

Out of this world: The Danxia mountains in China almost look as if they are part of some alien landscape

The colours of the mountains range from dark reds to pale blue and lively greens.

Unsurprisingly, tourists regularly visit the area to enjoy walks and boat rides through the brightly coloured scenery.

The landform is a unique type of petrographic geomorphology which is found only in China and consists of red-colored sandstones and conglomerates of largely Cretaceous age.

The landforms were included in the World Heritage List following the World Heritage Committee's 34th meeting, held in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, on August 1, 2010.

The heritage site however actually covers a range of landscapes in Southern China, of which Mount Daxia in Guangdong is the most famous.

The other five are: Mount Langshan and Mount Wanfoshan, Hunan Province; Taining and Guanzhoushan, Fujian Province; Mount Longhu and Guifeng, Jiangxi Province; Mount Chishui, Guizhou Province; and Fangyan and Mount Jianglang, Zhejiang Province.

The area consists of more than 680 stone peaks, fortresses, walls, pillars and stone bridges.

Local signs describe the area as the 'world famous UNESCO geopark of China'. Meanwhile, the area also features a number of temples on the mountains.

A river also runs through the area on which visitors are able to enjoy boat trips.
