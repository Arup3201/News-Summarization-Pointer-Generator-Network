A fire at the last remaining business blocking Tottenham’s new £400million stadium is being treated as suspicious.

Emergency services were called at around 5.15am on Tuesday and six fire engines and 35 firefighters tackled the flames at Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd, where the entire first floor and 50 per cent of the ground floor were alight. The company is based on Paxton Road, which is next to Spurs' White Hart Lane ground.

London Fire Brigade said the fire was put out at 7.52am and the cause of the blaze was under investigation.

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Half of the ground floor and the whole of the first floor were alight, but the fire is now under control.

'Crews will remain at the scene this morning damping down remaining hot spots. There are no reports of any injuries.

'Fire engines from Tottenham, Edmonton and Stoke Newington fire stations are at the scene.' 

Archway Sheet Metal is owned by Josif Josif and bills itself as the No 1 point of reference for all things stainless steel in the catering and hospitality sector, including the Archway Doner Kebab Grill and the Electric Chip Scuttle.

It is the one company standing in the way of Tottenham's local relocation to Northumberland Park, the site next to White Hart Lane, which the club hopes to redevelop by 2018. Spurs have already commissioned an engineering firm to build their new ground.

Josif has been in business for 50 years and Tottenham have been trying to buy his land for 10. The Josif family are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating. He has allegedly received threats and abuse from extreme elements of Tottenham's support.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding White Hart Lane, but the last remaining tenant was given leave to appeal to the High Court. The decision forced Spurs to admit in September that they were 'highly unlikely' to move into a new stadium for the start of the 2017-18 season. 

Spurs have confirmed they will move away from their current ground for one season when work finally begins on their new state-of-the-art 56,000-capacity stadium, which is expected to cost around £400m.

Tottenham are edging closer to agreeing a groundshare with MK Dons while work is carried out on their new stadium and are also considering the prospect of playing up to three Premier League games at Wembley.

Spurs have held formal talks with the League One outfit about the possibility of fulfilling their 2017-18 season fixtures in Milton Keynes. Stadium:mk is almost 50 miles from White Hart Lane but has good road and rail links from London and its capacity is 32,000, similar to their current home.

Wembley had been ruled out as the main temporary home for Tottenham during the construction because of a limit on the number of events that can be held there each year. Although preliminary talks were held, the stadium is limited by Brent Council to 37 events each year because of issues including noise, policing and parking.

A stadium share with Arsenal would be the most logical alternative but this has been ruled out because of the animosity that exists between supporters.

Tottenham have played at White Hart Lane since 1899, but its capacity is 36,240 and Levy is convinced the club needs a bigger stadium to generate more income and enable them to compete with the big guns in Europe.

The club previously bid to move to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, but lost out to West Ham in 2011.
