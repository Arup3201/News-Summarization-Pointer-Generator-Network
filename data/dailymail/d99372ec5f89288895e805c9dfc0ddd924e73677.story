Oklahoma City set aside some bad news off the court to beat NBA Eastern Conference leader Atlanta 123-115 on Friday, with Russell Westbrook scoring 17 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter and notching yet another triple double to steer the Thunder to an important victory.

The Thunder earlier in the day conceded that reigning league MVP Kevin Durant will probably miss the rest of the season with a foot injury, yet the team came out with an impressive performance that lifted Oklahoma City two games clear of New Orleans in the fight for the last playoff-yielding spot in the West.

The Pelicans lost ground with a defeat at league-leading Golden State, while other key results saw Memphis boost its Southwest Division lead with victory at Dallas and the Los Angeles Clippers end Washington's winning streak.

Dion Waiters matched a season high with 26 points for the Thunder, which faces an uphill task to make the playoffs without Durant.

Memphis ended a run of three-successive road losses by pulling away in the third quarter and beating Dallas 112-101.

He finished 4 for 17 for the Warriors, who improved to 55-13, the second-most wins in team history - and four shy of the franchise record.

Alexis Ajinca scored 15 points with eight rebounds for New Orleans, which played without four of its top six players, including leading scorer Anthony Davis.

Joakim Noah had 10 rebounds, equaled a career high with 14 assists and scored eight points to come within one basket of a triple-double for the Bulls, who pulled half a game ahead of the Raptors for third place in the East. They also took a 3-0 lead in the season series, assuring them the edge in any potential playoff tiebreaker.

DeMar DeRozan had 27 points for Toronto, which was without All-Star guard Kyle Lowry.

Cleveland extended its home winning streak to 15 games and officially secured a playoff spot by edging Indiana 95-92.

However, it was Cavs guard Iman Shumpert who came up with the biggest play, running down a long rebound and then knocking down two free throws with a second left.

George Hill scored 24 for the Pacers, who dropped their fourth straight and damaged their playoff hopes.
