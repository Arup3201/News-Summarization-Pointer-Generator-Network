Nobody seems to love HS2, and with good reason. It is by far the largest, and possibly the craziest, infrastructure project in British history.

It is not green. It will destroy town and country the length of the land.

It is presented as a much-needed boost for the economy, but the boost will likely come during the next boom, when such reckless public spending will seem foolish.

Elaborate plans: Former British Rail Board member Simon Jenkins says the HS2 is total waste of money

Since HS2 is ‘premium fare’, its chief beneficiaries will be existing first-class passengers out of Euston.

This may be a deserving group, but they are hardly the poor struggling masses yearning to breathe free. Yet George Osborne wants to subsidise them to the tune of £1,000 from every taxpayer in the land.

Last week the Government admitted yet another hike in HS2 spending, from £33 billion to £43 billion. The criticism became a deluge.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called it ‘complete madness’. One of her Tory members, Richard Bacon, added: ‘Everyone thinks it’s going to be £70 billion, £80 billion, £100 billion by the time it’s finished.’ That is double the present estimate.

Last month the National Audit Office declared even the existing case for the project at best unproven. The proclaimed increase in business hours was declared minimal, since people can now work on a train.

The list of HS2’s opponents would fill a page and embrace most of its original architects, such as Lord Prescott, Alistair Darling and Lord Mandelson. Prescott called it a ‘con on the north’. Mandelson admitted last week that it was always a political project, intended ‘to paint an upbeat view of the future’.

City leaders in Birmingham and Manchester supported it, but were not asked if they would prefer the money for something else, such as urban transit systems, a new trans-Pennine link or an extension to the M65.

The railway has opponents as diverse as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Socialist Workers Party, the Economist magazine and the environmentalist George Monbiot, the Engineering Employers Federation, the RAC, the Countryside Alliance, the Taxpayers Alliance and wildlife trusts galore.

In a savage letter to The Times, Adam Mills, former boss of the first Channel link, HS1, said claims being made for the new line were ‘away with the fairies’.

HS2’s friends are almost exclusively those with a political or financial interest in it. The Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, asserts that it will ‘bridge the north-south gap’ and ‘compete with China’.

Limited benefit: The plan has come under increasing criticism, with even former Labour Business Secretary Peter Mandelson warning that it could be an 'expensive mistake'

He does not explain why competing with China means avoiding the existing Euston-Midlands transport corridor and crashing through some of the loveliest country in England.

McLoughlin and the line’s chief cheerleader, Lord Adonis, deflect criticism from this geographical nonsense by claiming HS2 will at least liberate capacity on lines into Euston.

Since it is premium class, it will do so in a very limited way. Nor does the Minister explain why the train is to arrive at Euston and not link with either Heathrow or the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras.

It does not even link to London’s new Crossrail. The ‘train of the future’ will reach neither of London’s international transport hubs.

I served on the British Rail Board in the 1990s. Every investment battle was between glamour projects that appealed to Ministers and the mundane needs of passengers.

The railway was still only half electrified and much of its signalling was Victorian, yet time and money were exhausted on building a tilting train that never worked.

Every train pundit knows that the quickest and cheapest way to increase capacity is to re-engineer platforms, signals and rolling stock. The 2012 Atkins report on alternatives to HS2 (now forgotten) showed that redeveloping Euston could deliver a cost-benefit ratio of one to four – twice the benefit of HS2.

Threat: The Cheshire countryside where the proposed HS2 link between London and Manchester may run

Britain’s conventional railway desperately needs investment. It is shaming, long after most of the rest of Europe is electrified, that diesels still leave Paddington for the west country and chug round most of the feeder lines on the network.

Cross-country services into Wales are dire. If McLoughlin wants to reduce overloading, he should look at the commuter lines in the Bristol area, in Lancashire and in Yorkshire. Yet he is blowing the lion’s share of rail investment for 20 years on a well-heeled group at Euston.

To oppose HS2 is not to be nimbyist, much as some Ministers like to see things that way. There is no overriding national interest in tearing up open countryside when other means of transport are available.

There are 100 more productive uses for £50 billion of infrastructure spending. New motorways would deliver four to five times more economic benefit than HS2.

The parallel is exact with Concorde in the 1970s, a high-profile project that played to Harold Wilson’s high-tech obsession. Its backer was Tony Benn, who fought against all attempts to kill it at birth, musing recently on the BBC that ‘it will always be an icon’.

Concorde was a taxpayer gift to the rich, a classic French-style grand project intended to yield political glory. Benn made it fly over the cabinet room to give his friends an exhilarating bang – the most expensive bang in history.

Concern: Simon Jenkins says that claims for the line are 'away with the fairies'

High-speed trains are for long distances. Britain’s compact geography and the need for frequent train stops make speed less critical to journey times. Fast trains are also energy inefficient, necessitating an estimated 60 per cent more carbon than ordinary trains because, unlike in France, we have little benefit of nuclear power. 

Even in France the TGVs are losing their glamour. They have led French railways into £34 billion of debt. A halt has been called to new lines and SNCF has announced it will redirect investment to high-volume commuter lines.

Modern rail passengers in a country such as Britain want comfort and reliability rather than marginally faster journeys. Time spent in trains is no longer seen as wasted. A wise railway goes for many small investments, not one big one.

This leaves the intriguing question, if the case for HS2 is so weak, how does it survive?

The answer was given by David Cameron in opposition. He warned that special interest lobbying ‘has tainted our politics for too long,’ and needed curbing. He has not curbed it.

Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent by taxpayers on HS2, meaning a list of consultancies and contractors that is almost as long as that of the line’s opponents.

These lobbyists have open access to Whitehall, to ask Ministers for ever more in the trough. George Osborne usually resists calls to spend public money. But curiously enough, when the HS2 lobby arrives in Whitehall, his smile is wide and his pockets are deep. That is what Cameron was talking about, once.
