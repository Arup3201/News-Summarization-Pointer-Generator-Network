Napoli have signed Michu on a season-long loan deal, almost certainly bringing an end to the Spaniard’s two-year spell in Wales.

The Italian club will also hold an option to sign the forward permanently at the end of the season, with an agreed fee believed to be in the region of £8million.

Sportsmail understands Napoli will pay a loan fee in excess of £1m for a 28-year-old who proved to be a remarkable success in the year that followed his £2.2m signing from Rayo Vallecano in 2012.
