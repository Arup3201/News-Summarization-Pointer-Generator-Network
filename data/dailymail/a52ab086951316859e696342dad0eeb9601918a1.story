Tainted drugs likely caused the deaths of 14 women in India and left dozens more in critical condition following botched sterilisation operations, according to an Indian health official.

Police have closed six factories in the impoverished central state of Chhattisgarh today and arrested the owners after they were caught producing Indian-brand ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin.

Both drugs have been banned under state law, and both were given to the women shortly after they were operated on, just before they started vomiting and fell ill.

R K. Gupta, the Indian doctor arrested today for running the sterilisation 'camp', has denied claims his rusty tools infected the women, and instead blames the drugs he was given.

Gupta said he was under pressure from the state  to perform the operations. He also blamed the drugs used

Speaking from his cell he said that some of the sick women had been treated at a second, separate camp, proving that he is not to blame.

He said: 'I am not the culprit. I have been made a scapegoat. It is the administration which is responsible for this incident.' 

Raman Singh, state chief minister, said: 'Owners of the companies responsible for the sale of drugs have been summoned. They will all be questioned and we have sealed their factories.'

State health officials said police raided a local company, Mahawar Pharma, which had provided the antibiotics. The company's director, Sumit Mahawar, declined to comment 

Postmortem examinations have so far failed to reveal the cause of death, and medics have requested chemical analysis be carried out to give them a fuller picture.

Earlier today protesters burned tyres and clashed with riot police in angry demonstrations in India over the state-run sterilisation camp. 

Family members claim the women were 'herded like cattle' into the camp after being forced to take part in the programme aimed at curbing India's booming population.

In another disturbing development, it emerged a woman died after a second sterilisation camp was held in the same state despite the death toll mounting from the first clinic two days earlier.

Dr R. K Gupta was seized for questioning amid mounting anger over the tragedy in central Chhattisgarh state where women were paid to undergo a procedure.

'He has been taken into custody. He will be produced in the court in the afternoon today. He is likely to be arrested soon after,' police inspector general Pawan Deo said from Bilaspur.   

SK Mandal, the chief medical officer in central Chhattisgarh state where the operations were performed, said the surgeon was arrested at a relative's house after he had gone into hiding.

According to Dr Mandal, Gupta performed more than 80 sterilisation procedures in six hours - a breach of government protocol which prohibits surgeons from performing more than 30 in a day.

Dr Mandal said investigators were trying to determine whether the women, all of them poor villagers, had been given tainted medicine during their time at the 'health camp'. 

The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure on Monday after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked. 

Fourteen have died and 16 are fighting for their lives.  

Police said they were planning to seize equipment used during the operations by Gupta amid fears that it was contaminated.

Gupta said he was under pressure from the state government to perform the operations, while also blaming the drugs used.

'It was not my fault - the administration pressured me to meet targets,' the doctor was quoted by NDTV as saying as he was being detained on Wednesday night.

He said that all the patients began throwing up and complaining of dizziness and weakness after they were given medication following the operations. 

'The surgeries went well but the problem was with the medicines given to the women,' he also alleged. 

'I have been performing surgeries for a long time and there has never been any problem.' 

Gupta, who says he has conducted more than 50,000 such operations, denied that his equipment was rusty or dirty and said it was the government's duty to control the number of people that turned up at his family-planning 'camp'. 

'It is up to the administration to decide how many women would be kept for operation,' a visibly upset Gupta told Reuters from the police station where he is being held in custody. 

He faces charges of causing death by negligence.

'If they kept in that place 83 women, it is my moral responsibility to operate (on) all the women.

'If I decline to do that I would have faced public agitation,' said Gupta, who was awarded a state honour 10 years ago for his sterilisation work. 

The state government has banned the sale of six drugs used during the operations over concerns they were substandard, the Press Trust of India news agency said. 

The doctor carried out 83 operations in just five hours on the impoverished women, who were paid 1,400 rupees ($23) at a state-run camp in Bilaspur district at the weekend. 

Relatives today claimed they had been pressured into accepting the money, the equivalent of half a month's salary for a manual labourer.

'They herded them like cattle,' Mahesh Suryavanshi, the brother-in-law of one casualty, told the Indian Express newspaper, according to the Guardian.

'The [health workers] said nothing would happen, it was a minor operation.' 

Sadhu, the husband of one woman who died, added: 'I hope that he can never sleep in peace. 

'The same thing should happen to him. Then he will know what it is like to lose someone in your family.'

The government has suspended four health officials and ordered an investigation into the deaths.

In the state capital of Raipur, angry protesters also took to the streets demanding the chief minister's resignation.  

News of a death at a second camp held after several deaths from the first will also increase pressure on authorities in the poverty-stricken Indian state.

The Guardian reported that a woman died after surgery in the Chhattisgarh which was carried out even after several deaths had been reported from the first.   

Experts say the deaths are the result of a lack of medical oversight and the fact that the government in India sets sterilisation targets as part of its efforts to stabilise the population.

India's government had said it stopped setting targets for sterilising women in the 1990s, but doctors and human rights workers have alleged for years that targets exist, leading to coercion in villages where most people have limited access to education and health care. 

Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities. 

Lalit Mohan Pant, a surgeon who claims to have carried out the highest number of sterilisations in the world, defended the use of quotas as necessary to motivate government employees.

Pant, who lives in central India, holds the record for sterilising 816 people in one day and says he has sterilised over 330,000 patients in all. 'I am doing god's work,' he said.
