Daniel Sturridge isn't sorry to see the back of Luis Suarez, claims former Liverpool midfielder Jason McAteer.

The controversial Suarez, now at Barcelona and serving a ban for biting, formed a lethal striking partnership with the England man last season.

The duo netted a combined 55 goals to fire Liverpool to an unexpected second place in the Premier League.

But McAteer, who played for the Merseyside club between 1995 and 1999, believes Sturridge won't be missing his former partner in crime.

'I don't think they got on. Put it this way, I don't think they went out for dinner with one another,' McAteer told the Daily Star.

'They worked well as a partnership but it was a love-hate relationship.

'Sometimes one would shoot instead of passing to the other, the next time it might be the other way round.

'They were probably trying to outdo each other and score more than the other - but it worked for Liverpool.'

Sturridge won't be in action for Brendan Rodgers' side this week in the Capital One Cup against Middlesbrough.

The England striker has been out of action since pulling up with a thigh injury while on international duty earlier this month.
