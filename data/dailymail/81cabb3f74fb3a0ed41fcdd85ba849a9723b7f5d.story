Quentin Letts tried six  versions of the Christmas pudding from different supermarkets 

For many of us it is — along with the Queen’s television address at 3pm — the defining moment of Christmas Day: the arrival of the pudding!

At a signal from the kitchen, everyone round the dining table falls silent. The dog whimpers and takes cover.

Dad pours the heated brandy. Lights a match. Whoosh. Shades of napalm in the Vietnam war as the brandy catches fire and Mum asks a black-faced Dad: ‘Do you think you poured too much, dear?’

But seriously, here she comes, folks, here comes the great, black beauty of a pudding, a flaming, round mound of dark deliciousness with a sprig of (now rather singed-looking) holly protruding from its summit and dollops of brandy butter just waiting to melt down its flank.

Yum yum yum. Or, quite often, yuck, particularly from younger members of my family. They groaned when I told them we were to ‘test-drive’ Christmas puds from six of the big supermarkets.

‘But I HATE Christmas pudding,’ wailed Honor, 11. She soon changed her mind when I mentioned that anyone trying the puddings could have a small glass of pudding wine, a pleasing Jurancon.

Honor likes pudding wine. She relented and joined our pudding panel.

I always loved Christmas pud as a child — and I still do. Perhaps that tells you I am a natural gourmand, or perhaps it started thanks to financial greed — our Christmas puds always had sixpences hidden in them. Ah, the good old days before decimalisation.

My own children, particularly the girls, have been slower to appreciate the annual ‘treat’ of sultanas, raisins, currants, nuts, orange peel and so forth. But maybe we were buying the wrong sort. Maybe we could find a supermarket pudding that would convert them.

Actually, for the past couple of years I have made my own Christmas puds, and I thought they were fantastic: oozing wetness with fat from the suet.

We did the proper thing of making them on ‘Stir-Up Sunday’ just before Advent and adding interesting pieces of dried fruit, sloshings of brandy, all stiffened with breadcrumbs and given some colour with liquid Camp Coffee.

Our mission for the Mail, however, was to try supermarket puddings.

We bought roughly the same size puds (450g or about 1lb, enough to serve four) from Messrs Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, the Co-op, Tesco and Aldi.

Prices ranged from £2.50 (Morrisons) to £4 (Tesco), but we cheated slightly on the latter because Tesco had an offer on its ‘Finest’ line, and we thought we would be extravagant.

The top of the puds was Waitrose's 'richly fruited' Christmas pudding, according to the Letts family 

In second place, the Co-op's offering was 'nice and alcoholic' and 'a good all-rounder' (pictured)

After all, it had been stewed in Courvoisier cognac for nine months and had some flowery description on the box about how it had been made by ‘specialists who have been making Christmas puddings for 100 years’. It promised to be a ‘wonderfully rich, moist pudding’.

Tesco was not the only supermarket that had employed wordsmiths. Aldi described its pud as ‘richly decadent’ (decadence at £2.99!) while the Co-op’s had been ‘matured for six months’. That’s longer than many a prison sentence these days.

My tasting panel was: my mother Jocelyn, 80; my wife Lois; and children Claud, 17, Eveleen, 16, and the reluctant Honor.

I should declare now that I sometimes write theatre reviews for a Waitrose magazine but this was a blind tasting, conducted to standards of impartiality that would not disgrace the Electoral Commission itself.

I cooked the puddings in a microwave borrowed specially for the occasion — I normally avoid such machines, but the prospect of steaming six puddings in a bain marie for one-and-a-half hours each was unappealing.

Three minutes of microwaving did the trick — ping! — though by the end of the process the kitchen did smell faintly of burnt plastic. Not quite the desired effect, really.

First out of the traps was Morrisons’ ‘rich, mixed fruit pudding with cider and rum’, a steal at £2.50. It plopped from its container looking dark and just a little sinister. Was this a Christmas pud or a lump of lava from the slopes of Etna? More than one of the panel thought it was rubbery.

‘Sticky and boring,’ said Honor. ‘Dry,’ thought Claud, reaching for some pudding wine. ‘Wouldn’t cross the road for it,’ said Lois. Eveleen pulled a face. Oh dear.

Next! Enter Sainsbury’s Christmas pudding, £3. It glistened pleasingly when it emerged from its container. Everyone took a teaspoonful.

This one was laced with cider and that certainly found favour with the 17-year-old boy. Looking at the label I noticed it had the ‘V’ sign meaning ‘suitable for veggies’.

Palm oil had been used instead of proper suet. And so, as we looked at the ingredients labels, did it prove for all the puds. Not a single one used animal suet.

Vegetarians will see this as progress, but I am not convinced the culinary gods will be so pleased.

Morrison's was 'sticky and boring' with Quentin's wife saying she 'wouldn't cross the road for it'

Disaster struck with pudding number three, which was Waitrose’s ‘richly fruited’ offering at £3.75.

When I turned the container I did not quite do so quickly enough.

The pudding, which was juicier than its rivals, slid out at an angle — whoaa! — and disintegrated when I tried to put it upright with a metal spatula. It looked like a pile of rubble after a landslide.

Image is not everything, however, and this one was the first to meet with ‘mmmns’ and ‘ahhhs’ of approval from our panel as it slid down the hatch.

It tasted expensive and quite nutty. Lois liked the ‘toffeeish, chewy bits’. Claud said it was ‘more fruity’.

‘Different,’ thought Honor, and for the first time she was not making pretend-gagging gestures at her throat. We had a hit of sorts on our hands at last.

Could the Co-op Christmas pudding at £3 match the Waitrose landslide? It certainly held together better, but I think the Waitrose collapse was basically down to cook’s incompetence.

‘More boozy than the first three,’ thought Jocelyn. ‘Nice and alcoholic,’ said a smiling 11-year-old. ‘Good all-rounder,’ said Lois.

Our waistlines fast expanding (even vegetarian Christmas pudding is not slimming, my dears), we turned to our fifth candidate, Tesco’s Christmas pudding with Courvoisier cognac, English cider, amontillado sherry, French brandy, ruby port and brandy-soaked cherries. All for £4. Hic!

This was certainly the booziest of the puds. Perhaps Tesco’s chefs were trying to improve morale at their company after recent profit warnings.

Bottom of the pudding pile: Aldi's offering was 'spectacularly disgusting', according to Quentin Letts 

My wife had to go and play at a Christingle church service after our tasting session and confessed to the vicar that she was ‘drunk in charge of an organ’.

She blamed the Tesco pud, but the Jurancon may also have been responsible.

The Tesco offering had a springy texture (‘dry’, grumbled Jocelyn and Claud) and was paler in colour than some. Honor thought it ‘hard to get into’, which made it sound like the Garrick Club.

Both she and her sister said the amount of booze was ‘overpowering’. One for adults’ palates, perhaps.

Finally, we approached the Aldi Christmas pudding, £2.99. It is always bad luck to go last, perhaps, but I thought this was easily the nastiest of the lot. It seemed to taste chiefly of plastic.

What do you get a cookbook addict for Christmas? If they’ve already got Jamie, Nigella, Delia and Gordon, and they’re short on space, Penguin has the perfect present.

Cookery Postcards From Penguin is a box of 100 cards reproducing classic covers from the publisher’s archives.

Some of the titles are a hoot: there’s the Cookery For Men Only book with an image of a hapless man chopping a carrot with a pair of scissors, and The Reluctant Cook, which shows a stereotypical 1950s housewife lying on the sofa, smoking a cigarette and drinking a cocktail while ignoring the dinner sizzling on the hob.

Elsewhere, be grateful we are past the post-War days of Ambrose Heath’s Good Dishes From Tinned Foods.

‘Scented,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Plasticky,’ declared Honor. Eveleen quite liked it. So did our Patterdale terrier, Bonnie. She had most of my spoonful.

It had the texture of melted lorry tyre. Really spectacularly disgusting, in my opinion.

The only way I could get rid of the taste was to have a clementine from a big box we bought from Aldi at the same time as we bought the pud.

Our judges’ verdict, in ascending order (i.e., starting with the worst) was: Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Co-op, Waitrose.

The last three were certainly worth their place on your Christmas table, but I would still place my home-made puds in a higher class.

These, you see, are properly sinful: they are made with real suet.

And come the day itself, my daughters agree, they will try my proper pud — provided they can wash it down with some more Jurancon.
