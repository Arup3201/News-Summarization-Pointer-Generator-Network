A ten-year-old Jack Russell called Jake was rescued from a 165ft-high cliff face after spending two days stuck on a ledge.

The dog fell over the edge of a chalk cliff at an old quarry, which overlooks a residential street in Chafford Hundred, Essex, and landed on a narrow ledge about 30ft from the top.

The animal spent two days on the cliff face before its barks were eventually heard by nearby residents.

Fire crews spent four hours rescuing the animal yesterday and managed to retrieve it after firefighters were lowered down to the ledge on ropes and coaxed it to safety with food.

Incident commander John Harris, of Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Jake was trapped on a small ledge about 10 metres from the top of the cliff.

'It's a sheer drop of about 50 metres so he was in a bit of a predicament.

'Neighbours told us that he's been on there for a couple of days at least because they've heard him barking and yelping.

'The team used lines to lower themselves down the cliff to the ledge Jake was on.

'They had a basket to put Jake in and bring him back up.'

He added: 'At first Jake was scared and backed away from them but they had taken some food with them and they used that to coax him over and get him in the box.

'He had been there for a few days and was very hungry but didn't appear to be too worse for wear following his ordeal.'

The animal was checked over by a vet and is now in the hands of the RSPCA which is trying to find the dog's owner.

The RSPCA said: 'We were able to take the dog to a local vet and fortunately other than being shaken up and cold he seemed to be fine and is currently being checked over.

'We would always advise people to be careful when walking their dogs near cliffs and to keep them on the lead if there is any risk of danger.'
