A man who fell from a hotel balcony and froze to death overnight had been sleepwalking, his family believe.

Rob Williams, 27, who had been a sleepwalker since he was young, had gone to the hotel with colleagues following a work party when he fell about 13ft.

The building surveyor was found suffering from severe hypothermia on a roof outside an unoccupied first-floor room the following afternoon when he failed to show up for work. He spent five days in intensive care but died on Christmas Day without regaining consciousness.

Yesterday his girlfriend of four 
years, Carla Hilton, wrote on Facebook: 'I am completely lost without 
you. When my phone beeps, I hope with all that I have that it is you.

'When a door opens, my heart races to see if it is you. With every minute
 that goes by, I think of you, talk about you, cry because I need you.'

Mr
 Williams's sister Kirsty Ashby, 30, revealed that her brother had 
climbed out of a window on to a balcony at the De Vere Theobalds Park 
hotel in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, before falling.

He
 was taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, then 
transferred to Basildon Hospital. Doctors warned his family that he was 
unlikely to live but, incredibly, he started to show signs of progress.

But
 brain tests showed that he was not going to recover and on Christmas 
Day his family decided to turn off his life-support machine.

A
 post-mortem examination revealed Mr Williams, from Chelmsford, Essex, 
died from brain injuries caused as a complication of suffering from 
severe hypothermia. It is not known if he was knocked out in the fall or
 simply stayed asleep.

His 
sister, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, confirmed that Mr Williams had
 been a sleepwalker since he was young and his family believe he had 
been sleepwalking when he fell.

She
 said: 'We knew Rob sleepwalked but I don't think any of us knew how bad
 it was â€“ it's only been from talking to his friends that we realised 
the extent of it.

'It had 
never caused him any problems before.' She added: 'My parents are 
struggling to take it all in. It has been an awful time for us all.' Of 
her brother, she said: 'He was a really fun guy, someone you would 
always look forward to seeing.'

Mr
 Williams was not a guest at the luxury Georgian mansion but had gone 
back there with colleagues who were staying at the hotel following their
 Christmas party.

He and two
 colleagues stayed in a room and, the following morning, they initially 
thought he had gone to work. Concerns were raised when he didn't show 
up. Hertfordshire Police are treating the death as non-suspicious. A 
file has been passed to the coroner.
