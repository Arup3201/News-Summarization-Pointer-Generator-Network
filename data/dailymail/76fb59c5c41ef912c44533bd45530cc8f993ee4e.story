The St Louis Rams used their special teams to surprising effect to knock off the defending Super Bowl champions Seattle Seahawks 28-26 on Sunday.

Early on, Benny Cunningham's 75-yard kick-off return set up Tre Mason's opening touchdown, and Stedman Bailey's 90-yard touchdown run on a trick return put the Rams up 21-3.

Russell Wilson led a Seattle rally, passing for two touchdowns and 313 yards while rushing for another 106, but they came up short and the Rams put the game away after Johnny Hekker's 18-yard pass to Cunningham on a fake punt.
