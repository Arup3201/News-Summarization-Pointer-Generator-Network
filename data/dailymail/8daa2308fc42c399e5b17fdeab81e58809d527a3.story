New demands: Ed Miliband has listed six criteria the Government needs to fulfill for Labour to support military action

A divided Labour party yesterday issued a tortured statement on Syria, claiming David Cameron had failed to produce ‘compelling evidence’ showing the Assad regime had deployed chemical weapons.

Throwing the Government’s plans for a vote on imminent missile attacks into chaos, Ed Miliband’s party did not come out and oppose intervention, but claimed any action would have to meet six gruelling criteria which could take weeks to fulfil.

An amendment released last night by Labour fell well short of the Government’s conviction that dictator Bashar al-Assad had used poison gas on his own people - simply condemning his ‘killing of hundreds of civilians’.

A day after Mr Miliband said he would consider backing a ‘limited’ use of force, the party changed its position by saying they would not agree until they saw ‘compelling evidence’ chemical weapons were used by Assad’s forces.

They said they needed to see a full report by the United Nations weapons inspectors and for this report to be voted on by the UN Security Council.

They further demand a ‘clear basis in international law’ for involvement and a vote in parliament on action, which they insisted had to be ‘legal, proportionate, time-limited and have precise and achievable objectives designed to deter the future use of prohibited chemical weapons.’

These demands were then echoed in the Government motion which was released last night ahead of today’s vote.

Mr Miliband who was briefed on the military intelligence from Syria in Downing Street on Tuesday, backtracked amid growing turmoil within his party over the prospect intervention in the civil war-ravaged country and accusations it could drag Britain into an Iraq-style quagmire.

A senior Labour source summed up the 
party’s position as: ‘We have essentially reached a decision that we 
cannot give the Prime Minister a blank cheque tomorrow’.

A
 member of the shadow cabinet accused Mr Miliband of having ‘slammed 
into reverse gear’ after being told he was moving too quickly.

One
 member of his frontbench, public health minister Diane Abbott, said she
 would consider resigning over if forced to support an intervention that
 was not ‘legal’.

Miss Abbott, who voted against the Iraq War, broke 
ranks yesterday to say: ‘At the moment, I can’t see anything that would 
make me vote for intervention in Syria.’

In
 an outspoken interview she argued against Britain being ‘stampeded into
 action, warning against ‘delivering military punishment beatings’ and 
said there was no reason to believe military strikes would be legal, or 
would do anything to ‘stop Assad fighting to the last Syrian.’

‘Essentially it’s a civil war’, she said. ‘What Libya and Egypt have taught us is that these situations in the Middle East are complex. It’s not good guys in white hats and bad guys in black hats’.

‘The danger is we get dragged into an open ended involvement in a Syrian civil war....the truth is the British people have seen this movie, they know how it ends and that’s why the public is two to one against bombing Syria’

Mr Miliband, who told David Cameron this week that intervention in Syria had to be ‘limited’, yesterday went further insisting on waiting for the report by the small team of chemical weapons specialists who have begun inspections in Ghutah, in the east of Syria on Monday and will be there until at least tomorrow.

Not only will their report need to be scrutinised by the Security Council but it will have to be voted on by them - despite the fact Assad’s backers, Russia and China are among its five permanent members.

Mr Miliband’s amendment went even further to confirm ‘such action relates solely to efforts to deter the use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any wider action in Syria.’
