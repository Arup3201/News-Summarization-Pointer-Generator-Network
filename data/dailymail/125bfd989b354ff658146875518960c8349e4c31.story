A wife who saw her husband killed by Mexican drug cartels as they jet-skied together on the Texas border has spoken of her relief after a crime boss was arrested over the murder.

Tiffany Hartley was with her husband David Hartley on Lake Falcon when he was shot in the back of the head in 2010 by a gang who approached them in boats.

Police in Mexico on Saturday rounded up the drug cartel boss believed to be responsible for the killing Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo, a Zetas cartel leader is known as 'Commander Squirrel.'

He has been linked to numerous crimes, such as the escape of 151 prisoners in 2010 from a jail in the city of Nuevo Laredo and the recent flight of 131 prisoners in the city of Piedras Negras.

Escobedo was also wanted for his alleged role in the September 2010 killing of David Hartley on Falcon Lake, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Mexican Navy said in a statement: 'Squirrel is credited with being the mastermind of the deaths of 72 undocumented migrants in San Fernando.

'[He] is the alleged perpetrator of the narco graves found in Tamaulipas state, with more than 200 bodies and the execution of more than 50 people by his own hand in different parts of the republic, [as well as] the murder of David Hartley, an American citizen killed at Falcon Dam on September 30, 2010.'

Grief: Tiffany Hartley, speaking from her La Salle, Colorado home on Monday, said she hoped that Escobedo could lead authorities to her husband's remains

When asked if she had confidence that Mexican authorities arrested the man responsible for her husband's death, Tiffany Hartley said: 'It's really hard to really feel like this is going to be the final, but at the same time we're very hopeful that it will because we want some closure as a family.'

She said she was hoping for more details on how Martinez might be linked to her husband's death and also for information on where her husband's remains are so the family can move forward.

'But that's what we're really looking for is: What is his link to David and does he know where David's body is?' said Hartley, who lives in La Salle, Colorado.

She told cops that they had been riding jet skis to take photos of an old church on the Mexican side of the lake when her husband was shot in the back of the head.

Couple: David and Tiffany Hartley were high school sweethearts, and had been married for eight years when tragedy struck in 2010

She said that the couple - who had been high school sweethearts and married for eight years â€“ were fired upon by pirates in three speed boats.

Mrs Hartley said she could not pull her husband on to her jet ski and had to leave him lying face down in the water as she fled the gunshots.

Mr Hartley's body was never found.

The investigation into Mr Hartley's 
death was a dealt a blow in October of 2010 when Mexico's lead 
investigator, Rolando Flores, was decapitated.

Mr Flores's severed head was delivered in a suitcase to a military post near the border with Texas.Falcon Lake has been the scene of drug-related violence for years.

Escobedo is also accused of murder in that case.

Vergara said Martinez was captured in Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo, Texas. He was shown to reporters on Monday.

In custody: Mexican authorities had posted a $1million reward for the capture of Martinez, a Zetas drug cartel leader

The navy said Martinez is also a suspect in dozens of killings of people who were buried in mass graves at the same site of the 2010 massacre of migrants.

Nearly 200 bodies were discovered in April 2011 in the town of San Fernando, close to the U.S. border.

Those two crimes have been the most fatalities since Mexico's federal government launched an armed offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.

Mexican authorities had posted a $1million reward for Martinez.
