Stolen: Websites are offering illegally obtained credit card information

Stolen credit card details can be bought online for less than the price of a bag of chips, it has been revealed.

There are more than 150 websites offering illegally obtained information, according to government research.

Many of them offer for sale details belonging to between 20,000 and 100,000 people worldwide at any one time - charging as little as 70p.

The director of Britain's biggest 
intelligence agency has also revealed that cyber-attacks on individuals,
businesses and the government have reached 'disturbing' levels.

Iain Lobham, of the government's 
national intelligence centre, GCHQ, warned that sensitive data had been 
targeted and that the 'UK's continued economic well-being' was under 
threat.

He said sensitive data on government computers had been targeted, along with defence, technology and engineering firms' designs.

He
revealed there had been 'one significant (but unsuccessful) attempt on 
the Foreign Office and other government departments this summer'.

Mr Lobham's comments in an article for The Times come ahead of a two-day London conference on cyber-security starting tomorrow.

'The volume of e-crime and attacks on government and industry systems continues to be disturbing,' he wrote.

'I
can attest to attempts to steal British ideas and designs - in the IT, 
technology, defence, engineering and energy sectors, as well as other 
industries - to gain commercial advantage or to profit from secret 
knowledge of contractual arrangements.

'Such intellectual property theft doesn't just cost the companies concerned, it represents an attack on the UK's continued economic well-being'.

The conference aims to bring together 
political leaders, such as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and EU 
digital supremo Neelie Kroes, with leading cyber security experts and 
technology entrepreneurs such as Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Cisco
vice-president Brad Boston.

The Ministry of Defence foiled more than 1,000 cyber attacks in the past year from criminals and foreign intelligence services.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told the 
newspaper there had been an 'exponential rise' in incidents, with 
systems such as welfare and tax databases 'liable to attack'.

'Countries
that cannot maintain cyber security of their banking system, of the 
intellectual property of their companies, will be at a serious 
disadvantage in the world,' Mr Hague added.

Mr Lobham called for an inclusive approach to address the problem, adding: 'We are witnessing the development of a global criminal market place - a parallel black economy where cyber dollars are traded in exchanged for UK citizens' credit card details'

Mr Hague 
revealed in February that computers belonging to the government had 
been infected with the 'Zeus' computer virus after users opened an 
e-mail purporting to come from the White House and followed a link.

He said cyberspace was providing 'rich pickings' with UK defence contractors also being targeted.

In January, three Foreign Office staff were sent an email apparently from another colleague.

However, Mr Hague said, the email was 'from a hostile state intelligence agency' and contained 'code embedded in the attached document that would have attacked their machine'.

The vast majority of critical infrastructure in the UK is privately owned.

Leading think-tank Chatham House criticised the government for failing to protect critical systems from cyber-attack adding that there had been a reluctance from  the government to share information with the private companies that might be targeted.

The government says it ranks cyber security as a top priority. Last year it announced £650m of additional funding to help tackle computer-based threats.

Around £130m is specifically earmarked for critical infrastructure projects.
