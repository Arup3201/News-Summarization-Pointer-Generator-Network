A mixed boarding school is being investigated by police over claims that at least ten girls were sexually abused by other pupils.

The allegations emerged during a tribunal which heard that a 15-year-old autistic girl was groomed and raped at Stanbridge Earls School in Romsey, Hampshire.

The victim’s mother claims there was a ‘predatory ring’ and said behaviour among children was ‘like something out of Lord of the Flies’.

It was also alleged that a 12-year-old
 girl was stripped naked by five pupils and, on another occasion, 
assaulted in woodland.

The claims of abuse at the school, which 
specialises in helping children with learning difficulties and where 
fees are up to £39,000 a year, were revealed at a Special Educational 
Needs and Disability Tribunal.

It criticised ‘systemic failures’ and 
voiced ‘grave concerns about safeguarding’ of children. It awarded 
£86,000 to the parents of the 15-year-old, now 17, who cannot be named 
for legal reasons.

The tribunal heard that the girl was assaulted by a boy in June 2011.

She was taken to a GP but her parents were not told.

Two weeks later she said she had been 
raped.

Texts between the girl and male pupils were obvious attempts to 
groom her, the tribunal ruled.

She had been persuaded to send naked 
photos of herself to boys, it was claimed.

However, the messages were 
dismissed by Stanbridge Earls headmaster Peter Trythall as ‘normal texts
 for children of this age’.

The girl’s mother said: ‘The fact that
 our daughter was not the only vulnerable underage girl subject to 
sexual contact and sexual intercourse was, and is, shocking.

'It has 
taken 18 months and £150,000 in legal costs for us to be listened to.’

The family’s solicitor said tribunal evidence suggested more than ten girls had been abused.

The mother of the 12-year-old, now 14,
 who also cannot be named, said the girl had since been diagnosed with 
post-traumatic stress disorder.

Police are investigating allegations that at least two girls were raped or sexually abused by pupils at Stanbridge Earls school, in Hampshire

The tribunal’s findings have been sent
 to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is considering the school’s 
future.

Hampshire Police confirmed that officers are investigating the 
allegations.

Stanbridge Earls, which has 200 pupils
 aged ten to 19, said the tribunal case was ‘in no way illustrative of 
the way the school normally meets the needs of its pupils’.

It added: 
‘The school has submitted a detailed action plan concerning how it is 
remedying issues.’

The Department for Education said: 
‘These allegations are deeply disturbing. We are in close touch with the
 parents and the school and are working closely with the local authority
 to make sure children are safe at the school.'

Pupils have been banned from staying with families on foreign exchanges
