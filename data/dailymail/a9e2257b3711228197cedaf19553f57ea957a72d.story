Sauce attack: Louis Parsons, 18, arriving at Plymouth Magistrates Court

A drunk student caused £4,000 worth of damage to his college using bottles of brown sauce, a court heard.

Louis Parsons, 18, poured the popular condiment over floors, tables and walls at City College Plymouth in Devon.

Parsons, a third-year carpentry student, launched his brown sauce attack after a heavy drinking session, a court heard.

He tipped brown sauce across the college - including using it to write obscene words and phrases on tables.

Parsons admitted causing criminal damage to buildings at Plymouth Magistrates Court.

He was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £85 costs.

Presiding magistrate Janice Hunt said: 'This was an appalling case of criminal damage at an establishment which is helping you.

'I suggest you think long and hard about your drinking habits.'

The court heard Parsons left a 'trail of destruction' at the college which cost more than £4,000 to clear up, a court heard.

He found bottles of brown sauce in the kitchen and poured it everywhere and also broke doors and let off a fire extinguisher in a kitchen.

He broke into a drinks machine and then used a bin to smash the window of a van parked outside, the court was told.

Parsons admitted causing criminal damage to buildings at a cost £2,515. He also pleaded guilty to causing damage of £1,516 to a hired van parked outside.

The court heard Parsons could not remember why he went on the rampage after a night drinking.

Gareth Warden, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said he poured brown sauce around the site which required specialist cleaning.

Defending, Ken Papenfus, said: 'He has no recollection of why or how he got to the college.

'When he woke up later, he was vaguely aware that something had happened. Gradually, to his horror, it started to come back to him.'

He added Parsons was being allowed to finish his course.
