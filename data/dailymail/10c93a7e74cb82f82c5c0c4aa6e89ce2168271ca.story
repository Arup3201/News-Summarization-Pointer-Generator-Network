The ruling that jailed feminist punk group Pussy Riot was illegal and should be heard again, Russia's Supreme Court has said. 

According to the Supreme Court, it was never established that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina disturbed the peace out of 'hatred for a social group'. 

The crime was also not violent and the Moscow court did not take into consideration that Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have children, the Supreme Court added.

A date has not yet been set for a new hearing but it is hoped it will be heard before the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in February.

An amnesty legislation is also being considered by the State Duma which could mean they are released before the New Year.

Irina Khrunova, Pussy Riot's lawyer, said she welcomed the news.

Their sentences are due to end in March.

Ms Khrunova told The Independent: 'If the amnesty project passes, I expect they will be out by new year’s.'

Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Tolokonnikova – were convicted of hooliganism in August 2012 and sentenced to two years in a prison after performing a protest song against President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral.

Samutsevich’s sentence was suspended a month later.

In November, it was reported that Tolokonnikova was being treated for health problems in hospital in Siberia three weeks after she 'disappeared'. 

She was removed from Prison Colony No. 14 in October after going on hunger strike in protest at appalling conditions.

She spoke of death threats from senior prison officers, slave-like labour conditions, female inmates being forced to strip naked as they sew uniforms, the banning of toilet breaks and punishment beatings.

Tolokonnikova says she was forced to work 17-hour days and eat rotten food.
