A P&O cruise line passenger has expressed outrage at artwork being prominently displayed on a ship featuring a story about missing British girl Madeleine McCann.

The piece shows a row of people sitting while a variety of newspapers, including one copy of the Sunday Times that shows a lead story on the search for Maddy. 

Michael Gould, 55, was especially dismayed at the work being hung in full view of his children as he escorted them to a child's club area on board the P&O ship the Ventura. 

'Odd': Father of three Michael Gould shows an artwork featuring Madeleine McCann from a P&O cruise ship

Full view: Gould said he saw the work when he took his children to the child's club area on the ship

Father-of-three Michael was on holiday with his wife Corinna and their youngest daughter Olivia on a Mediterranean cruise in early July.

The company director from Liverpool said the family were staying at the rear - aft - of the ship and during the evening would walk up a flight of stairs to take Olivia, aged five, to an area devoted to children.

'I just thought it was a very odd piece of art to have on a child-friendly ship, we went past it every night to the child's club en route from our cabin,' Gould said.

'It was at the top of the aft stair well in a high-profile public area. When I contacted P&O about it they more or less said "well it's there".

'P&O said the artist was depicting the sad realities of life, I don't go on holiday to be reminded of the sad realities of life.

'I think what's happened is someone somewhere has said we need a load of art for the ship and this has been done.

'I'm disappointed P&O don't seem to have taken this seriously, and I think they're wrong.' 

Missing: Madeleine McCann has been missing since May 2007 when she disappeared in Portugal

Search: Gould shows a close-up of the Sunday Times story about the investigation into Maddy's disappearance 

Gould said he had emailed the company and been told the mural was not going to be taken down.

He said: 'It was a very successful holiday, it would not be the case to say the whole holiday was ruined by this.

'However as somebody who is interested in art and collects art we found this a very odd thing to have on a child-friendly boat.'

A spokesperson for P&O said: 'The artist intended to depict a snapshot of the headlines and capture a moment in time through actual front pages.'

Maddy has been missing since May 2007 when she disappeared during a holiday in Portugal with her family. 

Her parents Kate and Gerry have never given up hope of being reunited with the little girl, now 9, but despite an international appeal and numerous reported sightings Maddy hasn't been found.

Not budging: A P&O spokesperson said the artist aimed to 'depict a snapshot of the headlines and capture a moment in time through actual front pages,' and that the work on their Ventura ship wouldn't be taken down
