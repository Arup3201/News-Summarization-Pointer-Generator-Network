Robbie Williams has provided his fans with an online commentary from his wife's bedside as she gave birth to their second child.

The 40-year-old Angels star posted a string of bizarre videos and pictures showing him in hospital with his wife Ayda Field, 35, including one showing her on a bed wearing high heels.

'When Ayda goes into labour she comes correct,' the funnyman wrote as he attempted to help his wife get through the experience in Los Angeles, California.

And eventually, once the baby had been born, he added: 'Erm, so, he's here. It's ten past three on what day? Monday? And we've been up way over 24 hours.

Having fun: Robbie Williams has posted a string of videos and pictures showing him in hospital with his wife Ayda Field, 35, as she appears to be preparing to give birth 

'When Ayda goes into labour she comes correct,' the funny man wrote as he posted a snap of his wife's heels 

'I've never been more in love and I've never been more proud of my wife, she's been absolutely astonishing. Baby bud isn't having a name yet, we're still figuring it out. He's 8lb 1oz.'

Miss Field then corrected him to to say: 'Two ounces babe, every ounce counts.'

He also published videos showing the pair of them dancing in their hospital room and another where he jokingly tells fans: 

'It's quarter past seven, we've been here since ten o'clock last night and I know you're really concerned and worried and thinking about what's going on. I need you to know I'm doing great.' 

Getting into the spirit of things: Ayda appeared to be having just as much fun as she danced upon her husband's lap

Another video, called A River Runs Through It, appears to show a doctor preparing to break his actress wife's waters.

Williams broke the news on Twitter earlier this year that the couple, who live in Los Angeles with daughter Teddy, were expecting another baby.

The Stoke-born singer first hit the headlines in Take That but quit the group in 1995 and embarked on a hugely successful solo career.

He married Miss Field in the grounds of his Beverly Hills mansion in August 2010 and their daughter, formally known as Theodora, was born two years later.

He told The Sun on Sunday: 'I'm hooked on anything that takes my mind off me. It used to be food, drugs, sex, the internet, smoking or TV. Now it's my daughter.' 

He said: 'I'm in a content stage of my life. That's because I'm married with a kid. I'm less reckless. I thought it was all about the cars and the clothes, the girls and the house. But none of that is for me.

'With a baby girl there's a point to it other than my own ego. I'm now tethered to the planet.'

Mixing it up: He posed in a vintage looking dressing gown as Field winced in pain
