A schoolgirl has been kicked out of lessons just months before she begins her GCSEs because her shoes were not shiny enough.

Mother Tina Curran has blasted Brownhills School in Walsall, West Midlands, after her 15-year-old daughter Jodie Dawes was sent home from school because her smart, black velvet shoes were not 'polishable'.

Letters were sent out before the Christmas holiday telling parents that children must wear shiny shoes or face being sent home.

But Ms Curran argues many families had already bought shoes for their children and could not afford to replace them after the new rules were introduced at Christmas.

Headteacher Helen Keenan has hit back saying rules must be obeyed and she would not apologise for maintaining high standards at the school.

Ms Curran said: 'My daughter Jodie was targeted by one of the teachers as soon as she turned up last Monday.

'Someone rang us to say that she was not properly dressed for school. She was allowed to stay, but said some children were sent home.

The letter included this shoe guide, which outline what shoes are and are not acceptable in the school

'But the next day she was sent home. I am going to get her some other shoes, but I'm not happy about it.

'Lots of the mums have been complaining that they can't afford to keep buying shoes.

'If the children are in school what does it matter if they're not exactly the right type of shoe - their brains are not in their feet are they?

'To me the most important thing is that they're in school learning. Jodie is doing her GCSEs this year and shouldn't be missing any lessons.'

Mrs Keenan yesterday defended the policy, saying: 'I'm not apologising for our high standards. We have tried to apply the policy sensibly.

'We are not in the habit of sending people home unnecessarily. Only a couple were sent home to change their shoes or get it sorted.

'The problem is parents want to send their children to a good school, with good standards, but when it doesn't suit them some complain.'

MailOnline reported in October that Anne Jewer (pictured) was left furious when her son, Bradley, was forced to take lessons alone at Mayfield School in Portsmouth, Hampshire because his shoes were not 'polishable'

The school, which caters 700 pupils aged 11-18, was rated 'good' at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013.

This case is not the first of its kind. In October MailOnine reported that a 12-year-old schoolboy was being forced to study alone at school because his shoes are not 'polishable'.

Bradley Jewer was taken out of regular lessons and was forced to study in isolation because the school said he was wearing the wrong footwear.

His angry mother, Anne, said the move damaged her son's education by preventing him from interacting with other children.

Staff at Mayfield School in Portsmouth, Hampshire, have removed the year eight pupil from his classes because his black Converse shoes do not meet required standards.  

Tyler Hawkins, 15, (pictured) was told to colour in the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes at Newquay's Tretherras School following new rules

Pupils and parents around the country have reported being shocked at the stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's schools after they returned from the summer holidays.

In October MailOnline reported around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them footwear that was not 'black, leather shoes' was 'inappropriate'.

Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good.

'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing?

'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' 

A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School.

His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help.

'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.'

Later last month, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight.

Jaydee Hart, 13, Chloe Gregory, 14, and Amelia Wileman, 13, were told their uniforms were 'too tight' at their school, Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire

They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform.

Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight.

She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her.
