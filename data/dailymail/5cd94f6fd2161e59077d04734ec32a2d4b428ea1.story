He was airlifted to hospital by helicopter ambulance, but died shortly after arrival.

A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was taken to a south London police station for questioning.

The victim is the eleventh teenager to be murdered in London this year and the sixth to be fatally stabbed.

He is the third teenager to be murdered in London this month. A total of eight teenagers were murdered in the capital in the whole of 2012. 

Police have cordoned off Ockley Road.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called at 1.58pm to reports of a stabbing at a residential address in Ockley Road, Croydon.

'Upon arrival officers found a 17-year-old boy with stab wounds. He was taken to a south London hospital by London Air Ambulance a short while later in a critical condition where he later died.

'A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the incident. He remains in police custody at a south London police station.

'Officers from Croydon are investigating. Inquiries are continuing. Local road closures are in place.'

A record number of 29 teenagers were murdered in London in 2008, topping the previous worst toll of 27 in 2007.

However, there was a steep decline to just 15 teenage murders in the capital in 2009. A total of 19 teenagers were unlawfully killed in London in 2010, while 15 teenagers were murdered in the capital in 2011.

Eight teenagers were unlawfully killed in London last year.
