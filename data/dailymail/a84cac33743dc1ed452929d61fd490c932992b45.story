Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have been cleared by Italy's top court of tax evasion.

The founders of the Dolce and Gabbana fashion house had previously been found guilty by two lower Italian courts of failing to declare millions of euros the company earned through a subsidy based in Luxembourg.

In April, an appeals court gave a suspended sentence of 18 months in jail to the designers, who have always denied the charges.

However when the Supreme Court of Cassation was asked to confirm the sentence, it acquitted the pair saying there was no case to answer. 

Shortly after the ruling, Gabbana tweeted: 'We knew it!!! We
are honest people!'.

The suit stems from an investigation that began in 2008 when
Italian authorities stepped up their fight against tax evasion
as the global financial crisis began to bite.

Fashion groups have come under tax authorities' scrutiny in
Italy partly because they performed better than most other
sectors during the financial crisis, but the cases rarely come
to court.

Fellow Italian fashion house Prada said in
September its chairwoman Miuccia Prada and her husband, chief
executive officer Patrizio Bertelli, were being investigated by
Italian authorities over payment of past taxes.
