A wealthy French baron has bought a rundown English stately home which was once a favourite of King James 1 to reclaim its 'deserved place in British history'.

Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten - a French professor and diplomat dubbed the 'Red Baron' for his links to the Chinese Communist government - has splashed out £2.5million for Apethorpe Hall near Oundle, Northamptonshire.

The grade I listed Jacobean manor, which was originally built in 1470-80, has recently been restored by English Heritage at a cost of £8million after being bought by the government in 2004 for £3.5million.

The grade I listed Jacobean manor, which was originally built in 1470-80, has recently been restored by English Heritage at a cost of £8million after being bought by the government in 2004 for £3.5million. It currently has no electricity or running water but is set to be turned into a home

Originally built in 1470-80 by Sir Guy Wolston, who served as constable of the nearby royal castle at Fotheringhay, the 48-bedroom house was developed as the focal point and power base of leading Tudor and Jacobean families, closely involved with the Court of England's ruling monarchs for more than 150 years from Edward IV to Charles I. 

Despite its recent repair works, the grand property currently has no electricity or running water and is said to be in need of extensive further works to turn it into the family home which Baron von Pfetten desires.

The baron, 47, who was a member of the Chinese parliament from 2001 until 2005, has just finished restoring a 17th century chateau in his native France and said he wanted Apethorpe Hall to 'regain the place in British history it deserves'.

The hall was a favourite of King James I and its stately apartments were where he indulged in 'more commodious entertainment...and princely recreation' with his favourite, George Villiers, later to become the Duke of Buckingham. 

Baron von Pfetten, who was a member of the Chinese parliament from 2001 until 2005 where he got the nickname 'Red Baron', has just finished restoring a 17th century chateau in his native France and said he wanted Apethorpe Hall (above) to 'regain its deserved place in British history'

Apethorpe Hall was left to ruin before English Heritage pumped £8million into its restoration to save 'one of England's finest country houses'

Despite the extensive works (left) which have allowed the hall to keep some of its original features (right), there is still an extensive amount of work to do before it is a fully-operating family home. It is thought Baron von Pfetten will need to spend millions to restore it to a high standard

After a succession of owners, the hall – which also played host to Queen Elizabeth I and King Charles I - became the property of Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila.

He left the country after the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984 and the hall was left to decay. It fell into ruin, was riven with dry rot, and its Jacobean plasterwork ceilings starting to collapse.

Baron von Pfetten

Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten, 42, is a French professor, diplomat and former senior adviser to the Chinese government.

He served in the Chinese parliament from 2001 to 2005 and was referred to by the Chinese press as the ‘Red Baron’.

He was the first European ever to hold senior public office in the People's Republic of China.

In 2013, he held a series of meetings on Iran's nuclear program at his home in Burgundy, France, which were attended by senior officials from Iran, Israel, China, the U.S., France and the UK.

Baron von Pfetten, who is married, is a keen hunter and was elected President of the International Foxhound Association in 2012.

He is a joint master of the New Forest Foxhounds in Hampshire, UK, and the Equipage de Vens et Venaille in Burgundy, France.

He is currently master of his own hunt - Equipage de Selore - a private family pack of foxhounds and buckhounds based in the Chateau de Selore in St. Yan, Saône-et-Loire, France.

However, it was eventually bought by developers in 2002 - a consortium led by former QPR president Harold Winton.

But the group's plans for Apethorpe were not approved by the government, which issued a compulsory purchase order for the hall in 2004 for £3.5million.

In 2008, the 51,000 sq. ft. building, complete with stable block, gardener's cottage and 45 acres of land, was put on the market for £4.5million. But the estate failed to attract a sale.

English Heritage then spent £8million repairing the hall before putting it back on the market recently.

As part of the deal with Baron von Pfetten, the hall will be open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years.

English Heritage will organise the public openings.

Simon Thurley, English Heritage's chief executive, said Apethorpe was 'by far the most important country house to have been threatened with major loss through decay since the 1950s'.

He added: 'Since 2000 English Heritage has consistently said that the best solution for Apethorpe is for it to be taken on by a single owner, who wants to continue to restore the house and to live in it; especially one who has experience of restoring historic buildings and is prepared to share its joys with a wide public, as Baron Pfetten will do.

'The purchase price is £2.5m, meaning that English Heritage will have spent a total of £10m saving this architectural masterpiece.

'Baron Pfetten has agreed to an 80-year commitment of 50 days public opening a year, a far more extensive undertaking than the normal period of 10 years in the case of English Heritage grant-aided properties. 

'He will also need to fund the comprehensive refurbishment and fitting-out works himself.'

Baron von Pfetten said he was delighted with the purchase and added: 'My wife and I learnt a lot from the ten years we have spent renovating our 17th century chateau in France.

'Probably the most important lesson we learnt was to give it all time.

'Luckily we are young and we have many friends with similar interests keen to support us.

'My wife and her family are also professional architects who specialise in work to historic buildings.

'Our vision for Apethorpe is to help this house regain the place in British history that it deserves.'

Nick Hill, English Heritage's project manager for Apethorpe, said the property has been carefully restored to include its original furnishings.

He said: 'Some of the roofs here were on the point of collapse when English Heritage intervened, which would have led to the loss of some of the finest Jacobean plasterwork in the country.

'We have made the roofs and structure safe and secure and repaired the plasterwork.

'We have also cleared away many of the disfiguring modern structures erected in the 1960s when it was a school.

'But it is right that we left decisions about internal refurbishment and decoration to the future occupier.'

As part of English Heritage's deal with Baron von Pfetten, the grade I listed hall will  open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years

In 2008, the 51,000 sq. ft. hall, complete with stable block, gardener's cottage and 45 acres of land, was put on the market for £4.5m. However, it failed to attract a sale and has now been sold to French professor Baron von Pfetten, who will use it as his main family home, for £2.5million

Apethorpe Hall was built in the late 15th century by Sir Guy Wolston and is a grade I listed building situated on the outskirts of Oundle in Northamptonshire

Apethorpe Hall was built in the late 15th century and is a grade I listed building situated near Oundle in Northamptonshire.

It was built by Sir Guy Wolston, who then sold it to Sir Walter Mildmay and it stayed in his family for 350 years.

It contains one of the country's most complete Jacobean interiors and hosted 13 royal visits between 1565 and 1636.

It has a particularly important place in England's history because of the role it played in entertaining Tudor and Stuart royalty at the pinnacle of its influence around the turn of the 17th century.

It also once played host to Queen Elizabeth I, King James I and King Charles I. 

The country house's state rooms are arguably the most complete in the country and provide a fascinating window on a rich period of English history.

From the windows on the east side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the arrival of Elizabeth I.

Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road.

It was also a favourite haunt of monarchs James and Charles I who enjoyed magnificent feasts of venison and wine.

James I himself is believed to have enjoyed homosexual trysts when he visited the home 10 times between 1614 and 1624.

The architectural importance of Apethorpe lies in the breadth of architectural elements which survive today from almost every period of English architecture since the late 15th century.

Once described as Britain's most neglected grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and millionaire Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila.

After the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher during the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984, Mr Burweila was among the many Libyans who fled the UK.

He had been negotiating to sell the property to a consortium led by Harold Winton, the honorary life president of Queen's Park Rangers football club, which reportedly bought the property for £1.35million.

But two days later, on account of its dilapidation, the Department of Culture Media and Sport served the compulsory purchase order and took it off their hands.

After years of wrangling and a lands tribunal, the Government was eventually forced to pay £3.5 million for the house.

It was handed over to English Heritage, with additional grant-in-aid to carry out a major programme of repairs with the utmost care and expertise.

Since English Heritage took over, repairs costing £8million have been carried out and the building now stands in a secure state for the new owner to carry on the restoration work.

The house has been used for filming scenes of various television historical dramas as well as the 1984 film Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth.

Restoration and attempts to sell the property were also the subject of a fly-on-the-wall documentary first shown on BBC Two in April 2009.
