From a gentle tweeze to the full Hollywood strip, having a well-groomed look down below has become almost as important as ensuring the hair on your head looks good.

But one London hair salon has taken the creative approach to grooming one step further and is offering £40 dye jobs for your short and curlies along with their regular cut and blowdries.

Whether you're after a pink heart-shaped patch or a pretty leopard print 'do, Bleach Salon, which has branches in Topshop's Oxford Circus flagship and in Dalston, has a dye job to suit even the quirkiest of tastes.

The looks gaining the most love at the moment are the leopard-print landing strip and a vivid neon dye job.

But it seems that not everyone is impressed with the salon's new offerings, with owner Alex Brownsell admitting that pubic dye jobs provoke strong reactions among her clientele.

'It’s a bit like Marmite,' she told NY Mag. 'people seem to either love it or hate it. We put it [pubic dye jobs] on the menu for a bit of fun but it’s getting to be quite popular, especially because of the summer.

'I’ve had it done, a few of our stylists have had it done, loads of my friends have been in and had it done.

'We’ve got people coming in just for a wax that are seeing it, thinking about it, and then coming in the next time asking for it. Every one of my friends who has had it done has come in for a second go.'

Unusual though a neon Brazilian might be, it's not the first time that Brownsell's creative urges have made waves.

She was famously responsible for the dip-dyed 'ombre' hair trend that dominated last summer and counts Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch and singer Sky Ferreira among her clients.

Brownsell was also responsible for Rihanna's controversial embrace of greying locks - and has revealed that it was discovering grey pubic hairs on her own nether regions that led to the launch of the salon's increasingly popular pubic prettying service.

'First you pick the shape you want —  a triangle, 
strip, heart —  anything like that,' she explains of the dyeing process.

'Then Chelsea [Bleach's public hair expert] will paint the area in 
the shape, you don’t actually dye all of it.

'It is then bleached, left 
on for 10 to 15 minutes, then wiped off and a secondary colour is 
applied. This is a stain and only takes two minutes.

'Then Chelsea takes 
that off and does the waxing procedure as normal. It’s really quick. No 
paper underwear, but you do have a disposable towel on top and a blanket
on your legs so you’re not just sitting there waiting.'

She added: 'We’ve done multicolour, pink and blue hearts — hearts are very popular — tie-dye, and leopard print.

'Chelsea is always experimenting and pushing it forward; she sees how the stylists dye hair and wants to try it out and it goes from there.'
