Rugby's authorities have been warned that they risk creating a culture of diving in the game, due to the way that acts of foul play are being refereed.

Last month, this column highlighted the spectre of ‘simulation’ – as it has become known in football – taking hold as players seek to con officials into awarding penalties and dishing out cards. 

Now, that threat has been reinforced by Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, in light of a contentious incident last Saturday.

The Tigers were incensed when no action was taken against Blair Cowan of London Irish for punching their flanker, Jamie Gibson, in the face at Welford Road.

Having sought clarification, Cockerill was stunned to be informed by the RFU that referee Greg Garner was entitled to down-play the offence on the basis that the victim did not appear to be hurt. In return, he expressed concerns that this out-look will lead to the spread of diving.

‘In law, I am told that a punch is down to the referee’s interpretation, so the referee will decide whether it is a hard or a soft punch,’ said Cockerill. ‘The referee and the TMO at the weekend decided that the punch to Gibson’s face didn’t hurt him and wasn’t hard.

‘I had an email from Gerard McEvilly (RFU disciplinary officer) and Wade Dooley (citing officer) who said it wasn’t even a level-one citing, which is when it should have been a yellow card. One of the comments that alarmed me the most is that Gibson didn’t need treatment and didn’t go to the floor. 

‘Well, it didn’t really hurt Gibson so it is alright. How do you know it has not cracked his cheekbone or his jaw? The 50 year-old bloke sat in the TMO caravan outside is dictating whether someone gets hurt when they get punched.

‘The encouragement would be that if you get punched then go to the floor, get treatment and the player will get sent off. So now the law-makers are actually encouraging you to dive and I said that is the thin end of the wedge.’

The RFU have re-affirmed their conviction that this particular case was handled correctly – with the citing commissioner concluding that a penalty was sufficient for a weak punch which made minimal contact and did not provoke any response from Gibson. 

The union have also noted that Leicester did not make an official complaint about the matter and the governing body reject the notion that this sort of episode will provoke increasing levels of play-acting.

However, asked if he feared that this officiating issue would lead to coaches instructing their players to engage in simulation, Cockerill added: ‘You wouldn’t, but it is getting to that point.’

This policy towards the appraisal of foul play must be amended urgently. Cockerill’s point is valid, as diving is a minor, occasional problem for now, but this situation could lead to it becoming a real blight on the game. The notion that a full-blooded punch to the face that causes no immediate, obvious damage is more acceptable than a glancing blow that happens to draw blood is absurd.

The game is in an officiating hole due to guidelines issued to referees which remove the common-sense element of discretion, especially when it comes to the safety-first minefield of dangerous tackles. But in this case, the discretionary powers appear mis-placed. 

It would be disastrous for rugby if taking a tumble and feigning an injury was the only guaranteed route to justice.

Last weekend, Sam Burgess was congratulated on reaching the Australian NRL Grand Final by his perennial Kiwi adversary, Sonny Bill Williams, who said: ‘See you on the dark side’ – in reference to their mutual code switch. 

Williams has played union before and will slot straight back into the All Blacks set-up, whereas Burgess is preparing for an accelerated education in the 15-man game as he targets a World Cup call-up by England.

Sam Burgess, tackled by three men, is also making the switch to Union in time for the 2015 World Cup

He may wish to make the transition under the radar but there is no chance of that. Bath have released the first in a series of promotional trailers, entitled ‘The Countdown Begins’ as they prepare to welcome the league icon later this month. 

With the backdrop of a Roman arena and a heart-beat soundtrack, it shows Burgess in explosive action and heralds his credentials; both his physical stature and his sensational recent match stats. 

He is depicted as an unstoppable force of nature and his new club will hope that they soon have similar footage of Burgess scattering opponents in their colours. 

The transition will be televised. The pressure is on. 

While they await their high-profile new recruit, Bath have more pressing business on Friday night as they face Saracens in an intriguing Aviva Premiership encounter at The Rec. 

Both clubs are among the early front-runners in the league and destined to feature in the title tussle next May. Both have recently ‘nilled’ leading rivals in stunning fashion – Bath beating Leicester 45-0 and Saracens’ winning 39-0 away to Harlequins. 

There is unlikely to be a solitary zero on the scoreboard by the end of this match.

Saracens have made a superb start to the season but will be in for a tough test against high-flying Bath

Bath have promoted Gavin Henson to start at full back and England wing Anthony Watson is poised to make an injury comeback from the bench. 

Saracens must operate their fabled ‘Wolf- pack’ defence without the influential presence of Brad Barritt, who has a minor calf injury, while Owen Farrell is also absent again. 

This column – without overwhelming conviction – predicts a narrow Bath win.

While Williams and Burgess prepare for life in union, maverick Australian back Kurtley Beale may be on his way to league after the latest in a sequence of personal controversies. 

Having had his run-ins with the authorities several times before and struggled with alcohol-related issues, the gifted Waratahs play-maker has been dropped by the Wallabies for tomorrow’s Rugby Championship clash with Argentina. 

 Kurtley Beale is alleged to have fallen out with a member of the Australian staff after playing South Africa

This follows allegations of a heated row with a team official on a flight from South Africa to South America – an incident that has been referred to Australia’s ‘integrity unit’ and has side-tracked head coach Ewen McKenzie from the primary task of preparing his side to face the Pumas. 

The up-shots are that Argentina have surely their best chance yet of securing a maiden tournament win and Beale’s future is in jeopardy. 

It would be a shame if the game were to lose such a precocious talent, but the benefit of the doubt can only be applied so many times…

Kurtley Beale is a fantastic talent but he has already been given the benefit of the doubt several times

England’s coaches were awarded new contracts through to 2020, just days after Jake White left the Durban-based Sharks – reportedly with a view to being available if a Test job comes up after the World Cup. 

The South African who guided his country to global glory in 2007 has been interested in coaching England before. 

The role has great cachet and if Lancaster’s team collapsed in a heap next year (highly unlikely), the RFU would need to assess whether there were viable alternatives before dispensing with the current coaches, at great expense. 

Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have been given new long-term contracts ahead of the World Cup

These days, every union is expected to conduct a ‘worldwide search’ for the right man, amid a perception that there are always various stellar options overseas. 

In truth, White is one of very few, but his gold-plated CV doesn’t boast a forensic knowledge of English rugby. 

His compatriot, Nick Mallett, has surely been away from the game’s front line for too long to be a contender again. 

Kiwi coaches are an export trade in their own right, but it is unlikely the RFU would try to poach Warren Gatland from Wales or Joe Schmidt from Ireland. 

The grass is not necessarily greener elsewhere.
