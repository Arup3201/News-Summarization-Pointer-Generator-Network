West Ham loanee Paul McCallum will not play for Portsmouth again until March at the earliest after accepting a seven-game suspension following his sending off against Southend. 

The 21-year-old, who was shown a straight red card for violent conduct, had an extra four matches added to his automatic three-match ban after allegedly making contact with referee Lee Collins.

The incident is believed to have taken place just after he was sent off for an off-the-ball incident in the dying moments of Pompey's 2-1 home defeat.

McCallum, who is on loan from the Hammers until the end of the season, had the opportunity to contest the charge but chose to plead guilty and accept his ban. 

The length of his suspension means the forward will be unable to play in any games in February after sitting out his side's 0-0 draw with Wycombe on Saturday.

The League Two side cannot cut short his loan deal, meaning he will be available again for the trip to Northampton on March 3.

Portsmouth are 18th in the table but just two points off the relegation zone following a run of just one win in their last 10 games.
