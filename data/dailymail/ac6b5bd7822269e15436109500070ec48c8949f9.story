The dead body of a newborn baby has been found abandoned near to a Championship football team's training ground with a note requesting it receives an Islamic burial.

A couple walking their dog found the child close to fields used by Bolton Wanderers' academy players in Ox Hey Lane
in Lostock.

The baby was found wrapped up in clothing and plastic bags yesterday afternoon, just over a mile from the football team's Reebok Stadium.

Worrying: A cordon has been set up around a path where the child was found, close to fields used by Bolton Wanderers' academy players

The age, sex or ethnicity of the baby is not known at this stage and it is unclear whether the baby was live or still born.

Chief Inspector Carol Martin, said: 'Obviously this is an extremely upsetting incident and our investigation at the moment is twofold: finding out how and when the baby died and locating the parents.

'I cannot begin to imagine what either parent may be going through and we are very worried about their physical and emotional state.

'It is likely the mother in particular will require some form of medical attention and I want to appeal directly to both parents or anyone who knows them to contact police or visit your GP or local hospital.

Discovery: Forensic officers set up tents to search for evidence

'It is vitally important that I stress support networks are in place and are waiting and on hand to help the parents.

'While we cannot speculate on the ethnicity of either parent, there was a note left requesting the baby receive an Islamic burial and we have already reached out to the Muslim community through their Friday prayers through our partnership connections at the Bolton Council of Mosques.

'The answer undoubtedly lies somewhere in the community and I want to ask the Bolton community as a whole whether they know of anyone who may have tried to conceal a birth or who recently have been pregnant but now is without a baby or appears withdrawn, upset or in physical discomfort.'

A Home Office post mortem is expected to take place on Monday.

Super Int Steve Nibloe, from Greater Manchester Police, said a number of officers are working at the scene. He added:Â  'This is clearly a very upsetting incident.

'We do not know with any certainty how long the baby has been there or how it has died.

'While I understand there will be concern in the community I want to reassure residents that we will be working hard to answer these questions.

'We are deeply concerned for the welfare of the mother and if anyone has seen someone in the area or has information about who you think the mother might be please call us.'

Police have not yet confirmed the sex of the baby which was found at 4:55pm yesterday.
