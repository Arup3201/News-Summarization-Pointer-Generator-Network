A victim of an online 'rape club' that allegedly preyed on underage girls was told by police that 'she was asking for it' by wearing a skirt, it has been claimed.

Earlier this week police in New Zealand said two teenage boys, who called themselves the 'Roast Busters' and embarked on a campaign of luring girls into drunken group sex before boasting about their 'exploits' on Facebook, will not be charged.

Auckland police said the boys, aged 17 and 18, would not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - had been 'brave' enough to testify.

'The Roast Busters': Police said the boys, aged 17 and 18, will not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - have yet been 'brave' enough to testify

But one girl, who is now 15, has 
said she made a rape allegation to police two years ago and was made to reenact the alleged rape during a taped interview in front of officers.

She
says she told police that she had been raped by three boys from the 
Roast Busters gang but they focused on why she wore a skirt when 
she met members of the group in 2011.

'They
said that I didn't have enough evidence to show, because I went out in 
clothes that was pretty much asking for it,' said the girl, who was aged
13 at the time.

Police Minister Anne Tolley said the case, which has sparked outrage in New Zealand, had been 'poorly handled' and she had asked the police watchdog to conduct an inquiry.

'I
believe this is the right course of action to ensure the public has 
confidence in the police on this matter,' she said after calling in 
Police Commissioner Peter Marshall for a briefing today.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key described the case as 'abhorrent'

Tolley said the police treatment of the girl would be part of the Independent Police Conduct Authority inquiry.

'Parents of young girls need to have confidence that complaints to police about sexual assault are investigated thoroughly and appropriately,' she said.

When
the story broke Prime Minister John Key called the group's alleged 
actions 'abhorrent' but said it was difficult for authorities to 
prosecute them due to a lack of hard evidence.

Police
at the time said they had been aware of the group for two years but 
took no action because none of its alleged victims was willing to 
testify against them.

But it
has since emerged that four girls complained to police as far back as 
2011, including one who made the formal statement featuring video 
testimony about what she allegedly endured.

Key
told parliament on Thursday that the performance of police was 
'frankly, not good enough' and he was disappointed ministers had learned
details of the case through the media, despite requesting a full 
briefing.

But he said a more
important issue was that the allegations were properly followed up by 
police and the complainants, who were emotionally vulnerable and a 
potential suicide risk, were given adequate support.

'These
are fragile young girls that could potentially take their own lives,' 
he said. 'We already know that one of them has considered that.'

Victims'
rights advocates such as Greens MP and former sexual abuse counsellor 
Jan Logie have said that if the claims made by Roast Busters members are
true then it amounts to a 'rape club' and they should be charged accordingly.

'Grow up!' Their actions have sparked anger across Twitter

Police
Superintendent Bill Searle said officers were reviewing evidence and 
hoping to speak to victims again to see if a prosecution was possible.

'We will look at the whole evidence, at the time, to make a proper assessment,' he told Radio New Zealand.

Searle said investigators were aware 'very early on' that one of the alleged gang members was the son of a police officer but the fact had no bearing on how the case was handled.

Detectives also confirmed that one of the boys is the son of a high-profile entertainer with 'an international profile'.

The boys used the social networking account to post text and videos to recruit others to join their sex campaign.

'A true roast is where you know you are going there intentionally to roast this female,' says one in a video.

'We
don't choose a roast, the roast chooses us. We have girls hitting us up
to "hang out with us". They know what we're like; they know what 
they're in for.'

A young man goes on: 'We take what we do seriously - some of you think this is a joke, it's not.

'You try and get with the amount of girls we do. This is hard, it's a job, we don't do this s*** for pleasure.'

Speaking to New Zealand's 3 News on the condition of anonymity, one alleged victim described her ordeal.

'I
just kept blacking out 'cause i had drunken too much,' she said. 'You 
could say I got raped. I had sex with three guys at one time.'

Anger: Others criticised the police for letting the boys get away with their lurid sex campaign

A witness who claimed her sister was raped at one of the boys' parties told Radio Live: 'I could name, like, literally 30 girls from all around Auckland. I went to one of the boys' houses one day whose parents were away on holiday. And they had this room there which they called the layer.

'They would take girls inside the layer. There was blood all over the walls and they would take three different girls in there at a time.'

Rape Prevention Education said the behaviour described on the Facebook page is rape.

'It is not only morally reprehensible, it is criminal and illegal behaviour,' the group said.

The support group said the use of alcohol by offenders is often premeditated and planned.

However, police say they cannot prosecute until one of the girls comes forward.

Detective Inspector Bruce Scott said: 'None of the girls have been brave enough to make formal statements to us so we can take it to a prosecution stage or even consider a prosecution stage.'

He added: 'The page was left open for operational and tactical reasons, and whilst we acknowledge it was upsetting for the victims, it was being monitored for information or evidence that would assist our investigation.'

He said the The Facebook page alone does not provide evidence which would allow the case to be put before a court.

Their actions also provoked anger on Twitter.

One tweeter wrote: '#roastbusters grow up, get checked and have some dignity. Little boys trying to play big games.'

Another added: 'Their stupidity p****s meeh off! Yes, of course you'll be known, BUT for all the wrong reasons! #RoastBusters

'K here I am raging bout them lil fem%en$, forgetting I have two exams too! Grrrr ... #NoSleepTonight.'

A message from someone linked to the group said he made some 'major mistakes' in a message posted on Twitter, adding that he had made 'some dramatic changes' to himself since appearing on the news.

He added: 'I have not been happy with who I have become and if I suffer any consequences from my past actions then I guess I deserve it but I just want people to know I am a good person at heart and I have matured and have taken this as a massive learning experience.'

He went on to say that he hoped no one else would go down a similar path.

'All the girls that have been affected by this whole ridiculousness I apologise and wish the best for you.'

But other Twitter users were quick to call into question the sincerity of the apology.

Pound Cake posted: 'They've been doing it for 3 years and that's all he could come up with? #OhWell #Karma.'
