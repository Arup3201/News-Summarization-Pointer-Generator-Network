It has developed something of a cult following among the celebrities who swear by its benefits.

Now the British public can decide for themselves whether Lait-Crème Concentré really is the ‘miracle’ moisturiser it is claimed to be.

And at £20 for 75ml, they might feel they have every right to hope it is.

Previously only available from French pharmacies, specialist stores or websites abroad, Boots is now selling Lait-Crème Concentré by French brand Embryolisse.

It is first time the moisturiser – praised by make-up artists and beloved of stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson and Yasmin Le Bon – has been on sale on the UK high street. Simon Cowell is also said to be a fan of the product.

One tube of the cream sells every 60 seconds worldwide and large numbers of women – and men – have already snapped up the 75ml bottles at Boots since they hit the shelves last week. 

Make-up artist Julia Carta, who has worked with Keira Knightley, Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey and is Cowell’s personal make-up specialist on the X-Factor, described it as the ‘best kept secret among models and make-up artists’.

She claims that it gives the skin ‘immediate plump and glow’. She added: ‘I’m sure people will go crazy for Embryolisse, they are going to be queuing round the block for it.’

Make-up artists say they like to use Embryolisse because it can not only be used as a moisturiser, but also applied as a make-up remover, primer or repair mask. Its makers claim it is great on children’s skin too.

Boots decided to stock Embryolisse – which translates as baby’s bottom and purports to leave skin feeling as soft as an infant’s – following a conference two years ago where they invited 100 of the world’s top make-up artists and skin care specialists to talk about brands they used that were not readily stocked in their stores.

It came up consistently as one of the most revered brands that was not readily available on the high street.

In trials, 80 per cent of users with sensitive skin suggested the moisturiser, which is made from a ‘unique’ blend of natural ingredients, fatty acids and vitamins, had helped their skin to stay ‘smooth and silky all day’.

Joe Mitchell, of Boots, said: ‘It’s already an international bestseller, and we know customers are searching for it on boots.com, so we’re delighted to bring it to the UK high street as part of our exclusive range of beauty finds from around the world.’
