Having made history as the first skydiver
to safely land without using a parachute, daredevil Gary Connery is 
used to high-profile stunts.

Now, after acting as the Queen’s skydiving 
stunt-double during the Opening Ceremony, the father of two says he has 
realised his dream.

‘I had the best seat in the house for a show that 
was seen around the world,’ he says.

Gary and James Bond double Mark Sutton, 41, underwent months of secret training for their show-stealing jump.

On the night, Gary, 43, was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the 
Queen was wearing, and the duo were driven to Stapleford airfield, 
Essex.

It was the first time he wore his 
costume. 'I mean I’ve worn my own dresses out loads of times,' he joked.
'But in terms of the jump it was the first time.'

Asked why he was chosen for the jump Mr Connery replied: 'Good question. I think they liked my legs.' He added: 'I’ve got Queen-style legs.'

Their helicopter was given the all-clear to take off at 8.50pm by
military air-traffic controllers and then guided into position over the
arena at 800ft for the pair to make their entrance.

After deploying their parachutes at 500ft, the duo steered away from the stadium and landed on a nearby bridge.

Gary, who completed the world’s first skydive without a parachute in May, now says he has only one regret from the night: ‘I really wanted to
keep the dress, but I wasn’t allowed. It would have looked great on a 
night out.’

The result was the most talked-about 
sequence of Danny Boyle’s stunning Olympics Opening Ceremony.

The Queen greets 007 at Buckingham Palace with the words 'Good Evening, Mr Bond' in the film sequence leading up to her parachute 'jump'

In the 
segment, prerecorded at Buckingham Palace, the Queen receives the 007 
star with the words: ‘Good evening, Mr Bond.’

They then leave and walk towards a 
helicopter, corgis in tow, and at one point Craig gives a nuanced glance
in Her Majesty’s direction.

It was the Queen’s first film role, but it was revealed that she needed only one take.

‘She’s a good actor,’ said Mr Boyle.

‘She’s very sharp. You didn’t have to tell her anything 
twice.’ Not only that, he added, but she also ‘got along with James Bond
very well’.

It was all the irrepressible Mr Boyle’s idea. He raised it with London 2012 chief Sebastian Coe, who thought it inspired.

If Lord Coe was a little doubtful, 
however, that it would be well received by the Queen’s courtiers, he was
quickly reassured.

They listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask 
the Boss.

The Mail on Sunday discovered that
it was her deputy private secretary, Edward Young, a former adviser to 
William Hague, who acted as the go-between.

Some insiders refer to him as the 
‘Secret Agent’ – because he was  the key link between the Palace and Mr 
Boyle’s team.

Lord Coe had served as chief of staff to William Hague 
around the time Mr Young was working as the then Opposition leader’s 
communications chief.

Palace insiders felt it was a 
fortuitous connection that at least gave Lord Coe a chance of winning 
approval for the plan.

The idea appealed to Mr Young, 45, who went to 
Reading Grammar School and worked in managerial roles at  Barclays 
before becoming an adviser to Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude and then 
Mr Hague.

Mr Young, who is married, moved to Granada TV as 
communications director in 2001 before taking up his role at Buckingham 
Palace in 2007.

Sources said Her Majesty’s only 
stipulation for her acting role was that she would choose what to wear. 
Eschewing the bikini favoured by some who have gone before her – most 
memorably Ursula Andress and Halle Berry – she decided on a salmon 
dress.

In the helicopter scene, she was 
played by Julia McKenzie, famed for portraying Miss Marple. The scene 
concluded with the stunt double  of the Queen parachuting into the 
Olympic Stadium.

Seconds later the real Queen, wearing the same dress as
she did in the filmed sequence, was met with roars of laughter and a 
standing ovation as she entered the arena together with Prince Philip.

The Palace scenes were filmed in the 
quadrangle, the Grand Entrance, the East Gallery, the Audience Room and 
the West Terrace – and even starred Her Majesty’s dogs, including 
13-year-old Monty, previously owned by the Queen Mother. The Queen was 
said to have ‘immensely enjoyed’ her acting experience.

Reciprocating Mr Boyle’s favourable comments about her acting skills, the Queen declared his show ‘wonderful’.

And one Hollywood veteran said: ‘It 
was a brilliant and daring move – all film performances can slip from 
being such a good idea at the time to then getting an appalling 
reception from viewers.

‘The Queen played a blinder by acting and, like all great performers, also being herself.’
