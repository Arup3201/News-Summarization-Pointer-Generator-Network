After repainting doors and panels throughout his house, John Margerison felt justifiably happy with the results.

Until, that is, a few weeks later when his brilliant white had turned a nasty yellow.

He did the job again – but again the Dulux gloss paint turned yellow.

Whitewash: John Margerison, who won a court case against paint giant Dulux after his white paint gloss turned yellow

Mr Margerison, 72, was so disappointed
that he decided his next brush would be with the paint company.

He took
them to court... and has won more than £2,000 in compensation.

‘I’m
delighted with  the end result,’ he said yesterday. ‘But I wasn’t at 
all happy with the results of my painting.

'It was far from the brilliant
white we wanted. I thought it was fading so painted it all over again.

‘But
again we noticed the yellow re-appearing.

'If we wanted yellow, we would
have bought it.’

The former gunner in the 49th Regiment Royal 
Artillery, who lives in Leeds with his  wife Pauline, painted eight 
doors and frames as well as skirting boards and stair areas at his home.

When he complained Dulux offered modest compensation, but Mr Margerison said no.

He
added: ‘Dulux offered amounts like £100 or £250 but I refused it.

'They 
offered to have my house decorated but I carried on with my claim and 
the judge decided I had a point.

'It was far from the brilliant white we wanted. I thought it was fading so painted it all over again.

'But again we noticed the yellow re-appearing. If we wanted yellow, we would have bought it.'

He was awarded £2,010 by Leeds County Court.

Dulux
conceded there was a problem, and put it down to EU regulations that 
came into force in 2010, which forced manufacturers to reduce solvent 
levels in paint.

They also said the paint involved was a few years old.

Mr Margerison said the Leeds Homebase store where he bought the paint had been ‘fantastic’ and supportive.

A
spokesman for Dulux owner AkzoNobel said: ‘AkzoNobel takes all issues 
of customer satisfaction very seriously.

'We endeavoured to resolve Mr 
Margerison’s complaint, which related to paint manufactured a number of 
years ago, by offering to repaint at our cost.

‘We are disappointed that this case had to proceed to a court hearing.’

A spokesman for Homebase said: 'We would like to apologise to Mr Margerison for his experience when purchasing some Dulux paint from us.

'Customer satisfaction is a top priority for us, and we have been working closely with Dulux to help them resolve this issue.'
