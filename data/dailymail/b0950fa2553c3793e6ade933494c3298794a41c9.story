A 27-year-old man has died in hospital after collapsing near the end of the City2Surf fun run in Sydney on Sunday morning

At least half a dozen St John Ambulance officers rushed to the unconscious man as hundreds of runners dashed by towards the finishing line

'He died of a heart attack shortly afterward.'

'This has been an indescribable shock to us all and we loved him more than we can say.'

'We wish to thank everyone for their kindness, support and condolences.'

Mr Head was rushed to hospital around 11am after his fall near the finish line.

Runners streamed past as six paramedics rushed to his assistance, placed him on a stretcher and stabilised him. 

He was then taken to St Vincent's Hospital in a critical condition, but died soon after.

A person close to the family said it was unclear what caused Mr Head's death.

Fox Sports CEO Patrick Delany confirmed the news in an email to all staff. 'I have spoken with Chris’ father and passed on all of our condolences,' Mr Delany told employees.

He described Mr Head as a 'much loved' colleague and 'Crossfit enthusiast' who had recently returned from a trip to Kakadu.

'Its time to pull together and support each other as well as Chris’ family and friends in this very sad time,' Mr Delany said.

Mr Head took his fitness seriously, according to a number of posts on his Facebook page. On July 24, just weeks before the 14km run, he wrote on the website: "Last night I ran 17.26km in 2hr and 6min in prep for the City 2 Surf which is 14km long. I might have over done it!"

He shared many online memes about fitness and nutrition. One image he shared on July 31 said: "The best ab exercise is 5 sets of stop eating so much crap."

On August 5 he shared a post about being committed to lifting weights.

"DEDICATION: When the voice in your head says, 'It's too early, dark and cold... go back to bed'... then the beastmode voice kicks the little voice's ass... and you get up. And lift some s**t.'

There are reports the man was running the race with his partner, who was not with him when he collapsed

The man was stabilised at the scene and taken to hospital where he died shortly after

A witness said the runner was 'almost crawling' towards the finish line of the 14km race.

ABC reporter Anne Barker saw the events unfold from the finish line.

'I turned around and saw him almost crawling, clearly in trouble, but still trying to reach the line. He was barely a metre away,' she told the national broadcaster.

'He was very white. Suddenly he just collapsed on the ground, rolled on his side and stopped moving.

'Ambulance officers ran over, put him on a stretcher and by then he was obviously unconscious.

'It was all the more distressing because runners were just streaming past him, so clearly happy to have finished, many unaware of what had happened.'

There are reports the man was running the race with his partner, who was not with him when he collapsed near the end.

The man was among the 80,000 runners who participated in the 14km race from Sydney CBD to Bondi Beach.

Race organisers have called the man's death 'a moment of enormous sadness' and say their thoughts are with his loved ones.

It was a tragic turn for the world's biggest fun run, which this year raised more than $4 million for charity.

More than 80,000 runners participated in the 14-kilometre race from Sydney CBD to Bondi Beach  

This year's death is the third in the iconic race's 43-year-history, with the most recent being 26-year-old British man Lee Marriage who collapsed and died 200 metres from finishing the race due to a heart attack six years ago.

It was reported that Mr Marriage was not a registered runner and had used somebody else's registration to take part.

In 2000 a man aged in his late 30s suffered a heart attack and also died during the race.

Former University of NSW professor Michael O'Rourke said at the time of Mr Marriage's death  there was generally one cause of cardiac arrest or arrhythmia during the City2Surf each year, but they were often revived thanks to the use of a defibrillator, reported Nine News.

The fun run event has been held since 1971.

People including TV vet Dr Chris Brown and NRL star Beau Ryan and  posted their condolences to the man on social media.

Dr Brown said: "Heartbreaking that a fun run could claim a young man's life. Life is a fragile thing. My thoughts are with his family tonight #city2surf."

Mr Ryan said: 'Thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of the young man who lost his life running the #City2Surf today'.

TV vet Dr Chris Brown also expressed his sadness at the death of a City2Surf runner on Sunday night.
