A tycoon who was charged almost £1million for destroying protected woodland has come under fire for bulldozing rural property in order to build himself a holiday home.

Phillip Day, one of Britain's richest men, has knocked down a quaint country cottage in rural Cumbria, near Carlisle, and plans to build a three-storey holiday house in its place.

The 47 year-old businessman faced was charged £950,000 in July after turning woodland where Hadrian's wall was quarried into a wasteland to improve his pheasant shoot.

Tycoon Phillip Days was charged almost £1million in July for tearing down woodland near his home. His new plans for a holiday house have been met with the outrage of local residents

Mr Day's plans for the new house, which will accommodate 24 if finished, have been met with local outrage.

The development is set to include an underground swimming pool, spa, hot  tub and gym, and would almost double the population of the tiny village it is to be built in, which is home to just 24 properties now.

Residents of Townhead in Cumbria claim the plans threaten environment and wildlife, including 
colonies of bats which roost in local homes.

The quaint keeper's cottage that Mr Day destroyed in order to build his dream holiday home was much more in keeping with the other houses in the area, residents of Townhead

The holiday home would lie just two miles from the tycoon's permanent home. Plans include an underground swimming pool, hot tub, spa and gym

Local residents fear the ostentatious house won't fit in in the rural hamlet which is home to just 24 properties

There are concerns over 
noise and increased traffic along narrow country lanes, as well as fears that the ostentatious property will stand out in the village which is filled with 200 year-olds converted barns and farms.

But residents of the picture postcard community in rural Cumbria, seven miles from Carlisle - so remote it does not have street lights - are fighting the project.

Michael Aldersey and Alison Clarricoats, who live next to the proposed development, told the council: 'The original building that was demolished was a pretty two-bedroom stone-built cottage which blended in with the surroundings.

'It is now to be replaced with this new monstrous development which will dwarf the village and will be totally out of character.

Last month Mr Day was charged £950,000 for destroying protected woodland which he ruined while building a better route to his pheasant shoot

'Townhead is a quiet, peaceful hamlet and we do not understand how the planning department could think of ruining this by allowing an industrial scale development to be created.'

Businessman Koi Chatterjee, who lives at Townhead Farm, said: 'The structure is just grotesque, ugly and not in keeping with the nearby properties not conducive to the surroundings of what is definitely a picturesque quintessentially English hamlet.'

In July, Mr Day was fined £400,000 with £450,000 costs when contractors tried to drive a road through the site, allegedly to give shooting parties better access.

Last week Mr Day’s lawyers failed to get the costs reduced when Judge Peter Hughes QC - who said during the trial that the entrepreneur with a personal fortune of £300m had tried 'to use the power of his wealth to avoid responsibility' - said the public would regard it as 'an affront to justice'.

Mr Day was granted permission to knock down the cottage and replace it with eight separate holiday lets almost two years ago.

He is now applying to amend his original plans with the new building, which some objectors described as a ‘boutique hotel’ and a ‘fortress’.

The plans will be discussed by the council’s Development Control Committee on Friday (Aug 30).

Despite objections from 15 households, planners are recommending it be approved.
