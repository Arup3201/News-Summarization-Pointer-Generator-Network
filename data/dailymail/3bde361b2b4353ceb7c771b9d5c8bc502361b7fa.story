Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie signalled their intention to have a greater royal role as they attended their first Buckingham Palace garden party today.

Joining their grandmother, the Queen, the royal sisters mingled with some of the 8,000 guests, including members of the Team GB Olympic and Paralympic squads.

Beatrice, 24, even joked with the Team GB basketball squad about shooting some hoops in the Queen's iconic back garden.

Sisters: The Princesses today made a big step into public life as a Royal at the garden party. Previously they have taken a back seat to the more high-profile young royals

In conversation: Princess Eugenie shelters from the rain while chatting with the guests

Squad member Eric Boateng, 27, from 
London said: 'The first thing we wanted to know was does she play 
basketball.

Success: Princess Beatrice looks pleased as her first appearance at an party goes swimmingly. There are three of these events each year

She said "a little bit".'I
 was joking around asking if there was a basketball hoop anywhere round 
here (in Buckingham Palace) and we could have a game she said "maybe 
next time" (in 2016).

'She was really lovely with a lovely smile. She was talking about the importance of sport.'

Her
 younger sister Eugenie, 23, spoke to former triple world champion and 
world record holder at the 110metre hurdles Colin Jackson.

The pair joked about how they were both attending their first garden party.

Cardiff-born
 Jackson, 46, now a BBC sports commentator said: 'This is a great social
 occasion where there’s no pressure and it’s a great time to catch up.

'I commentate on these guys but at the end everyone goes off and does their own thing so it’s good to say hello.

'So it doesn’t matter what the weather’s doing it’s just great to be here.'

Speaking
 about his chat with the Princess he added: 'We were both saying how 
it’s our first garden party and Eugenie said it was great seeing 
everyone here and how it was great everyone was catching up.'

Members of the Royal Family arrived at the top of the garden steps at 4pm to the sounds of the National Anthem.

They were, as always, led by the Queen who defied the grey weather in a candy pink outfit by in-house designer Angela Kelly.

Royal handshakes: Princess Beatrice meets athletes from GB's basketball Team, including Kieron Achara (centre). She joked that she would join them in a game

She carried a clear pink-rimmed umbrella but refused to use it even when the rain started to fall quite hard.

Guests she spoke to included Royal 
British Legion volunteers Margaret Cook, 71, from Redhill, Surrey and 
Janet Salter, 64, from West Wickham, London.

Janet said: 'She was really interested in our volunteering and said she thought it was a big help and much-needed.'

The tradition of royal garden parties was started by Queen Victoria and there are now three per year.

They are attended by guests invited 
on the recommendation of the Government, Civil Service, Armed Forces and
 the Diplomatic Corps as well as charities and local Lord Lieutenants.

The
 parties normally take place in June and July but have been brought 
forward this year because of the celebrations to mark the 60th 
anniversary of the Queen's Coronation.

At each party an estimated 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 slices of cake are consumed.
