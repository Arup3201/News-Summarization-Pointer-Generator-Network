A girl Goth who was battered by two drunken thugs in an attack echoing the chilling 'hate' murder of college student Sophie Lancaster watched her tomentors get a total of almost nine years in jail.

Melody McDermott, 22, said she was robbed of her smile after she was headbutted, punched and repeatedly stamped upon as she stood on a tram carriage waiting to leave the station.

Miss McDermott suffered a fractured eye socket and swelling to her face and body in the attack by two middle aged men on a Metrolink passenger tram near Bury, Greater Manchester.

Targeted: Melody McDermott and Stephen Stafford outside Bolton Crown Court, where their attackers Gareth Farrar and Kenneth Kelsall were sentenced

A friend Stephen Strafford, 29, who was with her, was punched twice and sustained a black eye and an ear injury in the attack.

Thugs Kenneth Kelsall, 47, and 43-year old Gareth Farrar were suspected to have carried out the attack because the victim was wearing Gothic-like clothing.

Miss McDermott later told police: 'Since this attack I have been left with a constant reminder of what these vile people did to me.

'I cannot smile properly and every time I do I can feel the muscle in my cheek which is not attached.

'Every time I touch my left eye but stings. Every morning when I wake up it is an immediate reaction, I am constantly reminded of it eight months after.'

'I have confidence because I feel there is a permanent reminder because of the effect of the left hand side of her face.

'Every time I meet new people I feels self conscious. I feel the attack has changed my personality. '

She said she had been left 'traumatised' and doesn’t go out in Bury after dark and always goes home early.

The attack had chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of Goth student Sophie, 20, who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashire simply because of the long dark clothing she was wearing.

Today, tattoeed Kelsall laughed in the dock as he was jailed for six years and nine months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault.

Farrar was jailed for two years two months after he admitted assault and affray after CCTV of the horrific assault was played at Bolton Crown Court. Both denied targeting the victims because of their clothing.

Miss McDermott and Stephen watched from the public gallery as Judge Elliott Knopf told both men: 'It was an appalling explosion of violence on two young people.

'The public are extremely concerned by
the prominence of violence which can be found in our cities and towns 
day in and day out.

'People
minding their own business could be subjected to vicious attacks for no
reason leaving them with injuries or serious injuries whether fuelled 
by drink or another reason.

'It is a mark on our society which causes the greatest of concerns. In the case of both of you, you are in your forties and both of you are mature men. You should have been able to restrain yourself from the disgraceful conduct.'

He added: 'We do not know what happened before that but one can see what may well have been an exchange of comments.

'Kelsall in response to perhaps something which was said or being said to you came across and head butted the young woman with such force that she was propelled across the width of the carriage she could be seen getting to her feet.

'She was upset that she had been assaulted in that way by a mature man and this shockingly horrific display of violence beggars belief.

'You Kelsall could not stop, you stamped on this young woman’s head with your boots and foot which caused the injuries. The effects of what you did must be distressing for her.

'Not only is it painful when she wakes up and throughout the day but she has lost her confidence because people notice and this has had the effect of changing her personality.

'This traumatic experience will stay with her for a long time to come.'

Miss McDermott and Mr Strafford
were returning home from a night out in Bury in October last year and 
were on board a tram at the Metrolink platform when they were attacked 
by the two men.

Kelsall headbutted Miss McDermott
inside the carriage, sending her reeling across the floor. She got up 
and kicked out at the tram doors but Kelsall then bundled her into the 
corner as other passengers looked on in horror.

He repeatedly punched Melody and 
viciously stamped on her head and face five times as she is lay between 
two seats. Farrar thumped Mr Strafford and aimed two punches at Melody before running off.

'People like that should not be able to 
get away with that sort of thing. I have lost my faith in society. It’s 
had a giant impact on me.'

Victim Melody McDermott

Mr Strafford required four stitches in his right ear lobe from an earing which had split. He had a right black eye and swollen lip.

He later told police: 'I knew I had injuries but my main concern was for Miss McDermott. I am now extremely anxious about going out particularly if by myself. I totally avoid trams and buses and have noticed changes in Melody's personality.'

Kelsall of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, had committed 77 previous offences between 1980 and 2010 including assaulting a police officer and public order matters.

His counsel Laura Foster: 'He has been sickened watching the CCTV footage. He had had a drink and was intoxicated. He became aware of two people coming down the escalator saying 'tramp' and 'scumbag' and in response he pushed her.

'He accepts that he lost it. He bears no prejudice on people who are Goths or who dress in that way. He accepts his actions were beyond acceptable.'

In mitigation for Farrar, of Beswick, Manchester, defence counsel Stuart Duke said: 'There is no doubt the two parties did not like the look of each other. But whatever was said that is not an excuse.'

After the case Miss McDermott said: 'People like that should not be able to get away with that sort of thing. I have lost my faith in society. It’s had a giant impact on me.

'I still get quite nervy if it’s busy or dark. Watching the CCTV was difficult to take in.'

Mr Strafford said: 'It is still a bit of a blur, I can’t understand the mentality of someone who would do something like this.'
