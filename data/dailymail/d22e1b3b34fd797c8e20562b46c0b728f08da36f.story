Detectives have released images of two suspects wanted after £8million worth of oil was stolen from underneath Nick Clegg's country estate.

More than 1.4million gallons of fuel were siphoned from an Esso pipeline that runs beneath the Deputy Prime Minister's Chevening House estate in Sevenoaks, Kent.

It is believed that nearly 300,000 litres a day were stolen from the pipe using what police have described as 'highly specialised and dangerous techniques'.

Investigations have already led to the arrests of nine people in relation to the sophisticated crime, but Kent Police are appealing for people to come forward if they recognise the two men pictured.

The crime was uncovered in August beneath Mr Clegg's grace and favour estate, which he gets rent free due to his Government position.

Det Con Angela Holder said: 'We are asking anyone who may recognise these men to get in touch.

'We believe they can help with our inquiries in what continues to be a major and widespread investigation into the theft of fuel from underground pipelines.

'These incidents have occurred in a number of regions across the UK, whereby highly specialised and dangerous techniques will have been required to siphon fuel from pipelines which operate at very high pressure.'

The theft took place beneath Chevening House, the grace and favour home of Nick Clegg near Sevenoaks

The pipeline targeted by the criminal gang passes directly beneath the Deputy Prime Minister's estate

In response to the theft, Esso has stepped up its security along the pipeline.

A spokesman for the oil firm said: 'The section of pipeline was temporarily shut down to make repairs, which have now been completed. There has been no impact on supplies to customers.

'We strongly condemn the highly dangerous criminal action by those involved and are working closely with the police in their criminal investigations.'
