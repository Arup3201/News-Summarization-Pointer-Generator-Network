There are few clubs in the Premier League who want to see the back of this season more than Newcastle United.

They have struggled for form since the turn of the year, their fans staged a protest walkout against owner Mike Ashley and manager Alan Pardew last week and the local paper is campaigning for the  manager to be sacked.

Dysfunctional would be an understatement for this club. Liverpool, needing a win to keep any faint title hopes alive, could not ask for better opponents at Anfield on Sunday.

Feeling the heat: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is under pressure from the fans after his team's poor season

Making their point: Newcastle fans display a banner in protest against Pardew and owner Mike Ashley during last week's 3-0 win over Cardiff

Not impressed: Newcastle fans let Ashley and Pardew exactly how they felt during last week's win over Cardiff at St James' Park

The verbal abuse was so strong during last week’s 3-0 victory over Cardiff, which ended a run of six straight defeats, that Pardew did not leave the home dug-out.

Two thousand fans, aggrieved by the lack of signings and bad results, walked out after 69 minutes, chosen because the last time the club won a trophy, the Fairs Cup, was in 1969.

The contrast could not have been more stark this week as Ashley marched in his Sports Direct staff for the company’s annual conference of free beer and games.

Newcastle will finish the season in the top 10, with at least eight points more than last season, triggering a staff bonus and most likely keeping Pardew in a job.

Pardew will meet the owner for talks next week but the club distanced themselves from reports on Friday that they have made an approach for St Etienne manager Christophe Galtier, with sources claiming the 47-year-old Frenchman had been offered to them.

Asked if he expects to be Newcastle boss next season, Pardew said: ‘I hope so. There was a lot of frustration and I understand that. Hopefully I can prove, as I’ve done at previous clubs, that I can come back stronger.’

Feeling the love: Pardew did find some fans who were keen to have an autograph before the Cardiff match but the majority are not keen on him

The fans want him out. Pardew is said to be devastated at the abuse he faced last week and will no doubt have noted the front page of the powerful Evening Chronicle on Tuesday: ‘Earth to Pardew, Go Now!

Pardew’s case hasn’t been helped by the lack of investment in his squad. Ashley has not bought a player since January 2013 and the club’s best performer, Yohan Cabaye, was sold to Paris Saint-Germain in January.

There have been problems among the players, too. After a 4-0 defeat by Manchester United last month, Hatem Ben Arfa was thrown out of the dressing room by a team-mate, and Sylvain Marveaux and Gabriel Obertan have not started a game this year.

Troubled campaign: Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa has endured a poor season

Out of favour: Gabriel Obertan, left, and Sylvain Marveax have not started a game for Newcastle this year

The three, who cost in excess of £10million, are unlikely to play again for the club. Those who have played have been poor. Only four teams have conceded more than Newcastle’s 57 goals and no team have won fewer points after going behind than their three.

‘In the second half of the season we have not been good enough,’ said Pardew, who still seems to bear mental scars from his infamous butt. ‘I’ve not been good enough. I let myself down on the touchline. I think I’ve made some calls this year where I could have been more positive tactically. It’s time for reflection.’

Fans are furious at Ashley’s refusal to spend money and chase Champions League football and cup success. They argue he is in a position to do so. Since the Sports Direct owner took control of  Newcastle in 2007 for £134m, the share price of his sports stores has rocketed from £1.60 to £7.70.  

In contrast, the club’s turnover in that period has fallen from £129m to £106m. 

Frugal owner: Ashley has come under fire from fans for his lack of investment in the team

Pardew let his frustrations show during an interview in October on Sky’s Goals on Sunday, hinting Ashley might sometimes hinder the club’s progress. ‘He loves football but he sometimes can’t understand how it works,’ said Pardew. ‘It confuses and upsets him, and when he is upset, he does things that aren’t brilliant for the club.’

Ashley was furious and Pardew’s position was in jeopardy, far more so than after events at Hull. He was warned about his conduct but survived.

Ashley seems unmoved. This week he held the Sports Direct annual conference at St James’ Park. Employees played darts, whizzed remote-control cars around a track, played table football and watched cricketer Steve Harmison and Olympic curler David Murdoch in a version of a Question of Sport. There was a free bar and Ashley Roberts, once part of the Pussycat Dolls, sang to the delighted staff. 

Tyneside legend: Alan Shearer was voted as fifth most important Geordie of all time by Newcastle's local paper

Teams from all over the country played on the pitch as advertising hoardings rolled through a series of messages urging staff to make even more money. ‘The sign is red, the sign is blue, the £300m is there for you. Target for 2014-15 £300m, the three oh oh, here we go.’

‘Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Army. Another year another target smashed, bring on the next.’Ashley revelling in such success will surely rile Newcastle fans further. They feel Ashley is using the club, not helping it.

Across town, a talk was being given on Colin Veitch, a former Newcastle captain listed as the fourth most important Geordie of all time in the local newspaper (Alan Shearer was fifth). Veitch helped Newcastle to three First Division titles, one FA Cup and another four FA Cup finals at the start of the 1900s.

What this club would do for a sniff of a trophy now.
