Everton expect to formally announce the signing of Christian Atsu from Chelsea on loan on Monday but their discussions with Anderlecht over teenage forward David Henen have hit an impasse.

Henen tweeted: 'I hope I can announce some good news later this week but if there's no agreement I wont sign for EFC'. 

Henen has been training with Everton ahead of a proposed £2m transfer.

Atsu meanwhile could be the winger Roberto Martinez has craved this summer.

Gerard Deulofeu was a hit on loan last season but has returned to Barcelona, and Atsu's performances at the World Cup with Ghana suggest he could shine at Goodison Park.

The 22-year-old impressed on loan at Vitesse last year following his move to Chelsea from Porto.
