Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs.

Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design.

A study has demonstrated how an ostrich's speed, energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals, including humans.

Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future running machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs. Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move on two legs (illustrated) could usefully be employed in robot design

'Birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners, with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors,' said lead researcher Dr Jonathan Hurst, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University.

Running birds such as ostriches and emus are not necessarily the most graceful movers, but they save energy and avoid falling, Dr Hurst explained.

'These animals don't care that they appear a little unstable or have a waver in their gait,' he said. 

Working with colleagues from the Royal Veterinary College in London, roboticists from Oregon State University studied different species of birds. 

They used the results to develop a computer model that simulates the birds' behaviour.

The experts concluded that robot design 'must embrace a more relaxed notion of stability' rather than focusing on a rock-steady gait.

This was because the research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique.  

To hop over objects on uneven ground, each of the birds used a largely 'vaulting' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle, for example. 

'The running robots of the future are going to look a lot less robotic,' said Dr Jonathan Hurst. 

'They will be more fluid, like the biological systems in nature. 

'We're not necessarily trying to copy animals, but we do want to match their capabilities.' 

'Their real goal is to limit peak forces, avoid falling, be safe and be as efficient as possible.

'If their upper body seems to lurch around a little as a result, that's okay. 

'What they are accomplishing is really quite elegant.'

The research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique. 

These ranged from quails to turkeys, emus and ostriches.

To hop over objects on uneven ground, each of the birds used a largely 'vaulting' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle.

Unexpectedly, the scientists found that running birds do not prioritise stability in a rigid 'robotic' way.

Instead, they allow their bodies to bounce around to some extent, while ensuring that they never fall.

In order to stay upright, their leg movements may speed up or slow down, much like those of a scrambling rugby player.

Oregon State University doctoral student Christian Hubicki, who co-authored the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, said: 'We should ultimately be able to encode this understanding into legged robots so the robots can run with more speed and agility in rugged terrain.

'These insights may also help us understand the walking and running behaviours of all the common ancestors involved, including theropod dinosaurs such as the velociraptor.'
