Ronald Koeman is weighing up a summer move for Fulham goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.

The 32-year-old is on a season loan at Monaco but has barely figured with Danijel Subasic their regular number one. 

Stekelenburg has played in just four games, including last week's 3-1 win over Reims but has yet to be on the losing side. However, the campaign has proved a disappointment for him so far and he is looking for a fresh challenge.

The former Ajax and Roma keeper, who has 54 caps for Holland, has two years left on contract at Fulham and they will sell in the summer.

Southampton manager Koeman needs an experienced performer after losing England international Fraser Forster for eight months with a fractured kneecap. 

He has 38-year-old Kelvin Davis in reserve with Paulo Gazzaniga, 23, and Cody Cropper, 22, as back-up.
