Real Madrid have officially unveiled new £60million signing James Rodriguez after they completed the transfer of the World Cup Golden Boot winner from Monaco on Tuesday.

The Colombia international has agreed a six-year contract with Madrid and underwent his medical with the club on Tuesday morning before being displayed in front of a crowd at the Santiago Bernabau.

Madrid president Florentino Perez welcomed the forward andcompared him to the late legend of the club, Alfredo Di Stefano who also came to the club from Colombia.

BORN: Colombia, July 12 1991 (age 23)

2007-2008: Envigado (30 apps, 9 gls)

2008-2010: Banfield (42, 5)

2010-2013: Porto (63, 25)

2013-2014: Monaco (34, 9)

2014-NOW: Real Madrid (0, 0)

2011-NOW: Colombia (27, 11)

But why does he get called 'Hamez'?

In fact, that's how Rodriguez's first name should be pronounced, which ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley learned the hard way.

Tyldesley explained his pronunciation of the Colombia talisman's first name, which he dons on the back of his shirt, after being criticised for opting to call him by the English version.

‘I am in the identification business, I am not a linguist,' he said.'Believe it or believe it not, I do try to get pronunciations correct. And, yes, in his native Spanish language James Rodriguez becomes ‘Hamez Rod-reeg-ez’.

'The complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native Spanish speaker, or any other ‘speaker’ but plain English.'

'Colombia will be at your side,' said Perez, which raised a cheer from the fans in the stadium.

Rodriguez said: 'I hope to win many titles here, Hala Madrid,' invoking the club's chant.

An overly-zealous Colombian fan ran on to the pitch to hug Rodriguez and he was restrained by security personnel. 

Neither club have confirmed the fee for the 23-year-old, but reports suggest Madrid have paid about £60million, which would make Rodriguez the fourth most expensive transfer of all time after Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez.

A
 Real Madrid statement read: 'Real Madrid have reached an agreement with
 Monaco for the transfer of James Rodriguez, who will join the club for 
the next six seasons.

'The player will be presented today, Tuesday 22 July, at 20:00 (Spanish time), in the Santiago Bernabeu's presidential box.

'Following
 that, James Rodriguez will take his first steps on the Santiago 
Bernabeu's pitch wearing the Real Madrid shirt and will attend the media
 in the press room.'

Rodriguez
 was one of the revelations of the World Cup, scoring in each of 
Colombia's games as they reached the quarter-finals of the competition 
for the very first time, eventually losing 2-1 to hosts Brazil.

In
 total Rodriguez scored six goals at the World Cup to finish as the 
leading scorer - one clear of Thomas Muller - while his stunning 25-yard
 volley against Uruguay was voted goal of the tournament on FIFA.com.

His
 signing comes less than a week after Madrid brought in another of the 
World Cup's star performers in Germany's Toni Kroos, who moved from 
Bayern Munich for a reported £24m.

It
 also means that, if the reported figure is correct, Madrid now boast 
three of the four most expensive signings in history, having spent a 
world-record £80m on Bale last summer and the same on Ronaldo in
 2009.

The Champions League 
winners would hold a clean sweep of the top three signings but for 
arch-rivals Barcelona, who splashed out a reported £75m on 
Liverpool striker Luis Suarez earlier this summer.

Rodriguez began his professional career with Colombian side Envigado before moving down to Argentinian club Banfield aged 17.

His
 performances for the Buenos Aires outfit attracted the attention of 
Porto, who signed him for £4m in 2010, and three years later he 
joined Monaco for £38.5m after helping the Portuguese side win a 
hat-trick of league titles and the 2011 Europa League.

The
 left-footed forward scored 10 goals in 38 matches in all competitions 
for Monaco last term as they finished second in Ligue 1 behind Paris St 
Germain.

Big-spending 
Monaco said they had not been looking to sell Rodriguez but described 
the deal as 'one of the most significant transfers in football history'.

Monaco vice-president and CEO Vadim Vasilyev said: 'AS Monaco is proud to have helped James Rodriguez reveal his talent to the world as he notably made his mark on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil winning the Golden Boot. James is a fantastic player who achieved great things with AS Monaco.'

A
 statement on www.asm-fc.com read: 'The club would like to take the 
opportunity to thank James for the role he played in getting the club 
back to the Champions League and wishes him the very best for the 
future.

'The club had no
 intention to sell the player, however the time came when the solution 
of a transfer was considered to be the most beneficial solution for all 
parties.

'Monaco is proud to be a party to one of the most significant transfers in football history.

'Monaco
 is a club that will continue to grow and remains focused on the future.
 More than ever it has the ambition to strengthen the team and continue 
to progress for next season.'

Rodriguez is determined to make history at Real Madrid rather than crumble under the pressure of becoming the fourth most expensive player of all time.

Rodriguez : 'The numbers mean nothing to me. I just want to help make history and bring joy to the Madrid fans.

'This is a club which is used to winning and I'm prepared mentally and physically to do so. It is a pleasure to be among so many stars and I'm sure I'll learn a lot from everyone.'

'I've suffered a lot to get here and when you do that then it tastes so much better.

'I will never forget this day. I hope to work hard, to train well, and to experience a lot of joy here.

'I know I am under a lot of pressure, but I am happy to face it.'

MARCA and AS welcomed the signing of Rodriguez with open arms on Wednesday, dedicating their front pages to the new Real star.
