England's top prop Dan Cole may not play again for his country until next year's Six Nations Championship.

Cole,
 who last played in February, needs surgery on a neck problem that 
medics hoped would be cured by rest until September.

But theÂ  
27-year-old is now set to have surgery next week to correct a trapped 
nerve caused by a bulging disc. He may not feature for England until 
next February.

Big blow: Leicester Tigers and England prop Dan Cole has been ruled out for six months with a neck injury

Cole has played 41 times since he made his debut at the 2010 Six Nations Championship, as well as representing the Lions last summer as a substitute in all three Tests. Bath's David Wilson has stepped into the tighthead role, backed up by Sale's Henry Thomas.

England loosehead Alex Corbisiero has also spent much of the season on the sidelines with a knee problem but was expected to be a substitute in last night's Amlin Challenge Cup semi-final against Bath in Cardiff.

Wasps go into Saturday's European Champions Cup qualifier against Stade Francais in Paris without Fijian No 8.

Ouch: Cole injured himself on England duty and will have surgery on a trapped nerve in his neck next week

Nathan Hughes, who is getting married on 
the Pacific island. Dai Young, Wasps director of rugby, admitted: 'It is
 disappointing Nathan won't be with us, but in fairness to him he 
organised the wedding before he even came here last summer.'

Wasps
 won the first leg 30-29 last Sunday - thanks to Andy Goode's 
last-minute penalty - with the overall winners completing the line-up 
for the revamped 20-team European competition next season.

Young
 added: 'Last Sunday, we were very good in patches and a little bit 
inaccurate in patches, pretty much the story of our season. A lot of 
aspects of the game were very pleasing, but it is frustrating when you 
work so hard to gain points and then you let some slip.'
