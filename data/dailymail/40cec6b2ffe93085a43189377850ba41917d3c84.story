Blamed: George Osborne is being blamed for his party's poor showing in opinion polls by senior Conservative figures

George Osborne is facing renewed calls to give up his role co-ordinating his party's campaigning after being blamed for the poor opinion polls by senior Conservative figures.

The Chancellor is reported to be facing a 'whispering campaign' as members of the highest echelons of the party warn a change is needed before the general election.

There have been calls for him to be replaced as Chancellor in a job swap with the Foreign Secretary William Hague, according to The Sunday Telegraph, amid concerns that he fails to understand the middle classes and their economic struggles.

Mr Hague has repeatedly said he does not want the job.

The calls came as Labour stepped up its attacks on a raft of Coalition welfare reforms, saying tax and benefit changes have left families nearly £900 a year worse off.

Osborne's critics have pointed to the last budget, which penalised stay-at-home mothers rather than help them, along with failing to introduce recognition for marriage in the tax system.

The mortgage guarantee scheme has left some critics unhappy while Treasury plans for extra Whitehall cuts after 2015 has caused clashes with Cabinet ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, The Sunday Telegraph has reported.

One MP told the paper: 'He might have helped push through gay marriage but in my constituency people are more angry about the removal of child benefit, a policy designed and implemented by a rich Chancellor in a safe seat with absolutely no idea how hard it is for ordinary folk.'

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps however has supported Mr Osborne, saying he was doing a 'heck of a job in very difficult circumstances' as he battled to bring down the deficit.

Mr Shapps admitted the Tories had no more than a '50-50' chance of winning an overall majority at the next election.

Meanwhile, Labour has said Coalition tax and benefit changes have left families nearly £900 a year worse off on average.

A significant squeeze on state help starts to bite from tomorrow, with thousands joining protests across the UK yesterday against the so-called 'bedroom tax'.

Charities say they are braced for a period of 'misery' and increased homelessness for the poorest families and the disabled as the austerity measures kick in.

But ministers say tackling the spiralling welfare bill, which counts for around a third of all spending, is a vital part of the Government's deficit-reduction strategy.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith insisted that even with the tough measures, the overall cost to the taxpayer continued to rise.

'The reality is that this country is not cutting welfare, it is managing the growth at a lower level,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

'Across the UK - contrary to the headlines - all those on benefits will still see cash increases in every year of this Parliament.'

Campaign: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said households faced a 'shocking' cut at the same time as the top rate of income tax was reduced

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said households faced a 'shocking' cut at the same time as the top rate of income tax was reduced from 50p to 45p.

Institute for Fiscal Studies figures showed a £9.93 boost from this year's Budget was far outweighed by a £901 annual hit from previously announced measures, he said.

'While ministers trumpet the small rise in the income tax personal allowance, they should admit that it is hugely outweighed by things like cuts to tax credits and child benefit, higher VAT, the bedroom tax and the granny tax."

'These shocking figures show the huge hit millions of families are facing at the very same time David Cameron and George Osborne are giving millionaires an average £100,000 tax cut.

'They are giving with one hand, but taking away much more with the other.'

The Labour and Tory feuding came 
after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith blurted out that he 
had given up trying to cut the benefits bill.

He
said he is simply ‘managing’ the ever-rising increase in handouts – and
was forced to deny his new ‘universal’ benefit is in turmoil.

His
comments were in stark contrast to remarks by his own Minister for the 
Disabled, Esther McVey, who told The Mail on Sunday she is determined to
stop widespread abuse of the £13 billion-a-year disability benefit 
claimed by three million.

And
Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking
the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6. The Labour
leaflet, designed to look like a lottery flyer, states: ‘£100,000 win 
for everyone earning £1 million.’

In fact, people who earn £1 million, will be £42,500 better off per year.

Around 660,000 social housing tenants face deemed to have a spare bedroom face losing an average £14 a week from tomorrow.

The Government says ending what it calls a 'spare room subsidy' will free up unused space needed by people on waiting lists and save taxpayers £500 million a year.

Critics argue it will have a disproportionate impact on the disabled and the National Housing Federation warns it could actually increase costs as people downsize to private rented homes.

Council tax benefit is also replaced tomorrow by a new system run by local authorities but with 10 per cent less funding.

Anti-poverty campaigners say around 2.4 million poor families face an average £138 a year rise in their bills, with nearly two million having to pay for the first time.

Working-age benefits and tax credits will rise by a below-inflation 1 per cent from the start of the tax year on April 6 - the start of a three-year cap that represents a real-terms cut.

Two days later, disability living allowance (DLA) begins to be replaced by the personal independence payment (PIP) - which charities say will remove support from many in real need.

And later in the month, trials begin of a £500-a-week cap on any household's benefits in four London boroughs.

The chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, Leslie Morphy, said: 'Our poorest households face a bleak April as they struggle to budget for all these cuts coming at once.

'People are already cutting back on the essentials of food and heating but there is only so much they can do.

'The result will be misery - cold rooms, longer queues at food banks, broken families, missed rent payments and yet more people facing homelessness - devastating for those directly affected, but bad for us all.'

As the political battle over benefits heated up, Mr Shapps revealed figures showing that 878,300 people who were on incapacity benefit dropped their claims rather than complete a medical assessment.

That was a third of the total, he said, and included people on benefits because of blisters, acne, and strains and sprains.

Of the 1.44 million who had been reassessed, 55 per cent were found fit to work immediately and another 23.9 per cent able to do some level of work - leaving just 232,000 declared not fit to work.

'Welfare makes up a third of this country's spending - so it's our job to make sure it's getting to the people who really need it,' he said.

'Our reforms are about freeing people from a system of dependency that's trapped them and their families for decades - and people are getting back into work as a result.

'These figures demonstrate how the welfare system was broken under Labour and why our reforms are so important.'

Meanwhile, a group of leading churches has branded the Government's cuts to benefits as 'unjust', saying the most vulnerable people are paying a 'disproportionate price' under austerity measures.

The Baptist Union of Great Britain, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church and the Church of Scotland have come together to criticise the public perception of people in poverty.

They say politicians have misrepresented those on benefits in order to justify the cuts - an axe which they say falls unfairly on the poor.

The benefit cuts also suggest that people in poverty 'deserve' their situation and that they are not valued, according to Paul Morrison, public issues policy advisor at the Methodist Church.

'Our feeling is that these benefit changes are a symptom of an understanding of people in poverty in the United Kingdom that is just wrong,' he told the BBC.

'It is an understanding of people that they somehow deserve their poverty, that they are somehow "lesser", that they are not valued.

'The churches believe that they are valued and we believe that they should be treated much more fairly than they are being.'

The four churches joined forces to tackle what they see as the Government manipulating statistics to effectively vilify the poor, creating a culture that blames them for their own poverty.

They have written a report on poverty and sent it to every MP and Member of the Scottish Parliament.
