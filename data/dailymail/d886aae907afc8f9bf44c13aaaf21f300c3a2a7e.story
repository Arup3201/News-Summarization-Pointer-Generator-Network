A top base jumper competing in a world cup event was left hanging high and dry in Turkey after getting caught on the side of a skyscraper.

The jumper's parachute snared itself on the side of the 780ft tall Sapphire building in Istanbul during the ProBASE World Cup yesterday.

He was eventually rescued by firefighters using a wire rope suspended cage platform for glass cleaning.

The 54-storey Sapphire is the tallest building in Istanbul and Turkey, located in the central business district of Levent.

It is the seventh tallest building in Europe, and Turkey's first 'ecological' skyscraper.

This year it played host to a leg of the ProBASE World Cup, which is a tour of events that started after the Spain BASE 08 event, held at the Gran Hotel Bali in Benidorm.

It brings together some of the world's best base jumpers to compete over several disciplines, including target landing, acrobatics, wing suit flying and tracking.

Base jumping is the activity of parachuting from a fixed object as opposed to skydiving, which is parachuting from an aircraft.

Fixed objects can be buildings, antennas, smoke stacks, bridges, power towers, cliffs, cable cars, dams or any other object high enough to jump from.
