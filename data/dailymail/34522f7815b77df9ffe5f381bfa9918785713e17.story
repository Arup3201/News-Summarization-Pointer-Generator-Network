Kabeer Yousaf, pictured in traditional Asian clothing, is accused of extorting money from prostitutes while working as a PCSO in east London. He denies the seven charges against him

A PCSO helped extort money from prostitutes for a violent Romanian pimp and was even seen leaving a brothel in full uniform zipping up his flies, a court has heard.

Kabeer Yousaf, 30, a Police Community Support Officer, is alleged to have forced prostitutes to hand over cash or provide sexual services.

A court heard that, as part of his police work, he guarded a brothel witnesses had earlier seen him leaving.

Yousaf, who is said to have been 'motivated by sex and greed', now faces a string of charges, including rape and blackmail, which were allegedly committed during his time with the Metropolitan Police.

He is accused of helping alleged pimp Inout Motroc, 35, his wife, Monut, and his 'enforcer', Bogdan Gherga, run a string of brothels across east London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Caroline Haughey, prosecuting, told the court: 'Kabeer Yousaf is a Police Community Support Officer, a man who chose his role to support the police and work within and for his community.

'The role is one of responsibility and trustworthiness, something he abused as far as he could - demanding money of prostitutes in order that they would not be arrested, and when that money could not be provided he obtained sexual services in lieu.

'A man so arrogant that he was seen walking away from the brothel in full uniform, in broad daylight, doing his zip up.'

She added: 'Instead of reporting Motroc and his associates to his police colleagues, he joined them in their enterprise, trying to force other prostitutes into paying protection money to Motroc and others, using his role as a PCSO and trying to pass them off as police officers. '

Describing how a witness spotted Yousaf guarding one of the brothels Ms Haughey said: 'She had seen a PCSO coming and going out of the address.

'When the investigations were taking place she noticed the same PCSO standing outside the address.

'Kabeer Yousaf had been given the very unfortunate job of guarding the crime scene, in an address where he was participating in criminal activity.'

She said the criminal gang 'delighted in exploiting vulnerable women who were working as prostitutes - controlling them, trafficking them and in some cases sexually abusing them, when they did not do as directed'.

Mrs Haughey said: 'Ionut Motroc is the main mover in the criminal network, having arrived in the UK from Romania he created an empire controlling prostitutes and brothels in East London and bullying and threatening those that did not comply to his demands.'

The pair face trial alongside Ionut Moroc's wife, Monica, 35, of Forest Gate, east London, and his 'enforcer' Bogdan Ghergel, 30, of Stratford, east London.

The four defendants face 28 counts between them and deny all the charges.
