Zara Phillips may come across as the wholesome, down-to-earth outdoorsy type but it seems there's more to the royal than she lets on.

The 32-year-old has revealed that not only has she read racy novel 50 Shades of Grey - she thought it was tame.

'Oh yes, I read it,' said the mother-of-one, before adding, slightly sarcastically: 'I thought it was goooood.'

But not everything was quite to her taste. 'I think, when I read it I was expecting it to be amazing,' she continued. '[And then] it was a bit like, oh, is that it?'

The royal, who is 15th in line to the throne, was speaking in an interview with the Telegraph to promote Owlient, a tech company that she fronts.

Despite declaring her intention to put second-time motherhood on hold until after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016, Zara happily discussed her penchant for the naughty novel, which has sold millions of copies worldwide.

She would not, however, reveal whether or not she plans to see the imminent film adaptation of the book, which is scheduled for release in February 2015

Instead, the royal's focus is on her eventing career and she hopes to improve on the team silver achieved at the London 2012 Olympics.

She is also working on her fitness which, she says, took a hit following the birth of daughter Mia in January this year.

'After I had my daughter, I was very weak,' she says.

'Physically weaker but mentally weaker, too. Everything wasn’t 100 per cent. I wasn’t at my best, I hadn’t ever not ridden for that long.

'I didn’t realise how fit I was before and how many different muscles you use.'

Now back to winning ways, the equestrienne has just over a year to go before the Olympics commence but has already begun a campaign to impress the Team GB selectors.

Her most recent attempt came in August when, at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, she managed to finish strongly - with a little help from her 13-year-old horse, High Kingdom.

Speaking afterwards, she said: 'I wasn’t nervous. 

'I knew what I was sat on. He’s just a fantastic horse and he just kept jumping and got me out of trouble.

'All credit to him, he was in charge really. I was just steering and trying to hang on.'

The 33-year-old is now hotly tipped for for the Rio Olympics and has seen her career come on in leaps and bounds since the end of her more rebellious twenties.

She does, however, still like to do things her own way, not least when she sold pictures of Mia to a celebrity magazine for a reported fee of £150,000.

Senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal with Hello Magazine in advance and were taken by surprise when the pictures appeared in March.
