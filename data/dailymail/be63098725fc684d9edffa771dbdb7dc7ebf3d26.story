A dozen red roses is the quick way to win many a woman's heart on Valentine's Day. Temporarily, at least.

But if you're really serious about your partner and don't think 12 flowers is enough to demonstrate your love, then one extreme gifting company might just have the answer.

Luxury website veryfirstto.com is offering one dedicated romantic the opportunity to fill their beloved's garden with a sweet-smelling blanket of some 1.2 million rose petals, for the coronary-inducing cost of £70,000.

Roses are red: Your beloved could wake up to a garden blanketed with rose petals this 14 February - if you find a spare £70,000 knocking about behind the sofa

Your sweetheart would wake up on 14 February surrounded by a sea of rosy petals, as the company will scatter the flowery bulk in both front and back gardens, with a surface area of up to 600 sq ft.

The daring endeavour will be executed surreptitiously with the help of floral company Petals and Roses, whose Production Director Philip Davies said: 'This is the most ambitious and romantic project we have ever undertaken. She must be a very special woman.'

Marcel Knobil, brand expert and founder of veryfirstto.com, says: 'We are thrilled to help ensure that an exceptionally lucky woman wakes up to a dream vision.

'Veryfirstto.com is dedicated to enabling individuals to be the first to have newly launching luxury products and experiences, you don't get much more luxurious than this'.

Petal carpet: What could be more romantic than a garden scattered with 1.2 million rose petals? A garden scattered with 1.2 million chocolates? Mmm...

The cost of the big petal-drop will be adjusted according to garden size. Our advice is to think ahead and furnish your loved-one with a rake, should you choose to invest in the experience. And perhaps offer to lead the clean-up come 17 February.

After all, there is precious little less romantic than 1.2 million decomposing rose petals rotting away in one's garden just as the weather begins to warm up.

Other romantic gift ideas featured on the site are the opportunity to propose to your partner via a 30-second television commercial to be screened on national TV on Valentine's Day (£135,000), a Dolce & Gabbana diamond print tie (£120) and exclusive seats on the private Lynx II space shuttle (approximately £67,000 and available to Gold Members only).

Previous experiences offered on the website include the world's most extravagant Christmas dinner (£125,000 for four) and tickets to a celebrity-filled party to preview an exhibition of Coldplay album artwork in Camden.

What woman can resist roses? Unless of course there are 1.2 million of their petals decomposing in your garden come 17 February...
