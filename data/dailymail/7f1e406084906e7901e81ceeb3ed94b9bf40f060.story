Two dedicated dog owners have created a tear-jerking video that shows the incredible resiliency of man’s best friend and their dedication and love for their cancer-stricken companion.

Viewers are taken on an emotional journey as Sheridan the dog loses a leg to cancer yet remains the same playful and happy-go-lucky pooch that he was before his life-altering surgery.

Sheridan still loves to roll in the sand, leap into pools, obey commands for dog biscuits and chase his owner’s remote-controlled drone at their home on the Caribbean island of Grenada.

Last July, Sheridan was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, the most common bone tumour found in dogs. His right forelimb had to be amputated to slow the spread of cancer and prevent pain.

Despite having cancer Sheridan looks like a normal, healthy dog when the six-minute video begins with a look at his life before his leg was amputated. 

He runs on the beach, swims at a waterfall with one of his owners and plays with another dog in the sand.

But the video takes a heart-wrenching turn as viewers are taken into the operating room while veterinarians remove the loveable dog’s right front leg.

After surgery Sheridan underwent six treatments of chemotherapy and scans

His owners, Morgan and Zach, who are originally from Indiana, were granted access as they are attending veterinary school at St George’s University.

After the surgery the video shows the heart-warming moment three-legged Sheridan – with a massive surgical scar – is greeted by his owners and leaps out of his cage to return home.

Despite the agonising ordeal Sheridan is still the same playful dog who loves to run up and down the beach, roll on the floor and play with other dogs.

Sheridan's owners said: ‘For the time he has left, an excellent quality of life is what matters most'

After surgery Sheridan underwent six treatments of chemotherapy and monitoring to find out if the cancer had spread.

The median survival time for osteosarcoma after amputation and chemotherapy is eight months to a year.

In a YouTube caption, his owners wrote: ‘For the time he has left, an excellent quality of life is what matters most.’
