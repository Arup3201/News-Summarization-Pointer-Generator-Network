Michael Brown struggled with the cop who killed him and tried to grab the officer's gun, a report has claimed. 

Darren Wilson - the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, who shot the teenager - has told investigators he feared for his life when he opened fire.

He claims he was trying to get out of his police car when Brown pushed him back into the driver's seat and reached for his gun through the open window.

Aftermath: This is the first picture of Darren Wilson standing over Michael Brown after shooting him dead 

Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle

The teenager punched and scratched him repeatedly, he claims, leaving him with swelling on his face and cuts on his neck.

Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform.

However the account leaked to the New York Times last night stops there, and does not explain why Brown was then shot four times outside the car.

A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening.

They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands.

One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer.

Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. 

They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. 

There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. 

According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - Brown made him fear for his life. 

'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown

Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger.

Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.

City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights.

In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime.

His willingness to testify surprised many. 

However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. 

Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled.

They are expected to vote by mid-November.

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson.

He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial.

However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson’s use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. 

According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry.

People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. 

Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. 

The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun.

One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' 

Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times by Officer Wilson in the middle of a Ferguson, Missouri, street. His death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations

He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.'  

Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. 

Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny.

Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. 

To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.
