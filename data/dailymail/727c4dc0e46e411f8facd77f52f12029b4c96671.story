West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will not be making any more new signings before the transfer window closes on Friday night.

Allardyce, who boosted his squad with Italian pair Marco Borriello and Antonio Nocerino signing loan deals until the end of the season last week, was unsuccessful with a £3million-plus bid for Leeds and Scotland forward Ross McCormack.

The Hammers boss was tipped to go back in with an improved offer but said: 'I don't expect to be too busy now. Those two signings (Borriello and Nocerino) reach our 25-man squad limit so I don't see us doing any more business.

'If one is flagged up that is an outstanding quality player that would make a difference immediately, then we would do something, but the likelihood of that is very slim.'

Borriello has swapped Roma for a Premier League survival scrap, while Nocerino has traded AC Milan for the east end.

Seven-cap Borriello, 31, is a striker with close to a hundred career goals to his name, accrued at the likes of Milan, Juventus, Genoa and Roma.

He joined the capital club in the summer of 2010 amid rumours of interest from Manchester City, while he won the title with Juventus during a 2012 loan spell.

Nocerino, 28, has also been drafted in to help the Hammers in their battle to earn Premier League survival, with Allardyce's men currently in the relegation zone.

Capped 15 times by Italy, Nocerino is known to English fans for scoring a penalty against England at Euro 2012.

The ex-Juventus and Palermo man has been a bit-part player this season having previously been a key man for the club he joined in the summer of 2011.

Speaking ahead of Wednesday's trip across London to play Chelsea, Allardyce said: 'Antonio is very excited to play in the Premier League. He's very excited and wants to get into the Italy squad for the World Cup.

'Milan took Michael Essien from Chelsea which left the door open for Antonio to come in.

'He is fine to be selected as soon as possible but Marco needs a bit of time as he hasn't played a game for six weeks.

'Antonio is your box-to-box midfield player and has the quality of finding space. Playing at the top level in Italy brings a great deal of experience to go with the talent he has got. He is an intelligent footballer.

'Marco, it is about getting him on the field and talking about nothing else other than scoring goals. We need somebody in that box to be productive and to start scoring, someone who only needs one or two chances. At the moment we are needing six or seven.'

West Ham sit third-bottom in the Premier League while Chelsea are in third, just two points behind leaders Arsenal.

Allardyce said: 'Jose (Mourinho) has made Chelsea very difficult to break down again and that frees up their quality players to make an impact. But West Brom should have beaten them earlier in the season, so if we play to our best we can get a good result.'
