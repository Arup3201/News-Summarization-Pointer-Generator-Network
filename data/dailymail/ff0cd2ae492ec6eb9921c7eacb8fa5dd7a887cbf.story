It's deja vu all over again for Arsenal in the Champions League. Tuesday night's brave but preventable Champions League exit against Monaco was the fifth time in a row Arsene Wenger has been knocked out at the last-16 stage. And once again it was the first leg that cost him.

Arsenal were knocked out in France on away goals, a 2-0 away win failing to make up for a catastrophic 3-1 loss at The Emirates.

Their players know the history. 'We say same thing every year,’ complained defender Laurent Koscielny. 'Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right - play well in two games.'

Aaron Ramsey concurred: ‘We’ve always gone out to Bayern Munich and Barcelona at this stage but no disrespect to Monaco, we thought we’d have a good opportunity to qualify. But we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg. It’s nearly again, but it’s not enough.’

After losing 4-3 on aggregate to Barcelona in 2011 – beating them 2-1 in the first leg before losing 3-1 at the Nou Camp - Arsenal's first leg travails have hurt them every 12 months.

(AC Milan win 4-3 on aggregate)

Arsenal were a shambles in the San Siro as Kevin-Prince Boateng, Robinho (two) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (from the penalty spot) tore them apart. 

Incredibly, Arsene Wenger's men clawed back three of the goals in the first half at The Emirates through Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and Robin van Persie (penalty) but still couldn't force extra-time with Robin van Persie missing from close range.

Where did it all go wrong?  

Fans will remember the Van Persie miss (perhaps coloured by the player's subsequent exit), but it was the mental collapse in the first leg that cost Arsenal. 

The first goal was spectacular, if avoidable, but the other three were brutally poor defending. Against a decent, but not world-beating attack, the likes of Johan Djourou proved they didn't belong.

2013

Arsenal 1 Bayern Munich 3; Bayern Munich 0 Arsenal 2 

3-3 on aggregate. Bayern Munich win on away goals

Exactly the same set of results as this week. 

Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern a seemingly unassailable first leg lead, only for Arsenal to come so close to an astonishing comeback in Germany with goals from Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny. 

Bayern ended up winning the Champions League

Where did it all go wrong? 

It's a little harsh to criticise a defeat against Europe's best side, but Arsenal were naive in the first leg. 

Having weathered a Bayern storm, and found a way back into the tie at 2-1, the Gunners committed too many men forward, and conceded a sloppy third.

Bayern win 3-1 on aggregate

Pep Guardiola's side effectively settled the tie at The Emirates with Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos on target after Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the first half for a foul on Arjen Robben in the box.

Once again Arsenal battled back once they had little to play for and the pressure was off and Lukasz Podolski scored to give Wenger's men a deserved draw in the Olympic Stadium as they chased a shock victory.

Where did it all go wrong? 

Mesut Ozil's missed penalty was the turning point. Before that point they had bossed the game against the European champions. It took the wind out of their sails, and Bayern eventually produced their magic.

Arsenal 1 Monaco 3; Monaco 0 Arsenal 2 

3-3 on aggregate (Monaco win on away goals)

Arsenal keep finding new ways to cock it up. Against the weakest opposition left, Arsenal conceded a killer third goal in injury-time at The Emirates. 

It meant they had to score three in Monaco, they managed two and wasted a hatful of chances. Hurtfully, the languid Dimitar Berbatov said Monaco had 'wanted it more' than Arsenal in the first leg.

Where did it all go wrong?

For all the shambles in the first 91 minutes of the first leg, Arsenal were back in the tie when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a stoppage-time goal to make it 2-1.

For an unimaginable reason, however, they continued to attack all-out, and with nine men ahead of the ball, gave up a shocking third. 

However wonderful the effort in the second leg, the task was always likely to be too great.
