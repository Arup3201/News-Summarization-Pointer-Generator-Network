Chief executive Ross McEwan used his opening address at RBS annual meeting to signal a retreat from the high street

More RBS branches will shut because some of them ‘hardly see a customer’, the bank’s chief executive warned yesterday.  

Ross McEwan and chairman Sir Philip Hampton both used their opening addresses at the bank’s annual meeting yesterday to signal a retreat from the high street.

Mr McEwan said: ‘The truth is some branches hardly see a customer, which is why we are taking tough decisions about closing some, and sometimes making staff redundant – although that is always a last resort.’

RBS, which includes NatWest, has 1,900 UK branches – 310 of which will be spun off in 2016 to form part of the resurrected Williams & Glyn brand.

It has already earmarked 100 branches for
 closure so far this year, including in rural communities such as East 
Linton in Scotland and Kirkbymoorside, a small market town in North 
Yorkshire.

The bank would not say how many more outlets it plans to axe beyond this year’s 100 but Sir Philip said there was ‘no floor’. 

RBS is desperate to cut costs after slumping to a £8.2 billion last year. But its latest warning about branches was greeted with dismay by campaigners last night.

Derek French, spokesman for the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said: ‘The bank has absolutely no excuse for doing this to communities most of whom do not fall in the one customer a day category.’

RBS is increasingly serving customers in more remote communities with its fleet of mobile vans, which provide basic banking services.

Sir Philip stressed there would still be 'a major role for branches’ and said RBS still has more branches than Asda and Sainsbury’s , which have just over 1500 stores between them.

RBS said more of its customers are doing their banking electronically, via internet banking or mobile ‘apps’ on smartphones.

Online and mobile transactions have grown by 232pc since 2011, while branch transactions have declined by around 30pc.  

A succession of banks, including Barclays, HSBC and Santander have also warned they will shrink their branch network on the same basis.

RBS bosses were more tight lipped 
yesterday about the implications of Scottish independence and insisted 
they would not take sides over September’s referendum.

Mr McEwan said some branches hardly see a customer, which had led to some 
'tough decisions' about closing some branches and making staff redundant

Sir Philip Hampton stressed ‘we are not taking one side or the other’ and we will continue to maintain that neutral position.’

But he warned  a ‘yes’ vote  creates a  ‘great deal of uncertainty’ over areas such as ‘our credit rating, tax and regulation.’

The issue is particularly sensitive for RBS whose headquarters have been in Edinburgh since it was founded in 1727.  The bank also has 12,000 staff and 290 branches in Scotland.

Shareholders -  including the Government-backed UK Financial Investments which owns an 81 stake in RBS – yesterday approved lavish bonuses for last year.

Controversial six and seven figure fixed allowances designed to dodge the EU bonus cap were also approved.

Despite making a loss £8.2billion loss last year,  RBS paid out £576million in bonuses and handed staff people received packages worth more than £1million.

The huge loss last year was driven by a spiralling bill for mis-selling and is the biggest since it notched up the worst loss in UK corporate history of £24billion in 2008.

If you're fed up with your bank - or your local branch is about to close its doors - and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
£100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf.

If you switch your main current 
account to one of the Post Office’s Standard, Packaged or Control 
current accounts the bank will give you a £100 gift card.

Lloyds Bank is tempting 
desperate savers with its Club Lloyds current account - offering up 
to 4 per cent for balances between £4,000 and £5,000. But you will have to pay in at least £1,500.

TSB has also recently launched an interest-paying, the Plus Account pays 5 per cent on balances of up to £2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £500.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers

whereby both parties will receive £50 if an existing customers 
successfully recommends friends or family to the bank.
