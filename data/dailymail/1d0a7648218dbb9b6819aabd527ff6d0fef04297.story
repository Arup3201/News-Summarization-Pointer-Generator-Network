Murdering the CEO of America's largest investment firm wouldn't be enough to quench the 'blood lust' of big bank's fiercest opponents, Bill Clinton allegedly told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

Geithner recalled the conversation in an interview with The New York Times Magazine earlier this week.

' "You could take Lloyd Blankfein into a dark alley and 
slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days. Then the 
blood lust would rise again," ' Geithner says Clinton told him.

During the 2008 financial crisis the U.S. government gave out billions of dollars in loans to banks deemed 'too big to fail' including Goldman Sachs through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP.

Goldman Sachs came under scrutiny from Congress and several federal agencies afterward for predatory lending practices that contributed to the financial and housing crises.

Geithner, who worked in various positions at Treasury during the Clinton administration, served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the first half of the financial crisis.

He is one of three government officials, along with Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who is also a former Goldman Sachs CEO, credited with formulating TARP.

Congress passed TARP in the final months of President George W. Bush's presidency. Geithner assumed responsibility for implementing the unpopular program when the became Treasury Secretary in January 2009 at the start of Barack Obama's presidency.

'People think we gave the banks this free gift of hundreds and hundreds 
of billions of dollars, using the taxpayersâ€™ money that we would never 
see again,' Geithner explained to a group of Harvard students recently. 'We are going to earn, all in, a couple hundred billion dollars.'

'Much of the dominant view about the strategy is the inverse of the truth.'

Goldman Sachs and the other too big to fail banks have since repaid their government loans and are once again turning a profit.

Geithner left his post in 2013 after serving as Treasury Secretary throughout Obama's entire first term. He now works at a private equity firm.

longtime government employee also has a memoir coming out about his time time
