The tribunal was told that Detective Constable Andrea Brown had been suffering from depression and was signed off

A detective on sick leave due to 'stress' and 'depression' for most of two years jetted off to the Caribbean when she was supposed to meet her bosses, a tribunal heard.

Detective Constable Andrea Brown, from the Metropolitan Police, had been expected at a meeting to discuss her well-being after spending 18 months of the previous two years off sick but instead flew to Barbados that day for a family holiday, the hearing was told.

The tribunal was told she’d been suffering depression and was signed off between June 2011 and April 2012. She returned to work, but has been signed off again since March this year.

DC Brown claims she suffered a campaign of sexual harassment while working at Sutton CID in south London after her boss falsely bragged he’d had sex with her.

She claims that the Met’s refusal to offer her a flexible work rota so she could look after her teenage daughter caused her 'severe work-related depression'.

The tribunal heard that while working at Croydon CID, a senior colleague, now retired Det Insp Patrick Franklin, began making her feel ‘uncomfortable’.

DC Brown said: 'I didn’t trust him.

'A male colleague told me that DI Franklin had been questioning him about our friendship and asked if there was something going on between us.

'He told him that our relationship was platonic and that we were just friends.

'DI Franklin told him that he was ‘tapping me’, which is street or black slang for having sex with somebody.

'This was an absolute lie and I was so angry that I decided to make a formal complaint.'

DC Brown said she was then moved back to Sutton Police Station along with DI Franklin who she claims began making 'inappropriate' comments to her.

She said: 'Sometimes he made me feel uncomfortable by making personal comments about my appearance and being a bit over familiar with me.

'On one occasion, I heard a voice say ‘looking fit girl’. When I turned round, DI Franklin was walking behind me.

'There were other little comments like when he saw me eating fruit at my desk one day and asked what I was eating. I said ‘fruit’ and he said he’d noticed I’d put on some weight recently.'

DC Brown was told she would have to 'substantially' increase the number of late shifts she was working from four days until seven days a week.

She put a request in to change the rota because her daughter had 'lived out of a suitcase' as she had to stay with different people each evening.

But her request was refused, leading to a complaint, and in April 2011 she discovered her father had cancer.

She said: 'I was already feeling under tremendous pressure as a result of the refusal of my flexible work application and the news of my father’s diagnosis was devastating.'

DC Brown was still on sick leave when her father died, but she says her desk carried on 'bombarding' her with calls on the day of his funeral.

She said: 'I felt totally wiped out as well as physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted.'

DC Brown added: 'The thought of returning to Sutton made me so distressed that I suffered a relapse of my depressive illness and I was signed off sick with work-related stress by my GP from November 28th.'

The next day, she was sent a letter from the Met stating they would be taking management action against her because of unsatisfactory attendance unless she returned on December 13th.

She said: 'I got the impression they thought I was not really sick at all and just pretending to be stressed because I wasn’t getting my own way.

'They knew they were bullying me and causing me stress, but wanted me to stop complaining and get back to work.'

Instead of returning to work though, she jetted off to Barbados with her mum and daughter - although she had not been granted leave.

DC Brown said: 'This had been booked in August 2011.

'I felt the trip would assist my recuperation. I had not realised permission had to be obtained.'

Deshpal Panesah, representing the Met, said: 'Without informing your line manager of your whereabouts, you flew to Barbados on the first day of leave and stayed there until after Christmas.

'There was due to a case conference meeting with you during that time and you didn’t attend.

'It was unauthorised leave and that is a professionally serious matter.'

He added: 'You were not bullied, it was your perception of when you were being disagreed with. That is the reality.

'What you term as bullying is the normal management of an officer in their duty to fulfil their rota.'

DC Brown is suing the Met, claiming indirect sex discrimination, disability discrimination, victimisation and a claim under part-time work regulations.

The tribunal continues.
