Such is the strength of Manchester City’s squad this season, even the most expensive defender in the Premier League, £32million Eliaquim Mangala, acknowledges he isn’t guaranteed a regular starting place.

Mangala will miss out when the champions kick off their title defence against Newcastle United having only arrived at the club from Porto on Monday.

But even when fully up to speed, the Frenchman faces competition from club captain Vincent Kompany and World Cup finalist Martin Demichelis in the centre of defence. Matija Nastasic, 21, has already won 13 caps for Serbia.

‘Guarantees don’t exist, what really counts is how I play in training sessions and games when I get the chance. Everybody in the squad wants to play and you can only put 11 players in the side,’ said Mangala.

‘The only thing you can do as a player is make your own guarantees by doing well in training and giving the manager a difficult decision. There are plenty of games this season and I am sure I will get my chance.’

Pellegrini has added Mangala, goalkeeper Willy Caballero, right-back Bacary Sagna and midfielders Fernando, Frank Lampard and Bruno Zuculini to a squad already good enough to win the league.

He now has two top-quality players for every position which means he can choose between England No1 Joe Hart and Caballero in goal, or Stevan Jovetic, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero up front.

The canny Chilean even has the resources to rest some of his World Cup stars for their Premier League opener in the north-east.

Competition: Managala faces stiff competition if he wants to partner Vincent Kompany in defence

Pellegrini had seven of his players from Argentina, Brazil, France and Belgium reach the knockout stages in Brazil. Some of them, like Kompany, may be asked to face Newcastle after last Sunday’s 3-0 defeat in the Community Shield - but not all.

‘The most important thing is for players to have the rest that they need particularly between one season and the next,’ said the City boss, who will be wary of throwing in Aguero after his muscular problems last season.

‘Most summers you have the World Cup or European Championship or Copa America, it is very difficult. That’s why I think players have so many injuries. Not only in our team, in every team.

‘If I put all the World Cup players in together, maybe after 50 minutes they would not continue. We will try to make a mix. Of the eight who arrived late to pre-season, we will see which of them are in the right condition to play.’

Pressure: The 23-year-old says he isn't worried about his price tag as he didn't set it

Mangala glimpsed the size of his new club on Thursday evening when he joined his team-mates at a glamorous event called City Live, in which 5,000 fans turned up to see the new signings and hear a musical set from legendary Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.

The 23-year-old isn’t daunted by the size of his price tag which eclipses the record amount paid by Manchester United for Rio Ferdinand in 2002.

‘The price wasn’t set by me and it’s something I don’t pay attention to. If you can’t live with that sort of pressure, football isn’t the job for you. Stay at home and do another type of job,’ he said.

‘I’m here because it’s a chance to play alongside other quality players. From a career development point of view and to progress as a player, City were the club for me.’

Right move: Mangala said that Manchester City were the perfect club for him after leaving Porto

He is setting his targets high, and not just domestically. ‘As current champions, the first thing is to hold onto that title. And the big picture for City has always been to try and ultimately win the Champions League, so I think it has to remain a big target for us.’

Mangala thinks he will be fit enough to fight for a place by the end of the month.

Today, some of the scrutiny will be on the dug-outs following a bust-up last season between manager Alan Pardew and Pellegrini. The Newcastle boss apologised for swearing at his counterpart and was later banned after headbutting David Meyler of Hull City.

Pellegrini bears no grudge and says he personally finds it helpful to stay calm after being more hotheaded earlier in his career as a player.

‘The most important thing is to be winning the game, not to be fighting with other managers,’ he said.

‘I think if you are not calm, you are nervous, then you are not in the right mood at the right time.

‘I was another character when I was younger. More explosive and wanting to fight with other players.

‘After I finished my career as a player and started as a manager, I realised you must talk to all the other players in a calm way.’
