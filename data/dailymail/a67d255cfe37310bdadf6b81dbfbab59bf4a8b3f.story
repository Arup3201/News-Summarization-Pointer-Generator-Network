A second high school has cancelled its football season after rookie players were allegedly forced to sexually assault each other in humiliating initiation rites, according to officials.

The final two football games at Central Bucks High School West, Philadelphia, were cancelled after it emerged that players engaged in pre-season hazing at the school.

Superintendent David Weitzel said rookies were required to grab another player's genitals while fully clothed, an initiation that was carried out in front of most team members.

This comes just weeks after criminal charges were initiated  against seven players at Sayreville War Memorial High School, New Jersey, over allegations that a freshman was penetrated.

Rookie football players were allegedly required to grab another player's genitals while fully clothed, during an initiation at Central Bucks High School West, Philadelphia 

In a letter to the school district community, he said: 'Our inquiry determined that students new to the team were expected to participate in several initiations that were both humiliating and inappropriate.

'I want to be clear that these activities did not result in physical harm, but were not harmless.'

James Donnelly, chief of the Central Bucks Regional Police Department, said he had been notified about allegations of 'waterboarding' at the school.

Principal Jason Bucher alerted police that young players had been placed under the shower with towels over their heads, but Donnelly said it was not 'waterboarding' as he understood it.

Waterboarding is a form of torture, in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of a captive to create a sensation of drowning.

'The letter was pretty damning and contains some pretty scary information,' said Donnelly.

'We don't know if it was just kids horsing around or if it was more serious, but we're going to investigate.'

All varsity and junior varsity coaches at Central Bucks High School West have been suspended pending further investigation, according to Superintendent Weitzel

This comes weeks after the football season at Sayreville War Memorial High School in neighbouring New Jersey ended over a hazing investigation.

Five coaches were suspended at that school and criminal charges are pending against seven players.

Older team members were said to have held down the younger players on the team in the locker room, anally penetrating them with their fingers and then sticking those fingers in their mouths.

All varsity and junior varsity coaches at Central Bucks have been suspended pending further investigation, said Superintendent Weitzel.

Police said they would investigate whether any of the activity was criminal and whether staff failed to properly supervise team activities.

For years West had one of the most successful football programs in the country, including a run of four state titles in the 1990s, when it regularly appeared in USA Today's national Top 10 rankings.

Its alumni include Cleveland Browns head coach Mike Pettine Jr. and two of his assistants.

The school's most famous dropout is Alecia Moore, better known as the singer Pink.

Weitzel said hazing allegations were first reported to the district on October 14.

He said the majority of players were in violation 'through their offensive and disrespectful actions in what were supposed to be pre-season, team-building activities.' 

Players who did not participate, but witnessed the activities and failed to report them, also violated the student code, he said.

The district code of student conduct has banned hazing and similar activities for the past decade, and Weitzel apologised to those players who were 'subjected to the demeaning actions of fellow players who should have served as role models.'
