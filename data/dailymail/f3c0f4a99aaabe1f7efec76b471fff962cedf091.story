Game of Thrones has just entered its fourth season on Sky, but whether you're watching the shows or have read all the books, it can be tricky keeping track of what's going on.

Worry not though - a digital cartographer has created an interactive map of the fantasy world complete with character paths and links to the Game of Thrones Wiki.

Helpfully, it also comes with a slider that lets you select what chapter or episode you're up to, and hides any spoilers. 

Use the map below to explore. A full version is available at Quartermaester.info

Locations are plotted by nodes.

Cities are marked by stars, towns 
are circles, and castles are depicted by a circle surrounded by four 
points. 

Clicking
 on these nodes opens the relevant page from A Wiki of Ice and Fire - a 
Wikipedia-style encyclopaedia of all the characters, events and 
locations from the books.

To avoid spoilers, the map lets users slide to the last chapter they’ve read in the book, or episode they’ve seen. 

Users can search for specific locations, drag the cursor around the map and zoom in and out.

Elsewhere,
 it’s also possible to show character paths for each main person 
mentioned in the books.

Ticking
 the box next to the relevant character reveals their path on the map up to the point at which the user has read. 

The scale of the map is based on the length of the fictitious Wall, which is stated in the books as being 300 miles long. 

In the top right-hand corner of the map is a key that plots each of the main locations along the Wall, numbered one to 32.

These include Castle Black, the Queensgate and Sentinel Stand.

Every other location is plotted by a node. Cities are marked by stars, towns are circles, and castles are depicted by a circle surrounded by four points. 

Clicking on these nodes opens the relevant page from A Wiki of Ice and Fire – a Wikipedia-style encyclopaedia of all the characters, events and locations from the books. 

There is a mixture of confirmed locations and speculative locations, as the cartographer explained: ‘[Author] George [R.R Martin] prefers the maps in the books to follow a medieval cartography style and therefore locations are approximate rather than definitive.

The map also shows character paths for each main person mentioned in the books.

Each character is shown in a different colour and labelled with the first letter of their name, pictured

'Because the official maps do not cover everything a lot of this map is, by necessity, speculative in nature.’

The map is based on Google’s mapping platform meaning it can be used in the same way as Google Maps.

Users can search for specific locations, drag the cursor around the map and zoom in and out.

Within the Westeros part of the map, users can additionally highlight specific regions including the Nobility of Westeros and Constituencies of Westeros. 

Elsewhere, it’s also possible to show character paths for each main person mentioned in the books.

The list is divided into houses - rather than episodes - to avoid spoilers and includes the Starks, the Lannisters, the Baratheon’s and the Greyjoys.

When the fourth season of the show premiered at the start of the month, for example, HootSuite created a parody video of the opening credits that replaced kingdoms in the show with major tech companies, including Facebook, pictured, Google and Twitter

The map layer used on the site was drawn by theMountainGoat based on previous work by Tear of the Cartographer's Guild.

The show's popularity has produced a lot of fan fiction and parodies.

In the style of the TV show's opening credits, Facebook was shown with its empire including Instagram and Whatsapp, while Google's various products including Google+, Drive and YouTube were seen rising from an island rock.
