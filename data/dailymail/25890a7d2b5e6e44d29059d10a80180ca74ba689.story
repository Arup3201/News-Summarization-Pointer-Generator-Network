With her husband stationed 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan, a loving wife hit upon a novel way for them to celebrate the holiday season together by creating a special Christmas card which reunited the pair through the wonders of Photoshop.

One half of the heart-warming card features Christina Perdue, 25, in a Santa hat surrounded by the snowy landscape of Westchester County, New York.

The other half shows her husband Daniel, 29, a sergeant in the U.S. army, dressed his in fatigues in Afghanistan.

Christina Perdue, 25, of Westchester County, New York, hit upon the clever idea to create a special Christmas card that features her husband Daniel, 29, posing in his fatigues in Afghanistan

Using an iPhone app, Christina cleverly combined the two photos so the couple appear to be holding different ends of the same sign which proclaims ‘Merry Christmas.’

Christina, who is spending her second Christmas without her husband since they married in 2010, posted the image on Facebook on 15 December.

‘We may not get to be together for the holiday but we still manage to come together with our holiday photo,’ she wrote. ‘After searching for ideas we came across this one and thought it was perfect! I hope you all enjoy!’

The card - together with the couple’s message of support for soldiers deployed around the world – has become a viral hit which according to the couple is one of the reasons why they decided to do it.

'Out of the five years, I've had him home for two,' said Christina. Daniel's third tour of duty is almost up and he is scheduled to be home in January

‘We wanted it to go viral so it could get overseas and we can tell our soldiers that we appreciate them,’ said Christina, who is a nurse.

‘We just wanted to show that no distance can get in the way of love and we wanted to show the support of our brothers and sisters in arms, and that nobody forgets them this holiday season,’ Daniel told WABC via Skype.

‘Our family loved it, all our friends love it, everyone has been sharing it all across the internet,’ he said.

The couple, who knew each other when they attended Central Valley High School in Montgomery, N.Y., reconnected via social media in 2008 and married in 2010. 

Daniel's third tour of duty is almost up and he is scheduled to be home in January.

‘Out of the five years, I’ve had him home for two. I’m just excited for him to be home,’ Christina told Yahoo News. ‘Deployments, no matter how many you go through, don’t get easier.’
