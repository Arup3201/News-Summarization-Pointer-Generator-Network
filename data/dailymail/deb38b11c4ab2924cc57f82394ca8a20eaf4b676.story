With Prince Harry watching live from the VIP section, Stephen Bunting produced a suitably regal performance, knocking out the No 6 seed James Wade from the William Hill PDC world darts championships.

His Royal Highness decided to sample the boisterous Ally Pally atmosphere for just the second time – on the last occasion, nearly four years ago, protocol was breached when the victorious semi-finalist Adrian Lewis inadvertently kissed the fifth in line to the throne in sheer excitement.

Once again, though, the Prince chose an excellent night to watch the arrows. In a wonderfully thrilling second-round performance, Bunting underlined his class by smashing Wade 4-1.

While his doubles ratio of 37 per cent will have to improve as the tournament progress, the 29-year-old impressively hit checkouts of 161, 144 and 118.

The Bullet, the No 27 seed, eventually shot down one of the best players on the circuit with a double 10 finish.

'I was really nervous out there,' said Bunting, who faces Michael Smith in the Last 16. 'But I had a lot of fans watching. They were my 12th man and they got me through it. I'm not happy with a 93 average. I need to do better.'

Wade, 31, said: 'Stephen is not of the same level as me but he was the better player out there. This is embarrassing. I really thought I would win (the tournament) this year.'

For the second successive year, Raymond van Barneveld played Jamie Caven at the worlds – and 12 months after winning 4-3 in the second round, the Dutchman repeated the trick once again.

This match went with the throw for six sets – basically whoever threw first in the opening leg of the set ended up being the victor. However, in the decisive, seventh set, Barney's experience and nous as a five-time world champion paid off. 

The Dutchman, who received supportive Twitter messages from Man Utd and Holland striker Robin van Persie, will now face Adrian Lewis this evening in a potentially titanic third-round encounter.

Bunting joked: 'I didn't know Harry was here. I'm going to have a pint with him now! But it is great that darts is getting this type of coverage.'

In terms of darts royalty, there are few who come bigger than the defending champion. And the Dutchman Michael van Gerwen, the man who lifted the Sid Waddell trophy on New Year’s Day, became the first man into the quarter-finals, beating Terry ‘The Bull’ Jenkins 4-1.
