McDonald's has shed light on its food production techniques after answering some of the more uncomfortable 'frequently asked questions' the company faces about its ingredients and processing methods.

The fast food giant has provided answers on its U.S. website to a range of queries concerning the quality and content of its food, including whether 'pink slime' was used in its burgers.

The company, which has often been criticised for its food sourcing and processing methods, has also addressed such issues as whether its McRib is made using the same plastics as yoga mats and what the ingredients are in Chicken McNuggets.

Fast food giant McDonald's has answered a number of questions about its food production techniques on its U.S. website

The company has answered such questions as whether 'pink slime' was used in its burgers

In response to whether its burgers were made using 'real beef', McDonald's said in the U.S. they were made of '100% USDA-inspected beef.'

It goes on to say: 'There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called "pink-slime" in our beef.

'The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.'

In response to a direct question of whether it uses 'pink-slime' in its burgers, McDonald's USA says: 'Lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia, what some individuals call “pink slime" or select lean beef trimmings, is not used in our burgers. Any recent reports that it is are false.'

However, it goes on to say: 'McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011.

'While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world.' 

The restaurant chain has also answered questions about the ingredients used in its Chicken McNuggets, and why they include an 'anti-foaming' agent

The company has also addressed whether its McRib is made using the same plastics as yoga mats

Elsewhere, the company attempts to explain the difference between the azodicarbonamide used in yoga mats and the variation of the chemical compound which is found in its McRib.

It says while the ingredient can be found in bread and other items including hot dogs and hamburger buns, a 'variation of this ingredient' is also used in some non-food products, including yoga mats.

It goes on to say it is 'simply not true' however to claim McDonald's food 'contains that same rubber or plastics'.

The company says: 'We recognize the difference between using ingredients in food versus using a variation of those ingredients for non-food purposes can be confusing.

'We also realize that sometimes the scientific name for an ingredient may sound scary. For example, the salt you use to de-ice a driveway is a variation of the salt you use in the kitchen, however they are both sodium chloride.' 

Q: ARE YOUR HAMBURGERS MADE USING REAL BEEF?

MCDONALD'S: Yes. Our burgers in the US are made using only 100% USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called “pink slime” in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.

Q: DO YOU USE SO-CALLED 'PINK SLIME' IN YOUR BURGERS?

MCDONALD'S: Lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia, what some individuals call 'pink slime' or select lean beef trimmings, is not used in our burgers. Any recent reports that it is are false.

McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world.

Q: DO YOU IMPORT BEEF FROM BRAZIL, FROM CLEAR-CUT RAINFORESTS? DO YOU IMPORT CHICKEN FROM CHINA?

MCDONALD'S: Most of our beef we use in our U.S. restaurants comes from the U.S, although we import a small percentage of our 100% beef from suppliers in Australia and New Zealand to supplement our U.S. purchases. These suppliers must also meet McDonald’s quality and safety standards and USDA regulations. In fact, we’ve maintained a global policy against using beef sourced from de-forested rainforests since 1989. You can learn more about our long history of sustainable land management practices here.

All of the chicken we use in our U.S. restaurants is born and raised in the U.S. and comes from our trusted USDA-inspected American suppliers.

Q: WHY DO YOUR CHICKEN MCNUGGETS INCLUDE AN 'ANTI-FOAMING' AGENT?

MCDONALD'S: McDonald’s frying oil contains a small amount of an additive called dimethlypolysiloxane, which helps prevent oil from foaming and spattering in our restaurants. 

All of the ingredients we use, including dimethylpolysiloxane, meet recognized food quality and safety standards.  Because dimethylpolysiloxane is used in some non-food products, like putty, caulks  or cosmetics, there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that these items are also in our food.

We recognize the difference between using ingredients in food versus using a variation of those ingredients for non-food purposes can be confusing. We also realize that sometimes the scientific name for an ingredient may sound scary. For example, the salt you use to de-ice a driveway is a variation of the salt you use in the kitchen, however they are both sodium chloride.

Q: IS THE MCRIB MADE USING THE SAME PLASTICS AS YOGA MATS?

MCDONALD'S: We use ingredients that are commonly used by the food industry and meet recognized food quality and safety standards. Azodicarbonamide is used by bakers to help ensure a consistent texture in each batch of bread they bake. It is used in many items on grocery store shelves, like some hot dog and hamburger buns and other bread products you may already purchase. 

Because a variation of this ingredient is used in some non-food products, including yoga mats, there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that our food contains that same rubber or plastics. This is simply not true.
