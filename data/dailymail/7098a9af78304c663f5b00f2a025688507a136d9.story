Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a study has found - and its impact increases as the child ages.

Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families.

And the gap got wider throughout childhood, with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence.

Scientists from Goldsmiths, University of London compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the Twins Early Development Study (Teds).

The study is an on-going investigation socio-economic and genetic links to intelligence.

Children were assessed nine times between the ages of two and 16, using a mixture of parent-administered, web and telephone-based tests.

Technology may be getting smarter, but humans are getting dumber, scientists have warned.

Evidence suggests that the IQs of people in the UK, Denmark and Australia have declined in the last decade.

Opinion is divided as to whether the trend is long-term, but some researchers believe that humans have already reached intellectual peak.

An IQ test used to determine whether Danish men are fit to serve in the military has revealed scores have fallen by 1.5 points since 1998.

And standard tests issued in the UK and Australia echo the results, according to journalist Bob Holmes, writing in New Scientist. 

The results, published in the journal Intelligence, revealed that children from wealthier backgrounds with more opportunities scored higher in IQ tests at the age of two, and experienced greater IQ gains over time.

Dr Sophie von Stumm, from Goldsmiths, University of London, who led the study, said: 'We’ve known for some time that children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds perform on average worse on intelligence tests than children from higher SES backgrounds, but the developmental relationship between intelligence and SES had not been previously shown.

'Our research establishes that relationship, highlighting the link between SES and IQ. 

'We hope that our findings will drive future research into the specific mechanisms and factors that underpin the link between SES and IQ and thus, contribute to widening the IQ gap.'

Last year, a study by the University of Exeter revealed that children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which could affect their ability to excel at school.

Researchers found a link between social and economic status and childhood ADHD in Britain by analysing data from the Millennium Cohort Study - a database of more than 19,500 British children born between 2000 and 2002. 

While young children were found to have IQ scores on average six points lower than their wealthier peers, the intelligence gap was found to triple by the time they reached adolescence, which means their background arguably puts them at a disadvantage in exams such as GCSES. A stock image is shown

The study, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, showed that there was a greater prevalence of ADHD among children from families living below the poverty line.

The researchers found the average family income for a household with a child affected by ADHD was £324 ($509) per week, compared to £391 ($614) for those with unaffected children.

They also revealed that the chance of parents in social housing having a child with ADHD was roughly three times greater than for those who owned their own homes.

Mothers with no qualifications were more than twice as likely to have a child with ADHD as those with degrees, and lone parents were more likely to have a child with ADHD than households with two live-in parents.
