Forget the provocative likes of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus; in Japan, the look that both men and women aspire to is cute, wholesome and resolutely virginal.

Japanese culture, in particular popular cartoons such as Manga and Hello Kitty, has an innocent mien while the cult of the computer game loving geek, the otaru, is burgeoning.

But Japan's obsession with all things cute has come at a price. Not only are people having less sex, the country's birthrate has declined so much the Japanese population is expected to drop by a third within the next 50 years.

No sex please, we're Japanese: Many young people from Japan are choosing not to have sex

In Tokyo, a city of 35 million people, just 250,000 babies are born each year - a shockingly low figure when compared to London's rate of 135,000 children born to a population of just eight million.

So what's going on? It's a question that film maker Anita Rani attempts to answer in new BBC documentary, No Sex Please, We're Japanese.

'There are lots of reasons for the population decline but one of the biggest trends is that young Japanese people are moving away from wanting to have sex,' Rani revealed in an interview with MailOnline.

'Many young people have just decided they don't want any part of it. I'm as baffled as anyone else by it!'

Most baffling of all are the otaku [geeks], many of whom have chosen to withdraw from the dating game altogether in favour of 'relationships' with virtual girlfriends.

An increasing number of 'otaku' (geeks) are choosing to have a relationship with a virtual girlfriend over a real woman

Among them are Nurakan, 38, and Yugai, 39, whose 'girlfriends' Ne-ne and Rinko both come in a box and are part of a virtual game created by Nintendo called Love +.

And the pair really do believe they're in real relationships with the animated characters. 'I like the girls in this game too much,' explains Yugai, who adds that he tries not to have sexual feelings about his virtual girlfriend because the relationship is supposed to be platonic.

Asked whether he'd like a real girlfriend, he answers: 'Yes of course I do but since I began a relationship with Ne-ne, I'm really emotionally involved with her.'

'Ne-ne', should you have forgotten, is a cartoon schoolgirl, who says things like: 'do you really want to talk this late at night?', 'Because I
 like you, I will always want to be with you' and 'Let's go to the 
beach, let's dream and have lots of fun.'

Yugai, who says he is 17 in the Love + game, explains that for him, being involved with a cartoon is easier because he will never have to contemplate marriage.

'At high school you can have relationships without having to think about
 marriage,' he explains. 'With real life girlfriends, you have to consider marriage so I
 think twice about going out with a 3D woman.'

Is it the Japanese obsession with cute that is leading to the population crisis?

'There's so many great distractions,' explains Roland, a non-otaku man who appears in the documentary.

'Why would you get into something as messy, as troubling, as disorienting as a relationship when you could have a virtual girlfriend, a virtual experience, that maybe is even superior to the reality?

'I do know a number of men in Japan, and elsewhere, who find the role play games, the dating SIMS, even advances in pornography, and would rather experience the opposite sex that way than go through the challenges of relationships.'

Unsurprisingly, Japanese women are not impressed. 'Relatively speaking, I think most 
Japanese women find Japanese men wanting,' explains Roland.

'Men haven't developed autonomy or a sense of individualism and you now have a generation of 
women who want something more. They want to be independent themselves 
and they want men to be independent too.'

'They were nice guys and totally normal,' says Anita of Yugai and Nurakan. 'They were cool blokes but when it comes to women, they don't want to engage.'

Her view is borne out by the experience of a group of Japanese women interviewed for the documentary, among them career girls Natsuo and Yamiko.

'Japanese men are straight but they are 
not interested in women that much,' explains Natsuo. 'They don't aggressively try to get 
girlfriends.

Her friend Yamiko adds: 'They are afraid to get real contact with humans.'

A recent survey by Japanese insurance company Meiji Yasuda Life found that a third of Japanese men under 40 have never dated women at all, although women themselves aren't much better.

A survey by the Japanese Family Planning Association done earlier this year found that 45 per cent of women between 18 and 24 'were not interested in or despised sexual contact.'

'A few people can't relate to the opposite sex physically or in any other way,' adds Ai Aoyama, a Japanese sex and relationship counsellor in an interview with the Guardian.

'They flinch if I touch them. Most are men, but I'm starting to see more women.'

So what is to be done about Japan's ageing population and sex-shy younger generation? For Anita, the answer is more immigration, which she says would give women freedom to work after becoming mothers - a practice currently frowned upon in Japan - as well increasing the number of taxpayers.

'Everyone in Japan is aware of the problem so 
conversations happening at highest level,' she explains.

'They know they need to adapt workplaces
 to make them child and family friendly. But immigration is big issue over 
there because Japan is nation that's always been closed.'

But with an ageing population and a growing number of twenty and thirty-somethings who simply aren't interested in real life relationships, Japan is running out of time.
