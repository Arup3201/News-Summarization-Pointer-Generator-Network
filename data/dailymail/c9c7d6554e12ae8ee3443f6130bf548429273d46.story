Charges: Robert Dellinger is facing two counts of murder over the deaths of a Vermont couple

A former Fortune 500 executive has been charged with murder after his failed attempt to kill himself in a New Hampshire car crash killed a couple expecting a baby.

Robert Dellinger was indicted by a grand jury yesterday over the deaths of Amanda Murphy, who was eight months pregnant, and her fiancé Jason Timmons. 

Attorney-General Joseph Foster and state police announced on Tuesday that charges against Dellinger had been upgraded.

After the crash in December, the former vice-president at PPG Industries told police he had been trying to kill himself when he drove his pick up truck across the median of a highway.

His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash.

The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly.

Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter.

Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth.

A week before the crash, which happened on December 7, the residential center the pair worked at had hosted a baby shower for the couple.

Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'.

Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. 

At his arraignment in December, Susan Morrell, senior assistant attorney 
general for New Hampshire, said Dellinger had argued with his wife over his 
medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported.

Loss: Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy, who were killed instantly in the crash, were expecting their first child together

Shocking: The top of the couple's SUV was sheared off in the collision in December last year

Horrific: A medical examiner said the couple's injuries were consistent with those sustained in plane crashes

He left the house and began to drive 
around, growing increasingly despondent, she said. A trooper said 
Dellinger told him he intended to kill himself.

'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' Ms Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.'

Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, 
however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 
'productive and exemplary life.'

The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc.

He
 took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks
 when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

After
 his earlier arraignment, Dellinger had been freed on $250,000 cash bond
 and ordered to wear an electronic tag and undergo a psychiatric 
evaluation.

Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, a few days after the crash

Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl

On Friday, he was arrested at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. Neither the prosecution nor the hospital said why he was there. His lawyer didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.

Dellinger has not been arraigned on the original charges. His arraignment on the new charges was set for Tuesday. A second-degree murder conviction carries a sentence of up to life in prison.

The new indictment shows Dellinger has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder over the deaths of Mr Timmons and Miss Murphy, and a second-degree assault charge over the death of the couple's unborn baby.
