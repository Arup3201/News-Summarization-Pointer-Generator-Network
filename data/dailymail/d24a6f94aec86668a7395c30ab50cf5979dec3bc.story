The shooting of President John F Kennedy, born on this day in 1917, remains one of the world’s most infamous assassinations, and its implications are still arguably being felt today.

Aside from the conspiracy theories shrouding the event, the impact of his death on 22 November 1963 has been pored over and studied for decades. But what if he had never been shot by Lee Harvey Oswald?

That was a question tackled by award-winning US television journalist Jeff Greenfield for All About History magazine issue 13, who considered how life in the following decades might have been different had Kennedy lived.

What if JFK had never been killed? US television journalist Jeff Greenfield ponders the question for All About History magazine and discusses some of the implications if he had continued living into old age.

Greenfield postulates that the US might have been embroiled in fewer international conflicts had Kennedy remained president.

But closer to home, a suspected affair with Marilyn Monroe would have shocked the public in the same way Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky did.

And civil rights also might have made less progress if he had continued as head of state.

On the subject of the Cold War, Greenfield suggests that the terrifying events of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 might have improved relations between the US and Russia.

‘A lot of people look at the way Kennedy ran for president, very hawkish, very militant and in his inaugural speech he said he would pay any price, bear any burden,’ says Greenfield to All About History.

‘But they failed to recognise how much the Cuban missile crisis had affected him.

‘It’s pretty clear that he and Khrushchev [Former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] had come close to presiding over a nuclear holocaust, it dramatically changed the way he looked at the world.

‘That’s when he began looking for common ground with the Soviet Union: a test-ban treaty, possibly other steps to turn down the temperature of the Cold War.’

And in terms of the Vietnam War as well, events may have transpired in a more peaceful manner.

‘The evidence is, during the fall of 1963, Kennedy had realised that Vietnam was a losing proposition,’ continues Greenfield.

‘He had carelessly authorised - or didn’t stop - a coup that had put new people in charge of South Vietnam.

‘He saw this as a situation that violated a fundamental belief of his about committing large numbers of Americans to a land war in Asia.

‘He had always said to people that he wanted to disengage but he couldn’t do it until he was re-elected in 1964 - the politics wouldn’t let him.

‘He would have been accused of being soft on communism.

‘My best guess is that he would have played for time in 1964, tried to keep the status quo and tried to keep any incidents from arising.

And ultimately, says Greenfield, ‘I think we would have been spared [an all-out] war in Vietnam.’

And, he continues, 'if we had been, the cultural clash in the US would have been very different in the late 1960s.’

While the so-called ‘Swinging Sixties’ would have still occurred, Greenfield suggests there wouldn’t have been groups vehemently protesting against the US military.

The Vietnam War raged for many years and sparked huge protests across America. Greenfield suggests, though, that if Kennedy had remained president the war might not have happened as it did. Pictured is the 3rd Marine Division of the US Army in 1968

One of the potential scandals that threatened to undermine JFK’s continued presidency was his rumoured affair with Marilyn Monroe.

It’s believed they had an ongoing relationship, with Monroe even thinking at one stage JFK would divorce his wife Jackie and she would move into the White House as the First Lady.

And Greenfield says that if this had become common knowledge to the public, it could have been akin to the scandal that engulfed President Clinton when his affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed in 1998 - even though Monroe died in 1962.

‘I asked some people whether Kennedy could have survived this scandal ' they said “of course not”,’ says Greenfield.

‘The cultural climate of the US in [the early-1960s] compared to the 1990s was just radically different.

‘In 1964 we had a presidential candidate ' Nelson Rockefeller ' who lost a key presidential primary just as his wife gave birth to a baby and it reminded people that he had left his older wife for a younger woman.

‘We had never had a divorced president in 1964 and there was no idea of “oh well, it’s private, everybody plays around a bit".'

Greenfield adds it ‘would have been far more shocking’ than the Clinton scandal if Kennedy’s administration failed to prevent the story from becoming public, which would have been 'hard'.

Kennedy was assassinated during a motorcade in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas on Friday 22 November 1963 (pictured). Greenfield suggests that had he not been killed, he would have lived into moderate old age before succoming to one of the illnesses that ailed him in earlier life

Looking further into his life, Greenfield considers how his health might have curtailed his later years.

‘He suffered from all kinds of ailments,’ he explains.

‘He had Addison’s disease, he had horrible intestinal problems, he apparently had an untreated veneral disease and the combination of drugs he was taking for Addison’s with his injury from the war made his back [ache], just agony.

‘By the time he would have served a second term and in his early 50s, no one knows how his health would have been.’

And a final point Greenfield makes is on the subject of civil rights: would it have been such a big deal for Kennedy as it was for Lyndon Johnson?

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 famously outlawed discrimination based on race, colour, religion or sex.

But with Kennedy still president, it’s likely any such legislation wouldn’t have materialised until later.

‘Kennedy wasn’t as passionate about civil rights,’ says Greenfield.

‘He was also much more a foreign-policy president.

‘If Kennedy could have avoided the war in Vietnam at the cost of going easy on civil rights, he would have done it.

‘We would have gotten there eventually, but more slowly than it would have happened under Johnson.’
