Gus Poyet took advantage of his long-term friendship with former England forward Jermain Defoe to seal the player's move to Sunderland.

Poyet worked with Defoe, who was desperate to quit Major League Soccer side Toronto, when he was assistant manager to Juande Ramos at Tottenham.

He took Defoe out for dinner on Tuesday night to discuss his return to English football after an unhappy 11-month spell in Canada, where he scored 11 goals in 16 games.

The pair were at Spurs for the League Cup final win over Chelsea at Wembley in 2008, but Poyet left Spurs with Ramos the following October.

Defoe's first game for Sunderland — if he receives international clearance in time — could be against Spurs at White Hart Lane on Saturday.

Defoe, 32, has completed a medical and will sign a two-and-a-half-year deal worth £70,000 a week at the Stadium of Light.

Poyet has been desperate for firepower and believes Defoe can help steer his team clear of the relegation battle in the final four months of the Barclays Premier League season.

Sunderland have scored only 18 goals in 21 league games so far.

Defoe had been training with Tottenham's Under 21 development squad as talks continued over his move back to English football.

Toronto had been holding out for £8million, but Defoe's exit has been made possible by Jozy Altidore heading in the opposite direction on a deal worth £4m a year. The American striker was booked on a flight to Canada on Wednesday night ahead of a medical.
