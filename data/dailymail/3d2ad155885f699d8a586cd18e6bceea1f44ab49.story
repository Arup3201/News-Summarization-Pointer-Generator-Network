Consistency is key: The actress admitted her slim and toned figure is down to working out regularly

Not at all, the mother-of-two told The Sunday Times Style magazine.

In fact, she said her fitness is often thanks to just 20 minutes of exercise a day. 

She said: 'I'm a big believer in doing 20 minutes of exercise a day. I love skipping with a rope because it's one of the hardest cardio exercises you can do, but it's so easy. I do three sets of three minutes; I'm always shocked at how sweaty I get.' 

She added in a separate interview with US Weekly that consistency is key to her maintaining her fabulous figure. She said people can't expect to have a body like hers unless they are prepared to make exercise a way of life - which doesn't mean it becomes all-consuming.

She explains: 'I wouldn't say (I work out) a lot, just consistently. People think for some reason you have to work out for two and a half hours… but, it can be little. It can be 20 minutes, it could be 40 minutes. 

Keep fit: Kate will often do a mile run before a Pilates class 

'You can't do like two weeks and go like do two days and then take a week off and then do three days and then go, 'Why aren't I seeing results? I don't get it.' You know, you just got to do it - sad, like anything else in life!' 

She admits that like most people, she can struggle with motivation to work out so her key to success to get up and get it over and done with first thing.  

She said: 'I'm a morning person. If I go past noon, it's hard for me to exercise. If you wake up and just do it, then it's done.'

The How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days actress has long been a fan of Pilates and she credits this with keeping her toned and strong.

Nicole Stuart, Kate's Pilates trainer, told Shape magazine the actress will do a Pilates class three times a week, usually preceded by a mile run.

Support: The actress is passionate about encouraging more women to become active

Don't be shy: The actress gives it her all in the gym and says women shouldn't feel embarrassed about being seen working out

Explaining the benefits of Pilates, Nicole said: 'It primarily works your core, but not just the front. 

'You'll work the entire body - front, sides, back, your whole midsection, trunk - it pulls everything in and together. 

'You'll become tighter, more toned, and stronger. It makes you stand taller, makes you have more confidence, makes you more grounded. You'll lose inches and get that leaner, longer look. After the first 10 sessions, you'll feel different. After 20 sessions, you'll see a difference!' 

Kate has proved she's passionate about health and fitness and advocates everyone giving exercise a go, regardless of their current ability. She adds that women should not feel embarrassed about working out in public.

'When you get into fitness classes, nobody cares, nobody's looking at anyone else. It doesn't matter what you do or where you come from, you just become a class and everybody's there supporting everybody, and you're all there for the same reason,' she said. 

The actress has founded the website Fabletics with the goal of getting more people active. Members of the site can gain access to fitness programmes and support from other users.

She said: 'One of the reasons I love this company is that we are trying to make something affordable that could reach a demographic that don't necessarily have the means to go to a personal trainer every day, and to motivate people to just feel good in themselves. I think that all starts with being active.'

Kate has also released an accompanying fashion range of fitness clothing which she says is functional and flattering for women of all shapes and sizes. 

As a mother to Bingham, ten, with ex-husband Chris Robinson. and Ryder, three, whose father, Matthew Bellamy, she split up with at the end of last year, Kate said getting the energy to exercise isn't always easy.

So when she needs a good night's sleep, she calls on her mother Goldie Hawn to babysit.

She revealed that diet is also an integral part of her health and wellbeing.

'Healthy food inspires me. It's important to know what you're eating because food is fuel, and we don't want to fuel our bodies in a way that could make them sick,' she said.

But she added that she's not 'a health nut' as she'll tuck into M&Ms occasionally and loves to drink wine.

Kate Hudson wasn't the only one making waves thanks to her stunning figure at the Golden Globes last night.
