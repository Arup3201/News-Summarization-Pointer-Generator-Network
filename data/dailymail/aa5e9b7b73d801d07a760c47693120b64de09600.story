A male nurse arrested by police hunting a suspected serial hospital poisoner emerged from hiding after seven months today, vowing to clear his name.

Father-of-two Victorino Chua, 46, was questioned by murder squad detectives for almost four days after being arrested last January over alleged tampering with medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

He was freed without charge and bailed but was ordered by police to live at a different address due to fears for his personal safety.

No more hiding: Father of two Victorino Chua, 46, returns to his terraced house two months before he is due to be questioned over the scandal

His £105,000 two-up-two-down terraced home in Heaton Norris, Stockport, was boarded up amid fears it might be targeted by a vigilantes whilst Chua went to a secret address with his wife and two children.

But Chua has now returned to the address with his wife after workmen were called out to remove the boards. The move comes just two months before he is due to answer his bail and face further questioning over the scandal. 

Today, Chua arrived at his home holding two bags of shopping. He emerged from the property just moments later to dump a child’s pram with a passing scrap metal dealer but declined to comment on the investigation.

A neighbour said: 'Vic had not been back to the house, which was hardly surprising given all the worries there may have been that he and his home could be a target for revenge attacks.

'But we were equally stunned to see him back on the street. We hear he is protesting his innocence and no doubt moving back home is all part of his battle to clear his name.

'Everyone can understand why he has wanted to keep a low profile but we can only assume he feels there is no point hiding himself away anymore.'

Chua was initially detained in a dawn raid on his home on Thursday January 5 and accused of administering a noxious substance.

Nurses first discovered a chart for another patient had been altered between January 2 and 3 this year. As a result, it is believed one patient was administered more medication than necessary and had to be carefully monitored by hospital staff before being discharged.

Police were granted a warrant of further detention to continue questioning Chua on the allegations for a further 36 hours but decided to rearrest him on suspicion of murder.

'Poisoned patients': The male nurse was questioned by murder squad detectives over the deaths of several people who were given contaminated saline solutions

He was quizzed over the deaths of secretary Tracey Arden, 44, retired newspaper photographer Arnold Lancaster, 71, and retired electronics engineer Derek Weaver, 83, who all died after being given contaminated saline solutions.

He was also arrested on suspicion of intending to cause grievous bodily harm to 18 other patients including retired journalist Bill Dickson, 82, who passed away on New Year's Eve after being poisoned during the summer.

Other deaths being probed are those of NHS office administrator Linda McDonagh, 60 and John 'Jack' Beeley, 73 and Beryl Hope, 70.

Seven deaths in total have been linked to an insulin poisoner at the hospital.

In total 22 patients are thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 - which care for seriously ill patients - between June 1 and July 15 last year.

The alarm was first raised nearly two weeks after the spate began, when hospital staff realised a higher than normal number of patients had been reported as having ‘unexplained’ low blood sugar levels.

Police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluid.

Chua was bailed in relation to all matters pending further inquiries and cannot return to work. Police said further medical and forensic tests are being carried out.

Chua - described as a 'doting family man' - has worked at the hospital for two years having moved to England with his wife Marianne, 38, and their two children from the Phillippines about nine years ago.

He has been registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council since August 2003 and previously worked at a nursing home.

Last year nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, spent six weeks in jail accused of poisoning the same patients.

She was accused of injecting saline solutions with insulin on the wards between 1 June 2011 and 15 July 2011 and was kept in custody due to fears over her safety.

But she was dramatically released last September when charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.
