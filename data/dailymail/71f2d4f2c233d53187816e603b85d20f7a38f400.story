The State Department security bosses who resigned from their post after a damning investigation blamed the agency for 'systematic failures' leading up to the terror attack on the American consulate in Libya, have reportedly not stepped down at all, drawing the ire of a Florida lawmaker.

Eric Boswell, the assistant secretary of
state for diplomatic security, and Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant 
secretary for embassy security, both quit after the independent probe last week.

But an explosive new report on Wednesday claims that not only have Boswell has stayed put in the State Department, and has remained on the payroll.

Resignations? Eric Boswell was responsible for 
diplomats security and Charlene Lamb was in charge of security for the 
embassy in Benghazi

Anger: The revelations drew fire from Florida congresswoman Ileana Ros Lehtinen, a Republican, who called the State Department's actions 'pathetic'

The New York Post additionally reported that Lamb and two others who had quit were merely placed on administrative leave and will soon be back at their jobs.

As the paper puts it, the 'resigning' officials are merely changing desks.

The revelations drew fire from Florida congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, who called the State Department's actions 'pathetic.'

Ros-Lehtinen told Fox News: 'If these reports are correct, they're pathetic examples of yet another ruse about the tragedy of Benghazi.

'State Department officials proclaimed to the world that heads would roll after the deception related to the deceitful video excuse and the non existent spontaneous protest outside the consulate.

'Now we see that the discipline is a lie and all that has happened is the shuffling of the deck chairs. That will in no way change what the ARB found to be systemic failures of management and leadership in the State Department.'

'Systematic
failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels 
within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission
security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly 
inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,' the panel said as they released their findings last week.

The report singled out the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism, saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in Benghazi, a city in Eastern Libya that was relatively lawless after the revolution that toppled Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

Despite those failures, the Accountability Review Board determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties and recommended no disciplinary action now.

But it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future.

The report appeared to break little new ground about the timeline of the Benghazi attack during which Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens, information specialist Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - who were contractors working for the CIA - were killed.

Stevens' slaying was the first of a U.S. ambassador since 1988.

But it confirmed that contrary to initial accounts, there was no protest outside the consulate and said responsibility for the incident rested entirely with the terrorists who attacked the mission.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, administration officials linked the attack to the spreading protests over an American-made, anti-Islamic film that had begun in Cairo earlier that day.

Those comments came after evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack.

U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on numerous TV talk shows the Sunday after the attack and used the administration talking points linking it to the film.

An ensuing brouhaha in the heat of the presidential campaign eventually cost her the job to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in President Obama's second term.

The review board determined that there had been no immediate, specific tactical warning of a potential attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11.

However, the report said there had been several worrisome incidents in the run-up to the attack that should have set off warning bells.

While criticizing State Department management in Washington along with the local militia force and contract guards that the mission depended on for protection, the report said U.S. personnel on the ground in Benghazi 'performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation.'

It said the response by Diplomatic Security agents on the scene and CIA operatives at a nearby compound that later came under attack itself had been 'timely and appropriate' but absolved the military from any blame.

'There was simply not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference.'

The State Department sent a classified version of the report to lawmakers on Tuesday and shortly thereafter released an unclassified version.

The report made 29 recommendations to improve embassy security, particularly at high threat posts.

In an accompanying letter to Congress, Clinton thanked the board for its 'clear-eyed, serious look at serious systemic challenges' and said she accepted all the recommendations.

Some of those challenges were revealed in earlier congressional hearings when several State Department officials discussed competing demands for security and cost prohibitions.

Clinton said the department had already begun to implement some of the recommendations.

They include increasing by several hundred the number of Marine guards stationed at diplomatic missions throughout the world, relying less on local security forces for protection at embassies, consulates and other offices, and increasing hiring and deployment of highly trained Diplomatic Security agents at at-risk posts.

Members of local Libyan militias provided some security around the consulate, but in the attack it became unclear whose side they were on.

The report also called on Congress to 
fully fund the State Department's security initiative, noting that 
budget constraints in the past had led some management officials to 
emphasize savings over security despite numerous requests from the 
Benghazi mission and embassy in Tripoli for enhanced protection.

'For many years the State Department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work with varying degrees of success,' it said.

This has led to efficiencies but also 'had the effect of conditioning a few State Department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation.'

It said the number of Diplomatic Security staff in Benghazi before and on the day of the attack 'was inadequate despite repeated requests ... for additional staffing.'

On her way out: In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the State Department's security requests

'The solution requires a more serious 
and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department 
needs, which, in total, constitute a small percentage of the full 
national budget and that spent for national security,' it said. 
'Congress must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary 
resources.'

Congress has denied some funding requests from the State Department for more security.

In her letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the department's security requests, noting that 'all of us ... have a responsibility to provide the men and women serving this country with the best possible security and support.'

The Benghazi attack has highlighted the larger question of how U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers can do their jobs in unstable environments, as al-Qaeda spreads across Africa, without also expanding their security.

Diplomats have said that overreacting to the attack could produce what some are calling a 'Benghazi effect' that would wall them off from the people they are supposed to be engaging.

In her letter to lawmakers, Clinton said, 'We will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security' but she stressed that 'our diplomats cannot work in bunkers.'

'We must accept a level of risk to protect this country we love and to advance our interests and values around the world,' she said.
