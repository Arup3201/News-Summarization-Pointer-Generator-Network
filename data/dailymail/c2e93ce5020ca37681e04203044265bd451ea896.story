Walking on water ... Guests at the Koh Andet Island accommodation are also allowed to take pets into their chalets

Stunning location: The sun sets over the Tatai River where 4 Rivers Floating Lodge is situated 

But guests who prefer their own animals can take pets into the luxurious villas - which are located around 80 miles away from Thailand's Trat airport.

Steve Dobson, who listed the hotel on GoUnusual.com, said: 'Guests will start their day by waking up to the sights and muted sounds of the Cardamom mountains.

'As the mist clears over the water, there is little to disturb the natural calm other than the plop and splash of a feeding fish, the startled cry of a far-off bird and the growl of a predator returning home after a kill.

'Cocooned in comfort and surrounded by top-quality furnishings and decoration, each villa has flat-screen television and DVD player, and mini-bar. 

The resort boasts 12 double and twin-bed tented villas that boast flat-screen televisions, a DVD player and a mini bar

Tranquil: Switch off and enjoy a drink or two as the sun sets over the Tatai River in Cambodia

Remote: The only way to get to the water-top accommodation is by boat

Luxury interior: The rooms boast a modern design and include a flat-screen TV and double bed

Ultimate comfort: The bathroom inside the floating hotel - which boasts a stand-alone bathtub 

'Not that DVD movies, messages and recorded sound will be any match for the natural wonders you will witness from your private extra large sun-lounger balcony where you can enjoy an afternoon snack or a sunset cocktail.

'Away from the stress and pressure of everyday life, 4 Rivers Floating Lodge is the ultimate vacation hideaway where, immersed in natural beauty, you enjoy the the serenity of the surroundings.'

The site contains 12 double and twin-bed tented villas that boast flat-screen televisions, a DVD player and a mini bar.
