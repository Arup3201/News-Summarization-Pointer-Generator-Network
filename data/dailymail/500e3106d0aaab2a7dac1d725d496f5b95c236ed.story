A prolific criminal with a string of convictions has vowed to overturn a court order banning him from an entire town so he can can continue supporting his favourite football team.

Thug Kelvin Mathers, 31, and brother Ashley, 29, were both barred from entering Colchester in Essex after terrorising residents for more than a decade.

Between them they had wracked up 80 convictions.

Now the elder brother - currently 
serving time in Chelmsford prison for his latest crime - has written an 
open letter taunting police that his solicitors will quash the ban.

In the three page scrawled note to his local paper, he whined: ‘It is not right for the courts to do this.’

Mathers, who has clocked up 38 convictions for 61 offences and confesses to having a problem with alcohol, went on: ‘You would think that the courts would help people like me and my brother but no, they just bang people up.’

The injunction was requested by Colchester Borough Homes and agreed by Judge Roderick Newton at Chelmsford County Court, last month.

It means he will not be able to watch his team, Colchester United, play at home when upon his release.

Whining: Kelvin Mathers' starts his three page long letter, scrawled on prison issue note paper, by moaning he is 'not happy about this injunction'.

Under the ruling, the two siblings, who has 42 convictions for a total of 87 offences, can only come back for court appearances or hospital appointments.

Kelvin says he only gets in trouble when he has been drinking but says he can quit.

In the letter, Kelvin also denied there is a rift between his mother and refuted claims by half-brother Marcus Southernwood who said the brothers had been physically violent towards him.

Despite being banned for life from watching his beloved Colchester United, he signs off his letter: ‘Up the U’s, Barside barmy army’.

To Colchester Gazette,

It is me, Kelvin Mathers, from my prison cell in Chelmsford (pictured right).

I am writing this letter to you because I am not happy about this injunction banning me from the borough of Colchester.

I have done some bad things in life and I am sorry to some of the people.

You said my mother no longer wants anything to do with me but I do not know how that can be as I have had letters from her.

We get on well and she has always helped me out when she can.

The thing about Marcus is all made up as I have not seen him for up to seven years.

Me or my brother have not hit him and I do not know why he is coming out with that.

I am going to go to my solicitors to see what I can do about this injunction.

I am hoping to get back to Colchester as I have a brother, Jason, there and we get on well. He helps me keep off the drink.

I bet Colchester Chief Inspector Paul Wells is happy, the joker. He is getting too old for the job.

I know I get drunk but the police keep coming over to me and my brother, Ashley, when we are doing nothing.

It is not like we cause trouble day-after-day.

You would think that the courts would help people like me and my brother but no, they just bang people up.

It is bad when I have to come to prison to get help for my drinking.

PC David Hirst does not know what he is talking about. He is a joke and I have always had trouble from him.

He did not like me or my brother but that goes two ways.

It is not right for the courts to do this.

I am a lot better now and have been off the drink for five weeks. Prison does help some people.

I would like to stop because I know I upset a lot of people, but when I am drunk I do not think about what I am doing.

I have not got into any trouble when not drunk so yes, I will have to stop or go to places to get help - and I can do it.

A lot of people are upset that we cannot go back to Colchester and they think it is a joke.

I am going to go all the way with this. I do not think Paul Wells will be happy for long. I am two minutes from the Borough.

Up the U’s, Barside barmy army!
