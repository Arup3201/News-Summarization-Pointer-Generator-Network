BBC Sport have retained Match of the Day highlights at a fair price after rivals ITV conceded it was not worth competing for the rights.

ITV’s decision was a surprise after being widely tipped to make a bid during the tender process. But memories remain of the blunders made by ITV when they had the highlights from 2001-04.

Screening the show in the early evening and having match analysts operating from the much-derided ‘Tactics Truck’ were innovations that failed to score with viewers.

ITV’s decision not to compete allows the Beeb to keep their flagship programme at a cost of £204million over three years — an increase of little more than £24m over their previous three-year deal. It is also far less than the mooted price of a winning bid if ITV had been fully engaged.

Only Wimbledon tennis ranks higher in BBC Sport’s portfolio so their delight is perhaps understandable. It is also a timely boost with the Beeb expecting to lose live rights for The Open golf to Sky in the near future.

Pay-TV networks will be offered the chance to bid for another of the BBC’s top three properties, Six Nations rugby, from 2018. 

And BBC keeping hold of one of their crown jewels means it’s also likely that Gary Lineker will stay at the Corporation for the duration of the next contract that runs for three seasons from 2016-17 onwards.

Lineker, however, whose Beeb contract expires in 2016 might still present BT Sport’s Champions League coverage from next season – if his BBC deal that currently gives them exclusivity for Lineker in the domestic market can be re-negotiated.

ITV deciding not to enter the highlights auction is also strange considering they axed Adrian Chiles last week as their lead football presenter with immediate effect - replacing him with Mark Pougatch in what was seen as a clear move to get a football revamp sorted before the highlights auction.

The Premier League are still guaranteed to get a significant lift in their terrestrial highlights package as nothing about ITV not bidding would have come out before the BBC put in their offer. 

However the rights were retained for £204m and the BBC have done well to keep them for that amount if they weren’t aware ITV hadn’t bid.

They had been expected to fetch at least £250m compared to the £180m paid by the BBC last time.

The agreement covers the Saturday night edition of Match of the Day, its Sunday morning repeat, Football Focus, Match of the Day 2 on Sunday nights and a new midweek magazine show to air on BBC Two at 10pm on Wednesday night.

Under the new deal, the Saturday night show will be available on the iPlayer on demand service for the first time. 

A BBC statement read: 'The new midweek programme will review and preview the weekend’s action with all the latest Premier League news, going behind the scenes at Premier League clubs, and bringing interviews with managers, players and those who have made their mark on the league’s illustrious history.'

Barbara Slater, Director of BBC Sport said: 'We’re delighted to retain the rights to show Premier League highlights on the BBC, and continue to bring the most popular league in the world to our audiences. Match of the Day is the most iconic brand in television sport, and we work hard to ensure that it continues to be the destination for millions of viewers each weekend across platforms.

'It’s very exciting to be able to add a new midweek show to the mix, reflecting the continued appetite for Premier League action and analysis.'

BBC Director General Tony Hall added: 'Sport matters. It brings the nation together. It can break hearts and raise spirits. And because it matters to the public, it also matters to the BBC.

'That’s why it’s fantastic news that we have kept the Premier League highlights.

'It’s the best and most exciting league in the world. The BBC has made the highlights programme, through Match of the Day, a national treasure, and fans can look forward to enjoying all the drama with us for another three years.' 

Match of the Day, the iconic BBC football highlights programme, was first screened on BBC2 on August 22, 1964 and featured coverage of just one match, the first division fixture between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield.

The programme's audience was estimated at a mere 20,000 - less than half the attendance at the ground - because not many households could receive the BBC2 channel, set up four months earlier.

It was not the first time the BBC had broadcast football - live matches had been shown since 1958 - but a new tradition of Saturday night highlights was born.

Match of the Day was broadcast on BBC2 for the first year of its existence 

The top division clubs initially had objections, fearing the promise of evening highlights would impact on gates at the ground, and so the BBC reached a compromise whereby they wouldn't reveal which match they would show until after the day's play had concluded. This arrangement remained in place until 1983.

The programme proved so popular, it was switched over to BBC One in 1965, and has remained there ever since.

The first Match of the Day broadcast in colour was on November 15, 1969 for the game between Liverpool and West Ham.

Slow motion replays were introduced in 1971 but the BBC's monopoly on League highlights was being challenged by ITV, who started showing Sunday afternoon highlights in the regions in 1968. The BBC responded to 'The Big Match' over on their rival station by showing a second game on Match of the Day.

In 1979, a new four-year deal saw rights split between BBC and ITV, and for two seasons in the early eighties, Match of the Day occupied a new Sunday afternoon slot before reverting back in 1983.

Worse was to follow in 1988, when the BBC lost all rights for League football to ITV, meaning the Match of the Day name continued purely with FA Cup highlights.

When England's leading clubs broke away to form the Premier League in 1992, the Beeb seized the chance to get back the highlights with Sky taking up exclusive live coverage.

For the first time, Match of the Day showed highlights from three games plus the goals from the other matches for the first time.

Premier League highlights have been on the BBC for the entire Premier League era with the exception of 2001-2004, when ITV launched 'The Premiership'.

Their idea to bring Saturday night highlights to an earlier time backfired and ratings were poor. When the BBC picked up the baton again, they started showing highlights from every game with a commentator at each ground.

The famous theme song was written especially for the programme by Barry Stoller in 1970. Previously, the intro had been 'Drum Majorette', written by Major Leslie Statham, the band leader of the Welsh Guards.

Stoller's rather vague brief was to write 'something good' and he came up with a theme that is one of the most recognisable in the UK.
