If winning is a habit, it’s one that Celtic would like to reacquire with some haste. If few are yet willing to entertain the notion of Ronny Deila’s men doing anything other than romping to this season’s SPFL Premiership title, they aren’t doing much cavorting at the moment.

At Dens Park, they certainly played their part in a hugely entertaining 1-1 draw. Yet the fact that Paul Hartley’s home side were at least equally responsible for the thrills on a sunny afternoon said a great deal about Celtic’ s current state of readiness.

When Deila admits, as he did yesterday, that his team looked ‘afraid’ in a game against newly-promoted opposition, something isn’t right. The Celtic boss insists that all will be better after the international break – and after the ins and outs of a transfer window are completed. They’ll need to be.

Equaliser: Leigh Griffiths came off the bench to score and earn Celtic a point against Dundee

On Tayside, a James McPake header almost exactly one minute into this early kick-off was cancelled out when substitute Leigh Griffiths scored against one of his many former clubs not long after half-time.

Over 90 minutes plus added time of cut and thrust, to and fro, give and go – not to mention some slap and tickle among a Celtic defence missing their star player, more of whom elsewhere and later, ad infinitum – both teams had their chances to win. Each settled rather uneasily for a point at the end of a day when off-field events often intruded on the thoughts of spectators.

The curse of the closing days of any transfer window is that every aspect of team selection, every tiny gesture, is magnified and analysed to the nth degree. Often with good reason; most of us are long enough in the tooth to read the runes at this time of year.

Virgil van Dijk being left out, then, was obvious. We knew he wanted to leave Celtic, we were aware of interest from several Premier League teams – and we knew that Celtic weren’t for turning on this issue.

Opener: James McPake headed in a Phillip Roberts corner to put the hosts in front

Kris Commons being recalled, meanwhile, could be interpreted as the manager looking to rebuild some goodwill with a player whose agent is arriving in Glasgow for contract talks tomorrow. Pick your way through that one.

As for Griffiths coming off the bench for the ineffectual Jo Inge Berget – hooked before half-time – to score and perform as well as any in Hoops? That’ll be the end of any silly talk about him being loaned out to Hibs. Celtic need all the livewires they can get at the moment.

In a first half typified by Celtic sluggishness and Dundee’s vigour, the visitors were constantly troubled down their left flank. Partly because Emilio Izaguirre couldn’t cope with Dundee winger Philip Roberts, making his league debut for the club – and partly because Celtic counterpart Berget gave his full-back about as much protection as a paper mache tank.

Berget was an empty jersey here, offering nothing in attack and less than zero in defence. On a day when Celtic could not afford to be carrying any passengers, it was a minor miracle that the Norwegian made it to 40 minutes before Deila replaced him with Griffiths.

By that point Dundee were sitting fairly comfortably on a 1-0 lead, having started at a pace that clearly caught Celtic cold. It began inside the opening minute, Roberts leaving

Impressive: Dundee are currently sixth in the table, level on points with Celtic

Izaguirre for dead and forcing Jason Denayer into a last-ditch tackle at the expense of a corner. An early tester from a set piece, then.

It was a test that Celtic failed. Or, rather, one passed easily by Dundee, as a Roberts delivery was met by the forehead of a soaring McPake, the bounce of his downward header beating Callum McGregor on the post.

Celtic rallied to create a couple of near things but, with Peter MacDonald always lively for the home side, Dundee looked as likely to score as the reigning champions. Especially when Roberts got on the ball.

The former Falkirk winger’s best moment came as he was being castigated for a perceived lack of go-forward by failing to show down the line for a breaking Paul McGowan. In reality, he was just biding his time, holding back to create the five or six yards needed to explode past Izaguirre, beat Denayer and fire in a low shot tipped on to the post by Craig Gordon.

The introduction of Griffiths helped Celtic greatly, while central defender Eoghan O’Connell replacing Adam Matthews at half-time – forcing Efe Ambrose out to right back – also gave them more ability to carry the ball out from the back.

When the equaliser came, with 54 minutes on the clock, no-one inside Dens would have been surprised by the identity of the scorer. They know ‘Sparky’ Griffiths in these parts. Remember him with a certain fondness.

Taking the ball into feet on the edge of the box, the striker turned and hit a sweet low shot with his left foot, a deflection off the helpless Thomas Konrad helping the ball to fizz and spin beyond the reach of a despairing Kyle Letheren and in off the post.

Celtic were certainly energised by the equaliser, a superb charge from O’ Connell ending with Stokes strangely choosing not to shoot, while a fading Roberts – eventually replaced – began to struggle with Izaguirre’s forward surges.

Yet Dundee sub Martin Boyle, on for Roberts, could easily have scored from one of three – yes, that’s three – chances created by his blistering pace against a wandering Celtic back line.

On each occasion Boyle stormed down the inside right channel, exposing gaps and skipping over a despairing Denayer at one point. Two of his shots were pulled just off target, the other swatted aside by Gordon, whose reactions were equal to the powerful thump.

Chances came and went for both teams as this match rattled towards the finish, Anthony Stokes hitting the post and Griffiths forcing Letheren into a fine save from a 25-yarder that moved wickedly through the air, while Luka Tankulic twice came close to securing all three points for the hosts.

It was breathless, occasionally brilliant, quite often barmy. Not the kind of experience that Celtic would like to make a habit of.
