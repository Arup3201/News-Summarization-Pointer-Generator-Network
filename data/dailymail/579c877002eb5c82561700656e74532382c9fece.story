The Brazilian referee who took charge of England’s World Cup with West Germany 24 years ago says he wanted Bobby Robson’s men to win the game - despite being responsible for making Gazza cry.

England crashed out of the semi-finals of Italia 90 on penalties but the game became more famous for Paul Gascoigne’s tears after he was booked meaning he would miss the final – if England got progressed.

And Jose Roberto Wright says he wanted England to progress to the final as it would have given him the best chance of taking charge of the final.

England’s chances of progressing to the final were ended in the shoot-out when Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed.

Wright told the Guardian: ‘I had to be really sharp but I must confess that somewhere in my mind I was hoping England could win.

‘Not because my great-grandfather was English, I swear.

‘Only with England in the final could I have a chance to referee that game. The Germans would never want a Brazilian referee again after losing in two finals refereed by my fellow countrymen [in 1982 and 1986].

‘England almost did it but that fella with the funny hair [Chris Waddle] sent his penalty almost outside the stadium and the Germans went through.’

The tears shed by Gazza on that Turin helped the English public fall in love with football again after a number of difficult years. And 24 years on, the picture of Gascoigne crying has become one of the iconic World Cup images.

And Wright says he has been asked to donate a memento from that evening to a museum.

He added: ‘Years later I read that Gascoigne’s tears were some kind of watershed moment in English football, that people fell in love again with the game. In a way I was happy to be part of such a historical occasion and I don’t think Gazza has a problem either.

‘A few months ago somebody from England called me asking if I could donate a memento of that game for a Gascoigne museum. I might actually give them the yellow card I used. Yeah, I still have it.’
