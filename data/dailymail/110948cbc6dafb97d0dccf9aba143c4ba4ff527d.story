Male nurse Neil Riley, 54, was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Lancashire

A male nurse at one Britain’s most prestigious Catholic boarding schools has been found hanged after he was accused of being a peeping tom.

Neil Riley, 54, had been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism after claims he set up hidden cameras in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues.

Staff at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where boarding school fees cost up to £28,443 per year, called police after it was believed four women had been secretly filmed.

Mr Riley was later questioned and released on bail but five days later he was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Blackburn, following concerns for his welfare.

Lancashire Police today said inquiries were still ongoing into whether any offences had been committed against the staff.

Officers are studying a computer seized from Mr Riley’s home to check for any files which may contain film footage of the college. It is feared up to two secret cameras may have been used to film the unwitting women getting undressed.

Det Insp Claire Holbrook said: 'We can confirm that a 54-year-old man was arrested at his home on Sunday, November 11, on suspicion of voyeurism after concerns were raised by staff at Stonyhurst College.

'The man was a non-teaching member of staff who was employed as a nurse. He was bailed pending an examination of the cameras seized, and other computer equipment.

'On the evening of Friday, November 16, officers sadly found the man deceased at his home. There are no suspicious circumstances. His family are aware. There is still an on-going police investigation.'

She added: 'There is no suggestion any of the children at the college have been in any way physically abused by this man. I have no suspicion, or evidence, to link this individual to other offenders.

Investigation: Mr Riley's death came just days after he was arrested over claims he set up a hidden camera in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues at the £28,000-a-year Stonyhurst College

Allegations: An investigation was launched at Stonyhurst College two weeks ago after staff reported concerns about Mr Riley's behaviour

'Clearly, because of the tragic circumstances which followed the arrest, this man will never face court proceedings.

'It must be understood at this stage Mr Riley had not been convicted.

'We will work closely with the college to identify any offences committed, any persons who may be victims, ensure that they are safeguarded, and offered any support or counselling that may be required.'

Mr Riley joined the college as a nurse in 2005 and was involved in the college’s combined cadet force, where he was recently promoted to captain.

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned until January 29.

A Stonyhurst College spokesman said: 'Concerns were raised two weeks ago by other staff about Mr Riley, a member of the nursing staff at Stonyhurst.

'It was thought he may have set up a hidden camera in a staff bedroom for voyeuristic reasons. As soon as the concern was raised, Mr Riley was sent home and the police were asked to investigate. The college has also informed social services of this.

'Sadly Mr Riley was found dead at home by the Police on Friday 16th November.

'We understand the police have still to conclude their investigation, and we are co-operating with them fully.

'Staff, parents and pupils have been made aware, and we have offered support to those who have been upset by it. We have also been in touch with the family of Mr Riley to offer our support.'

Stonyhurst College - whose French motto, Quant Je Puis means 'As Much as I Can' - is a coeducational Roman Catholic independent school, adhering to the Jesuit tradition and was founded in 1593.

Former old boys include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of Sherlock Holmes, England rugby star Kyran Bracken and Mark Thompson, former Director General of the BBC.

In 1998 a Jesuit priest who sexually abused four pupils aged between 12 and 16 while a maths teacher at the school between 1987 and 1995 was jailed for five years. The sentence was reduced to three years on appeal.

At the time of his trial the Catholic Society of Jesus blamed a breakdown in communication for their failure to take heed of warnings about the priest’s behaviour while abroad.

Before being convicted, the Jesuits had sent him to Canada for psychiatric treatment and he later went to Our Lady of Victory, in Gloucestershire, the retreat where fallen priests from the UK and the Irish Republic are sent.
