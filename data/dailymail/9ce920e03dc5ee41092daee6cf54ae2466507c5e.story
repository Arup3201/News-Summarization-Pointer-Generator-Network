A Massachusetts teenager accused of killing his math teacher with a box cutter appeared to be 'psychotic' after he allegedly attacked a youth female clinician in Boston earlier this month.

According to the petition to have Philip Chism committed to Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital for 30 days of evaluation and treatment, the 15-year-old was 'out of touch with reality' and 'yelling, screaming incoherently [and] foaming at the mouth while being restrained by staff.'

The attack happened June 2 at a Department of Youth Services detention center.

Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker

The details were released Tuesday by a Superior Court judge in response to a motion by The Salem News.

Chism
 pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers 
High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a restroom 
last October. He was 14 at the time.

Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident.

Prosecutor
 Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down 
out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her
 while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she 
screamed.

In the petition to have Chism committed, psychologist Kenneth Rogers wrote that the teenager strangled, punched and stabbed the female unit clinician.

'Once pulled off her, he was out of touch with reality, screaming, yelling and moaning incoherently for about two hours even as he was taken away,' wrote Rogers.

The document also stated that Chism's mother informed officials that before the June 2 attack her son had no history of psychosis.

Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors

During a hearing held June 10, the 
prosecutor insisted that Chism not be left alone with female staff at 
the facility, describing the teen as 'someone who appeared utterly calm 
and fine in the moments leading up to the event.'

Kate
 MacDougall also expressed concern that within the detention center, 
patients are free to move around, which could potentially put female 
staff and patients at risk

Lester Blumberg, the Department of Mental Health attorney who represented the hospital at the hearing, assured the prosecutor that while the patients' rooms are not locked, Chism remains under guard at night and is rarely alone.

Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and murdered with a box cutter last October

Authorities
 still don't know what motivated the transfer student 
from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher.

He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October.

Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene.

Chism,
 who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, 
allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, 
sexually assaulted her twice, including once with a stick, stripped her and then stole her cellphone,
 credit cars and her driver's licenses.

According
 to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and 
carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped.

After
 dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot 
where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied 
school clothes.

He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'.

Police
 arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy 
highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's 
underwear.

Last
 month, Ritzer's parents, Tom and Peggie Ritzer, issued a video statement 
speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their 
support. 

'These 
past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our 
family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said.

'Each
 day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family
 and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our 
daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive
 to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.'

support. Pictured is Ritzer's sister Laura, father Tom, mother Peggie and brother Tom

In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name.

'Thank
 you for your kind words, generous gestures and support of the 
scholarship fund in Colleen’s name that will empower future generations 
of thoughtful, caring teachers to emulate Colleen’s passion to inspire 
students to discover their full potential,' Mr Rtizer said, flanked by 
Mrs Ritzer and Colleen's sister Laura and brother Tom.

Following
 his arrest, classmates and teachers at the school expressed shock that 
such a quiet and polite boy could commit such a horrendous crime.

Chism's
 mother Diana - who is separated from father Stacey - said her son was 
'born in love' and that she is 'struggling to understand' the murder.
