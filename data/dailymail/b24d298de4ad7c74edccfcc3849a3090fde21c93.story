Health authorities in Ireland were last night seeking legal advice over whether a brain-damaged pregnant woman should be kept on life-support in an attempt to save her unborn child.

It is understood the woman who is in her late 20s suffered a brain trauma within the last two weeks and was originally brought to the Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.

However well-placed sources say she has now been brought to the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar which has a maternity unit. She is said to be within the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy.

It is understood some members of the woman’s family wish for the machine to be kept on, but other individuals do not believe that action to be appropriate.

The health service are seeking legal advice in relation to whether they continue to keep the mother on life-support for the sake of her unborn baby.

Health authorities were expected to receive definitive legal advice yesterday in relation to the rights of the mother versus the rights of the unborn child.

Sources say the mother – believed to be from Westmeath – suffered from significant ‘brain trauma’.

An Irish medical law expert said Dublin High Court most likely would determine whether the woman will be kept alive artificially until the baby can be delivered. The case is scheduled for Tuesday.

Dr Adam McAuley, a Dublin City University law lecturer, said yesterday: ‘The law isn't clear, and when there is conflict, the matter will have to come before the court.’

Such disputes have become increasingly frequent in Ireland, a predominantly Catholic land from which more than 4,000 women travel annually to receive abortions in England.

However, that option does not exist for ill women medically unable to leave the island.

The news comes after Health Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday that constitutional restrictions on abortion are too ‘restrictive’ and have a ‘chilling effect’ on doctors.

He was speaking in the Dáil on a private members’ bill on the Eighth Amendment, which gives equal rights to the mother and the unborn.

Mr Varadkar said: ‘Difficult decisions that should be made by women and their doctors, a couple or the next-of-kin where there is no capacity, and on the basis of best clinical practice, are now made on foot of legal advice. That isn't how it should be.’

Last year after bitter debate, politicians amended Ireland's abortion ban to make terminations legal if doctors deem the woman's life at risk from continued pregnancy. That step had been delayed for two decades.

It finally happened after an Indian woman died from blood poisoning linked to her own dying foetus. The Irish hospital had refused her abortion pleas, citing the foetus' heartbeat.

There are increasing calls in Ireland for the country to legalise abortions in cases involving rape, fatal foetal abnormalities, or long-term health risks to the woman.
