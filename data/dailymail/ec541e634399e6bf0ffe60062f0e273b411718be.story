In life, his courage and selflessness inspired the nation.

Now, one month after his death, teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton has been honoured with a rare posthumous MBE.

The 19-year-old formally accepted the tribute before losing his fight with the illness – and declared the honour ‘awesome’.

Award: Stephen Sutton, who lost his battle with cancer one month ago, knew about his accolade before he died. He said the honour was 'awesome'

Stephen, whose trademark thumbs-up gesture summed up his refusal to be cowed by the disease, captured hearts and raised an astonishing £4million for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

His mother Jane, 49, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, said she was ‘truly delighted and immensely proud’ he had been recognised.

Announcing the birthday honours yesterday, the Cabinet Office said more than 1,100 people had received an award, 49 per cent of them women.

Some 11 per cent of the honours are for work in education – including knighthoods or damehoods for five heads – while health workers make up 8 per cent. Those who helped in the aftermath of the floods that hit the South-West in February are recognised too.

Robert Francis, QC, who led the inquiry into scandal-hit Stafford Hospital after up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily, is knighted for services to healthcare and patients.

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, gets an OBE for services to consumer rights and charitable services, and pensions expert Ros Altmann – who led a crusade for pensioners losing their final salary schemes – receives a CBE.

In politics, Labour MP Dawn Primarolo, the Deputy Speaker – once known as Red Dawn for her Left-wing views – receives a damehood. Knighthoods go to veteran Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash, 74; fellow Tory Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill; and Tony Blair’s biographer Anthony Seldon, the head of Wellington College. A CBE goes to former Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin.

A scientist targeted by animal rights activists receives a knighthood after previously being snubbed. Neuroscientist Professor Colin Blakemore, 70, has endured letters laced with razor blades, parcel bombs and kidnap threats to his children.
