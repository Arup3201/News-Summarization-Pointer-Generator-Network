President Barack Obama joked today during a New York speech that he doesn't seem to have the traffic problems the city's residents are always complaining about.

'It's actually pretty smooth for me during the week,' Obama said, after playfully arguing that everyone in New York 'hypes' the traffic.

'I don't know what the problem is,' he told attendees of the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting. 'I haven't noticed.'

Traffic? What Traffic?: President Barack Obama feigned ignorance of the traffic jams his visits to New York cause while speaking at the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York this afternoon

Obama said he told former president Bill Clinton backstage that his daughter Chelsea, left, whose due to give birth any day now, could use his motorcade if she went into labor while he was on stage.

A very pregnant Chelsea Clinton showed off her baby bump at the 10th Clinton Global Initiative today. Soon-to-be grandfather Bill Clinton indicated in an interview that aired on Sunday that Chelsea will likely have her baby by October 1

Obama started off the bit by saying he told CGI namesake and former U.S. president Bill Clinton backstage that if his daughter Chelsea went into labor while he was speaking 'she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic.'

The president was seemingly unaware of how intensely New York drivers despise his visits and the traffic jams they cause around the city.

Every time the president travels to New York police have to close streets along his motorcade's route, sometimes for long stretches of time, turning the city's busiest roadways into parking lots.

The already busy streets were even more jam-packed this week as the United Nations convened for a climate change summit and a General Assembly meeting.

Per usual, New Yorkers took out their outrage over the gridlock caused by Obama's motorcade on twitter.

'GO HOME OBAMA NO ONE WANTS THIS TRAFFIC,' twitter user Rebecca Plaine said.

'Thank you Obama for causing all this bulls*** traffic in NYC,' a user named Ramirez tweeted.

'Pres and Lady Obama we love you guys but please leave NY ASAP! This traffic is unbearable!' user Rachel Johnson begged.

First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied the president to New York this afternoon, and the first couple will remain there through Thursday.

After learning that Obama had mocked their travel problems, residents of New York and the surrounding area were even more irate.

'I know multiple folks who missed flights today because of him. File Under: No laughing matter,' twitter user @lisaedlisa said.

The president and first lady will be in New York through Thursday attending various United Nations meetings

President Obama was introduced at today's CGI meeting by the organization's founder, former president Bill Clinton. Obama said he noticed audience members 'trickling out' just before he took the stage after a panel that actor Matt Damon was participating in concluded

Obama was preceded at today's CGI conference by actor and Water.org co-founder Matt Damon, who spoke about the clean water initiatives.

'Always wonderful to follow Matt Damon,' the president jested moments after his traffic wisecrack. 

'I saw people trickling out after he was done.

'These are the hardcore policy people who decided to stay for me,' he teased.

President Obama is in the Big Apple this week for a series of events, including today's U.N. meeting, where he prodded the global community to cut carbon emissions, and the Clinton Foundation gathering. 

There he promoted the administration's new Stand with Civil Society program and advocated for the strengthening of civil society abroad.

This evening the president will attend a Democratic Party fundraiser. Obama will again give remarks to the U.N. on Wednesday and Thursday before returning to Washington, D.C. on Thursday evening.
