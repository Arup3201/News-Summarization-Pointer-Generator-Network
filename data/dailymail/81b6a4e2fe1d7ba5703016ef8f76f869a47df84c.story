Senior teachers at Catholic schools have been warned they face demotion or the sack for being openly gay, remarrying after divorce or cohabiting with a partner.

New Church guidelines state that key staff and governors in a ‘non-chaste’ relationship  outside marriage could face an investigation and be removed from their posts.

Education Secretary Michael today rebuffed calls to intervene, insisting schools only had to act within the law.

Guidance issued to Catholic schools, such as St. John Fisher Catholic Primary School in Erith, south east London, covers the relationships which teachers and govenors are allowed to have

The advice is in a booklet written by Monsignor Marcus Stock, the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference.

It urges heads, deputies, governors 
and heads of religious education to avoid making ‘substantive life 
choices’ that conflict with the Church’s teaching.

The advice is aimed at the Church’s 2,100 state schools.

The National Secular Society wants the booklet to be withdrawn.

Director Keith Porteous Wood said: ‘A
 growing percentage of teachers in Roman Catholic schools are not 
Catholics, and a significant proportion of Catholic teachers will have 
made life choices deemed incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic 
Church.

‘Both groups have cause to sleep less
 easily as the Church becomes ever more intolerant of lifestyles that 
are becoming commonplace.’

The Catholic Education Service said the booklet was guidance rather than mandate.

Head teachers, principals, deputy heads and heads of RE and most governors at Catholic schools are required to be practising Catholics. They must also conduct themselves in a way which does not conflict with the Church, the guidance says.

It states: ‘There are also substantive life choices which are incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic Church and which may be detrimental or prejudicial to the religious ethos and character of a Catholic school.’

These could include:

Failure to abide by the rules could affect ‘their ability to govern or to lead and model Catholic life and faith with ecclesial integrity may cease to exist’, it adds.

Breaching the guidance would trigger and investigation and in some circumstances ‘may necessitate a member of the governing authority of a Catholic school being removed from office or disciplinary action being taken against someone appointed to a key post’.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has insisted it is up to schools to decide who to employ

The National Secular Society (NSS) said the lawful, private activities of teachers ‘should not be any business of prying employers’.

It said it had written to Mr Gove asking for the document to be withdrawn.

But the Department for Education said today: ‘This is a matter for schools and their governors.

‘Faith schools can consider whether a person’s conduct is in line with their religious values when dismissing teachers. However schools must also comply with employment law.’

Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the NSS, said: ‘A growing percentage of teachers in Roman Catholic schools are not Catholics, and a significant proportion of Catholic teachers will have made life choices which are deemed incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic Church.

‘However good they are as teachers, both groups have cause to sleep less easily as the Church becomes ever more intolerant of lifestyles that are becoming commonplace,’ he told the Times Educational Supplement.

A spokeswoman for the Catholic Education Service told the magazine: ‘The recently revised document Christ at the Centre offers guidance to governing bodies, staff and parents about the ethos and values of Catholic schools.

‘It is a matter for governing bodies and dioceses to make staffing decisions based on local situations.’
