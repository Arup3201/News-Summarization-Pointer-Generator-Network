Today show host Savannah Guthrie debuted an edgy new look when she took to the red carpet for Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show on Sunday night, flaunting a toned tummy in a daring midriff-baring ensemble - just six months after welcoming her first child with husband Michael Feldman.

The 43-year-old, who gave birth to daughter Vale on August 13, 2014, drew plenty of attention in her $550 Cushnie Et Ochs figure-hugging long-sleeved crop top, which featured cut-outs down each of the arms, and black A-line skirt, which fell just below her knees.

Despite being on the red carpet primarily to interview the show's numerous celebrity attendees, Savannah was herself the talk of the town - particularly on Twitter, where fans were quick to compliment her on her new look.

'Who were you wearing tonight? LOVED the crop top!' one person wrote, while another added: 'I love your look. Beautiful. You knocked it out of the park.'

The new mother, who celebrated daughter Vale's six-month milestone live on air on last Friday's episode of the Today show, accessorized her daring ensemble with a pair of simple black and nude pointed-toe heels, a silver charm necklace and a number of gold rings - as well as adding some extra sparkle courtesy of her beautiful engagement ring.  

It appeared as though Savannah was also debuting a darker hairstyle; while we are used to seeing her modeling a full head of blonde highlights, Sunday night's red carpet saw her showcasing a more natural, dark brunette shade, with just a few subtle streaks of blonde. 

And when it came to her make-up look for the evening, Savannah also chose to go for a darker look, opting for a bold smokey eye, complete with some seriously lengthy lashes. 

Clearly thrilled to be a part of such a historical show, which was celebrating the 40 years that Saturday Night Live has been on the air, as well as paying tribute to its most memorable cast members, Savannah herself took to Twitter to share her excitement at the evening's events.

Surprise! Actor Jim Carrey left the Today show team speechless after asking them where they were 'hiding' NBC anchor Brian Williams

Alongside a picture of herself and her Today show co-hosts, Al Roker, Matt Lauer and Carson Daly, posing on the red carpet, Savannah commented: 'A night to remember!' 

Indeed, it wasn't just Savannah's daring ensemble which Today show fans will be remembering for weeks to come; all four of the Today show hosts were left speechless after actor Jim Carrey asked Matt Lauer about the whereabouts of NBC anchor Brian Williams. 

'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?' the comedian asked, leaving both SNL host Tina Fey and Savannah struggling to string together a sentence, while 57-year-old Matt was only able to say: 'Look at the time!'

But happily for Mr Williams, the jokes at his expense were barely a fraction of the material on Sunday evening.

Musicians, actors, and politicians alike lined up on the red carpet to tell the Today show team just how much they love the show.

Seth Meyers attributed the success of the show to creator Lorne Michaels' 'good taste'.

In a moving tribute, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani remembered the show's first post-9/11 show as 'one of the most patriotic moments for this show, maybe for America.'

Sarah Palin spoke alongside Alec and Hilaria Baldwin to hail the show as a center for 'the most intelligent and comedic minds in America in one place.'

She appeared on the show in 2008, during her presidential campaign, beside a lookalike version of herself played by Tina Fey.

In a nod to that episode, she told Matt and Savannah: 'If this is indicative of the campaign it was the most fun moment of the campaign.'
