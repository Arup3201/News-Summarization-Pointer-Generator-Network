Three people have been injured after shots were fired in the underground car park of Denmark's largest shopping centre, police have said.

The attack took place earlier this morning at Fields - a busy shopping precinct on the outskirts of the Danish capital Copenhagen.

Local media reported that two people had been arrested by police though it was not immediately clear whether
those responsible for the shots are being held.

'We have a massive presence [there]. It happened in the
parking basement. One person is hit in the arm, the other is
possibly hit in the back,' the police chief, Michael Andersen said. 

Alert: Police in Copenhagen have been on guard since former convict Omar El-Hussein attacked a free speech event and a synagogue, killing two people and injuring five police officers in February

Officials at Copenhagen police reached by telephone said
they could not confirm any details. There was no official word
on any motive, although witnesses claimed the shooting was gang related. 

Speaking to local news agency Rittzau, Andersen said the shooting was a result of 'two groups who clashed', adding that approximately eight people had been involved in the incident. 

'It seem two groups got in a quarrel and it culminated in the parking basement in Field's where a still unknown number of shots were fired,' Police Communications Officer Sebastian Richelsen added.

Located in the Amager district, Fields is the biggest shopping centre in Denmark.

Copenhagen police have been on guard since local former convict
Omar El-Hussein attacked a free speech event and a synagogue,
killing two people and injuring five police officers last month.

The first shooting took place at a public  event called 'Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression' at the, where El-Hussein killed film director Finn Noergaard, 55, and wounded three police officers.

Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who garnered fame and notoriety for his drawings of the Prophet Muhammed, was among the speakers and is thought to have been the main target of the attacks.

Hours later, security employee Dan Uzan, 37, was shot in the head as he stood outside a building belonging to the city's Great Synagogue. El-Hussein's bloody rampage was brought to an end shortly after when he was shot dead by police officers after a dramatic stand-off.

Following the attack Denmark's government  pledged 970 million kroner (£95 million) to strengthen anti-terrorism measures, including boosting foreign and domestic intelligence gathering.

The government started drafting the plans in January after lawmakers demanded a review of anti-terror measures following the terror attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris.

Social Democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt says the plan includes 415 million kroner (£40 million) to boost efforts to monitor Danes joining Islamic militant groups abroad.

A further 200 million kroner (£20 million) went to the domestic intelligence agency, and 150 million kroner (£15 million) to more IT and analysis capacity.

The government also stated that it wants more SWAT team members and bodyguards in the city.
