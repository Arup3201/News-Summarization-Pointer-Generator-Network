Last week Queen Letizia flaunted a new hairstyle, which gave the appearance of a
 swish bob, at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony held at the Palacio
 de Congresos of Girona in Catalonia.

It wasn't clear whether the glamorous Royal had gone for the chop and cut 
off her luscious locks - or whether she was fooling us with clever 
styling, and had simply twisted her flowing hair under, and pinned it.

Today's appearance proves that it was just a nifty stylist trick as she showcased her usual flowing caramel hair on a visit to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican.

It was just a trick: Queen Letizia of Spain showed us that her short hair last week was just a styling trick as she wore it in its trademark style today during a meeting with Pope Francis at his private library in the Apostolic Palace

The visit today was her and Prince Felipe's first foreign trip as monarchs, and invited the pontiff to visit Spain.

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, wearing white as is standard protocol for a queen visiting the pope, were greeted by Francis in the papal library.

They chatted for about 40 minutes in private. As they left, Felipe invited Francis to visit and bent down to kiss the pope's ring, while Letizia curtsied. 

Just a trick! It wasn't clear whether the glamorous Royal had gone for the chop and cut off her luscious locks - or whether she was fooling us with clever styling at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony - and it was just a trick, as proven today, right

Isn't she lovely: The 41-year-old wore natural make-up and dazzling earrings at the event

In a statement, the Vatican noted that it was the monarchs' first foreign visit and said the cordial talks focused on church-state cooperation in Spain and unspecified global conflicts.

Francis had met Felipe's parents, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, on several occasions, the last time during the April 27 canonizations of Saints John Paul II and John XXIII.  Juan Carlos abdicated earlier this month.

It has been a busy few weeks for the 41-year-old. Since becoming Queen she has attended numerous public events. She showcased her good taste once again last week as she joined 
her husband to attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association
at El Pardo Palace in Madrid.

For that occasion, she wore tailored navy trousers and a tweed blue jacket.

Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north
west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at 
Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The
couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain. Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
