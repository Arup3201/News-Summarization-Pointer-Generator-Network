The relatives of a baby boy who was brutally killed by his parents today condemned their short nine-year jail term as a ‘kick in the face’.

Levi-Blu Cassin, of Smith's Wood, Birmingham, died as a result of horrific abdominal injuries ‘consistent with being hit by a car or falling from a three-storey building’.

But, following a five-week trial, his parents Danielle Cassin, 27, and Mark Piper, 31, were both cleared of murder and manslaughter after a jury was unable to pinpoint which one had dealt the fatal blows.

They were sentenced to just nine years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday for causing, or allowing, the 22-month-old’s death in February last year.

Levi-Blu’s grandmother, Angela Cassin, told today how the boy’s family are ‘devastated and disgusted’ by the sentence and condemned social services for failing to prevent his death.

She said: ‘No amount of justice will bring him back – but nine years is like a kick in the face. We’ve just lost so much.

'We don’t know the truth – and we’re never going to know the truth. We’re forever having different scenarios running through our heads.’

During the trial Cassin – a known drug addict - from Chelmsley Wood in Solihull, West Midlands, and Piper, of no fixed address, blamed each other for the death of their son.

A year after his death, the pair remained together and refused to tell police of the drugs and violence that plagued their son’s life.

To this day neither has revealed how he suffered his ‘major internal injuries’ - comparable to those seen after car crashes or falls from two or three storeys.

Throughout the trial the court heard how Cassin would take her son to crack dens where she would take Class A drugs for hours at a time. 

And Piper was painted as a violent bully who regularly beat her.

The drugs and violence at their flat prompted neighbours and friends to call Solihull Social Services and police. But Levi was never taken away from his parents.

A Serious Case Review - to be published in the spring - is now investigating whether police and social services failed to protect the boy.

In a statement issued yesterday, following the verdict, Levi-Blu’s family said: ‘We refuse to let Levi-Blu be another sad statistic that we only remember when another poor innocent child is murdered.

‘This was a tragedy that could have been prevented if the right steps had been taken by the various agencies responsible for the care and protection of our beautiful angel.’

Mrs Cassin, 47, who lives around the corner from where her daughter and grandson lived, said yesterday: ‘Danielle could have said anything to me and I would have helped her.

‘She could have just given me Levi, and said she was having problems - I would have taken him. I always believe life is about choices and this is what she chose to do. Levi had no choices.’

She added: ‘I just want the world to love him and know how much he was loved.’

Birmingham Crown Court heard how Cassin phoned for an ambulance after her son stopped breathing at around 4.30am on the morning of his death.

Paramedics arrived at the couple’s flat to find him lying on the floor between the cot and his mother’s bed.

Prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC said the lifeless child’s eyes were open but his lips had turned blue and his heart was not beating.

He was rushed to hospital on blue lights but was pronounced dead at around 5.30am on February 20 last year.

Mr Raggatt said: ‘The totality of the injuries was so severe that they could not have happened by accident, they are the result of at least one very substantial blow to the abdomen and maybe more.

‘The injury was sustained at least six hours, and maybe up to 12 hours, before the 999 call was put in asking for assistance.

‘The defendants are charged jointly with murder because this has to have occurred as a result of cooperation between the two of them.

‘It was a joint enterprise. One person can do the damage, but if the other supports or connives then they are guilty too.’

Following yesterday's verdict, Edwina Grant, chair of the Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board, said a review was underway.

‘We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Levi-Blu,’ she said. 

‘I can confirm Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board is carrying out a serious case review, the final results of which will be published in the spring.’
