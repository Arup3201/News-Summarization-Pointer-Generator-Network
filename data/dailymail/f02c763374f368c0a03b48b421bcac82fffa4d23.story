A Nike advert featuring Oscar Pistorius and describing him as like a 'bullet in the chamber' has been removed from the sprinter's website hours after he was charged with shooting dead his model girlfriend.

A banner of the advert, thought to have been made in 
2011, was visible on Oscar Pistorius's website earlier yesterday but has 
since been taken down.

Alongside a time lapse picture of Paralympic gold medalist Pistorius springing from the starting blocks reads the caption: 'I am the bullet in the chamber.' 

It was removed just hours after he was charged with shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp at his Pretoria home.

The 30-year-old model was shot four times in the head, chest and arm.

Nike has extended its 'sympathy and 
condolences to all families concerned' but refused to comment 
further as the matter is now a police issue.

Pistorius has long been the poster boy
of disabled sport, never more so than since he made headlines around 
the globe competing at the Olympics and Paralympics in London last 
summer.

But with the champion sprinter making 
headlines of a different nature after he allegedly shot dead Reeva 
Steenkamp, 30, at his home in Pretoria, his star already appears to have
fallen.

A television station has already also pulled an advertising campaign featuring Pistorius following his arrest.

The South African station M-Net said 
it is no longer using the adverts that were to promote its coverage of 
the Oscars on February 23.

Billboards featuring Pistorius in a suit with the slogan 'Every night is 'Oscar' night this February' were pictured being removed in Johannesburg yesterday.

In a statement on Twitter, the 
station confirmed: 'Out of respect and sympathy to the bereaved, M-Net
will be pulling its entire Oscar campaign featuring Oscar Pistorius 
with immediate effect.'

Another of his sponsors, British 
Telecom, said: 'We are shocked by this terrible, tragic news. We have no
further comment at this stage.

His agents at Fast Track management said there would be no comment.

While fans took to Twitter in their 
thousands to express their shock, others were 
lambasted for making jokes about the shooting.

A tweet from John Cleese came under fire for being distasteful

Twitter user Anthony McGuinness hit out at John Cleese's tweet yesterday

Harriet Garner also failed to see the funny side of Mr Cleese's post

Fawlty Towers star John Cleese came 
under fire for Tweeting that Pistorius' defence would be 'that he was 
absoultely legless at the time.'

WIthin minutes, followers had branded the joke 'distasteful' and 'disrespectful'.

Harriet Garner tweeted: 'Sorry don't 
see how anyone can "make light" of such a death. That was 
uncharacteristic poor taste I fear.'

Controversial comedian Frankie Boyle was also attacked for making light of Miss Steenkamp's death.

He Tweeted: 'The tragedy is if Oscar Pistorius had no arms this would never have happened.'

A Twitter user named Will hit back 
'The girl who died was someone's child. You're a father, imagine losing 
one of your children only to have it joked about.'

Former 100metre sprint world record holder Asafa Powell Tweeted about the news describing Pistorius as 'a true inspiration'.

He posted: 'Sad news about @oscarpistorius & fatal shooting of his girlfriend
he's a true inspiration & amazing athlete. A real tragedy for all.'

His former coach, Italian pole vaulter Andrea Giannini, said: 'I knew Oscar well. I'm hoping it was just a 
tragic accident.

'He's a marvelous person, a really sweet and calm guy. 
It seemed like this was a calm time for him. He seemed really happy and 
well-balanced.'

The International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee each had little to say about the case. 

'This is not the moment for the IOC to be commenting on this tragic incident. Our thoughts are with the families affected and we send them our deepest sympathies,' the IOC said in a statement.

The IPC said it was 'police matter' and that it would be inappropriate for them to comment.

The South African Olympic committee released a statement saying they had been 'inundated' with requests for comment but were not in a position to give out any details of the shooting.
