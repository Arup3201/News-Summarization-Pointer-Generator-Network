A coroner has slammed an award-winning hospital after a great-grandmother died after becoming dehydrated when she was ignored by staff for five hours.

Anne Sandever, 77, was admitted to Walnut Ward at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Cambridgeshire, at 10.30am but wasn’t seen by a doctor or nurse until the afternoon, an inquest at Huntingdon Coroner's Court heard.

The court also heard how hospital staff missed the fact that the mother-of-four was diabetic, despite it being in her charts.

Speaking at the inquest, her daughter branded the care she received 'appalling' while her husband said that 'it shouldn't have happened'.

Mrs Sandever, who was a part-time NHS receptionist at Eaton Socon Health Centre in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, was left severely dehydrated
 when she waited for five hours without the fluid she was taking from an
 IV drip.

She was then left for eight hours overnight without fluids 
after medics failed to notice the intravenous drip had become 
unattached, the inquest was told.

Mrs Sandever died from renal failure on February 6 - three days after being admitted to the hospital which was recently named 'Best in England' for quality of care by healthcare consultancy firm CHKS. She leaves behind 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Assistant coroner for South and West Cambridgeshire, Dr Sam Bass, said if it had been his mother he would be 'very disappointed' and Mrs Sandever had been 'done a disservice'.

Critcising medics during the inquest last week, Dr Bass said that he would write to Hinchingbrooke Hospital to raise his concerns in a bid to prevent future deaths.

He said: 'One of the issues I have is you can only spot a deteriorating patient if someone actually looks at them, and it does seem that no one had seen her from 10.30 in the morning.

Ignored: Mrs Sandever, who was diabetic, was not seen for five hours after arriving at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire

'I’m a doctor so I understand. I know it’s short staffed I know there’s issues[...]and all the cuts but she came in and she arrived on the ward and she wasn’t even seen or spoken to until sometime in the afternoon.

'What happened to actually talking to the patient? Finding out who they are, what they do. We’ve missed the fact she’s dehydrated, we’ve missed the fact she’s diabetic.

'I can’t see there’s an excuse for that, however many pieces of paper we fill in.

'I think we have missed something here and I’m afraid if it was my mum and if it was your mum I’m sure you would be very disappointed.'

Mrs Sandever was taken from her home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, to Hinchingbrooke Hospital on recommendation of her GP in February as she was suffering from a diarrhoea illness.

The inquest heard that her medical notes showed medical observations were taken at 10.20am and she arrived on Walnut Ward at 10.30am.

But medics who gave evidence to the inquest could not present the coroner with any records showing Mrs Sandever had been seen before 3.30pm that afternoon.

Mrs Sandever’s daughter, Chelle Ritchie, who works in care as a service manager for Royal Mencap Society, criticised nurses for not speaking to her mother.

Mrs Ritchie said: She spoke to me, my dad and my daughter on the phone but no medical staff came near her.

'I’ve worked in the care industry and I understand staff shortages. The whole point of the nursing profession is to communicate with people. I think it’s absolutely appalling.

'There was just no interaction from any nurse who came on that ward that day.'

Mrs Sandever’s husband, Brian, also hit out at the care his wife received at the hospital.

He said when he told nurses his wife’s drip was empty they dismissed him and said, 'no, she’s having no more treatment. There’s no more treatment for her'.

He added: 'She [the nurse] said no no but I’ll go and ask a doctor. I went back in to see my wife and within ten minutes world war three had broken out.

'There was doctors, nurses, everything was going off and that was the last time I spoke to her. That was it.

'I’m just hoping there’s something better for the next person. It shouldn’t have happened.'

Mr Sandever said that the care his wife received in the critical care ward, where she was moved to from Walnut Ward.

Dr Martin Goddard, a consultant pathologist at Papworth hospital, said Mrs Sandever’s care at Hinchingbrooke was 'sub optimal' but he believed it did not cause her death.

He added she was 'an obese lady' of 118kg with underlying health problems, including kidney trouble and a history of high blood pressure.

Dr Goddard recorded a primary cause of death as renal failure with a secondary cause of clogged arteries and diabetes.

Speaking after the inquest, Hisham Abdel-Rahman, Clinical Chairman and Chief Executive of Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust, apologised 'unreservedly'.

He said: 'We are deeply sorry that this happened, and apologise unreservedly to the family.

'The coroner’s verdict recorded natural causes of death and no evidence of neglect. However, it highlighted shortcomings, particularly in monitoring and communication.

'We fully accept this: our internal investigation arrived at the same conclusion, and we will make sure the lessons are applied across the hospital.

'Patient safety is our highest priority and we will do everything we can to improve the quality of care, in full cooperation with the ruling.'
