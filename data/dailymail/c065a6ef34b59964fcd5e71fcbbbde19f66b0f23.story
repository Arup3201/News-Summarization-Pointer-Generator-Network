A Texas man accused of going on a shopping spree with 'cloned' Australian credit cards in US stores has been arrested.

Authorities in Austin, Texas, launched an investigation after the Commonwealth Bank of Australia reported customers were victims of credit card fraud.

It is alleged Austin local Alexander Polanco Osorio, 22, used credit cards imprinted with cloned numbers and with his name on them to buy nine gift cards worth $2380 ($US2200) and clothes worth $780 ($US734) at US stores Banana Republic and Gap.

Alexander Polanco Osorio, from Austin Texas, was allegedly using credit cards imprinted with cloned numbers

The 22-year-old used the cards to buy thousands of dollars worth of gift cards and clothes

When Osorio made the purchases the store employees asked for his driver's licence, but he appeared legitimate because his name on the licence matched the name on his cloned card, Austin police said.

The purchases were allegedly captured on video surveillance cameras.

French bank Domaine Moyens de Paiement also had victims.

He targeted the American stores Banana Republic and Gap
