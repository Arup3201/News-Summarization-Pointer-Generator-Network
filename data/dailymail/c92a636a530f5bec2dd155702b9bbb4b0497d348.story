A stoppage-time goal from Devante Cole, son of former Manchester United striker Andy Cole, was not enough to prevent Barnsley from falling to a 5-3 defeat by MK Dons.

Cole struck after Conor Hourihane's brace for Barnsley, but it was too little, too late for the home side as MK Dons clinched all three points.

The on-loan Manchester City forward has scored three times in five games this season.

That was before the home team salvaged some pride with three goals in the last eight minutes to give the scoreline some respectability.

The victory for MK Dons left them third in League One, four points adrift of leaders Bristol City while Barnsley sit 13th.
