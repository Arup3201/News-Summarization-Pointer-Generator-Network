Fulham finally claimed their first Sky Bet Championship victory of the season with a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Birmingham.

Second-half goals from Tim Hoogland and Hugo Rodallega saw Kit Symons' men end their miserable start to life in the second tier, after David Cotterill had put the Blues in front before the interval.

The Cottagers climbed off the bottom of the table, with Blackpool - now the only winless team in the division - taking their place after throwing away a one-goal lead to lose 3-1 at home to Norwich, who now sit top.

New Leeds boss Darko Milanic suffered a defeat in his first game in charge, as Ramallo Jota and Alan McCormack were both on target in a 2-0 home win for Brentford.

Managerless Cardiff recorded their first win in six games by beating Sheffield Wednesday 2-1.

Sean Morrison scored his first City goal before cancelling it out himself by putting through his own net, but Anthony Pilkington reprieved him by netting the winner just after the hour mark.

Nottingham Forest and Charlton retained their unbeaten records but both were held to goalless draws at home by Brighton and Middlesbrough respectively.

Chris Powell enjoyed his first win as Huddersfield boss as Nahki Wells scored twice in the 2-1 win over Millwall.

Blackburn fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Watford.

Matej Vydra and Daniel Tozser put the Hornets 2-0 up at the break but Rudy Gestede and Ryan Tunnicliffe responded in the second half for the hosts to earn a point.

Wigan's abject away form continued as they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Bournemouth - their fourth defeat in five league games on the road this campaign.

Chris Martin bagged a brace as Derby recorded a second successive away win, beating Bolton 2-0, while two goals in the opening six minutes helped Ipswich beat Rotherham by the same scoreline as they recorded a fourth league win in a row.
