A respected firefighter has been jailed for raping a woman at her Tasmanian home but won't be place on the sex offenders register.

Rodney Charles Cuthbert met the woman - 15 years his junior - at a friend's 50th birthday party earlier on in the night where he forcibly kissed her, The Mercury reports.

The 51-year-old followed the woman home, entered her unlocked house without knocking then raped her in her living room on July 6.

A respected firefighter, 51, has been jailed for three and a half years after raping a woman at her home in Tasmania

Rodney Charles Cuthbert was sentenced at the Supreme Court of Tasmania on Friday

The court heard the woman left the party at about midnight and Cuthbert entered her home while she undressed in the living room.

Cuthbert ignored her protests and pushed her onto a matt­ress where he raped her.

After the incident, the father-of-two asked if he could call her.

The woman then left her house in tears, wearing a dressing gown, where a partygoer from her neighbour's birthday event saw her and called police.

Cuthbert claimed the sex had been consensual.

During the sentencing at the Supreme Court of Tasmania on Friday, Justice Helen Wood said Cuthbert had caused his victim great distress and emotional harm.

However his commendable resume – which included being awarded the National Medal – was a mitigating factor.

She added that his actions were completely out of character.

Cuthbert will serve three and a half years behind bars and will be eligible for parole in May 2016.
