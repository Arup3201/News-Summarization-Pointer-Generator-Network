For most young people, turning 30 is seen as something of a landmark in life.

But  Amy Caulton from Hatton, Derbyshire, has celebrated the milestone two years earlier, after giving birth to the child she thought she could never have and two healthy decades passing since her lifesaving kidney transplant.

The 28-year-old had the transplant when she was nine and is now the proud mother of five-month-old Seth.

Amy Caulton, 28, (right) from Hatton, Derbyshire, had a kidney transplant aged nine and for years she worried it would affect her ability to have a child. She and her partner Anthony (left) are now parents to a five-month-old boy called Seth (centre)

Amy said: 'When I was growing up, I always wondered if I would be able to have a baby.

'I had to change all my medication before my fiance, Ant, and I could start trying, but even then I didn't know if I would get pregnant.

'Then it happened and I was over the moon. I think Seth is our little miracle. He's everything we wanted and more.'

Even before Amy, who works at Sainsbury's, was born, doctors knew she might encounter renal problems in her life as it was clear on the hospital scans that her kidneys were small. 

Seth was born six weeks early 

When she was seven-years-old, her details were added to the NHS Organ Donor Register and it took two years for a suitable match to become available.

She said: 'My blood group is quite rare and that made it hard to find me a kidney.

'When I was little, I knew kids who were having their transplants just a few weeks after dialysis.

'For me, the wait was much, much longer. I don't think I was bothered at the time because I was young and obviously I didn't know the importance of the transplant.

'Now I'm a mum, I can't imagine how my own mum felt about it. She must have been so worried.'

Amy received her donation from a young boy, who lost his life after being involved in an accident and many of his organs, including his other kidney, lungs and liver, were given to others.

Amy said: 'He saved the lives of so many people, including mine.

'I will always feel indebted to the boy. He saved my life.'

But Amy's problems didn't end after the transplant - during the six months after the operation, she developed infections and had to go back into hospital.

She said: 'I think my mum and dad regretted the transplant for a while because I had not been so well on my dialysis but after about six months, things settled down and it was fantastic for me to say goodbye to the regular renal treatment.'

But although the procedure was successful, Amy was always left wondering if her condition would affect her ability to have children.  

She said: 'When I talked to my consultant at Derby about wanting a baby, he was very supportive.

'He said he would have to change some of the drugs I took and that I would have to wait three months for the other medication to leave my system before I could try and get pregnant.

'Anthony and I were really happy. Obviously, we had to be patient because getting the medication right was important but we were in no rush.

Three months later, after Amy and Anthony had been given the green light to try for a baby, they received some wonderful news.

Amy was pregnant and she says Anthony, a 33-year-old aircraft designer, was in complete shock at the news.

At the 20-week scan, special attention was paid to Seth's kidneys to make sure that he was alright 

She said: 'It was hilarious really.

'Ant and I had talked about just how long it might take me to get pregnant and I'd told him it could be a while.

'Obviously, because of my kidney transplant and all the medication I took, I thought it could take us at least a year. Luckily, that wasn't the case.

'I got pregnant straight away and I was so thrilled. It was everything we wanted.'

Almost as soon as Amy revealed a positive pregnancy test, she was back seeing the renal team at the Royal Derby Hospital.

Checks were immediately carried out on her kidney function and doctors were pleased with the results.

Amy and Anthony fell pregnant almost immediately 

After he was born at the Royal Derby Hospital, Seth was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit 

She said: 'I was looked after so very well. It was wonderful to have so many scans and to see the baby growing normally.

'At the 20-week scan, special attention was paid to Seth's kidneys. I guess everyone wanted to be sure that he was alright.'

Baby Seth was born six weeks early at the Royal Derby Hospital. He weighed a tiny 4lb 8oz and was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit.

She said: 'Having a kidney transplant could have stopped me from enjoying life but that has not been the case.

'I've done some wonderful things and my health issues have never got in the way.

'When I wanted Seth, the team at Derby were only too happy to support and help me.

'I don't know what the future holds, no-one does, but I'm so proud of what I have achieved and my son will know all about what I've been through when he's older.'
