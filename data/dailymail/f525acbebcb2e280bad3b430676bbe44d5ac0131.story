A rare 1928 Mercedes which spend 60 years gathering dust in a garage has fetched almost £3 million at auction.

The S-Type Mercedes-Benz - the supercar of its generation that easily 
reached over 100mph - still runs perfectly despite being stuck in a 
'time warp', and not driven since 1952.

One of the world's fastest vehicles when it rolled off the production 
line in 1928, the Mercedes sparked a bidding war at the Bonhams' Goodwood 
Revival sale.

Super discovery: The rare 1928 Mercedes was found rusting and covered in cobwebs

Rare find: The unrestored 1928 Mercedes S Type was unearthed after 60 years sitting in a garage

The car has been owned by the same family since the 1920s and went to a 
mystery buyer for a staggering £2,801,500 - nearly double the £1.5 
million it had been tipped by Bonhams pre-sale.

Auctioneer James Knight, group director of Bonhams' motoring department,
beamed with delight as he finally brought down the gavel at the Sussex 
sale.

The 680 S-Type was one of the earliest mass produced luxury sports cars 
and boasted an engine designed by chief engineer Professor Ferdinand 
Porsche.

Experts hailed the dark battleship grey convertible, which had been 
languishing in a lock up without seeing the light of day for 60 years, 
as ‘an incredible find’.

The 6.8-litre fast tourer was first registered on the roads in May 1928 and unrestored cars of its type are extremely rare.

The original owner, a retired British Army officer and World War One 
veteran raced the car on the Brooklands motor-racing circuit in Surrey.

He  went on to use the car very little before his death in 1940 when it 
was passed on to his son who set a new record time in the Merc for the 
highly unofficial open-road inter-varsity blast from Oxford to Cambridge
during his time as an Oxford University student in the late 40s.

The car was then put in a lockup and it still has just 8,375 miles on the clock.

The original owner's grandson secretly removed the car from its lock-up 
and re-started it as a surprise for his father's 75th birthday.

Mona-Lisa of cars: Experts have hailed the discovery one of the most considerable automotive finds with unrestored cars of this type extremely rare

According to Bonhams, it ‘proved to run incredibly well, ticking over with jaw-dropping silence and driving very nicely.’

Bonhams said it was ‘almost without precedent’ for a family to own such a
car for 84 years, calling it ‘an achingly-rare Mona Lisa of the 
automotive world’.

It went on: ‘It is one of the most jaw-droppingly unspoiled, time 
machine-quality, vintage cars that we have ever had the privilege to 
bring to market."

A spokesman said: ‘Motor cars of this type and age have rarely been in the same family ownership from new.’

Detail: The unidentified owners grandfather - a pioneering British motorist - was one of the earliest buyers of the Mercedes 'S' Type, which sparked mass production due to its popularity

Car expert Rupert Banner said: ‘It has literally been off the radar. No 
one knew such an untouched and archaic vehicle this old existed.

‘It is an incredible find at a time when motor cars in original 
condition and with impeccable provenance are appreciated more than ever.

This one-owner car offers an unrepeatable opportunity for collectors.’

According to the cars unworn handbook, it was bought from The British Mercedes Ltd in London under the order number 38130.

Its bodywork was hand crafted by London-based coachbuilders Cadogan Motors and its original blue upholstery is still intact.

The 'S' Type re-established Mercedes' reputation for building fast, 
luxurious and high quality motorcars and its popularity sparked mass 
production.
