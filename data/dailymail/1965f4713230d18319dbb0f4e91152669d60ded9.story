It's widely accepted that not knowing your biological parents can be psychologically damaging.

There have been documented cases of how not knowing who your biological parents can damage your sense of identity and heritage.

Damian Adams, from Adelaide, Australia, was conceived using an anonymous sperm donation in the 1970s. Now Mr Adams is hoping to remove some of those psychologically harmful feelings he has felt since discovering he was conceived by a sperm donation.

But rather than tracking down his biological father, something which he is legally forbidden from doing, Mr Adams hopes to address a less acknowledged hurdle.

Mr Adams believes his birth certificate is inaccurate and that it is having a dehumanising effect on his life

‘The current legal practice for donor conceived children is for the receiving couple, or commissioning couple, to be listed as parents on the birth certificate,’ Mr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘This means my birth certificate is technically inaccurate. It creates a sense of deception in my life.’

If he is successful, Mr Adams will be the first Australian to have his birth certificate amended so his his father is listed an 'unknown'.

'I'm doing this because I want a factual record of my birth. I'm a firm believer in truth, it's how I was raised. I'm sure my (adopted) father would support me in this decision. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how much I loved my  father, or how much he loved me.'

Mr Adams explained that donor-conceived children suffer from a lack of identity.

'We are are already denied access to their heritage and associated kinship. We are denied our medical history. Many animals have have a more accurate birth record than I do and I find that completely dehumanising.' 

Mr Adams said that his profession was instrumental in the pursuit. 'I work as a medical researcher. It means I am exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, which played a role in my decision to pursue this.'

Mr Adams says he has received support from groups like donor conception Australia, as well as  the full support of my friends and family

Mr Adams filed his his application with the Magistrates Court in Adelaide two weeks ago, but he says that this is something he had resolved to do several years ago. 'I have wanted to do this for a long time, but my family and professional life ended up prolonging the process.'

If Mr Adams is successful, he only be second person in the world to have corrected their birth certificate in this way. In July this year, 26-year-old donor-conceived British woman Emma Cresswell became the first person to have achieved the feat, albeit after a six year legal battle. Mr Adams said he wasn't initially influenced by Mrs Creswells plight, but that it was vastly assuring.

'I had decided to do this before I heard about her, but it was very assuring to know that someone had achieved this. Somebody had to take the plunge. It was also opportune timing. If I do get to take this to a Magistrates courtroom, I will certainly be able to use her case to my advantage. The legal system in UK is largely similar to that in Australia.'

Mr Adams believes there is no certainty in the outcome of his case to amend his birth certificate, however he believes the case of Emma Crosswell, the only person to have successfully achieved the same pursuit, will assist in his case

However in another sense it proved how difficult the process will be. 'The fact that it took six years, and that it has only ever happened once before-it means I have no certainty of a successful outcome.'

Mr Adams says he has received a torrent of support for his cause. 'I've been approached by individuals, as well as support groups like donor conception Australia. There are people in a likewise position who hope to pursue the same path now. I also have the unbridled support of my friends and family, which I'm very grateful for.'
