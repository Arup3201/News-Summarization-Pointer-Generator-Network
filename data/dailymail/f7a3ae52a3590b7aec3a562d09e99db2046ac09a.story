A former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan was being investigated by U.S. authorities for suspected money laundering through his wife's bank account.

The suspicions center on Zalmay Khalilzad's alleged transfer of  $1.5 million in May 2013 to an account in Vienna owned by Cheryl Benard.

State prosecutor Thomas Vecsey on Monday confirmed a report by the Austrian magazine Profil but declined to give details. 

Former US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad (pictured in 2007) allegedly transferred $1.5million to a bank account in Vienna in his wife's name 

The money allegedly came from oil and building deals in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates which violated U.S. law, according to Bloomberg.

Documents on the case were found in a garbage container used by the state prosecutor's office in Vienna, the magazine reported.

Benard's account has been frozen by Austrian authorities. 

Khalilzad was ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the U.N. under President George W. Bush. He briefly served as counselor to former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.

Benard's lawyer, Holger Bielesz, said that U.S. authorities have yet to express 'reasonable grounds for suspicions'.

The former diplomat is president of Khalilzad Associates, an international business consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. Under its parent company Gryphon Investors, Khalilzad's firm is focused on business in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Gryphon Investors were unavailable for comment on Monday. 

In 2003, Khalilzad was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. He was in the role until 2005 where he oversaw the country's first elections and was a close adviser to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. 

He served as U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2005-2007 before becoming the country's UN ambassador. 

Cheryl Benard is president of a DC non-profit research group which supports cultural activism in former war zones. 

Mr Khalilzad, 63, and his wife have two sons, Alexander and Maximilian.
