Air travellers today lampooned Ryanair's plans to offer £10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand, pay to use the toilet or even parachute into America  because it is so cheap.

The budget airline has announced it  plans to fly to New York, Boston, Chicago and Miami from London Stansted, Dublin and Berlin from 2020. 

The £10-a-ticket proposal is part of a wider plan to change its image and 'stop  p****** people off' because  boss Michael O'Leary's schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers left many irate.

Breaking new ground: Ryanair's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline offering flights from as little as £10 but there has also been considerable fun at their expense

But despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion, others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline's expense.

Some said that Ryanair's New York hub could be in Nova Scotia, Canada, or passengers may have to 'sky dive in and hope you don't land in the Hudson river' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs.

Others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets, and if the £10 deal would include any food, leg room, entertainment or any luggage. 

Jason Bournemouth tweeted: 'It's Ryanair so New York means, at best, landing in New Jersey. Probably Iowa'.

Mail columnist Andrew Pierce wrote: 'Ryanair to launch £10 flight to US. Plus £200 for luggage, £200 for seat, £1 to use loo'.

Sandie Blicken replied: 'They don't actually land anywhere you just do a sky dive and hope you don't land in the Hudson'. 

The budget airline’s directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at Europe’s largest low-cost carrier over the next five years.

The airline has set out proposals for one-way tickets costing from under £10, although some fares would be much higher.

Ryanair says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen European and US cities on a transatlantic service that could start ‘in four to five years’.

Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline offering cheap ‘ten buck’ transatlantic fares – with $10 currently equivalent to £6.75.

But the announcement that his board has now approved initial plans suggests the company is now more serious about going ahead with the ambitious strategy. O’Leary is particularly keen to win a slice of the lucrative long-haul transatlantic trade which is one of the most profitable routes in the world.

The company said yesterday: 'European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development'.

Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth

But it is dominated by long-established European and US airlines including British Airways, American Airlines and, on a smaller level, Virgin Atlantic, which is in partnership with America’s Delta. 

Pay-per-pee

In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight.

'We’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny.' When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'Vertical seats

A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts.

His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent. 

Who needs co-pilots?

Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'.

He said aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight.

Ryanair’s plan has echoes of 1970s cut-price pioneer Sir Freddie Laker whose cheap Skytrain flights to the USA transformed transatlantic travel for the masses, until it was effectively killed off by the established airlines, though it inspired Sir Richard Branson to launch Virgin Atlantic.

Norwegian Air started its transatlantic service in 2013 two years ago with a one-way ticket from the UK to New York starting at £149.

Ryanair has said it would fulfil its long-expressed promise of offering some bargain-basement transatlantic fares at £10, but other one-way tickets would be priced from £99 or more.

In November Ryanair's profits soared by 32 per cent and its loud-mouth boss Michael O'Leary admitted: 'Being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy'.

These have included demanding up to £5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board. 

But last year, after two profits warnings, Mr O'Leary's promised that the company would 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'.  

O'Leary agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5, relax the airline's draconian baggage allowance rules and a 'sophisticated' business service.

He admitted that  to turn them around he would end the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture.

In 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. 

Her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘f*** up’.

Budget: Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline

Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years.

But in the past 18 month, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways.

In Autumn 2013 a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers.

He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets.

Many customers told Mr O'Leary what an 'a***hole' they thought he was - with user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'.

The Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still love me.'
