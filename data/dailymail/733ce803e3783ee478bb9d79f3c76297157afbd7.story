Gina Marie Rayner allegedly had sex in a public hot tub while her young child wandered around calling for his 'mommy'

A drunken mother had a threesome with her boyfriend and another woman in an apartment block's public hot tub while her young child wandered around crying for his 'mommy', it has been claimed.

Gina Marie Rayner, 28, her boyfriend Anthony Michael Vechiola, 30 and Jennifer Duchnowski, 29, reportedly refused to stop having sex when officers confronted them in Peoria, Arizona.

After the trio were finally separated an officer reported hearing a child crying for his mother, according to a police statement.

The five-year-old boy later was identified as Rayner's and her three-year-old child was found sleeping in Vechiola's apartment.

A concerned resident had called the police on Sunday night claiming he had seen a small child wandering around the apartment complex calling for his 'mommy', the statement said.

Minutes later the same resident called again to report a fight near the pool saying they believed the child’s mother was involved.

A witness claimed to have seen Rayner and Vechioloa having sex in front of the children, while one person allegedly recorded the incident on a cell phone, according to the statement.

The trio were accused of public sexual indecency with Rayner also being held on suspicion of child abuse on the grounds she allegedly left her children alone in an apartment.

Rayner denied that the children were present when she was having sex.

Vechiola
reportedly said he had taken the children to his apartment and had told them to go
 to sleep before leaving them alone and returning to the pool area.
