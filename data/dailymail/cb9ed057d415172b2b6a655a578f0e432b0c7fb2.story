Victim: Patricia Goodband, 76, was found dumped in a 12ft deep manhole in her Buckinghamshire garden

A wealthy pensioner was allegedly murdered by the man who stood to inherit her fortune and her body dumped in the garden of her home, a court has heard.

Patricia Goodband, 76, was set to leave her two properties and £230,000 to her friend of more than three decades Christopher Symons.

Symons is alleged to have beaten her around the head before dumping her body at the bottom of a 12ft deep brick-lined manhole in the back garden of her home in Woodham, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, in December last year.

Her body had been covered with soil, stones and bags of rubbish, Reading Crown Court was told.

Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Mrs Goodband was last seen alive on December 22 last year.

She said that the body was found after a 'painstaking investigation' of the area surrounding her home on January 21 this year.

Ms Glynn told the court that her body had been 'well concealed' in the deep shaft, which was hidden beneath a manhole cover.

Only those familiar with the grounds of the property would know of its existence, the prosecutor claimed.

She said: 'She had been murdered and brought there by her killer, having received extremely serious head injuries.

'Specifically, she was beaten around the head at least six times, twice around the face and four times around the back of the head.

'She had been thrown down the shaft in the most callous way you could imagine.'

The jury was told Symons and Ms Goodband had been friends for 30 years before he was alleged to have killed her and together they ran a haulage and aggregate business from her home.

Symons and his wife had once owned the house where Mrs Goodband lived and in 1994 she put the land surrounding the property into his joint ownership.

Ms Glynn said: 'This was not a normal friendship, this was not a normal business relationship.

'Its clear Patricia Goodband during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him.'

The jury was told that in 2008 she created a will in which she left two properties and all her money to Symons.

Akeman House, where she lived, was worth between £550,000 pounds and £600,000 pounds at the time of her death.

A second property in Edgecote, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was estimated to be worth between £170,000 and £200,000 pounds.

Symons would also have received the £230,000 in her bank account as part of the inheritance.

Ms Glynn said that Symons had always denied that he was anything more than friends with Mrs Goodband but she said it was not important to the prosecution case.

'She had been thrown down the shaft in the most callous way you could imagine.'

Despite their close relationship, the court heard that things changed on Christmas Day, 2007, when Symons attacked Mrs Goodband.

After allegedly beating her around the head it was him who called police. Officers waited for her to return from dog-walking and she told them nothing had happened.

Mrs Goodband wrote in a diary entry written around the time of the incident: 'Chris snapped today. Bad night. Not a day to remember.'

'(He) went wild. I got thumped aside my jaw - ear - deaf - aches. Bashed about head. Must think about future, what went wrong.'

She added: 'Perhaps once again I have (unclear) my usefulness. The second bash. I will not wait for a third.'

The day after the alleged incident, she wrote: 'Then had the gall to tell me to get out. Disgraceful conduct,' and she noted bruises emerging over the next days, while expressing her loneliness.

However, on December 30 that year a diary entry stated she had spoken to Symons.

She said: 'What a weight off my mind. I’m sorry, I would not have chosen this but I must adjust.'

Prosecuter Ms Glynn said: 'It’s not clear what arrangement they had come to but what is clear was this was not a normal relationship.'

Mrs Goodband was described as a recluse by her neighbours who disliked traveling.

She worked for 10 years for a couple of retired medical professionals cleaning their home and had a reputation for being intelligent and fit and healthy.

'Its clear Patricia Goodband during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him.'

Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting

But Symons cast doubt on this after she had disappeared, by implying to her friends that she had displayed the early signs of dementia, Ms Glynn told the court.

She said this was part of his effort to lay a false trail to confuse those searching for her, to make them think she had gone to Yorkshire where her daughter Samantha lived at the time.

Ms Glynn said: 'It was well known by friends and neighbours that she had fallen out with Samantha some years before, so what he devised was a trail of evidence that she had gone to stay on December 22 with somebody called Sue, who apparently lived in Stockton, and was going to take her to see Samantha.

'This was quite untrue. Patricia Goodband had no intention of going to Yorkshire.'

Symons was also accused of using text messages to try to throw investigators off the scent.

Two messages were sent by a phone in Mrs Goodband’s possession but registered to him, on December 18 and 22.

The first, sent to Symons’ phone, confirmed she had bought the train tickets for her journey to Yorkshire. Detectives discovered no tickets were ever bought.

The second read: 'Please thank Bob for taking me to Milton Keynes railway station. I have arrived in Stockton safely.'

Ms Glynn said mobile phone cell site analysis said in both cases the messages had been sent and received by phone masts covering Akeman House.

She said it was consistent with the phones being next to each other on the same table and Symons sending them to himself to cover his tracks.

She said of the second call: 'The handset was nowhere near the north of England. The one thing we can be sure of is Patricia Goodband was not in Stockton. She was almost certainly dead by that point.'

The prosecution believes that Mrs Goodband died on December 22 because she and Symons visited mutual friends - Mr and Mrs Pointer - who described her as wearing the same clothes that her body was found in.

Symons, 63, who appeared over video link after the jury was told he had been unwell, denies a single charge of murder.

Co-defendant Kathleen Adams, 74, denies one count of perverting the course of justice and Jennifer Creasey, 73, denies two counts of perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
