Labour was in turmoil last night as senior MPs rounded on Ed Miliband for failing to anticipate the dangers of a Ukip surge.

As town hall election results left Labour MPs depressed about their chances of regaining power, Mr Miliband was accused of running a ‘tremendously ill-judged campaign’ marred by gaffes.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the results were ‘not good enough’.

In what was widely seen a dry run for the general election campaign next year, Labour’s vote share was 31 per cent, just two points ahead of the Tories and seven points lower than it managed a year before Neil Kinnock lost the 1992 election.

Pressure on Mr Miliband and the ‘metropolitan elite’ at the top of his party will increase if, as strategists fear, it is beaten by Ukip in European Parliament elections, results of which are due tomorrow.

Although Labour made progress in London, it lost huge chunks of its vote to Ukip in northern strongholds such as Rotherham, Sunderland and Grimsby, and failed to win key Middle England swing councils in Tamworth, Thurrock and Swindon.

Its gains of nearly 300 fell well short of the 500 that experts said it needed to show it was on course for general election victory.

In an ominous sign for Mr Miliband – who insisted he ran a ‘good’ campaign – senior members of the shadow Cabinet, including Mr Balls, Harriet Harman and Yvette Cooper, were said to have complained they felt ‘shut out’ of Labour’s campaign. One insider told the Labour-supporting New Statesman that the strategy to concentrate on Mr Miliband had failed disastrously. ‘It was all Ed, Ed, Ed,’ the source added.

Mr Balls called for the party to strengthen its position on issues including immigration and Europe, a key driver of Ukip support.

‘Whether on Europe or immigration or on the economy, Labour has got more to do to show we can deliver the real fair change people want to see,’ he said.

John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, insisted poor results were the ‘fault of Ed Miliband and all the people at the top of the Labour Party’, who had complacently believed a Ukip advance would hit only the Tories. Arguing that Labour’s ‘metropolitan elite excluded ordinary people’, he added scornfully: ‘Some of the pointy-heads at the top of the party thought that Ukip doing well is what we needed.’

On a day that saw all three main parties hit by the Ukip advance:

Yesterday’s results suggested that as things stand, both Labour and the Conservatives will struggle to assemble a Commons majority next year.

Ironically, experts said Ukip’s advance could help ensure the Lib Dems remain in government in another coalition.

Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said: ‘Labour’s lead over Conservatives of two points is narrower than last year, and it is narrower than 2012. This is a clear warning to Labour.’

Ed Miliband admitted there was 'a deep sense of discontent' among voters

Ukip last night hailed a ‘tremendous result’ after winning ten council seats in the Labour stronghold of Rotherham.

The dramatic result – which saw Ukip  become the biggest opposition group – is a huge blow to Labour in its South Yorkshire heartland, where Ed Miliband is MP for Doncaster North.

It will be seized on by the party as evidence that they are as much of a threat to Labour in the North as they are to the Conservatives in South.

Ukip councillor and Rotherham branch chairman Cavan Vines said: ‘This will send shockwaves. If you can break Rotherham, the rest will follow.’

Labour MPs
 expressed despair at a series of media gaffes by Mr Miliband during the
 campaign – including failing to know the price of groceries, forgetting
 who was in control of a key council during a visit to the area and an 
unfortunate photocall at which he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich.

Mr Mann added: ‘Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron.

'Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world. That was a fundamental error.’

John Healey, Labour’s respected former housing minister, warned Mr Miliband: ‘We need to be clearer, bolder and stronger about the plans we have.’

Labour grandee Tessa Jowell said the basic presentational errors of the campaign were unforgivable. ‘If you are a politician . . . don’t eat a bacon butty when the world’s cameras are on you.’

Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said Mr Miliband ‘is behind in the personality stakes’ and the party was struggling on economic policy.

He added that it was ‘unforgiveably unprofessional’ for the Labour leader not to know the value of his family’s weekly shopping bill when he was running a ‘cost of living’ campaign.

Mr Miliband admitted there was ‘a deep sense of discontent’ among voters. ‘You also saw some people turning to Ukip and I am determined that over the next year we will persuade them that we can change their lives for the better.
