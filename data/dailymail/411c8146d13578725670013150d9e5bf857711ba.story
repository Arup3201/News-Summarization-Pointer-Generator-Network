A mother who pleaded guilty to fraudulently enrolling her six-year-old son in the wrong school district has been sentenced to five years in prison.

Tonya McDowell sent her son to an elementary school in Norwalk, Connecticut, instead of her home city of Bridgeport.

The 34-year-old, who was homeless when she was charged with felony larceny last year, said she wanted the best education possible for the boy.

Jailed: Tracy McDowell pleaded guilty to fraudulently enrolling her six-year-old son in the wrong school district and has been sentenced to five years in prison

McDowell last week entered her plea at
 Norwalk Superior Court under the Alford Doctrine, which means she does 
not admit guilt but concedes the state has enough evidence to convict 
her.

Authorities told the hearing that she 
used a babysitter's address to enroll her son in kindergarten in Norwalk
 when he should have attended schools in Bridgeport, her last permanent 
address.

Her case drew national attention and support from civil rights leaders and other advocates who wanted the charge dismissed.

McDowell told police she was living in
 a van and occasionally slept at a Norwalk shelter or a friend's 
Bridgeport apartment when she enrolled her son Norwalk's Brookside 
Elementary School.

Police said McDowell stole $15,686 worth of 'free' educational services from Norwalk.

She also pleaded guilty to four counts of sale of narcotics, which will be included in her prison sentence.

In a separate case, she pleaded guilty on February 7 to selling drugs.

McDowell's lawyer, Darnell Crosland, said she agreed to 
accept a plea bargain rather than continue fighting the charges even 
though she insists she is not guilty.

Mr Crosland said: 'You shouldn't be arrested for stealing a free education. It's just wrong.'

McDowell was sentenced to 12 years in jail, suspended after she serves five years, and five years probation.
