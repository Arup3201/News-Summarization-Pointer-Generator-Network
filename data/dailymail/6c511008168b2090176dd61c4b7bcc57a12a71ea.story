'Just a small island no-one pays any attention to'... Russia's President Vladimir Putin, left, welcomes PM David Cameron at the start of the G20 summit today in St Petersburg

Russia dismissed Britain as ‘just a small island no one pays any attention to’ last night as a summit of world leaders descended into acrimony over planned military strikes on Syria.

In an astonishing attack, Vladimir Putin mocked the UK’s size and influence, and boasted that Soviet oligarchs had ‘bought Chelsea’.

However as controversy erupted, Russian officials flatly denied the remarks – attributed to President Putin’s official spokesman Dmitry Peskov – had ever been made.

But the episode at the G20 summit hosted by Russia underlined the Cold War style tensions that have been created by the row over Syria.

The seating plan at the talks has had to be changed so that Barack Obama and President Putin are kept as far apart as possible.

Last night, arriving at the summit venue in St Petersburg, President Obama strode in alone rather than walking in with President Putin.

The war of words with Britain came as David Cameron continued to make the case for intervention in Syria despite his defeat in Parliament last week.

They represented an extraordinary breach of protocol, particularly as Russia is hosting the G20 meeting.

President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, has been revelling in MPs rejection last week of British participation in US-led military action.

But the Kremlin’s decision to rub Mr Cameron’s nose in it – with the Prime Minister on Russian soil – will plunge Anglo-Russian relations to a new low.

Told of the Russian verdict on Britain, an infuriated Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I don’t accept that for a moment.’

A Downing Street source said: ‘As host of guests from the world’s leading countries, I’m sure the Russians will want to clarify these reported remarks, particularly at a G20 where it’s a very British agenda on trade and tax.

‘It highlights how a small island with great people can achieve a big footprint in the world.’

Chancellor George Osborne insisted Britain is 'setting the agenda' at the summit, on the humanitarian response to what’s happening in Syria, the economic agenda and the tax agenda.

A British diplomat pointed out that the UK economy was significantly larger than Russia’s.

There
 was no sign at the summit that the latest evidence produced by the US 
and the UK to back calls for action against Syria was winning over 
doubters, with everyone from Iran’s supreme leader to the Pope opposing 
intervention.

President 
Putin accused the US of ‘lying’ to justify missile strikes and attacked 
Secretary of State John Kerry for denying that Al Qaeda was fighting 
with the Syrian opposition.

Mr Cameron attempted to win over opponents of military strikes on Damascus by unveiling new new evidence of the regime's use of chemical weapons.

He also launched a provocative attack on those who had blocked British involvement in the planned operation.

President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, is well aware of the rejection of British participation in US-led military action as voted against by MPs last week

All smiles: But the Kremlin's decision to rub Mr Cameron's nose in it, with the Prime Minister on Russian soil, will plunge Anglo-Russian relations to a new low

Arriving in St Petersburg, the Prime 
Minister announced that scientists at Britain's Porton Down had 
identified deadly sarin gas on victims' clothing and in soil samples 
from Damascus.

It also emerged that a report 
prepared by US spy chiefs concluded that Syria possesses a 'longstanding
 biological weapons program', on top of chemical weapons, and may have 
access to anthrax, camelpox and cowpox.

Taking 'full and personal 
responsibility' for the Government's shock defeat over British 
participation in military action last week, Mr Cameron insisted he had 
taken a 'principled stand against the gassing of children'.

Labour MPs - and those Tories and 
Liberal Democrats who joined with them to oppose military action - would
 have to 'live with the way that they voted', the Prime Minister said.

Mr Cameron said he had agreed to all 
the caveats Labour had asked for but 'even in spite of that, in my view,
 they chose the easy and political path not the right and the difficult 
path'.

However, there was no sign that the 
latest evidence produced by the US and the UK was winning over doubters -
 with everyone from Iran's supreme leader to the Pope opposing the idea 
of intervention.

Iran’s
 supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed the US was using a 
chemical attack in Syria’s civil war as a pretext to interfere in his 
country.

The head of Iran's elite Quds force, 
Qassem Soleimani, went further, declaring that the Islamic Republic 
would 'support Syria to the end'.

Pope Francis also opposed action as 
world leaders gathered in Russia, urging them to 'lay aside the futile 
pursuit of a military solution'.

Asked in TV 
interviews whether he was ‘sidelined’ at the summit as a result of the 
Commons vote, Mr Cameron said repeatedly: ‘I don’t accept that for a 
moment.

Mr Cameron said he had not seen ‘any evidence’ that Russia was prepared to shift position and endorse action through the UN.

‘Let’s
 be clear: almost 100 years ago the world came together, Russia 
included, to say after the First World War, the use of chemical weapons 
wasn’t acceptable,’ he said.

'All the testing that's been done, including the testing we are doing at our Porton Down laboratories, all adds to the picture.

'But I don't think anyone is 
seriously denying that a chemical weapons attack took place. I think the
 Russians accept that. Even the Iranians accept that.

'The question is obviously convincing more people that the regime was responsible.'

Unable to take
 part in military operations, Britain is instead offering an extra 
£52million in aid for the millions of Syrians who have fled President 
Assad’s forces, taking its total commitment to £400million.

The Prime Minister said he had not seen 'any evidence', however, that Russia was prepared to shift and endorse action through the United Nations.

But he added: 'I don't resile from the arguments I made last week - when America and many others in the world draw a red line over chemical weapons use, if nothing follows from that, that would be very bad for our world.'

Mr Cameron said President Obama had been 'very understanding' over his defeat in Parliament.

'Like me he is a democrat who 
believes you have to listen to people, you have to listen to Parliament 
and you have to respect the outcome of a vote.

'Britain isn't going to be involved 
in this specific military action, but the special relationship between 
Britain and America is as strong today as it was a week ago,' the Prime 
Minister said.

Mr Cameron is also urging President 
Putin to use his influence with the Syrian regime to strike an agreement
 that neither side in the civil war should fire on humanitarian convoys.

'Every 15 seconds there is another 
Syrian refugee. While we are sitting here in the comfort of St 
Petersburg, thousands of people will be made homeless.

'They need tents, they need shelter, 
they need food, they need protection from chemical weapons attacks,' the
 Prime Minister said.

The Pope has condemned global leaders for refusing to find a diplomatic solution while a ‘senseless massacre’ unfolds in Syria.

In a letter to Vladimir Putin as the Russian leader prepared to preside over the G20 summit, Francis wrote: ‘It is regrettable that, from the beginning of the conflict in Syria, one-sided interests have prevailed and in fact hindered the search for a solution that would have avoided the senseless massacre now unfolding.

‘The leaders of the G20 cannot remain indifferent to the dramatic situation of the beloved Syrian people which has lasted far too long and risks bringing even greater suffering to a region bitterly tested by strife and in need of peace.

To the leaders present, to each and every one, I make a heartfelt appeal for them to find ways to overcome the conflicting positions and to lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution.’

Yesterday foreign ambassadors were summoned to the Vatican to receive a briefing on the Pope’s position.

But the diplomatic efforts by Francis stopped short of Pope John Paul II’s futile attempts to prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Vatican denied claims that Francis had spoken to President Assad by telephone asking him to reduce attacks on rebels.

Meanwhile Assad’s wife Asma has used social media to try to pretend that all is well in the country. On the Syrian presidency’s Instagram account, the first lady is pictured smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers.

Critics say it shows British-born Mrs Assad has become a Marie Antoinette figure, out of touch with what is really going on.

Some Instagram users accused her of ‘hypocrisy’ at being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year war.
