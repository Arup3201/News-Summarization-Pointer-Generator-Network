Given their marriage only lasted 72 days before she filed for divorce speculation that Kim Kardashian had married for money and publicity were rife.

But according to a U.S. magazine the breakdown of the relationship was in fact down to Kris Humphries and his mean behaviour.

It has been claimed that the basketball star not only neglected his new wife, but he made a series of derogatory comments towards and is accused of referring to Kim’s famous sizable derriere as a‘fat ass’

Us Weekly also reports that the 26-year-old was brutal with his comments towards his new wife and insulted her constantly.

A source told the magazine: ‘He belittled her in front of people. He'd call her stupid. It was truly sickening.

‘He tried to control Kim by bringing her down...He would say truly terrible things. One time, he said she had no talent and her fame wouldn't last.’

A source close to Humphries told MailOnline: 'The Us Weekly story is completely taken out of context and a manipulation of the media. The show is completely staged; there is nothing real about this reality show.'

'Kris teased Kim a lot, but it was never malicious, and he never resented her. He loved her and still does. Too bad they have to tear someone down to propel their own careers.'

It has also been alleged that Kris is
 planning to sue Kim for $10million over his role in the upcoming Kim 
and Kourtney take New York series.

According
 to Life&Style magazine: ‘He’s claiming his role on Kourtney & 
Kim Take New York is bigger than he was told, and that’s why he wants 
more money. But Kris is also suing because he’s really worried about how
 badly he’s going to be portrayed on the series.’
