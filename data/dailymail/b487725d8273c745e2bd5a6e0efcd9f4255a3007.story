The world's first algae-powered building is being piloted in Hamburg.

The building, which was designed by multinational firm Arup, features panel glass bioreactors on the facade which contain microalgae.

These algae generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source.

The building features panel glass bioreactors on the facade.

Each of the 129 bioreactors measures 2.5m by 0.7m.

They contain algae that generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source.

They also insulate the building and keep out noise.

The panels are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water.

At the same time, the systems provides insulation for the building and keeps out noise.

Currently, 129 bioreactors - each measuring 2.5m by 0.7m - have been fitted to the southwest and southeast faces of the building.

They are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water.

Jan Wurm, Arup’s Europe Research Leader, said: 'Using bio-chemical processes in the facade of a building to create shade and energy is a really innovative concept.

'It might well become a sustainable solution for energy production in urban areas, so it is great to see it being tested in a real-life scenario.'

The news comes after Arup announced their vision for the future of skyscrapers which suggested that buildings would be 'living' buildings powered by algae that respond automatically to the weather and the changing needs of inhabitants.

Research by engineering multinational Arup, the firm behind the Pompidou Centre, the Sydney Opera House and many of the stadia for the 2008 Olympics, imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050.

Their predictions included ideas as outlandish as jet-powered maintenance robots, high-rise farms and photovoltaic paint - all of which, incredibly, are already in development.

'In 2050, the urban dweller and the 
city are in a state of constant flux - changing and evolving in reaction
 to emerging contexts and conditions,' the report said.

'The
 urban building of the future fosters this innate quality, essentially 
functioning as a living organism in its own right - reacting to the 
local environment and engaging with the users within.'

claims that by 2050 buildings will have modular designs maintained by

efficient thanks to algae fuel cells

The study by Arup’s internal think tank predicted that structures would be fully integrated into the fabric of the city, responsive to changes in the external environment, and designed for continuous adaptability.

Responding to estimates that in four decades 75 per cent of an estimated global population of nine billion will be living in cities, it foresaw a shift to increasingly dense urban environments.

At the same time, it predicted, the rise of networked 'smart' devices could lead cities 'where everything can be manipulated in realtime and where all the components of the urban fabric are part of a single smart system and an internet of things'.

The British company that built the Shard has landed a contract to build what will become the world's tallest building - and plans reveal the two look remarkably similar.

London-based Mace won the £780million deal to build the Kingdom Tower, pictured right in an artist's impression, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which will stand more than 3,280ft (1km) high.

The Shard is currently western Europe's tallest building at 1,003ft (306m) high.

Mace will participate in a joint venture with fellow British firm EC Harris to create the huge building, which has been given a completion date of 2018.

The Kingdom Tower, which will have a construction area of more than 5,381,955 square feet, will stand at four times the size of the Shard.

It will overlook the Red Sea and is expected to take over from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 2,717ft (828m), as the world's tallest skyscraper.

It is not yet known how tall the skyscraper will be as developers keep exact details of the plan a secret.

The most incredible prediction in the Arup report was that the buildings of the future would benefit from brain-like 'intelligent building systems' that enable them to automatically adjust to the needs of inhabitants.

Using data about energy consumption, weather, and the whims of residents, they would be able to make 'calculated decisions' about how to best use resources.

This could extend as far as using jet-powered maintenance arms to swap the 'modules' that form the building blocks of the skyscraper.

Such modular components could be used for residential or commercial units, or even urban food production sites housing animal, fish or vegetable farms, depending on what is needed at the time.

'In this emerging age, with significant developments in construction, prefabricated and modular systems are moved and assembled by robots that work seamlessly together to install, detect, repair and upgrade components of the building system,' the report said.

With human population set to mushroom,
 the predictions took into account likely increased concern about the 
pressure so many souls would put on our planet's already-strained 
natural resources.

The Arup 
report promised buildings that would one day in fact produce more 
resources than they consume thanks to external walls coated with 
photovoltaic paint, wind turbines and even pods growing bio-fuel 
producing algae.

Green 
spaces would be dispersed throughout the building to encourage urban 
biodiversity, while water systems would be optimised for recycling and 
reuse and filters would cut down on environmental pollutants, it said.

The building's facades, as well as 
having the potential to generate power from the sun, could also be 
coated with nano-particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants
 and capture waste carbon dioxide.

Elements
 such as vast organic LEDs could even allow for whole surfaces of the 
structure to light up at night, creating a new form of street lighting.

'Coupled
 with daylight absorbing abilities, the technology realises the 
possibility of 'net zero energy' artificial lighting,' the report said.

The Arup report, entitled It's Alive, was put together by Josef Hargrave, a consultant in the company's Foresight + Innovation team, an internal think tank which focuses on the future of the built environment.

He concluded: 'By producing food and energy, and providing clean air and water, buildings evolve from being passive shells into adaptive and responsive organisms - living and breathing structures supporting the cities of tomorrow.'
