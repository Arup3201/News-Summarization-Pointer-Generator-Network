Former elementary school teacher Whitney Fair Mullen, 34, appeared in court Thursday morning in Senatobia, Mississippi on charges of molestation and sexual battery of a child

The boy, now 18, came forward recently and claimed that he had been abused by Mullen when he was just 12 years old back in 2008

Senatobia police said the alleged victim, who is now 18, recently revealed the alleged abuse. Police reported uncovering messages exchanged between the teacher and student. 

The teen claimed that the abuse had taken place since 2008 but investigators said that it did not take place on school grounds. 

Mullen no longer works for Tate County schools. It is unclear if there are other victims. 

It is alleged that the victim was abused at Mullen's home where he was doing odd jobs. 

The court set Mullen's initial bond at $5million but it was later reduced to $250,000.

She hid her face with her hair from TV cameras as she exited court escorted by two police officers in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit. 

The alleged victim and his family described the torment they have suffered following the alleged abuse. 

The father, who remained anonymous to protect his son, said that the family had great respect for teachers and perhaps had placed too much trust in Mullen. 

He told WMC: 'Maybe it was a little too naive, I guess is the word, but a terrible price was paid. It's impacted his life, from the time he was 12 'til now.'

The case is due to heard by a grand jury.
