It has proved somewhat of a mixed week for trainer Nicky Henderson with some success and a few near misses, but PEACE AND CO (Cheltenham, 1.30) has looked a class act since joining the Lambourn maestro and is taken to land the JCB Triumph Hurdle.

Henderson, who had his first winner of the Festival when Call The Cops won the Pertemps Network Hurdle, has a strong hand in the opener with Top Notch and the classy Hargam providing terrific back-up artillery for his main gun.

They should both run huge races, with the latter especially dangerous given the way he travels and jumps. However, Peace And Co looked to have an extra gear in reserve on his British debut at Doncaster and I have rarely seen a juvenile hurdle with such enthusiasm and precision.

Everything went wrong for the son of Falco on trials day as a small field and sluggish pace led to him pulling hard and over-racing early on, but he still possessed the quality to score readily and the likelihood of a stronger gallop is sure to suit today.

The Willie Mullins trio of Dicosimo, Kalkir and Petite Parisienne all look to have viable credentials with preference for the latter, who was a smooth winner of the Spring Juvenile Hurdle at Leopardstown, one of the chief trials for his race.

LE MERCUREY (Cheltenham, 4.40) is another French import who arrived on these shores with a big reputation and, although he has been a slower burner than most, he could be ready to strike.

Paul Nicholls has been highly competitive in the week’s hurdle events and his five-year-old shaped with plenty of promise in an Ascot handicap on his latest start when staying on nicely late on behind Baradari. Some will think he has plenty of weight, but his handler looks to have found a race where exciting conditional Sean Bowen can be utilised fully, and Nicholls won this event two years ago with Salubrious before Caid Du Berlais was third last year.

The progressive Roi Des Francs, winner of a Grade Three Hurdle at Clonmel last time, looks dangerously well treated and rates as the chief danger, while course winner Barizan could be overpriced, given his stable switch and change of headgear.

Alan King pulled a rabbit from the hat with AP McCoy’s 16-1 mount Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase and GRUMETI (Cheltenham, nap, 5.15) looks a sporting bet to land the finale.

Like Uxizandre, King reaches for the first-time headgear for his seven-year-old, who was progressing nicely over fences until he stepped up in trip for a Sandown Grade One last time and found it all too much. 

His previous efforts, including behind Vibrato Valtat in a Warwick novice chase, read pretty well and he won with plenty in hand at Plumpton on his penultimate start, a victory which qualifies the selection for a bonus if he can complete the double today.

Ned Buntline is sure to have plenty of supporters behind his rider and he should again run well given he was only beaten a length in the race last year, while it would be no surprise to see a resurgent Next Sensation, fourth 12 months ago, also acquit himself well.
