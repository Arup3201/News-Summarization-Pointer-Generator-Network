Always popular: Anita Dobson, pictured on Strictly Come Dancing, is to join The Archers

A racy divorcee is about to hit leafy Ambridge. So when Jennifer, Lillian and the other ladies of The Archers get together at the Bull, there will be only one topic for gossip.

What to do about the unexpected new arrival in the everyday story of country folk?

For in a move which will astonish the programme’s fans, the new character, I can reveal, is to be played by the one-time queen of TV soaps, Anita Dobson.

As Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts in EastEnders, Anita, 63, enthralled fans with her tempestuous marriage to unfaithful husband Dirty Den, played by Leslie Grantham.

And in 1986 their storyline helped the show record the highest-ever viewing figures for a soap – more than 30 million.

When she quit at the height of her fame in 1988, Anita vowed she would never again appear in a soap because of the public pressure she encountered.

She has since starred in many TV dramas and on the stage, most recently in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Merry Wives Of Windsor. But now she has clearly had a change of mind.

‘I’m going into The Archers playing a divorcee called Celia,’ Anita says.

Her arrival could be just the shot in the arm the radio show needs following recent complaints about storylines and political correctness.

Last month the BBC said it was shutting down The Archers online messageboard after scores of complaints.

Two years ago Anita appeared on Strictly Come Dancing where she proved to be an excellent dancer and last year, she was on tour with Greta Scacchi in the play Joan and Betty about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis fractious relationship when they made the film Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?

Speaking of her new role at  St Pancras station where her  rock guitarist husband Brian May was giving a performance, Anita says: ‘Initially it’s just for six episodes.

'To be honest I’ve been working non-stop lately and what  I would like most is a long rest. But we’ll see.’

Says a friend: ‘The role is ideal for Anita, she plays a flighty woman on the look-out for a man and is just the kind of part she has been looking for to put some fun back into her career.’

It was the sartorial go-to for fashionistas and celebrities alike including Elle Macpherson, TV presenter Lauren Laverne and American socialite Olivia Palermo.

But now, glamorous founder Sarah Walter has been forced to put her company — Style-Passport — into liquidation.

After only two years of trading, Sarah, who is the wife of GQ editor Dylan Jones and a contemporary of Anna Wintour — they began their careers at British Vogue on the same day — is facing losing her business after a key investor pulled out.

Fans of the high-end bikinis and 
kaftans sold by Sarah and her team have taken to social networking site 
Twitter to express their shock at the news.

However the online firm, 
whose  administration is being overseen by liquidators Marsh Hammond 
& Partners, has reassured customers that all existing orders will be
 fulfilled.

‘Everyone is incredibly sad but there is still time for someone to come in with an investment and save the day,’ says a friend.

‘So we all just have to sit tight and wait and see.’

After four years in the U.S, bubbly TV presenter June Sarpong is returning to British shores, bringing with her some big plans.

The first is to oversee the expansion of her international network Women: Inspiration and Enterprise, for which she is hosting a  symposium tomorrow.

The second is of a more personal nature — to look for a husband.

‘Finding a guy is another reason to come home, I prefer British men,’ says June, 35. ‘They’re not chivalrous the way American men are but that’s OK, I would rather have British jokes and British sarcasm — and I can open my own door.’

June, who is in talks with Channel 4 about a new show, admits her job will take a backseat when she does start a family. ‘If you are a woman and you’re over 40, your TV career is not what is was ten years earlier, it’s nuts,’ she says. ‘There’s ageism, sexism, racism.

‘But hopefully I’ll be at home with kids so I am happy to relax and take a step back career-wise five years from now.’

It’s all smiles at Chilham Castle in Kent where former Tory donor turned UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler has been cheering the success of his party’s efforts in the by-election at Eastleigh.

Now his wife, society photographer Tessa Codrington, has another reason to celebrate. For Tessa has finally managed to get the second edition of her coffee-table photographic book, Spirit Of Tangier, distributed after her publisher went bankrupt.

Her book, first published in 2008, was a sell-out and it was re-printed five months ago. ‘But then there was this terrible blip,’ she tells me.

‘Just as all the books were about to be distributed, the publishing company went into liquidation.

‘They have now been taken over  by someone else — but at the time all the books were stuck in storage  and the distributer refused to send them out.’

This week, however, she hopes they will at last go on sale again.

Emma Forbes has worked out why she’s not on prime-time TV any more.

‘I don’t suck up to male presenters enough,’ she says. ‘I think I’m too feisty. I just can’t simper to men like so many women I know on TV — it makes me sick.’

Happily Emma, 47, has other plans. Speaking at Tesco’s Mum Of The Year awards at the Savoy, the mother-of-two tells me: ‘I’ve just been signed up by Vision Express as a style adviser, which is a coincidence because my eyesight has suddenly got terrible.

‘I’ve got to wear spectacles to read autocues and I’m looking for a really outrageous pair!’

In a theatrical career spanning more than half a century, you might suppose that Dame Eileen Atkins has some regrets. In fact, she has just two.

‘One was a Jeffrey Archer play that was no fun at all,’ she says. ‘Poor Jeffrey, it wasn’t his fault but he was asked to re-write the whole thing. The other was a horror movie with Joan Collins. She was all right, but it was a dreadful movie.’

Dame Eileen, 78, adds: ‘It was called I Don’t Want To Be Born and it was a spin-off of The Exorcist. I needed cash to go half-way across the world to meet a man and thought, “Oh well it will be all right, I’ll just do this.” It was only two grand, too — two grand and I sold my soul...’
