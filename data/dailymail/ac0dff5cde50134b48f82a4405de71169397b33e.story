Landscape gardener Patrick Norfolk had one last wish as the debilitating physical condition that had plagued him for years entered its final, terrible stages. He wanted to die in his garden among the flowers and plants he  had tended for decades, surrounded by his family.

Patrick, 65, had been left a shell of his former independent, physically active self by motor neurone disease – an incurable illness that wreaks havoc on the nervous system and causes muscles to waste away.

Overwhelmed by the disease’s relentless onslaught, Patrick did indeed try to take his own life at his home. But the attempt was unsuccessful and – unable to seek help from his wife Anne or anyone else because of Britain’s laws on assisted suicide – he took the agonising decision to end his life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland.

Now, for the first time, Anne has decided to speak of her husband’s death in June in the hope it will reignite the debate over the ‘barbaric and archaic’ laws that robbed him of his dignity.

Anne, 58, says: ‘Pat desperately wanted to die a peaceful death surrounded by his family in his garden, which was where he was happiest. Had he been able to have his wish, the last years of his life would have been so much more pleasurable, knowing he could have a dignified death.

‘Instead, Pat spent every single day worrying about how he could end his life when the time was right for him. He never wanted to die in a foreign country but because of the laws in Britain, he ultimately had no choice.’

It is not the only tragedy that Anne has suffered in recent years. In  February 2011, her youngest daughter Vicky committed suicide after struggling with depression. The 31-year-old shop assistant, who suffered from rosacea – a chronic skin condition that caused her face to redden – jumped off the Humber Bridge.

At the time, Patrick’s condition was worsening by the day – and he was  particularly badly affected by Vicky’s death. Anne said: ‘Patrick had the  natural devastation of his daughter dying. But it was more difficult for him because of what he was going through.

‘After Vicky’s death, he was conscious that he didn’t want anybody to think what she had done was influencing him.

‘His mind to take his own life was made up from day one.’

Patrick had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2008, three years before Vicky died.

Anne, who still lives in the home they shared in Swanland, near Hull, said: ‘The doctor at Hull Royal Infirmary diagnosed him and one of Pat’s first questions was, “How long have I got?”

‘The doctor said about two years. From the day he was diagnosed he said, “I will not see this through, I will take my own life.” It was soul-destroying for him. He was robbed of his livelihood and independence.’

Anne says their daughters Bridget, now 38, Colette, now 34, and Vicky were ‘shocked and devastated’ by the diagnosis.

Patrick’s health continued to deteriorate and by December 2011 he was confined to a wheelchair – and it was at this point that he made his failed suicide attempt, while Anne was out shopping.

She preferred not to discuss the details but said that Patrick had thoroughly researched it and was ‘convinced’ that it would work.

As well as a note to his wife and family, Patrick wrote a letter to the coroner. In it, he said: ‘If an animal was left to die under these conditions a prosecution by the RSPCA or similar would follow  – are animals more important?’

Anne recalled: ‘He didn’t want him or any of us to suffer any longer. He didn’t want us to go through the misery of watching him die. After his failed suicide attempt we had a soul-searching conversation and he came to the conclusion that the only way forward was Switzerland.’

Patrick contacted Dignitas in February. ‘He was given the green light in May and, from that moment on, it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders,’ Anne says.

The couple – together with Bridget and Colette – flew from Heathrow to Switzerland on June 24. Patrick was booked into the clinic four days later.

Anne revealed that Patrick died outdoors surrounded by nature. She said: ‘In the end, we decided the girls should come with us to the entrance to the clinic but only I should go in.

‘First of all he took something to settle his stomach and then we sat chatting. We spoke about silly things like flowers. About an hour later he took a potion and had a glass of water to swill it down. I held his hands and we kissed and said we loved one another.

‘He got to die in the garden, not his own, but he was outside as he wanted to be. I’m still incensed he couldn’t die at home, in his garden as he wanted. The laws in this country are archaic and barbaric.’

Nearly 200 people from Britain have ended their lives at Dignitas since it was set up in 1998.

But critics of assisted suicide argue that it is a violation of medical ethics. A spokesman for anti-euthanasia campaign group Care Not Killing said: ‘The message assisted suicide sends is that if you are terminally ill, disabled or less healthy,  your life is less  worthy than if you are young, fit and healthy.

‘The moment you start deciding whose life is worth saving and whose is not, you are on a slippery slope.’

Earlier this month, new Health Minister Anna Soubry said she backed changing the law on assisted suicide – under which offenders risk a sentence of up to 14 years – only to face calls for her resignation.

The Motor Neurone Disease Association said: ‘We have a  neutral stance on whether there should be a change in the law.’
