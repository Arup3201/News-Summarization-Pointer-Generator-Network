Fresh out of a cocaine scandal, a divorce and public attacks by her former personal assistants, Nigella Lawson has said she is 'averse to conflict'.

The 'domestic goddess' told how she avoids confrontation in an interview with Radio Times interview to promote the new season of The Taste.

Nigella's acrimonious split from Charles Saatchi has hogged the headlines, alongside her confession in court that she has used cocaine seven times in her life and accusations by the Grillo sisters that she 'let her children smoke cannabis'.

Not confrontational: Nigella Lawson has said she is 'averse to conflict' and that as a cook, she is different from professional chefs

Talking about her US TV show, which has been described as MasterChef meets The Voice, she told the magazine: ‘What I liked, not being terribly confrontational as a person, is that because you taste everything blind, you're never making any judgments on a person and you're just talking about the food.’

Lawson, who is also an executive producer on the show, added: ‘So much of reality TV is the theatre of humiliation or in some sense the culture of the breast-heaving back story, so to have a food competition that is actually about the food is... rather pleasant.’

Asked what the difference is between professional chefs and cooks like her, she added: ‘What I would say - and this is not about the food, it is about the personality - is that, as a general rule, chefs are conflict-driven, they are perfectionist, they are risk-takers. 

All about The Taste: Nigella said she seeks to 'use food to bring harmony - for whatever reason'

In charge: Nigella, pictured alongside her fellow chefs Ludo Lefebrve, Marcus Samuelsson and Anthony Bourdain is both a judge and the show's executive produces

‘Whereas home cooks tend to be conflict-averse - well, I am - not necessarily risk-takers, and we seek to use food to bring harmony - for whatever reason.’

Lawson added that she had felt ‘incredibly frightened’ about going to Los Angeles to do the show.

The interview, which took place six weeks before allegations of Lawson's drug use emerged in the fraud trial of her former personal assistants, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo,

The sisters were acquitted and Lawson admitted during the trial that she took cocaine with her late husband John Diamond when he found out he had terminal cancer, and in 2010 when she claimed she was being ‘subjected to intimate terrorism’ by her former husband Mr Saatchi.

Police are to review her admission that she took the Class A drug.

The Taste is being broadcast in the UK on Channel 4.
