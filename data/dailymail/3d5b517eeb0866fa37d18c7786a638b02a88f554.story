A couple in Toledo, Ohio cheated death when a car going 100 miles an hour slammed into their motel room.

Adrian Smith had just gotten up to do to the bathroom when a SUV crashed into their room at the Crown Inn Motel, right where he was sitting before.

'I get up to use the bathroom and right when I get up to use the bathroom, the truck ended up in my room,' Smith told ABC 13. 'You know what I'm saying? Just one big bang!'

Motel car crash: Thomas Wallace of Temperance, Michigan lost control of his car going 100 mph and crashed into a Toledo, Ohio motel

Lucky ones: Rochelle Watson, left, was eight months pregnant when the car came charging into the room, pinning her between the couch and bed, and almost hitting her boyfriend Adrian Smith, right

He said it sounded like the room exploded.

'If he wouldn't have gotten up when he did he would have been smashed up under that car. It came in right where he was laying at,' his girlfriend, Rochelle Watson, said.

Watson is eight months pregnant and was knocked off her bed and pinned between the bed and the couch, but luckily wasn't seriously injured.

Rescuers had to knock down the neighboring room's wall in order to get the couple out.

The crash happened at around 11:30 a.m. when 32-year-old Thomas Wallace of Temperance, Michigan drove 100 mph through a red light.

Narrow miss: Police said they don't believe alcohol was a factor in the crash

He hit two other vehicles and lost control of his car, police said.

He hit a light pole and then smashed into the motel.

Police don't believe alcohol was a factor.

After the crash Wallace tried to flee the scene on foot, but police caught him in a nearby K-Mart parking lot.

Despite the speed of the car, motel manager Arvind Patel told ABC News that no one was injured.

'I was worried about the pregnant woman, but no one was injured. It was a miracle,' Patel said.

Three rooms were damaged in the crash and all guests affected were relocated to other rooms in the motel.

Miraculous: Neither Smith or Watson were seriously injured in the crash

Smith believes he cheated death.

'I'm real lucky to be alive. Somebody prayed for me last night or this morning. I'll put it that way.'

Both Smith and Watson were taken to a nearby hospital for non life-threatening conditions. Smith was discharged Sunday night.

The driver was also taken to the hospital for treatment.
