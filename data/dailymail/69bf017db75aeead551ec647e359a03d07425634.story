Arizona has become the first state in America to pass legislation allowing people and businesses to refuse to work with or serve gays if their religion forbids or disapproves of homosexuality.

The Democrat opposition called the proposal 'state-sanctioned discrimination' and an embarrassment and claimed that it would hurt the economy.

'This bill is about going after the 
rights of the LGBT community in Arizona,' said Representative Chad 
Campbell, the leader of the Democrat opposition. 'This is going to be horrible 
for our economy.'

Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (with microphone) says that a new bill would discriminate against gays and others. The legislation is designed to allow people and businesses to refuse to serve or work with gays if they find homosexuality against their religious beliefs

If accepted, the bill will put the state back into the forefront
 of controversial law debate, four years after the national uproar it caused with an 
immigration crackdown.

Other states -Â Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South 
Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma - have brought in religious legislation but Arizona is the only one to pass.

Republicans claim the bill is about protecting religious freedom and not discrimination, They mentioned the case of a New Mexico photographer who was sued after refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple.

In favour: Republican Justin Pierce spoke in favour of the legislation that Democrats said was 'discriminatory'

The bill allows any business, church or person to use the law as a defence in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination.

The bill is backed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law.

All but three Republicans in the House voted in favour of the bill. and the Senate passed it the day before.

In 2008, Arizona voted to ban same-sex marriage but there is no guarantee that the bill will pass as Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar measure last year.

Republicans said it was simply an added protection for the faithful in the state who disapprove of gay marriage and want to be able to reject participating.
