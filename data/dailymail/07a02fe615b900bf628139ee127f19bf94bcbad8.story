Plagued by a hacking cough and persistent bouts of pneumonia, doctors urged Jamie Roper to undergo medical tests.

The 46-year-old was showing the classic symptoms of lung cancer.

But he was adamant, he would not have a biopsy until he had married his bride-to-be Jen, 30.

After returning from the Mediterranean, where the couple tied the knot aboard a cruise ship, tests confirmed doctors' fears.

Mr Roper was suffering lung cancer.

Six weeks after marrying his new wife, he passed away in her arms, his last words to her, 'I love you.' 

Jamie Roper, 46, died six weeks after marrying his wife Jen on board a cruise ship in the Mediterranean. He had delayed a biopsy test to detect lung cancer, adamant he wouldn't let it get in the way of their wedding 

Two weeks after returning from their holiday, tests revealed Mr Roper did have lung cancer, after he had been suffering a hacking cough and persistent bouts of pneumonia

Mrs Roper, from Long Stratton in Norfolk, today urged others not to delay vital tests.

'We were always hopeful that he'd be all right then I realised it was not to be,' she said.

'In the run-up to the wedding Jamie was in and out of the doctors.

'He had felt poorly for a month, but we didn't think it was serious. We weren't worried.

'He was told he had a chest infection, then pneumonia and he went for scans. 

'Then in September - on the day before my final dress fitting - Jamie was told that he might have lung cancer.  

'We were told he would need more biopsies to confirm this but we decided to stay positive.

'We decided to delay the tests and get married. We hoped that we'd get a few years together at the very least.'

In October 2011, the couple drove to Southampton to board the cruise ship on which they were married.

'It was lovely,' Mrs Roper, who met her husband two years earlier at work, remembered.

'But all the time I thought something might be wrong. As we said the words "in sickness and in health", it really hit home.' 

The couple made the most of their fortnight away.

'Jamie struggled with his breathing but otherwise we had an amazing time,' she said. 'But a cloud hung over us.'

A fortnight after they returned home Mr Roper went to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for a biopsy. 

Six weeks after their wedding, while in the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, Mr Roper passed away in his wife's arms, his last words to her, 'I love you'

Mrs Roper today urged people not to delay medical tests as her husband did. She said: 'We were always hopeful that he'd be all right then I realised it was not to be'

He was kept in hospital because of complications and after 10 days allowed home.

Two days later – a month after they'd returned from their wedding – he was diagnosed with lung cancer and returned to hospital. 

Lung cancer is one of the most common and most serious types of cancer.

More than 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK.

Many people will see no signs or symptoms in the early stages, but as the disease progresses some symptoms develop, including:

- a persistent cough

- coughing up blood

- persistent breathlessness

- unexplained tiredness and weight loss

- an ache or pain when breathing or coughing

Mrs Roper said: 'Surgeons confirmed he had lung cancer and a tear in his bowel, which he would need surgery for.

'He had surgery straight away but afterwards his heart rate picked up and he started gasping for breath.

'I was told that before the surgery Jamie had been asked if his lungs failed if he wanted to be resuscitated.

'He'd said no.

'I told him I loved him and he tried to say it back but didn't get the words out.'

He died in his wife's arms on November 29, 2011.  

After his funeral that December Mrs Roper struggled to cope and kept a note he had written her, pinned to the fridge for months.

It read: 'Hi honey I bloody love you!! Xxxx.'

She read it over and over again and when it started fading she decided to have the words tattooed on her left hip.

She also had a ring made, containing some of his ashes and the words, 'Love you forever', engraved on the band.

She said: 'They were the words Jamie used to sign off every text.'
