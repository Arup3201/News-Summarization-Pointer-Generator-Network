A leading economist is being questioned by police over claims he assaulted a prostitute after the pair smoked crack together.

Professor Douglas McWilliams, executive chairman of influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, allegedly attacked Beverly Shearon at her flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Ms Shearon, 47, reportedly called police after she was left with a black eye and an injury to her hand, claiming McWilliams had 'flipped out' when a neighbour arrived at the one-bedroom flat.

She claims the pair had smoked crack cocaine together, and she had performed a sex act on the married 63-year-old when he visited her unannounced on New Year's Eve.

He reportedly left before police arrived, but was later questioned under caution by officers.  

'He turned up at about 4pm and wanted a smoke. I was weak and let him,' Ms Shearon, who added that she was trying to quit her drugs habit, told The Sun's Michael Hamilton.

Ms Shearon, who calls McWilliams 'Posh Rob', said his mood changed suddenly when a neighbour called in to wish her a Happy New Year.

She alleged McWilliams, who she said had been a regular visitor to her home in the past year, had then attacked her in front of the well-wisher, before leaving the flat.

She said she called police to her home, who took photographs of her injuries.

Police arrived at the one-bedroom property and are said to have taken photographs of her injuries  

'Police are investigating an ABH assault which is alleged to have occurred at an address in St Albans at around 5pm on Wednesday, December 31st,' a Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline.

'A woman reported she had been assaulted, she suffered an injury to her hand and bruising to her face.

'A 63-year-old man from London has been interviewed under caution and investigations are on-going at this time. No drug offences are being investigated.'

McWilliams has not commented on the claims. A CEBR spokesman told MailOnline the claims involving McWilliams were 'not a matter' for the think-tank.

A representative of McWilliams told The Sun he had been unable to contact the economist since Friday evening.

'I am aware he has denied this lady's allegation,' he said. 

Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'.

He set up the think-tank in 1992 having previously served as Chief Economic Adviser to the Confederation of British Industry and Chief Economist for IBM UK. 

The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR’s clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.'

On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about his predictions regarding the British economy, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.'

It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.'

McWilliams has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off  by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget.

He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.'

In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world’s fifth largest economy.

The growth in Britain’s national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries.

On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about the predictions, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.'

A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.
