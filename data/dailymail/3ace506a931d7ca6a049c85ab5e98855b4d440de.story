A Utah father has filed a lawsuit seeking $130million in damages after his baby boy was given up for adoption without his knowledge.

Jake Strickland's ex-girlfriend Whitney Pettersson gave birth to their son Jackson in 2010 and soon afterwards put him up for adoption. Mr Strickland claims he was not given the chance to seek custody.

Mr Strickland, 27, says he wanted to be fully involved in his son's life and that Miss Pettersson, 
conspired with the adoptive parents' adoption agency, LDS Family Services, operated by the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, to give up his son.

Mr Strickland and Miss Pettersson met in 2009 while working at a restaurant. She was married but told Mr Strickland that she was getting a divorce and they began a relationship. Three months later, Miss Pettersson was pregnant.

Mr Strickland says he assured her that he wanted to be involved in his son’s life and provided emotional and financial support, even after their 
own relationship began to break down.

However in early 2011, Mr Strickland found out that Miss Pettersson had given birth to a boy a week earlier
 without his knowledge.

It also emerged that she was still legally married to another 
man and that under Utah state law, he would be considered Jack's father.

The most devastating part of the discovery however was that Miss Pettersson had given Jack up for adoption.

Mr Strickland began a paternity claim to get his son back but was hindered because he had not registered for paternal rights.

Despite his attempts to get his son back, the father learned in November 2011 that Jack had been given up for adoption.

His battle for paternity rights is currently under review by the state.

According
 to NBC: 'Strickland’s federal lawsuit is seeking $30 million for the 
loss of the parent-child relationship caused by the adoption and $100 
million as a deterrent to ensure another dad doesn't suffer his fate.'

This is the third year of Mr Strickland's fight to have his son returned to him. Each year he and his family gather around a lone birthday candle to sing Happy Birthday to his absent son.

Mr Strickland's lawsuit challenges the restrictions on a biological father's rights in Utah.

The lawsuit, filed last Friday in U.S. 
District Court, claims the entire process of custody and adoption was 
illegal and done 'through gross misdirection and … clandestine conduct'.

The
 suit claims that parenting laws in Utah, which have prevented Mr 
Strickland and his family from seeing his son, are 'pro-adoption and 
anti-birth father'.

Attorney
 Wes Hutchins says the emotional battle is 'pulling [Jake] apart … They 
still think about Jack even though they don't have contact'.
