It was once a gritty stretch of Manhattan known for rail yards, warehouses and aging industrial buildings, so desolate it was dubbed 'The Wild, Wild West'.

Now, one of the US's biggest construction projects is transforming a stretch of Manhattan's west side with 20 new buildings - 17 of them high-rises - so tightly packed that it has earned the nickname: 'Hong Kong on the Hudson.'

When finished in 2024, the Hudson Yards area will boast more hotels, as well as an observation deck higher than the Empire State Building.

This is going to be the new heart of New York,' says Michael Samuelian, a project manager for the $20bn Hudson Yards - a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group.

This development and the adjacent $4.5bn Manhattan West complex comprise the city's most ambitious private real estate ventures since Rockefeller Center went up in the 1930s.

When fully completed, the two projects will offer more than 22 million square feet of space, including 6,000 residential units - more footage than the rebuilt World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.

Construction on Manhattan West's first 65-storey office tower will start after the platform is finished by year's end.

The plan for Hudson Yards, occupying an area between 30th and 34th streets bordered by Tenth Avenue and the West Side Highway, features 16 buildings - 14 of them skyscrapers.

The first, 52-storey tower rising over the rail yards is expected to open in 2015, anchored by the Coach luxury retailer with tenants including L'Oreal USA and German software giant SAP.

Work also has begun on Hudson Yards' tallest building - an 80-storey skyscraper with an observation deck higher than the Empire State Building. It will be home to the corporate headquarters of Time Warner by 2019.

Manhattan West fills the block between
 Tenth and Ninth avenues with three towers - two more than 60 storeys - a
 public plaza and walkway, shops, garages and a hotel.

Squeezed 
in-between the budding complexes is a nearly half-century-old, 
pyramid-shaped building that Brookfield purchased as part of Manhattan 
West.

The 16-storey building is to undergo a $200m renovation with glass
 floor-to-ceiling exteriors by 2016.

New York University urban planner Mitchell Moss says the developments accelerate a shift of the city's high-end commercial heart away from the traditional stronghold of midtown Manhattan surrounding Rockefeller Center.

'They reflect New York's new economic 
center of gravity, shifting to the west and south all the way down to 
the World Trade Center,' Moss says.

The
 neighborhood popularly called Hell's Kitchen to the east and Chelsea to
 the south had briefly been considered as the site of a proposed 
football stadium for the Jets meant to help win the city the 2012 
Olympics.

But those plans fell apart when New York lost the bid to London.

Even before the latest construction 
work, the area had seen something of a rebirth with its former elevated 
freight tracks transformed into the popular High Line park.

Some who live nearby are skeptical of what lies ahead.

'Something
 was going to be built over the rail yards - that was inevitable - and 
this would have been a nice opportunity to do something for the 
community,' says resident Ann Warren, who owns a neighborhood cupcake 
bakery and was forced out of her apartment building on West 35th Street 
by eminent domain.

'But all the developers want is to make money.'
