These images show the incredible moment a manatee befriended a 15-year-old girl.

Margaux Maes was on holiday on the Crystal River in Citrus County, Florida, with her mother, Ellen Cuylaerts, and brother, Max, when she struck up the friendship.

Ordinarily, the marine mammals, which can weigh more than a tiger shark, are known to shy away from humans. But this manatee took a real shine to Margaux.

Manatees are usually known as a shy species, but this one took a real liking to the 15-year-old holidaymaker

Manatees are large, fully aquatic, mostly vegetarian marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows, which can grow up to 9ft.

Margaux's family spent three days swimming with the animals, in a special expedition to learn more about the conservation and preservation of the species.

Mother, Ms Cuylaerts, who photographed their encounters, said: ‘We were on a boat trip with a small party, and the manatees wouldn't get close to any of the other swimmers, but for whatever reason, they really took a liking to Margaux.’

The 15-year-old spent four hours in the water every day and was extremely lucky to swim in such close proximity to the stocky mammals.

Margaux said: ‘I'd been told the manatees wouldn't come anywhere near us, but when I saw the one of them swimming right towards me it caught me off guard a little and I was a little panicked if I'm honest.

‘They are very big and powerful animals, but it was soon clear that this not-so-little fella just wanted to play and he was swimming in circles around me.

‘It was a once in a lifetime experience and I enjoyed every moment of it.’

On the specialist boat trip run by conservationist Stay Dunn swimmers are asked to not to chase the manatees, but are allowed to make contact if the animals approach them.

Ms Cuylaerts said: ‘I was stroking the manatee and I think he really enjoyed it as he kept coming back for more of a fuss.’
