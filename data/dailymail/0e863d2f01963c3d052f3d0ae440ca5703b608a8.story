A top undercover detective wants to quit South Africa's notorious police after he was arrested during a covert sting and tortured for 30 hours by colleagues from his own force, his lawyer has claimed.

Cornelius Pettit, who has been behind some of the Eastern Cape's biggest criminal busts, said he was trying to smash an illegal gold trafficking ring in Pretoria when officers swooped, blowing his cover.

His lawyer, Alwyn Griebenow, claimed he had gone to the Sunnyside area of the city with an informant to meet a dealer to meet suspected gang members before his plan was scuppered.

He says he was arrested and thrown behind bars at a local police station while the real culprits were let go, according to Sowetanlive.com.

There, he claims, fellow officers tortured him, refused to feed him and even stole R20000 (£1,400) which he had in his pocket.

He says he was so badly traumatised 
by the ordeal that he has booked time off work, received medical 
treatment for wounds to his arms and needs psychiatric therapy.

Now Pettit, who was recently commended by his force for refusing a R2million (£140,000) bribe from drug dealers, says he wants to leave the South African police after 26 years of service.

Brutal: Earlier this month, eight police officers accused of handcuffing taxi driver Mido Macia to their patrol car in Daveyton and dragging him along the street until he died were charged with murder

Shocking: Video footage captured on a mobile phone showed officers attaching the 27-year-old Mozambican to the back of their van and brazenly speeding off before a crowd of horrified onlookers

According to his lawyer, when Pettit begged his arresting 
officer to phone his unit commander in Port Elizabeth to clear up the 
situation, the officer refused and instead abused him more.

South Africa's police force hs been thrust sharply under the spotlight recently after a string of controversies.

Earlier this month, eight police officers accused of handcuffing a taxi driver to their patrol car in Daveyton and dragging him along the street until he died were charged with murder.

Video footage captured on a mobile phone showed officers attaching 27-year-old Mozambican Mido Macia to the back of their van and brazenly speeding off before a crowd of horrified onlookers.

Controversy: In February, the murder trial of paralympian Oscar Pistorius, left, was sensationally interrupted after it emerged the chief investigating officer, Hilton Botha, right, was facing multiple murder charges himself

Mr Macia was found dead in a police cell two hours later in Daveyton, South Africa.

That scandal was only the latest to undermine confidence in South Africa's police, heaping yet more shame on a
force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum 
mine in August last year, killing 34 people.

And in February, the murder trial of paralympian Oscar Pistorius ground to a sensational halt after it emerged the chief investigating officer was facing multiple murder charges himself.

Detective Hilton Botha has been charged with seven counts of attempted murder 
relating to an incident in October 2011 and is due to appear in court 
himself in May with two other police officers, accused of firing shots 
at a minibus which had seven people inside.
