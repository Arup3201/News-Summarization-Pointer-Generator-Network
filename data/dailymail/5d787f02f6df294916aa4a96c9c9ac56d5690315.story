Defiant: Former NUM President Arthur Scargill leaves Sheffield County Court where he is claiming £50,000 in damages against the organisation

In his heyday, Arthur Scargill ruled the National Union of Mineworkers like a king.

But yesterday the 74-year-old turned against his former kingdom by taking the union to court in a battle over thousands of pounds in unpaid bills and benefits.

Mr Scargill is claiming up to £50,000 damages in a case that could cost the union’s Yorkshire Trust Fund as much as £80,000 if he wins.

And it was clear from a typically combative performance in the witness box at Sheffield County Court that time has not changed the former union firebrand in his determination to fight to the end for his ‘rights’.

Mr Scargill, who ended his reign as union President 10 years ago, claims the union should pay all his home and mobile phone bills as well as £14,556 towards the cost of a new car.

He has hired a leading QC and is also asking for his costs to be paid by the union.

But as it was in the famous miners dispute of the 1980s, the two sides remain miles apart, with his union employers offering to pay their former leader just £50 for a car.

After resigning as NUM President in 2002, Mr Scargill became a paid employee of the Yorkshire Area Trust Fund in a contract which ended in December 2011.

The court battle centres on the terms of this lower grade job and work he did or didn’t do.

Giving evidence in a dark suit and red tie, Mr Scargill implied he received a £26,000-a-year salary for the trust job and worked more than eight hours a day for six days a week on important compensation and legal casework on behalf of members.

He said: ‘Most people who know me say I undertook more hours than any other official in history.’

However, the court heard two of the trustees were unaware he was working for the fund and for months at a time Mr Scargill was said to do no work at all.

Bizarrely, the terms and conditions of his employment as a union trust fund official were set out in writing when Mr Scargill was still union President.

James Laddie, for the trust fund, suggested to Mr Scargill the important document was a ‘letter to you and from you.’

Mr Scargill denied authorising his own job terms and insisted: ‘It would have been a conflict of interest for me to do my own contract of employment.’

He said the task was handed to the vice-president and union solicitors instead.

Discussing his workload as a trust official, the court heard there were 58 ‘cases or issues’ he handled in a three-year period from June 2007.

However, some of these jobs detailed in a written log by Mr Scargill involved little work. One task he listed as a union job involved him signing five books, the court heard.

There was a four-month period in 2008 when he did no work at all, according to the list.

Mr Laddie told the claimant: ‘There were large periods of time when you undertook no work at all on behalf of the Yorkshire Area Trust Fund.’

From 2004 onwards, he never attended a single trust meeting and the minutes of the meetings never discussed any of the work he had done, the court heard.

Mr Laddie told him: ‘If you really were conducting any of this terribly important and terribly substantial work in the course of your employment, it’s surprising there is no reference to that work over this period of years.’

However, the former union leader, who was earning £70,000 a year as President, denied any suggestion that he had a small workload.

He insisted he was entitled to a car allowance from the union in intervals of not less than two years.

The county court case being heard by Judge Robert Moore is just the first stage in an ongoing legal battle with the NUM.

Mr Scargill is in dispute over the payment of £34,000 annual rent on a £1.5 million apartment in London’s upmarket Barbican development, which the former leader claims he is guaranteed for life.

Another court hearing is also due to take place in London later this year over other union benefits allegedly owed to Mr Scargill, including the cost of an alarm at his home in Barnsley, accountancy fees and his fuel allowance.

It was clear that Mr Scargill has lost none of his belligerence and repeatedly stood his ground in the face of questioning by the trust fund’s barrister.

An exasperated Mr Laddie said to him during the middle of one question and answer session: ‘You telling me I have answered the question is not actually the same as answering the question.’

The case continues.
