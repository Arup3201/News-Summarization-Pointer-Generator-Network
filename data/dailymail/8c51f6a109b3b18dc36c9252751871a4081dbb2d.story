Stuart Hall appeared before magistrates yesterday to deny allegations of sexually abusing young girls.

The veteran broadcaster looked drawn and grey – a shadow of his normal ebullient self – as he entered court to face three counts of indecent assault.

Wearing a dark suit and striped tie, the 82-year-old former It’s A Knockout host and BBC Radio 5 Live commentator said he was not guilty of all charges relating to three girls, aged between nine and 17.

The offences are alleged to have been committed over a ten-year period between 1974 and 1984.

Hall was arrested by police during a dawn swoop on his £1.5million detached home in Cheshire last month.

The broadcasting stalwart was then 
taken to a police station where he was questioned for several hours 
before being charged with three counts of indecent assault.

During his first court appearance, 
Hall was asked if he understood that he faced three separate charges of 
indecent assault and if he wanted to enter a plea.

He replied: ‘Yes I do. Not guilty to all three charges.’

Hall, who gave his full name, James 
Stuart Hall, was allowed to sit down in the witness box while further 
details of the charges were given at Preston Magistrates’ Court.

Joanne 
Cunliffe, prosecuting, said the case should be sent to crown court 
because the charges were too serious to be dealt with by magistrates.

Outlining the charges, she said Hall 
is alleged to have indecently assaulted one girl, then aged 16 or 17, 
between September 1, 1974 and December 31, 1974. The second charge 
alleges he indecently assaulted a nine-year-old girl between January 1, 
1983 and December 31, 1983.

Finally he faces a charge of indecent assault on a 13-year-old girl, on an occasion between July 1, 1984 and September 27, 1984.

None of the alleged victims can be named for legal reasons.

Louise Straw, defending, told 
District Judge Peter Ward there would be no objection to the case being 
sent to Preston Crown Court, where Hall will go on trial before a jury 
in April.

District Judge Ward granted Hall bail on condition that he 
lives at his home and that he has no unsupervised contact with children 
under the age of 17. ‘You do understand that?’ he asked Hall. ‘Yes, of 
course,’ the defendant replied.

Scrum: There was huge interest as the broadcaster British broadcaster walked to court

Hall, famed for his exuberant 
delivery and florid football match reports, left the court building 
after the brief hearing followed by TV cameras, photographers and 
reporters.

He was arrested on December 5 at the family home he shares with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, 74.

The couple, who have two grown-up 
children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local  
community where they carry out charity work.

Forensic officers from Lancashire 
Police spent hours searching their five-bedroom house on the edge of the
upmarket town of Wilmslow.

Following his arrest, the BBC said 
Hall would not be working at the corporation while he faced the 
allegations. Hall has been a familiar face and voice in British 
broadcasting for half a century and was last year awarded an OBE.

Exit: Mr Hall leaves Preston Magistrates Court having pleaded not guilty to all charges yesterday

Along the way, the veteran 
broadcaster has earned ‘national treasure’ status – not least for his 
over- excitable commentaries on It’s A Knockout.

The broadcaster’s arrest came as the BBC continues to deal with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile sex-abuse scandal.

Police confirmed the arrest did not 
form part of Operation Yewtree – the investigation into alleged sexual 
offences by Savile and others.

Following his arrest Hall condemned the police decision to carry out a dawn raid at his home.

At the time his solicitor, Miss 
Straw, expressed anger saying her client should not have had to suffer 
the humiliation of being arrested at his family home in the early hours 
of the morning.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
