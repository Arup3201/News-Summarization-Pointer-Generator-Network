The mother of an eight-year-old boy receiving radiotherapy for a brain tumour has said his spirit has been crushed by the treatment.

Sally Roberts told ITV’s Daybreak programme that Neon’s co-ordination had been affected by the cancer treatment and her son was 'feeling pretty rubbish', despite doctors telling her he was on the mend.

Ms Roberts, a New Zealander living in Brighton, East Sussex, appeared on the television show ahead of a documentary, You’re Killing My Son: The Mum Who Went On The Run, which will be shown on Channel 4 tonight.

Sally Roberts told ITV's Daybreak programme that Neon's co-ordination had been affected by the cancer treatment and her son was 'feeling pretty rubbish', despite doctors telling her he was on the mend

Footage shown on Daybreak showed Neon’s father Ben telling documentary-makers that his wife, from whom he is separated, kidnapped his son and took him on the run 'at a time when he needed critical treatment'.

Ms Roberts, 38, lost a legal battle to stop her son receiving radiotherapy treatment, which she believed would cause Neon to suffer long-term harm, after the removal of the tumour last October.

Doctors argued that her son would die within three months if he did not receive the treatment.

Following the ruling, Ms Roberts and her son disappeared but were found four days later.

Ms Roberts told Daybreak she still believed that there were alternative treatments for her son which would not have such a damaging effect on him.

She said: 'I think his co-ordination and his spirit have been crushed. He’s very much feeling pretty rubbish.'

She said that although doctors have told her Neon is doing well, she found it a 'strange description'.

She said: 'He’s hiding away from the world, always building dens around himself.

'The treatment itself is a carcinogenic immuno-suppressor for salt on the body. There are a multitude of other treatments out there.

'I have mentioned before the proton therapy for less invasive treatment. That does not do nearly as much damage to the surrounding tissue. It is more targeted, more localised, and does not do the whole brain.'

Ms Roberts said she felt she and her son had been railroaded into the treatment offered by the NHS and there were other medical experts out there who could help.

She said: 'I was contacted by a proton therapy expert from the States who was willing to take him (Neon) on.'

Presenter Kate Garraway said: 'This therapy has the same sort of statistical results of success, does it, as the one that’s used by the NHS to treat this kind of problem?'

Ms Roberts replied: 'Yes, that’s right. It will be used from 2017 and the population here is less than somewhere like America or China where they are using it already.'
