A Florida dog owner is begging for the public's help to find her ill nine-year-old Yorkshire terrier after the dog was reportedly stolen during a mugging.

Damica Clark says her dog, India, needs regular treatment for an intestinal infection if she is to stay healthy.

The dog was taken when her brother, Darren, offered to walk India while Clark was working double-shift Monday.

Darren told NBC Miami an unidentified man pulled a gun on him while he was walking the dog home from Young's Circle.

'He tried to sell me whatever he had on him. I didn’t know what. I figured 
cigarettes or what not,' Darren told reporters. 'But I just bypassed the whole 
ordeal. ‘Sorry sir, I’m not interested,’ and kept it moving.'

As Darren tried to pass, the man pressed a pistol into his side and told him to empty his pockets. 

'I didn’t have any cash on hand so he took my two cell 
phones and my sister’s dog,' he said.

The man then fled in an SUV.

He may have stolen the dog expecting it to draw a good price, as the breed can be costly.

Clark said she only hoped the man 'isn't abusing (India) and treats her well. She's really sick right now.

'It’s part of our family. It’s been here for like eight years. Pets become a part of our family.'

A Facebook group, Bring Home India, has also been set up to help with the search. 

'Please keep 
your spirits up & don't stress yourself,' Clark wrote on the page. 'I won't stop searching for 
you. If we never see each other again on this earth, I know in my heart 
that all dogs go to heaven, & we'll be reunited again one day. 
Cuddled up & smothering each other like we always do.'
