Celtic have issued a firm denial on behalf of winger Aleksandar Tonev after the Bulgarian was accused of racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan during his debut for the Scottish champions.

The 24-year-old international is facing a Scottish FA probe after being reported by the Dons for an alleged incident during Saturday's 2-1 Premiership win for Ronny Deila's side at Parkhead.

The pair were direct opponents for much of the match and Englishman Logan is understood to have told referee Bobby Madden that Tonev said to him: 'Get your hands off me, you black c***.'

The SFA are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on Monday

But Tonev vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by manager Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins. And on Sunday night a Celtic spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have spoken to the player and he has stated that the accusation made is not true.'

Logan, 26, was left so incensed by the alleged confrontation with Tonev that after alerting Madden he also directed Dons skipper Mark Reynolds to take up the matter formally with the match official. 

He then informed his manager Derek McInnes, with the Aberdeen management team alerting fourth official Crawford Allan as well as Celtic to the allegation.

The alleged incident will be mentioned in Madden's report which is due to arrive on the desk of new SFA Compliance Officer Tony McGlennan at Hampden on Monday. It is also expected to feature prominently in the report by SPFL delegate John Connelly.

It is alleged that Tonev called the Aberdeen defender a 'black c***' during the game at Celtic Park

Both Logan and Tonev, as well as opposing managers Deila and McInnes, are now likely to be contacted by the SFA's Disciplinary Department, as well as Madden.

The SFA's Disciplinary Department would then investigate before deciding whether or not there were grounds to issue a Notice of Complaint against Tonev. They confirmed the disciplinary process would only begin when Madden's report is received.

But with Tonev denying the claim, unless the alleged exchange was witnessed by another player or caught on camera it is likely to remain a case of one man's word against another.

Aberdeen privately accept that they Aleksandar Tonev is unlikely to be found guilty without more evidence

Celtic said on Sunday night that Aleksandar Tonev 'has stated that the accusation made is not true'

Aberdeen declined to comment ahead of a potential SFA investigation but Sportsmail understands they privately accept it may be hard to prove Logan's claim. A source close to the club on Sunday added that they felt obliged to take their player's word and report his complaint.

Celtic signed Tonev on a one-year loan from Paul Lambert's Aston Villa last month and have an option to buy him permanently next summer. 

He is expected to be part of the squad who travel to Austria this week for Thursday's Europa League clash with Salzburg.

Aleksandar Tonev is still expected to travel to Salzburg for Celtic's Europa League tie on Thursday 

He had to wait until Saturday to make his debut after recovering from a groin injury and played for 70 minutes before being replaced by Nir Biton.

Fraser Wishart, chief executive of PFA Scotland, said it would be 'inappropriate to comment at this time' because the incident could result in an investigation by the SFA.
