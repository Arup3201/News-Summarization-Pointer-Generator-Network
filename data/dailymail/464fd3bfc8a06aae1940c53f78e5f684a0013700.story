Sunbathing in Barbados, ringing in the New Year in New York with Rihanna... and posing with hounds and horses for a high fashion campaign. It's just another week in the colourful life of supermodel Cara Delevingne.

The 21-year-old has kicked off 2014 in style as the star of Mulberry's SS14 campaign, where she posed alongside a veritable menagerie of furry friends.

Shot by Tim Walker in Shotover House, an 18th century country mansion in Oxfordshire, Cara looks fresh-faced as she poses in an array of feminine dresses armed with the fashion house's luxury arm candy.

Mulberry describe the shoot as 'a charming English tea party, with a Mulberry twist and some unexpected guests including a Parson’s Jack Russell, a Patterdale Terrier and a Great Dane, a pelican, two cockatoos, a tortoise and a little white (and very greedy) pony.'

Speaking about the campaign, art director Cooke Newhouse said: 'The spring 2014 campaign was a beautiful but naughty tea party with Cara and her ark of animals - the perfect Mulberry moment.

'They didn’t have the best table manners, but Cara was very forgiving.'

Cara, who is well known in the industry for her quirky personality, even poses with a parrot on her shoulder in one of the shots.

A spokesperson for Mulberry said: 'I don’t think I have ever been on a shoot with so much talent in the room…and I am not talking about our animal friends!

'Tim Walker’s vision gives a romantic, literary and very British feel to the Mulberry brand and Cara has more spirit, true beauty and warmth than you could ever hope for: charisma with a capital C!'

This isn't the first time the model has posed for the British brand - she was also the face of their AW13 campaign and walked in their SS14 show at London Fashion Week.

Speaking to Grazia Daily at the time, the London-born model said: 'Mulberry is such a great label. As well as being an iconic brand, the products are sexy and cool.'

And it seems that Cara is keen to follow in the footsteps of fellow clothes horse Alexa Chung, who had a Mulberry satchel named after her.

'My favourite Mulberry bag would be the Cara bag…actually that hasn’t been made yet! I want to design a Mulberry bag, there needs to be a Cara bag.

'I have so many ideas, Mulberry need to call me. And they have to let me design trainers too!', she added.

The next Alexa? Like Miss Chung, Cara has revealed that she wants to design her own handbag for the brand

It has been a busy few months for fashion's favourite face. Aside from her modelling duties, she is currently filming Michael Winterbottom's film The Face Of An Angel in Italy.

She took some much-needed time off over Chiristmas to holiday with her family in Barbados before flying to New York to ring in the New Year with her good friend Rihanna.

The pair headed to the 40/40 club owned by Jay-Z, which is located near Madison Square Park in lower Manhattan.
