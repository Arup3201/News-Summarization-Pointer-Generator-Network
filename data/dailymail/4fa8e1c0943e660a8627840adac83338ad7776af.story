A family of wild African elephants has taken up residence in a Florida citrus grove.The National Elephant Center in Fellesmere opened earlier this year and the 225-acre facility became home to a family group of elephants: two mature females, Thandi and Moyo, and two adolescent males, Tufani and Tsavo, the offspring of Thandi, in May.The center aims to provide a home to any elephant in need and one day will be home to up to 45 elephants.

The site has been created especially for elephants, with water holes and habitats idea for foraging and mud-wallowing - two popular elephant activities.

The abundance of citrus fruit doesn't hurt, either.

Formerly a citrus plantation, there are juicy oranges ripe for the picking all over the site.

John Lehnhardt, the executive director of the center, says Moyo was the first to discover the fruit.

'She sucked the orange to the end of her trunk, which is really part of their nose, and she picked it from the tree, put it in her mouth, and I just saw her eyes light up like, "Oh my,"' Lehnhardt told NBC.Â 

'They all started picking oranges like crazy.'

Thandi and Moyo have been best friends since they were both orphaned by poachers as calves in Zimbabwe in the 1980s.

Lehnhardt says the friendship has helped them deal with the 'enormous trauma' the pair has endured.

After their families were killed, Thandi and Moyo were sold to a Washington zoo in 1983 before being sold on to Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1997.

According to NBC, Disney allowed the four elephants to move to the National Elephant Center so that they could enjoy time together as a family before Tufani, 10, leaves the herd.

Male elephants separate from their herds as teenagers or are pushed out by the family matriarch.

Lehnhardt says the center will be a home for aging elephants from zoos around the country, but unlike a zoo, the center is not open to the public.

'We just want elephants to be elephants. They are family oriented. They're honest and straightforward. We should learn from them,' he told NBC.

The Center for Conservation Biology reports that elephants in Africa are being killed as a rate of 35,000 to 50,000 per year for their ivory.
