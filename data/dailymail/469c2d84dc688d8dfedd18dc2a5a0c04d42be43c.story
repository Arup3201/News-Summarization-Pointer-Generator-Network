Comedienne Margaret Cho was a prominent face at the 2015 Golden Globes, but not as herself.

The Korean-American showed up repeatedly, alongside her co-host pals Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, in character as a North Korean general with a penchant for American entertainment.

The general even got a photo op with Hollywood living legend Meryl Streep. But it couldn't save the bit from sparking outrage and ridicule.

'Still not funny. The Asian stereotyping bit still old, even pretending to be North Korean. Worst bit of the night,' tweeted @DaveSaitzyk. 

And his was just one of countless posts denouncing the bit.

Too far? Margeret Cho appeared on the 2015 Golden Globes as a cartoonish North Korean general in love American entertainment named Cho Yung Ja

Stoking controversy? As Cho Yung Ja, Ms. Cho demands a photo opportunity with Meryl Streep, who gamely stands with the faux soldier and smiles for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton

There were giggles from Keira Knightley and Jack Black (right) but Salma Hayek did not look amused (left behind Meryl Streep) during the skit

It began at the top of the show when Fey and Poehler introduced the general.

‘The Hollywood Foreign Association comprises journalists from all around the globe and we would like to now introduce you to our newest HFPA member. A contributor to Movies Wow magazine and a North Korean army general; Cho Yung Ja. Welcome.’

Movies Wow, it turns out, features none other than supreme leader and the alleged vengeful mind behind the recent Sony email hacks--Kim Jong-un.

As Cho Yung Ja, Ms Cho demanded a photo opportunity with Streep, who gamely stood with the faux soldier and smiled for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton.

From behind, actor Benedict Cumberbatch leapt up for a photobomb.

After the snap is taken, Fey said: ‘Thank you, crisis averted. God Bless.’ 

In a room full of movie stars - many affected by the embarrassing Sony hack - it all seemed like good fun. But then the Twitter reaction came. 

The Korean-American actress and comedian was called out on Twitter following the Sony-hack inspired bit

Cho has long imitated her South Korean immigrant mother, but some viewers were appalled by her act on Sunday night

Adding a bit of flare to her act, Cho goose-stepped off-stage following the second Cho Yung Ja bit

'I've always loved margaret cho but she needs to stop shuckin' for white folk,' wrote @LordeBarrington.

@HoJoLego agreed: 'This is the worst Margaret Cho joke ever. #GoldenGlobes'

As did @BougieBlackGurl: 'Margaret Cho that was freaking awful. Is she going to shuck and jive too? #GoldenGlobes #whenthechecksstopcoming.'

The tweets kept coming. Thanks for the eager naysayers, the Cho Yung Ja sketch did, too.

Later in the show, Cho appeared onstage in costume and shared her thoughts on the lesbian plot line between Orange Is The New Black characters Alex and Piper, calling their relationship 'very toxic'.

Margaret Cho had previously appeared in Tina Fey's creation 30 Rock as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and his son Kim Jong-Un in 2011 (Cho is pictured left with Fey and right, with Tracy Morgan)

Cho appeared in 30 Rock in 2011, the NBC comedy series created by Tina Fey. The 46-year-old actress played North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il in one episode for which she received an Emmy nominaton for Outstanding Guest Actress.

She popped up again on 30 Rock, this time as the Supreme Leader's son, Kim Jong-Un.

She then proceeded to goose-step off stage. And as their final act in their final Golden Globe hosting gig together, Fey and Poehler even gave Cho the last words of the entire show. 

'Show over. I host next year. Good night,' she said in character as Cho Yung Ja while credits rolled.
