The Health and Social Care Bill will 'significantly curtail' public access to information, particularly about the private sector, campaigners have warned.

The Campaign for Freedom of Information has written to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley outlining how the Bill will restrict access to information about the activity of private companies working under NHS contracts.

While the NHS bodies commissioning services will be subject to the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act, those bodies providing services will not, it says.

A commissioning body can demand information from a private company to help them answer FoI requests, but only on specific details already laid down in the contract between the NHS and the independent provider.

Campaign director Maurice Frankel said: 'Suppose there is concern about the use of potentially contaminated medical supplies by hospitals.

'For an NHS hospital, the FoI Act could be used to obtain details of stocks of the product, the number of doses administered, the numbers of affected patients, the quality control measures in place...

'This level of information would clearly not be available in relation to independent providers treating NHS patients.

'This would represent a major loss of existing information rights.'

It has come on the same day that Professor Chris Ham, Chief Executive of the King's Fund, has warned the health changes are 'high risk.'

'It's a very complex set of charges, which are quite high risk in our view at a time where there are reall financial pressures in the health service,' the health charity chief told the BBC.

He said the NHS faced a number of risks over the next two to three years as the bill would turn the health service 'upside down.'

Meanwhile, campaigners say NHS bodies could lose out to independent providers during the early stages of the reforms because they will have to disclose their track record on treating patients while independents will not.

'NHS bodies would be forced to disclose any poor performance, while equally poorly performing independent providers may simply appear to have a blank sheet.

'The principle of patient choice would also be undermined by such unequal disclosure requirements.'

The campaign says independent providers should be subject to the FoI Act in the same way as the NHS.

Otherwise, separate FoI requests would have to be made to each of the commissioning bodies with whom a provider has a contract.

A request may then be refused on cost grounds, where the cost of investigating rises above Â£450.
