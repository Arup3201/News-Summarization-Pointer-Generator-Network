A 22-year-old fisherman has been sentenced to 18 months' probation after unsuccessfully trying to produce counterfeit money using three everyday items: napkins, a glue stick and an oven.

Cass Alder, from Prince Edward Island, Canada, purchased a packet of table napkins emblazoned with images of his country's $100 bills and cut out the pictures of the money, a court heard.

He then pasted the images to pieces of paper using glue, before briefly baking the fraudulent notes in the oven. This was to ensure the bits of napkin were firmly stuck to the paper, it was said.

Then, Alder attempted to spend one of the bills at a local convenience store. However, his plan was foiled when a clerk realized that the bill was forged and contacted the police, as Alder fled the scene.

Now, the young man, from Lennox Island, has been handed a suspended sentence for counterfeiting the $100 notes. He has also been sentenced to 60 days in jail for another fraudulent scheme.

In the latter scam, Alder, who lists his job as a 'lobster fisherman' on his Facebook page, reportedly cheated H&R Block out of $5,267 of CAD (or $4,216.64 in USD) using a fraudulent tax form.

Both of the charges date back to 2013, according to People magazine.

At the time, drugs were said to be a 'serious issue' in Alder's life. However, during his sentencing, the former student at Charlottetown Rural High School told the court he has since turned his life around.

'It took me a long time to realize I deserved better than this for myself,' said Alder, who is now in a long-term relationship and apparently has a 'strong support network' in his home community.

Alder was one of several people who obtained returns they were not entitled to using the fake T4s, The Guardian reported. Half of the money was paid to the person who gave Alder the form.

Alder was ordered by Chief Provincial Court Judge John Douglas to make restitution to H&R Block for half of the amount he received. The remaining half will be paid by the person behind the form.
