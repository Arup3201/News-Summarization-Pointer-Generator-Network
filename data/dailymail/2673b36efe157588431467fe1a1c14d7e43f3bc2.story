European football has been as much a curse as a blessing for Celtic this season yet perhaps this deserved if somewhat fortuitous victory will finally nail the theory that Ronny Deila’s side are incapable of fighting a battle on two fronts.

It was by no means the perfect display from the Champions — truthfully we’ve yet to witness that under the Norwegian — yet for the first time in five attempts they at least succeeded in winning a league game immediately following a European match.

It would, however, be impossible not to dwell on how different the outcome might have been had Allan Johnston’s side maintained a full quota of players for more than 34 minutes.

Manuel Pascali’s ordering off for pulling down the again impressive John Guidetti looked fully deserved, but it effectively ended the highly impressive challenge from the Ayrshiremen in the opening half-hour.

To compound the dismissal, not only was the majestic Alexei Eremenko immediately withdrawn but Guidetti scored the consequent free-kick with aplomb. Deila’s men rarely looked back from that point.

Celtic’s victory not only capped arguably the best week of Deila’s tenure but may also prove to be the day in which his seemingly slavish devotion to a 4-2-3-1 system ended.

With Anthony Stokes and Kris Commons injured, Deila played both Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic in a more orthodox 4-4-2. Not only did both strikers score, those around them looked far more at ease with the shape.

In taking his goal tally to five in seven matches, Guidetti is fast becoming the kind of hero Celtic fans have craved for so long. Not that the on-loan Manchester City man was of a mood to pat himself on the back too much.

‘I’m happy with the team performance but I feel I should have scored at least one more because I hit the post and the keeper made two good saves,’ said the Swede. ‘You can say I was unlucky but I wanted one more.

‘I want to score as many goals as I can. I have five in seven and three assists, so I’m happy with that.

‘Once they had the player sent off, we knew we would have a lot of the ball.

‘I was looking at the goal difference and, if we win our game in hand, we will be top of the league, which I think these fans deserve.’

Undefeated in five league matches, Kilmarnock arrived in the East End with the possibility of going joint-top of the table and there was a boldness to them from the outset.

Eremenko’s beautifully floated ball over the top seemed to hold up perfectly for Tope Obadeyi but he did not appear to have the legs or the stomach for a one-on-one with Craig Gordon.

As Celtic struggled to settle, Killie pressed them high up the park, forcing three corners before the hosts had one.

When Stefan Johansen was finally tasked with such a delivery, his execution was accurate. Scepovic out-jumped Pascali at the near post but flashed his header into the side-netting. It served to awake Celtic from their slumbers.

Playing on the right of a more orthodox middle four, Callum McGregor accelerated to the byeline and hung up a cross for Wakaso Mubarak. Conor Brennan in the Killie goal was not troubled by the header.

Eremenko was intent in displaying his full skill set. A rasping 30-yard strike had Gordon at full stretch but Pascali’s folly would render that the Finn’s last meaningful involvement.

The Kilmarnock skipper had looked in a foul mood from the outset, nipping away at Guidetti in particular both on and off the ball.

Perhaps as a consequence, his concentration levels were not what they should have been when McGregor attempted to laser a pass to Guidetti.

Caught the wrong side of his man, Pascali dragged him to the ground on the edge of the box and was already walking by the time Willie Collum dipped into his top pocket.

Eremenko was immediately replaced with Lee Ashcroft but the punishment for the visitors would be two-fold.

Guidetti liked what he saw from the set-piece and went for power as well as placement to rocket the ball around the wall and away from Brennan.

What a catastrophic 60 seconds for Johnston’s men. With that, Celtic were truly up and running.

Guidetti’s sublime turn on the edge of the box saw him bullet a shot down Brennan’s throat but the keeper parried at the cost of a corner.

Before the break, McGregor narrowly missed the target with a flashing strike on the turn then Wakaso drilled the ball a foot wide of the same post from 25 yards. For the visitors, a second half of playing percentages lay in store.

A combination of good fortune and Celtic’s profligacy kept Killie in the hunt. Guidetti thumped the upright, then was left cursing Brennan as he dived to thwart him 30 seconds later.

McGregor failed to punish a handling error by the keeper by only finding the side-netting then Scepovic miscued his shot after being teed up by Wakaso.

Redemption for the Serb was not long in coming, though.

Emilio Izaguirre’s dead-weight ball down the left found Wakaso, whose cross at pace could not have been better with Scepovic applying a sumptuous finish to take the game out of Kilmarnock’s grasp.
