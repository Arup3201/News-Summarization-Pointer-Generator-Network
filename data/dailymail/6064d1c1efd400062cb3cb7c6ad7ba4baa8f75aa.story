'We felt so happy and so special because we didn't really expect that,' Sophia's mother Rossio Sandoval reportedly told ABC News.

'It is so awesome because I know a lot of people who see this will see that my daughter is kicking cancer, and maybe it will help others.' 

Sophia, who is keen superhero fan,  was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in May last year after her mother became concerned about her lack of balance.
