A former Oklahoma teacher has been charged with rape for allegedly having sex with at least two of her students last year.

Laura Cowan, 35, of Frederick, was charged last Wednesday with three counts of second degree rape.

The same charges were filed against the former Tipton Public Schools educator last July, but in early December a judge threw out the case against Cowan after key witnesses could not be found by the prosecution.

Bad teacher: Laura Cowan, 35, a former Oklahoma high school teacher and mother of one, has been charged with three counts of rape for allegedly having sex with two students 

Cowan, who has a Master's degree in education from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, started her teaching career in 2010 at Davidson Public Schools.

In 2012, she was hired by Tipton Public Schools, where she remained for two years until her resignation last April, reported NewsOK.

Investigators say Cowan, the mother of a college-age daughter, admitted to repeatedly having sex with two of her students in various locations, including in her classroom at Tipton High School.

Law enforcement officials first learned of the rape allegations against Laura Cowan in April when Tipton Public Schools Superintendent Shane Boothe contacted police and the Tillman County Sheriff's Office about a possible 'inappropriate relationship' between the teacher and one of her students.

According to an affidavit prepared in July and obtained by the Frederick Press-Leader, during an interview with police Cowan described having sex with a student in her car during Spring Break 2014.

The court document stated that the former teacher also admitted to sleeping with another teenager last January in a Frederick hotel and in her vehicle.

She turned herself in to the sheriff's office July 23, 2014, and immediately posted $150,000 bond.

During a preliminary hearing in December, key witnesses failed to show up in court to testify against Cowan, prompting the presiding judge to dismiss the case.

However, prosecutors were given the option to refile the charges against the ex-teacher, which they chose to exercise last week.
