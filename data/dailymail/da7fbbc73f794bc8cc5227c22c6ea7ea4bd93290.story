Two-tiered system: Patrons could soon pay up to $1 for a 'regular' letter and up to $2 for a 'priority' letter

Australia Post is set to drastically increase the cost of postage stamps by 40 cents to $1 - and if you want the parcel to be delivered the next day you'll be forced to pay $2.

The national mail service will hike prices as part of a new two-tiered system, with the 'regular' letter service costing $1 instead of 60 cents.

Those letters will arrive later than the $2 'priority' service, which means you have to pay a full dollar more for high-priority correspondence.

It comes after Australia Post announced a shocking half-year loss of $151 million, a drop of 56 per cent. 

The Abbott government is getting ready to soften the regulations that govern Australia Post in order for this two-tiered process to be functional.

This reform would see that pensioners and concession card holders would continue to pay the standard 60c. 

Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour says reform - such as introducing a two-tiered pricing for its letters - is vital. 

The government is expected to announce its support of the motion in coming weeks.

During last weeks ABC Television's Q&A program, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said politicians need to move beyond slogans and do a better jobs at explaining complex reforms such as this one. 

Mr Turnbull then interviewed the Managing Director of the Boston Consulting Group, Nick Glenning, for his own YouTube channel.

Looking at a loss: If Australia Post does not act, it is expected they will lose $10 billion in the coming years 

The interview was uploaded to YouTube on the same day as Australia Post announced a further steep drop-off in residential mail volumes, and asked the government to support a delivery overhaul, calling the letter results 'not pretty'.

'While Australia Post as a whole has still made a profit... the growing letters loss is being subsidised, or covered by, the profit in parcels and retail,' Glenning said.

'That's not going to last for much longer and without change the company is heading for an overall loss.'

Turnbull quizzed Glenning on the increasing of stamp costs and reducing the frequency of delivery runs to cut costs in overseas postal services who have faced the same collapse. 

'The parcel market is growing, particularly where people can order things from retail eCommerce,' Glenning said.

'However, it is a highly competitive and capital intensive business.' 

Turnbull reaffirmed Glenning's points by stating that Australia's parcel business is benefiting from the eCommerce boom, but the parcel business is competitive and letters is a monopoly. 

Glenning went on to say that big players are appearing in the market with services like Japan Post and Singapore Post investing several hundred million dollars every few years to maintain a competitive position. 

Pensioners and concession card holders will continue to pay the standard 60c under the new reform

On being asked how much money Australia Post would lose if they did not act, Glenning told Turnbull it was an estimated $10 billion in the letters business overall with the losses getting bigger and bigger.

Malcolm Turnbull's 'Tech Talk: Reforming Australia Post' has attracted over 300 views since Monday. 

Australia Post is to face a grilling in a senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday.

The Communications Electrical Plumbing Union has said it would support sensible reforms on the condition that it's upfront with its staff and customers.
