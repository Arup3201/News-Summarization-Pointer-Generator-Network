Looking very different to her tough Nike shoot, Karlie Kloss left little to the imagination in their plunging gowns at the De Grisogono Crazy Skull watch party in Paris last week , demonstrating her versatility as a model

It also blends the old with the new,  featuring pieces like a neoprene jacket that is crafted with ‘60s-era couture tailoring techniques but made with Dri-FIT mesh which pulls sweat away from the skin.

The statuesque blonde sported a very different look last week when she attended launch of the De Grisogono 'Crazy Skull' watch in Paris in a floor length black gown slashed to the navel.   

Showing her chameleon-like ability to adapt top very different looks, Karlie swept her blonde hair in tousled waves to one side and opted for blue eyeliner to accentuate her grey eyes.
