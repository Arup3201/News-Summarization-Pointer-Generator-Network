Luxury: Sue in her top-of-the range kitchen which she had built to make life 'more comfortable'

When Sue Pickard discovered she had terminal cancer she vowed to make the most of the 18 months doctors said she had left to live.

The grandmother-of-three used a £30,000 insurance pay-out to fulfill her 'bucket list' of final wishes.

She splashed out £10,000 doing up her home in Bedworth, Warwickshire and thousands of pounds on a flat-screen TV and luxury sofas. The 47-year-old even piled on four stone eating in expensive restaurants.

But then she was given another bombshell - she was told the cancer had vanished.

She was understandably 'thrilled' but added: 'I just thought to myself ''My God I've spent £30,000 and I'm the size of a house".'

Mrs Pickard, who has two grown-up daughters, worked full time at a GP surgery before she was diagnosed with cancer.

Doctors discovered a three-inch tumour in her cervix in February last year.

After a CT scan doctors found the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.

Sue began gruelling chemotherapy sessions three times a week days after 
her diagnosis and also underwent 10 weeks of radiotherapy this summer.

Sue said: 'The consultant said he was really sorry but he estimated I had between 12 and 18 months left.

'I was absolutely devastated and didn't know what to do. I just sat and sobbed.'

Her and her husband Tony, 54, received the payout having taken out critical care cover on their mortgage years earlier.

They forked out on holidays and spent £900 a month eating out every night at restaurants and pubs.

In just a few months she had ballooned in weight after piling on nearly four stone until she tipped the scales at 19 stone 11lbs.

But in September, just weeks before she was expected to die, doctors told Sue her radiotherapy and chemotherapy had worked and the cancer had vanished.

The mother-of-two said: 'I was shell-shocked when the doctors told me I wasn't going to die.

'I was thrilled but I just thought to myself ''My God I've spent £30,000 and I'm the size of a house. I couldn't believe it, I'd prepared myself for death and even planned what songs to play at my funeral.

'After I was diagnosed with cancer I 
had chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and reduce the tumour but I 
always thought it might only give me a few months more.

'Tony and I decided to enjoy every last second we had left together so blew the money on eating out and holidays.

'Me and Tony always loved pub meals so ate out all the time. We went away in our caravan most weekends and lived it up. I would always have chips and we'd have curries, fish and chips and chicken in the basket seven days a week.'

She added: 'The money was supposed to cover the mortgage repayments in the event of either me or Tony getting critically ill.

'Tony told me he wanted me to enjoy my last few months. All our family agreed and we just spent it all.

'I didn't cook once, we just went out to the pub or restaurant or got takeaways.

'I didn't care about putting the weight on because in my mind I was going to die anyway so what was the point of dieting?

'I even gave my bike away just indulged myself by eating lots of food I enjoyed.'

Sue was given the surprising 
all-clear in September and doctors told her she does not need any 
further treatment but must have a check-up every three months to ensure 
the cancer does not return.

She has now enlisted the help of 
hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, who runs Bridge Therapy Clinic in 
Coventry, to help her lose the weight.

He said: 'Sue has already overcome incredible odds to beat terminal cancer so losing weight will not be a problem for her.

'She is absolutely motivated and wants to succeed which is half the battle.'

As well as eating and drinking out every night of the week they spent £10,000 building a new conservatory on their home.

They also forked out on scores of mini-breaks in their caravan.

Sue said: 'When I was diagnosed with cancer I left my job and Tony just said ''right lets go and enjoy ourselves''.

'I wasn't able to go too far because the chemotherapy did tire me but we went all over the country in our caravan.

'We loved going to the Dorset coast, Cornwall and especially Skegness and Wales.

'It didn't matter what the weather was like, every Friday we'd jump in the car and tow the caravan to a different campsite.

'We ate out all the time too, we must have eaten in over a hundred different restaurants and pubs.

'I love travelling and going away with Tony and our family every weekend helped take my mind off the cancer.

'I wanted to cram as much happiness into my last few months as possible.

'I saw sunsets and sunrises all over the country and basically indulged myself with food and pleasure.

'One of my favourite times was when we stayed on a farm near our home and the sheep were lambing.

'I had always wanted to hold a newborn lamb and my husband told the farmer and he let me hold one.

'It was magical and I just thought this would be the last chance I would have to do things like this.'
