A masterpiece painting by Marc Chagall which was found in the flat of a reclusive hoarder was stolen by the Nazis from a Jewish family when they were forced to flee to the U.S., it was reported today.

The precise origins of many of the 1,400 artworks discovered at the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of a Nazi-era art dealer, have so far remained unclear, prompting a massive official investigation.

But a German newspaper used official documents to link a previously unknown work by Chagall to Savely Blumstein, a German-Jewish man who lived in Latvia.

'Our father often spoke about the Chagall and other artworks that were stolen by the Nazis,' Mr Blumstein's sons Neil and Philip told Bild.

Experts value the work by the Russian-French early modernist painter, who died in 1985, at up to €1million (£840,000).

The 'Allegorical Scene' from the mid-1920s was one of the works suspected to have been looted by the Nazis found in 2012 in Mr Gurlitt's Munich apartment.

Hildebrand Gurlitt, father of the elderly recluse, was an art dealer who acquired an extraordinary haul of masterpieces throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

The Nazi regime apparently commissioned him to sell art which was deemed 'degenerate', or which had been either stolen or bought under duress from Jewish collectors.

The Chagall work was of 'particularly high art-historical value', said the art expert aiding the police investigation, Meike Hoffmann, when the haul was revealed last month.

Bild reported that the Gestapo stole all the Blumsteins' property in 1941, after Savely had fled to the U.S. with his brother Salomon.

In 1957 they filed a compensation claim for all their family's stolen art, eventually receiving 25,000 deutschmarks (around £10,500) in 1981.

Savely Blumstein died in 2009, but Bild tracked down his sons Neil, 57, and Philip, 53, after finding the compensation papers in state archives in Berlin.

Hildebrand Gurlitt claimed he received the painting as a gift in 1943.
