The lawyer for a mother arrested after the bodies of three infants were found in her home said today he believed a basement boarder was the woman's boyfriend and fathered all the children - before rubbishing claims that the man was unaware of the horrific conditions upstairs.

Lawyer Keith Halpern also said that he's optimistic forensic testing will show the babies weren't born alive, and therefore weren't harmed or killed by his client.

Erika Murray, 31, was charged on Friday with fetal death concealment and other counts after authorities found the bodies in her squalid, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, a town near the Rhode Island border and about 50 miles southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. 

A medical examiner is determining whether the remains were newborns or fetuses, and how they died. One body still had the placenta attached.  

The lawyer for Erika Murray, 31, (pictured on Friday) said that he's optimistic that forensic testing will prove the three dead babies found at her Massachusetts home last week were not harmed or killed 

Her alleged boyfriend, who has not been named, told investigators that he was unaware of the horrific circumstances throughout the rest of the home. 

Mr Halpern told the Boston Herald: 'He lived in the house — they shared a bedroom... He did not live exclusively in the basement. ... I think the notion that he barricaded himself in the basement and did not know what the rest of the house looked like is absurd.' 

Two weeks ago, state officials took custody of Murray's four children, aged six months to 13 years, after discovering the dirty conditions of the home - which prosecutors and neighbors said included soiled diapers piled up 2 feet high and the remains of a cat and a dog. 

One wall had to be knocked down due to feces contamination.  

Authorities found the bodies of the babies last week after getting a search warrant.

Mr Halpern said he's hopeful the tests will show the dead infants were stillborn. He also expects DNA testing to show that Murray and her longtime boyfriend were the parents of the infants.

'I … am eager to see whether the forensic testing confirms that in fact the children that are deceased … were never born alive,' Halpern said.

Halpern told The Boston Globe in an earlier interview that Murray secretly gave birth to her two youngest children because she was scared, after her boyfriend told her he didn't want any more children after their first two.

He told the newspaper Murray tried to conceal from her boyfriend the fact that the two youngest children were hers, and apparently told him she was babysitting them.

Halpern said Murray was fearful during the five pregnancies, including the ones of her two youngest children and the dead infants. 

He said it's wasn't clear to him how much of the fear was attributable to the mental illness he believes Murray has and how much was due to real-life concerns.

'Try to imagine the kind of fear and sort of loss of control over your life that would lead a woman to give birth to a child alone on the floor of her bathroom. That's was she was going through,' Halpern said, but didn't elaborate on which child or children he was referring to.

'This terror just controlled her. She couldn't figure out how to get out of the prison she created for herself.

'She is clearly mentally ill,' he said, 'because the lengths to which she went to try to hide these children … no one in their right mind would have done this.'

Halpern declined to discuss Murray's relationship with her boyfriend and whether she was scared because she believed he would harm her. He also declined to comment when asked what Murray told him about the three dead babies.

The boyfriend hasn't been charged in connection with the dead infants or the conditions in the home, where he also lived.

The children first came to the attention of police two weeks ago when a ten-year-old boy who lived in the house went to a neighbor and asked, 'How do you get a baby to stop crying?' said Tim Connolly, a spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr.

The neighbor went with the boy and found the crying baby covered in feces, but no adults around.

Police were called and notified the state Department of Children and Families, which removed the four children - ages 13, ten, three and six months - from the home. Murray was then charged with two counts of reckless endangerment, and the house was condemned.

Based on interviews with the two older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house. 

Officers found the remains of three babies, one in a closet on Wednesday and two others on Thursday.

Community members planned a vigil for Sunday evening to show support for Murray's children.

Prosecutors said the home was piled with two-feet stacks of soiled diapers and the remains of several animals were also found.
