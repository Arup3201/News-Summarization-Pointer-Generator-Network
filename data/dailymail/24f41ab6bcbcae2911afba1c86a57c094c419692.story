Supermarket bread contains 20 per cent less salt than it did a decade ago, according to new research.

Some of the most popular branded products also trail supermarket's own packaged loaves, with less than half meeting Government guidelines on what is a healthy amount.

And a group of scientists behind a new study insist that more work needs to be done to drive down the amount of salt in our bread and help lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Health boost: Supermarket own brand breads contain 20 per cent less salt than they did a decade ago, according to new research

Bread is the biggest contributor of dietary salt in the UK, providing almost a fifth of the total derived from processed foods.

The recommended daily intake for UK adults is a maximum of 6g, compared with the current average of 8.1g a day.

Salt levels in packaged bread in supermarkets across the UK fell around a fifth from 1.23g per 100g in 2001, to 0.98g per 100g in 2011, according to findings published in the online journal BMJ Open.

Researchers examined 40 products in 2001, and 203 in 2011 for the study by the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London.

Overall, the number of products meeting the Department of Health's 2012 target - of less than or equal to 1g of salt per 100g - rose from under a third in 2001 to almost three-quarters in 2011.

But wide variations in salt content persist between supermarket own-label and branded products, the results showed.

In 2001, 38 per cent of supermarket own-label loaves met the 2012 target compared with just 17 per cent of branded products.

By 2011, the equivalent figures were 89 per cent and 42 per cent respectively.

Little difference in salt content was found between white, wholemeal, and brown loaves despite the common perception that wholemeal and brown bread are healthier alternatives to white bread.

The scientists behind the research said: 'A wide variation in salt levels was found, with many products already meeting the 2012 targets, indicating that further reductions can be made.

'This requires further progressive lower targets to be set, so that the UK can continue to lead the world in salt reduction and save the maximum number of lives.'

Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, said: 'A reduction in population salt intake is one of the most cost-effective measures to improve public health, as lowering salt intake lowers blood pressure and reduces the number of people suffering and dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.

'So we are really pleased that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of salt in bread and are continuing to work with industry, through 'he Responsibility Deal, to help people reduce their salt intake.

'Many foods contain higher levels of salt than we might expect so it's important to check the label.

'To make it easy for everyone to keep track of what they eat and make healthier choices, we will soon be announcing a simple and clear system for front-of-pack labelling that everyone can use to help people make healthier choices.'
