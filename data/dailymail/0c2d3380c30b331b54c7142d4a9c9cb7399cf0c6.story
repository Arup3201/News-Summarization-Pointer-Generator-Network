Women's basketball stars Brittney Griner, 23, and Glory Johnson, 24, are engaged.

Griner proposed to Johnson and both posted pictures of the event on social media, with Griner showing a photo of herself on one knee with a ring in her hand in front of Johnson on her Instagram account.

Griner plays for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury and Johnson for the Tulsa Shock. The two are now the first professional athletes to become engaged to a player from a rival team.

Young love: The pair have reportedly been dating for just two months

In the post, Griner wrote: "Last Night 
was a Night to Remember(,) I became the happiest person on this earth! 
(almost pass out but when that one word came out I came back to life) Me
 and my baby @missvol25 are in it for Life!"

Johnson also had a photo on her Instagram account of Griner lying in bed with an engagement ring resting on her shoulder.

Griner has embraced her role as a prominent gay athlete since finishing a record-breaking career at Baylor.  She came out last year and wrote a candid memoir, In My Skin, that was critical of college coach Kim Mulkey.

Mulkey encouraged Griner to hide her sexuality because she and other university officials thought it would hurt recruiting.

The 6-foot-8 center, drafted first overall by Phoenix last year, has helped lead the Mercury to a WNBA-best 27-5 record. She is averaging 15.4 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.9 blocks.

Johnson is averaging 15.0 points and 9.5 rebounds in her third season with Tulsa. The 6-foot-3 forward played at Tennessee.

Arizona
 and Oklahoma have gay marriage bans being contested in court. 
Oklahoma's ban was found unconstitutional, but that decision is on hold 
and the state has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Griner and Johnson have not said when or where they plan to get married.

The widespread reporting of the engagement and its positive reception was unthinkable just a few years ago, when despite a large proportion of lesbian fans and many gay players, the WNBA shied away from acknowledging it.

Earlier this year, the WNBA announced that it would actively begin marketing the sport to its lesbian fans, and teams and individual players have participated in gay pride events.
