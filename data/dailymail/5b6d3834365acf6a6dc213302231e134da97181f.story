A police source said: 'There is reason to suppose that the artist's death is of a criminal character.'

The 49-year-old was born in St Petersburg in October 14, 1965 and attended the St Petersburg State Institute of Theatre, Music and Cinematography.

He was best known for his roles in the drama series Bandit St Petersburg and The Street of Broken Lights.

He was also well-known as an outspoken critic of Putin and has taken part in many anti-Kremlin protests.

Three years ago, he returned two state honours that had previously been awarded to him by President Putin for acting.

He said he handed them back in a protest against corruption and political censorship and said he felt 'ashamed' to have received them.

In a later interview he said: 'I am completely fed up with this tzar-statedom with its lies, cover-ups, state sanctioned robbbery, bribery and other virtues.'

Shortly after the interview, he was attacked on the Moscow underground, with reports saying he was 'almost killed.'

He was also a member of the United Civil Front and in March he signed a letter along with other Russian actors condemning the country's military intervention in Ukraine.

However, other reports have said he was found inside his apartment, with the Russian Interfax news agency quoting a source in law enforcement that Mr Devotchenko could have died from a heart attack.

The source added that there were no signs that the actor suffered a violent death and that he may have fell and hit his head when drunk.

Russian tabloid LifeNews reported that Devotchenko fell into a a glass cabinet and died of blood loss after sustaining severe cuts to his hands.

It added that empty bottles of whiskey and packets of phenazepam, a legal Russian drug prescribed to treat epilepsy, were discovered near his body.

Police are investigating but there has not yet been a cause of death established.
