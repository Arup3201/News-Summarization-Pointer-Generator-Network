Jack Nicholson fears dying alone because women don't trust him thanks to his reputation as a lothario

He once said he used to feel irresistible to women - and his impressive list of lovers suggests he had a point.

But Jack Nicholson admits he fears dying alone because he can no longer captivate the ladies like he did in younger years.

The 77-year-old says women do not trust him anymore thanks to his reputation as 'Jack the Jumper' - a reference to his well-known philandering.  

In comments published by U.S. magazine Closer, he said he would love 'one last romance' but said he was 'not very realistic' about that happening.

He said he didn't believe that relationships are 'fixed things' because humans are 'necessarily complex and confused beings'.

He added: 'We don't always do the right thing, say the right thing and behave the way we always want to behave.'

Nicholson has made very similar remarks in an interview in 2011, suggesting that his outlook on the future has changed very little since then.

A source also told the magazine that Nicholson was 'afraid of dying alone' in his Los Angeles mansion.

Nicholson's lovers have included actresses and models such as Michelle Phillips, Bebe Buell, Lara Flynn Boyle, Anjelica Huston and Rebecca Broussard.

He was married to Sandra Knight for six years between 1962 and 1968, a marriage she described as 'very beautiful and sweet'.

But his  affair with Addams Family actress Angelica Huston was far more volatile, with him repeatedly cheating on her.

It finally ended in 1989 after 16 years when when he announced over dinner that Broussard was going to have his baby.

In remarks published by Closer, Nicholson says he was 'annihilated emotionally', adding: 'I'm childish and I did make a mistake'. 

The magazine reports how Nicholson spends his time sleeping until 1pm, drinking milk to soothe his stomach, playing golf and going next door to the property that contains his art collection.

He bought the adjacent house, once owned by Marlon Brando in Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, largely so that he didn't have to cope with any neighbours.

A source said his family had been trying to get him to sell the properties to downsize to a 'more manageable place in Beverly Hills'.
