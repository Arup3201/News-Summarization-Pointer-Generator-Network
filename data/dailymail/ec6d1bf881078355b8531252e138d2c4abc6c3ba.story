The iconic city of Jerusalem, so rich in history, religion and science, is celebrated in a new movie shot using high definition cameras by filmmakers granted special access rights to capture unprecedented views of the Holy Land.

The result is a visually stunning piece of film-making which offers viewers breathtaking aerial perspectives of the Old City and other famous landmarks.

Jerusalem is like nowhere else on earth, not only is it one of the oldest cities in the world, but it is considered holy by three major world religions - Christians, Jews and Muslims.

Throughout its checkered history it has 
been fought over more than any other place in history; conquered and 
destroyed, rebuilt and reinvented and remains to this day both a 
thriving modern city and a living museum to over 5,000 years of history.

‘Jerusalem,’ which is being distributed by National Geographic Entertainment, explores this ancient, enigmatic place on a grand scale. It has been shot especially in 3D for IMAX and Giant Screen cinemas which immerses audiences in a spectacular cinematic journey.

Audiences get a rare glimpse of the storied city, as well as exclusive access to iconic holy sites including the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Jordan River, the Sea of Galilee and the mountain fortress of Masada.

Although a strict no-fly zone has existed over the region for many years, the filmmakers were granted special permission to capture aerial images using low-altitude planes.

'We were thrilled with the opportunity 
to provide audiences with the story of the Old City on this grand scale,
 and offer unique perspectives, aerials and access to this part of the 
world in a way you could never get in any other format.' said Daniel 
Ferguson, who produced the movie along with Taran Davies and George 
Duffield.

'Jerusalem' presents the story from several perspectives and features three teenage girls, one from each faith - Farah Ammouri, a Muslim, Nadia Tadros, from a Greek Orthodox and Catholic family, and Revital Zacharie, a Jew – who each took Ferguson on a (separate) one-day tour of Jerusalem, which he filmed.

'Our goal was to look at the roots of the universal attachment to Jerusalem: Jewish, Christian and Muslim,’ explained Ferguson.

For those of the Jewish faith, Jerusalem represents their homeland. Every synagogue in the world faces Jerusalem, and three times a day, Jews pray towards the temples that once stood here above 'the Kotel' or Western Wall. They believe prayers pass through the Kotel to God.

For Christians, Jerusalem is the place where Jesus was arrested and sentenced to death nearby in the Garden of Gethsemane. The Via Dolorosa, or ‘Way of Sorrows,’ is said to be the path Jesus took on his way to crucifixion.

For Muslims, Jerusalem is the city of 
the prophets. Muslims believe that Mohammed was taken on a miraculous 
journey from Mecca to Jerusalem where he ascended to Heaven on a ladder 
of light, which they associate with the 'Dome of the Rock.'

From the Damascus Gate and the Dome of the Rock, to the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the girls each reveal the Holy City from their own perspective.

‘What was really amazing was that they would bring me to some of the same places in the city and tell me entirely different things,' said Ferguson.

'Revital would point out Jewish history, but when I asked her if she knew about the Christian or Muslim attachment to the same places, she didn’t. The same was true of the other girls.'

‘We hope the juxtaposition of these different religions and cultures - all with profound spiritual and historical connections to the city - will reveal how much Jews, Christians and Muslims have in common and inspire all of us to better understand each other.'

In Jewish tradition, it known as 'the Foundation Stone,' where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son and where the Temples stood. Many historians believe the biblical Jebusites worshiped here nearly 5000 years ago

With thousands of archaeological 
sites, Jerusalem is one of the most excavated cities on the planet, with
 so much more waiting to be discovered. 

The
 film features renowned archaeologist and religious studies professor 
Dr. Jodi Magness of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who
 explains the many layers that chronicle this important crossroads of 
civilizations. 

'It's a living city, and it's a city that's been inhabited continuously for thousands of years,' Magness told NBC News. 'Unless, God forbid, the city is ever completely abandoned, we'll never get a complete picture.'

In the film, Dr. Magness leads a group of students through an ancient water tunnel beneath the biblical-era city of Jerusalem, which conveyed water from the Gihon Spring outside the city walls to the residents of the city in the event of a siege by an invading army.

She also gives audiences a tour of excavations around the Western Wall, marveling at one of the greatest feats of engineering in the ancient world.

Jerusalem is like nowhere else on earth, not only is it one of the oldest cities in the world, but it is also considered holy by three major world religions - Christians, Jews and Muslims

The sensitivity to all those 
traditions is one of the biggest challenges facing archaeologists as 
they try to piece together the story of Jerusalem's past, going back to 
the Jebusites (also known as the Canaanites) who settled there 5,000 
years ago.

'Understanding
 ancient Jerusalem is like trying to put together a giant puzzle, where 
we're missing most of the pieces and we don't know what the original 
picture looked like,' Magness said in the film. 'Everything that we dig 
up out of the ground is a new piece of the puzzle.'

One of the most thrilling scenes in 'Jerusalem' starts out with Magness showing a tour group around the monumental walls of the Temple Mount, and ends up morphing into a computer-generated reconstruction of the Second Temple.

Other scenes compare present-day settings with how the same location looked in historical photographs or virtual views of the ancient past.

The film, which is narrated by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, will premiere in giant-screen, IMAX and digital 3-D cinemas in the USA and worldwide beginning September 20, 2013.
