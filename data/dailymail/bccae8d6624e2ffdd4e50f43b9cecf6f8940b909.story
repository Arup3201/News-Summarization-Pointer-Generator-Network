It says everything about Eoin Morgan that England had to delay announcing him as one-day captain until Saturday because they could not contact him in Sydney.

‘When I got up there were about 20 missed calls from James Whitaker,’ said the man currently on Big Bash business in Australia. ‘So I thought I’d better give him a ring. He said, “We’d like to offer you the captaincy” and I was delighted. Being offered the captaincy is awesome. It’s a huge honour.’

Note that Morgan was paying little attention to what was going on in England without him. He must have known that Friday was World Cup squad decision day and surely he knew that Alastair Cook was under increasing pressure.

Eoin Morgan has an excellent batting average when captaining England, and will hope to keep that up

The new captain, currently playing in Australia, wasn't checking his phone when the decision was made

Morgan is a calm, shrewd operator, who must have known he was likely to replace the sacked Cook

Yet the cool, calm, singular Irishman remained detached, not exactly waiting by his phone or scouring Twitter for news of the biggest development of his career.

He is shrewd enough to know that he was the obvious alternative to Cook but his apparent indifference suggests that he will take his promotion in his stride. Eoin Morgan is truly his own man.

It was fascinating to read the assessment of Ed Smith, who captained Morgan during his days at Middlesex, of the man who will try to make England credible World Cup challengers.

‘Gifted but calculating, affable but wary, engaging but hard to read, Eoin Morgan has played his hand well en route to the England captaincy,’ said Smith in The Sunday Times. ‘He is highly rated but not clearly understood. Just as he likes things.’ It sums up Morgan perfectly.

Morgan can be hard to read, but he will bring a new energy, and a new outlook, to England's one-day game

Cook paid the price for poor performances with the bat and a slow scoring rate in Sri Lanka

Morgan is ambitious and talented, and has shown his talent both at home and in the global T20 leagues

England’s resolve to move on without Kevin Pietersen remains as strong as ever despite his desperate Twitter pleas and the appointment of his friend Eoin Morgan to the one-day captaincy.

National selector James Whitaker was irritated when Pietersen’s name came up at Lord’s on Saturday and said: ‘No, no, no’ when asked if there was a way back for the sacked star.

He added: ‘The ECB management made this decision in January and it is the same decision now. There is no way that Kevin Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’

So unless everybody at the ECB is sacked and replaced by a selection panel of Shane Warne, Michael Vaughan and Piers Morgan there is no way back for Pietersen.

The Dubliner is nothing if not ambitious, as he showed when he threw in his lot with England in 2009 three years after making his one-day debut with Ireland.

This is a significant change of policy by England, an admission that they have to think of 50-over cricket as an extension of Twenty20 rather than a reduced form of Test cricket. They need a different approach and largely different personnel.

Sportsmail understands their original intention was to replace Cook as one-day captain after the World Cup with Joe Root. But a change of plan has been necessary now. 

For the first time, England will have different captains for different formats, with Morgan almost certain to replace Stuart Broad as Twenty20 captain to unite the limited-overs formats. 

‘To have two captains gives us the chance to develop a one-day side in a slightly different way,’ said managing director Paul Downton. ‘It may well be that we will look to evolve slightly different teams.’

So what sort of captain will Morgan be? Well, he will lead England in his own, calm image.

The ECB had intended to make Joe Root captain after the World Cup, but had to make the decision earlier

Replacing Cook with Morgan indicates that England have decided to treat ODIs more like T20s than Tests

‘I really enjoy being captain,’ said Morgan. ‘It puts a lot more onus on your performance, your contribution to the team and your tactics as the game unfolds. Those are things I really enjoy. As captain I want to keep things simple and honest. 

'I don’t have a huge amount of time to influence the side but my main aspirations for the group are to take advantage of them being naturally hard-working and skilful.’

There are the makings of a decent England one-day side here. The question, in the short term, is whether they will have any better chance of causing an upset at the World Cup with Morgan rather than Cook in charge. We will soon discover the answer.
