A visible indication of the eagerness with which Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers approached this match could be seen in his face when he welcomed Carlo Ancelotti to the stadium. Eyes bulging, head back, hand outstretched — it was an unfortunate look caught by the Sky Sports cameras. Meanwhile Rodgers also welcomed back Joe Allen for his first start since he injured his knee playing for Wales on Andorra’s artificial pitch.

Return of a hero  

An Anfield favourite who brought European silverware to the club before Istanbul was in the stands on Wednesday night. Gerard Houllier won the UEFA Cup as Liverpool manager in 2001 as part of a treble of trophies, ending a 17-year wait for success on the Continent.

Status Quo are still top of the Kops  

Status Quo's Rockin’ All Over the World blared out over the speakers before kick-off. It was the song adapted during the 2005 Champions League final by fans who sang: ‘Scousers all over the world’. For good measure, Johnny Cash’s classic Ring of Fire — the unofficial anthem of that season’s European campaign — was given an airing too, just in case anyone in the stadium was having trouble recalling that remarkable victory in Istanbul nearly a decade ago.

Liverpool’s kids did the business over Real Madrid on Wednesday afternoon, claiming a thrilling 3-2 victory over the Spaniards in the UEFA Youth League at Langtree Park, St Helens. Harry Wilson, 17, struck the winner with two minutes remaining. The victory means Liverpool top Group B at the midway point, joining Basle and Real on six points from their opening three matches.

Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli infuriated the home fans when he stopped play to allow Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez (above) time to change his shirt after a cut to his head splashed blood on it. Rizzoli bizarrely restarted the game just before James was finished then waved him back onto the pitch.
