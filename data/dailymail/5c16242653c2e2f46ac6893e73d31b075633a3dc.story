A prison has been forced to change its locks after staff lost the keys.

An insider claims HMP Haverigg, Cumbria, was landed with an £80,000 bill for the bungle, although the Ministry of Justice refuse to confirm the figure.

The missing keys turned up after locks at the 644-inmate jail were replaced.

The Ministry of Justice has confirmed several locks at HMP Haverigg were changed after prison keys went missing at the jail on May 6.

The MoJ said all inmates were in their cells at the time the keys were lost and stressed the “human error” had not put posed any risk of escape from the jail or threat to the public.

A spokesman remained tight-lipped over the number of locks the keys were able to open but confirmed they were for internal doors only.

He said the keys were lost due to “human error” and said no inmates were involved in the incident.

A prison insider claimed changing locks at the jail following the incident could cost as much as £80,000, however, the MoJ said they did not recognise the figure and added it is 'too early' to put costs on replacing the specialist locks.

The jail’s 644 inmates are deemed low risk by Ministry of Justice guidelines, placing them as category C and D - the lowest on the scale.

Now, the prison has launched an investigation to find out how the keys went missing and has confirmed “a number” of locks at the jail are set to be replaced as a precautionary measure.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'As a security precaution a number of locks at HMP Haverigg are being changed following the loss of some keys.

This was an isolated incident and there was never any risk to the public. Incidents like this are extremely rare.

'We always investigate them thoroughly and update our security measures accordingly.'

The spokesman confirmed the keys have since been recovered and said no members of staff have been disciplined as a result of the incident.

A report into standards at the prison is due to be released by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons this month and a HMIP spokeswoman previously said it could be as early as next week.
