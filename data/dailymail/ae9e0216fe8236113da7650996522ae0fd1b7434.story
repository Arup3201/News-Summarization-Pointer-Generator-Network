Drowned: Atur Liana fell into a river while relieving himself after drinking ten shots of vodka on a night out, an inquest heard

A security guard drowned when he fell into a river while relieving himself, an inquest has heard.

Artur Liana, 32, was swept away by a current after falling into the freezing water in the early hours of December 22, 2012.

He was said to have drunk 'at least' ten shots of vodka during the evening.

His body was found floating in the River Nene in Northampton more than six weeks later on February 2 last year by a council worker.

An inquest at Northampton Coroners Court yesterday heard Mr Liana may have slipped into the water while urinating after he enjoyed a pre-Christmas evening in the town.

Professor Guy Rutty, a pathologist, told the hearing there were no injuries to Mr Liana, but that the condition of his lungs was consistent with drowning.

He also said Mr Liana was approximately twice the legal drink-drive limit, according to a toxicology report.

He said: 'His flies were partly done up.

'In the past, I have known individuals, while intoxicated with alcohol, to have gone to urinate in water and in the process have fallen in and drowned.

'On the balance of probabilities the findings can be considered consistent with drowning.'

Mr Lianaâ€™s friend Anna Polakowska told the inquest she and two others had been on a night out in Northampton with him on the night he drowned.

The security guard, who was also volunteering as an intern at a bank with a view to getting a job in the financial sector, was seen on CCTV outside the Borjia night club in Northampton on the night that his vanished.

His disappearance prompted a major police search before his body was eventually found.

She told the hearing Mr Liana, who moved from his native Poland to Britain five years ago, had drank 'at least ten shots of vodka' before he wandered off.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Northamptonshire Coroner Anne Pember said: 'He had been out in the town centre and in all probability went to relieve himself by the river.

'It is not unusual for people to have been drunk and fall in.'
