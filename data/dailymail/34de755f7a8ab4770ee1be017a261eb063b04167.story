A narcotics detective watched proudly this weekend as his ten-year-old daughter won her fourth-grade science fair for an experiment on cocaine.

Emma Bartelt's project 'Drug Sniffing Dogs' featured an ounce of powder cocaine (with a street value of $1,300) and three police dogs along with the input of her father, Detective Douglas Bartelt.

Her imaginative work earned Emma first place on Saturday at the science fair at Coral Gables Preparatory Academy in Miami, Florida.

Experimental: Miami Detective Douglas Bartelt with retired drug-sniffing dog Franky who was used in his daughter's school science experiment involving cocaine

Winning: The ten-year-old's science project was based on the work that her father does as a narcotics detective

The experiment was conducted at a police training center by Detective Bartelt while  ten-year-old Emma wrote down the results. She never touched the drugs at any point during the process.

It worked by placing an ounce of cocaine inside a metal box and hiding the box inside a room, according to the Miami Herald.

The next step was to release one a K-9 into the room and begin timing -  then stop the clock when the dog sniffed out the drugs.

After carrying out the experiment a number of times and using a second room, the average time that it took the dog to find cocaine was calculated.

The experiment was tried with three different dogs to see which one was fastest -  Roger, a springer spaniel; Levi, a golden retriever or Franky, a retired brown Labrador.

Emma told the Herald that the project was her idea 'because I wanted to do my dad’s job'.

The school district reportedly said that cocaine is not a banned material when it comes to science fair experiments. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from district spokesman John Schuster.

Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Detective Aida Fina-Milian told MailOnline that Detective Bartelt's supervisor had approved the use of police facilities for the experiment but she had few other details.

Detective Fina-Milian said that Franky, the Labrador used in the experiment, was a retired police dog who now belonged to the detective and his family.
