Samir Nasri completed his rehabilitation at Manchester City on Thursday by signing a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions.

The French midfielder appeared to have a bleak future last year when former City boss Roberto Mancini accused him of only giving ‘50 per cent’ in training, and he was targeted by fans.

But Nasri’s career has been revived under Manuel Pellegrini, and his 11 goals last season included decisive efforts in the Capital One Cup final and on the last day of the Premier League season.

‘It took me time to adjust to living in Manchester,’ said Nasri, a £24million signing from Arsenal three years ago.

‘But last year everything was great. I enjoyed my football and I feel very much at home.

‘I understand that maybe in my second year I wasn’t great. City pay me a lot of money and the expectations are high.

'It’s normal that the fans show you their disappointment.’

Nasri, who joined City from Arsenal in 2011, has 22 goals in 129 appearances for City, and has won two Premier League titles as well as the League Cup with the club.
