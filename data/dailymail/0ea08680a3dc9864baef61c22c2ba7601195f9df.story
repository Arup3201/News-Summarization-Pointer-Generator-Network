Adults on scooters and swinging briefcases can be treacherous during a busy morning commute - but that hasn't stopped a company combining the two.

The Commuter Case electric scooter doubles up as a suitcase designed to not only gets riders to work faster, but to make it easier for them to carry a change of clothes or other heavy items, such as laptops. 

It costs $5,990 (£3,500), but because it is a prototype, the company said it will use this money to fund production - and hasn't revealed when customers will receive their purchases.

The Commute-Case electric scooter, pictured, doubles up as a suitcase. It costs $5,990 (£3,500), but because it is a prototype, the company said it will use money from pre-orders to fund production and put it through testing. It hasn't revealed a release date yet, though

The prototype vehicle weighs 27lbs (12kg) and the scooter can be folded to fit inside the suitcase.

The case can be carried, or pulled along on wheels.

When assembled, the scooter is powered by rechargeable batteries, and reaches a top speed of 12.5mph (20km/h).

It can also be 
propelled by foot if the battery dies.  

The final product is expected to retail 
for $5,990 (£3,500), but the firm is offering 50 per cent off on 
pre-orders, taking it to $2,995 (£1,785).

Green Energy Motors has not announced a release date.

Powered by rechargeable batteries, the
 scooter reaches a top speed of 12.5mph (20km/h), but can also be 
propelled by foot if the battery dies.

The firm said this means users can cover a mile in five minutes, compared to 20 minutes when walking.

The left and right footrests, the steering column and wheels are stored in the suitcase and are removed and assembled into position.

Once the rests, wheels and handles are locked into place, the vehicle is in 'ride mode'.

The rider pushes the Commute-Case forward using their foot and once moving, it is driven by an accelerator on the handlebars.

It is slowed, or stopped, using a manual level brake.

Illinois firm Green Energy Motors is currently taking pre-orders of its vehicle to help finance production, and is putting the device through testing. 

The left and right footrests, and the steering column are stored in the suitcase, shown in silver, and can be removed and assembled into position. The prototype Commute-Case weighs 27lbs (12kg)

The final product is expected to retail for $5,990 (£3,500), but the firm is offering 50 per cent off pre-orders, taking it to $2,995 (£1,785).

By comparison, a regular scooter costs around $125 (£75) while new Segways, at the other end of the scale, cost around $8,300 (£5,000).

Although these seem expensive, Green Energy Motors said it costs just 10 cents (15p) to travel 25 miles versus an average of $3.35 (£2) to travel 25 miles in car.

‘Use Commute-Case as your first mile ride - from home to train station or bus stop,’ said the firm.

‘After de-boarding your daily commuter train or bus, use Commute-Case for your last mile ride to work, school, shopping, or any local destination not within your desired walking distance.

‘By providing an alternative means of short distance transportation, Commute-Case helps lower urban pollution, fuel consumption, and eases traffic congestion.

‘Simply put, now you can ride your briefcase around town.’
