Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last night claimed that Lewis Hamilton’s victory in the Singapore Grand Prix was payback from a ‘racing god’ for his race-ending accident in Spa last month.

It was there that Hamilton retired after a collision that the team blamed on Nico Rosberg, who went on to win the race.

Although Mercedes have already fined Rosberg and made him apologise for the crash, the loose-tongued Wolff returned to the topic after an electrical failure ended the German’s race yesterday and allowed Hamilton to leapfrog him into a three-point lead in the drivers’ championship.

‘Lewis caught up a lot of points, ones he lost in Spa,’ said Wolff. ‘If there is a racing god maybe he was there today.’

Of more concern to Mercedes than spiritual matters are the nuts and bolts of providing a dependable car. They have suffered five retirements this season and further problems in qualifying and practice.

Wolff admitted: ‘We have a missile of a car but are having reliability issues. Today Nico’s steering column broke. I said: “Sorry for letting you down”. At moments like that there is really nothing you can say.’

Rosberg was still stony-faced as he was commiserated by Niki Lauda, Mercedes’ non-executive chairman, more than an hour after his race ended.

Asked if reliability would be a factor in deciding the title, Rosberg said: ‘Of course, but I’m still very optimistic. It is clear reliability is the point we need to focus on the most.

‘At the moment I’m just disappointed with today, and I want to dig in with the team to try to understand what went wrong. The team are working crazy hours.

They just need to review their approach and try to improve in that area. It’s not a demand. Everyone in the team wants the same thing.’
