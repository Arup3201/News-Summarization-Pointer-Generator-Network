A Florida home where a seven-year-old girl was lured, molested, and murdered five years ago was burned to the ground Thursday.

Its been five years since seven-year-old Somer Thompson was lured into the home at 1152 Gano Avenue in Orange Park where she was molested and murdered by Jarred Harrell, 29.

Little Somer disappeared in 2009 while walking home from school. Her body was found days later in a landfill. Harrell, who is now serving a life sentence, kidnapped, molested, and killed the seven-year-old in the house, the Clay County Sheriff's Office said.

Fire crews and other first responders used the house in a live training exercise after it was procured by the Somer Thompson Foundation.

Now, the home that once sparked painful memories when Somer's loved ones passed by is destroyed. 

The home was burned down as part of a training exercise for the Orange Park Fire Department, Clay County Fire Rescue, and Jacksonville Naval Air Station Fire Department, WJXT reports.

Participating firefighters started and extinguished small fires throughout the morning, according to WJXT, and the victim's mother, Diena Thompson, joined the firefighters at around 1.30pm and set the final blaze.

'How could you not feel good about burning down some place where unimaginable things happened?' Thompson said.

'At the same time, it's like almost being brought back to the very beginning in a different way.'

By 3pm, the house was completely destroyed.

The home was vacant after the 2009 murder, and ownership was later transferred from a bank to The Somer Thompson Foundation, founded by Thompson after her daughter's death, WFMY reports.

Thompson reached out to the department looking for a way to use the home to benefit the community and destroy the home at the same time. 

She said she wanted something good to come from the tragedy, according to WFMY, and allowing firefighters to train at the house would be a good way to do it.

She donated the home to Fire Station 19. The specialized training included search and rescue techniques.

On Oct. 19, 2009, Somer was walking home from elementary school with her twin brother and older sister when she became separated from the two and found herself in front of Harrell's home, The Florida Times-Union reports. 

'She was literally just walking home one day and stopped right here and put her face up to the fence and talked to a little doggie,' Thompson told WJXT about the day her daughter was abducted. 

'And then an even-meaner dog came out and took her.' 

Harrell admitted to abducting, sexually abusing, and lewdly touching Somer before strangling her, HLN reports. 

Investigators later revealed that Somer often played with a dog outside of Harrell's house, suggesting that he used the dog to lure the young girl into the home.

He also admitted to putting the girl's body into a container and placing it in a dumpster. 

Harrell became a person of interest in the case after authorities arrested him on 29 counts of possession of child pornography, unrelated to Somer's investigation. 

He later pleaded guilty to a total of 59 charges, including Somer's abduction, molestation, and murder, the molestation of a three-year-old girl, and possession of child pornography.

A judge sentenced Harrell to six life sentences with no chance to appeal the convictions.  

Since her daughter's death, Thompson founded the Foundation, which is is a non-profit organization to help the families of victims of child abduction resulting in death, according to the Foundation's Facebook page.

The mother-of two was outspoken throughout her daughter's investigation and both she and her remaining two children spoke directly to Harrell at his sentencing. 

Now, five years after Somer's death, Thompson and the community are receiving a sense of closure. She told WJXT that it 'takes a village to help a mother who lost a child.'

'I hope she's proud of me and I'm so sorry that I let her down,' Thompson said.
