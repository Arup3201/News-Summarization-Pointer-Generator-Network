Homeland has posted its second-highest ever ratings - despite the new third season being widely criticized as 'confusing' and a 'train wreck'.

Sunday night's episode, The Tower Of David, which saw the return of Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis) averaged 1.81 million viewers for its 9pm episode - followed by a season best 2.62million for its three airings at 11pm and 1am on Monday.

And this made it the Showtime drama's second-largest audience for any night, behind only its second-season finale, according to Nielsen.

But despite the ratings, the TV hit has been castigated for its plotlines, which have so far seen errant CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) forcibly detained in a psychiatric unit - while her former lover Sgt Nicholas Brody was discovered in Venezula, being kept in a prison of his own in an abandoned, half-finished skyscraper in Caracas, referred to as the Tower Of David.

Why Dana? Homeland fans have taken their outrage for the teenage character's attitude and general mopiness online and have called for her to be killed off the show

Following Sunday's episode, stars including Rosie O'Donnell and actress Emily Deschanel took to Twitter to berate the show.

Rosie, 51, tweeted: 'Homeland tonight...totally confused', while Bones star Emily, 37, added: 'You guys! What is going on with #homeland this season?!'

Actress Olivia Wilde added: 'Homeland writers, how about we just have Carrie take her meds, take over the CIA, annihilate Dana, and solve puzzles all day?'

Meanwhile, TV writer Michael Ausiello ‏said: 'Still not sure where I stand on last night's Homeland. I admired its quiet ambition but can't argue with folks who found it a little tedious.'

Another tweeter, Jimmy Burns added: 'The #RedSox have temporarily lost big screen privileges so I can catch up on last week's #Homeland. I've traded one train wreck for another.'

Favorable father: Dana is less beloved than her father Nicholas Brody, who is a terrorist

While another viewer Courtney Lee ‏tweeted: 'Catching up on Homeland! Carey is still crazy, Brody is still confusing and the episode is going nowhere! #ineedstufftohitthefanagain'

The Twitter rampage comes after Homeland fans spoke of their fury for Brody's daughter Dana - and the big role she took in the second episode.

As MailOnline reported last week, the moody 
teen, played by Morgan Saylor, has been a subject of ridicule in fan message boards and online 
ever since the show began two years ago, but her stock has gone down of 
late since she has been granted so much screen time in the new season's 
first two episodes.

Adding 
to the virtual vitriol about Dana's prominent plot lines is the fact 
that her father was notably absent from the third season following the 
explosive finale this spring.

Rather
than just making Dana-esque scowls at their televisions, viewers took 
to Twitter on Sunday night to lament once more their hatred of the 
teenager who (spoiler alert) has recently come out of rehab following a 
suicide attempt.

'Why is Dana still on the TV, WHY WHY WHY WHY,' Twitter user Jonathan McGarrigle wrote.

'I
thought that #homeland people would have realized by now nobody likes 
dana, but no, they give her a storyline nobody cares about,' fellow user
@rapturebus wrote.

Teenage angst: Actress Morgan Saylor, who plays Dana, said that she finds it funny how much time people dedicate to bashing her character online

The decision to include the Brody family prominently - while leaving viewers in the dark about the whereabouts of Nicholas Brody himself - was a conscious one for the creators.

'There are all these families that are the victims of somebody in the family doing an act of violence. Whether it’s Sandy Hook, whether it’s Columbine, the Boston Marathon bombers, these people all have families who suffer the consequences of these psychopathic actions,' show-runner Alex Ganza told New York Magazine.

'It was interesting to think about what would happen to the Brody family.'

Screen time: The two episodes of season three of Homeland have dedicated a good portion of the episodes to Dana's story line and her new romantic interest

Actress Morgan Saylor, who plays the tortured teen, finds the attention paid to her character’s moods and ticks funny - including the spoof that Saturday Night Live did, where they played up her tendency to fiddle with her hands when feeling nervous.

There are also similarities being drawn between Dana and the character of Skylar White from Breaking Bad, who was also the subject of scorn and the inspiration for hate-filled Facebook groups.

‘Characters are not always supposed to be loved. You could look at most characters and see mixed reactions. I don’t know. I don’t take it personally. I think it’s kind of interesting to see people, like, spending so much time focusing on something like that,’ Saylor said in an interview with The Daily Beast.
