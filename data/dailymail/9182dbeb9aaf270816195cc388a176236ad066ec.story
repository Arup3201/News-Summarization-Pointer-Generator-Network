The first culottes I ever saw were in Jackie magazine. Though I was a 15-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent and only just waking up to the idea of fashion, I remember thinking how ludicrous they looked.

But Agnetha and Frida from Abba wore culottes, so I ventured to Chelsea Girl to try on a billowing blue pair. I left empty-handed because they looked far too grown-up and dwarfed me.

Culottes, a strange skirt/shorts hybrid, are said to have the practicality and comfort of trousers, but the feminine look of a skirt. Not seen much since the Eighties, this season they’ve staged a comeback and are everywhere on the High Street, spurred on by designers such as Chloe, Marni, Joseph and Valentino. I’ve never owned a pair. Working as a TV presenter for more than 20 years on Blue Peter and GMTV, I learned the importance of clean lines and shapes, and what suits me.

At 5ft 6in, I’m not tiny, but prefer to elongate my legs. And having lost a stone in the past year, I like well-fitting clothes that show off my shape. Surely culottes will make me look shorter, pile on the pounds and give me thunder thighs?

I tried on six High Street pairs to see if I could finally be converted to culottes.

EVENING ELEGANCE 

Smart: Culottes, £75, coast-stores.com Top, £14.99, hm.com Belt, £69, reiss.com Shoes, £14, newlook.co.uk

On the hanger, they looked like billowing Aladdin pants, so I was surprised at how elegant they were once on. Slimming black is ideal for culottes. A fitted top and metallic belt define your waist.

I’d wear these to a smart event on a windy evening and be thrilled the hemline didn't fly up!

FLOATY BUT SLIMMING 

Comfy: Culottes, £20, clothingattesco.com Top, £69, reiss.com Shoes, £49.99, zara.com

These were the most comfortable and a real bargain. The paper-thin fabric ensured my legs looked slim. I like the pattern, but it needs a pop of colour on top.

You could wear these during the day or even out for the evening, but they need killer heels to prevent them from looking old-fashioned.

A DENIM DISASTER

Unflattering: Culottes, £145, whistles.com Top, £35, hobbs.co.uk Shoes, £50, riverisland.co.uk

Help! I look like Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances when she heads off to sea in stripes and acres of skirt.

You’d have to be minute to wear wide-bottomed culottes without looking as big as a house. My hips look gargantuan, my legs are shortened. These hang like curtains, drowning my figure.

Hideous!

THEY'RE MAN REPELLERS

Ridiculous: Culottes, £40, topshop.com Top, £45, riverisland.com Shoes, £69.99, zara.com

I can see why some people call culottes man repellers. These swamp my legs — I want to hoist them up, pin them back or make a parachute out of them.

Though cream is a lovely winter shade that lifts my complexion, these mask the natural shape of my legs, which I’ve worked hard to keep. They look simply ridiculous. No one could get away with these.

UNLOVELY LEATHER

Not sexy: Faux leather culottes, £45, asos.com Top, £29.99, zara.com Shoes, £29.50, debenhams.com

Faux leather can look sexy, but these had too low a crotch and loose a leg. Waist pleats tailored the fabric to sit tidily against my hips, but the bottom half sticks out stiffly like a panto costume.

Toughened up with a big sweater and biker boots these might look better, but not by much.

Leg width: 36cm

SATIN SOFT AND STYLISH 

Top pick: Culottes, £45, asos.com Top, £95, reiss.comSlingbacks, £185, lucychoilondon.com

My clear favourite. The fabric was satin soft, lined and excellent quality. They looked and felt designer.

The length is spot on for culottes — any shorter and they would look boyish. The dusty pale pink complements my complexion and blonde hair.

My waist looked trim and the overall effect was neat and chic.
