Ed Miliband’s failure to take on Labour’s union paymasters has left him looking ‘weaker than Neil Kinnock’, Michael Gove will warn today.

In an attack on the Labour leader’s record, the Education Secretary will accuse him of letting powerful union barons drag the party back to the 1970s.

Mr Gove – who has repeatedly clashed with teaching unions over radical school reforms – warns that the issue facing Mr Miliband is similar to that faced by Lord Kinnock in the 1980s when the hard-left Militant group was trying to take over the Labour Party.

Toxic issue: Labour leader Ed Miliband is compromised by his union backers

In a speech at Conservative Party HQ he will say the unions have become ‘a toxic issue’ for Mr Miliband and because of ‘his failure to appreciate that with him in place radical left-wing union leaders now believe the Labour Party can be theirs again: and they are taking it back, seat by seat, policy by policy, before his impotent gaze’.

Lord Kinnock led Labour to defeats against Margaret Thatcher and John Major.

But Mr Gove will say that, unlike Mr Miliband, he stood up for Labour when the party came under threat from the hard left.

‘The contrast with Neil Kinnock... is striking and not at all flattering to Ed Miliband.’

And he believes that while Lord Kinnock acted ‘bravely and remorselessly’ to eradicate Militant’s influence, ‘Miliband has done nothing to stop the takeover of his own party’.

Mr Miliband has been rocked by 
allegations that the Unite union  attempted to take over the Labour 
Party by trying to fix parliamentary selection meetings for its 
candidate in Falkirk.

Mr 
Gove will warn that Mr Miliband is too in hock to the unions in general,
and Unite in particular, ever to be able to tackle them effectively.

The
unions have provided 85 per cent of Labour’s donations since Mr 
Miliband became leader – a far higher proportion than under Tony Blair 
or Gordon Brown – with Unite Labour’s biggest single donor, handing over
£8.4million since 2010.

Mr Gove points out that Mr Miliband owes his position to the unions, with MPs and party members voting for his brother David.

‘That
is key to his weakness,’ Mr Gove will say. ‘He was put in place by 
organisations with an agenda because they believed he would be the most 
pliant personality available.’

He will also hit out at Labour’s call for a £5,000 cap on political donations.

Behind the scenes: Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union Unite, which is Labour's single biggest donor

MP Jonathan Ashworth, of Labour’s National Executive Committee, accused Mr Gove of  ‘throwing around cheap smears’.

Party funding was ‘crying out for serious reform’, he said.

 ‘Anyone would have thought Mr Gove would welcome such an opportunity to clean up Tory party finances.’
