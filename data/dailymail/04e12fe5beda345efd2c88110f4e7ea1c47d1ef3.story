Half of the biggest companies working in the UK have headquarters overseas, many in low-tax regimes, it was revealed yesterday.

Britain’s most senior tax official made the admission as she was slammed for ‘failing to get to grips with tax avoidance’ by an influential group of MPs.

It came as the Government launched a crackdown on multi-national giants that slash their tax bills by using complex legal techniques to funnel profits overseas.

Public outrage over the issue was triggered after it emerged that a long list of global giants including Starbucks, Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay pay relatively minuscule tax bills in the UK.

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has a list of the 770 largest companies operating in the country, so that it can keep tabs on their tax contributions.

Probed yesterday by the Public Accounts Committee, HMRC’s chief executive Lin Homer conceded ‘around half’ had HQs outside Britain, often in low-tax regimes such as Ireland and Luxembourg, making it easier to avoid paying their fair share.

By its own admission, HMRC has a tax gap of £32.2billion of uncollected revenue.

The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said there had been ‘hardly any progress’ since 2004, when the same gap was just over £33billion.

The committee also lambasted Mrs Homer for pursuing small and medium-sized businesses more zealously than large companies.

Labour MP Austin Mitchell said: ‘You go easy on the big boys and go harder on the companies that can’t leave and have to pay their tax here.’

Mrs Homer said: ‘All that HMRC can do is to apply the law and multinational businesses can choose where they are based and where their profits are based.’

It came as George Osborne launched an international effort to tackle tax scrimpers.

Teaming up with his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble, the Chancellor called for ‘concerted international co-operation’ to strengthen tax standards’.
