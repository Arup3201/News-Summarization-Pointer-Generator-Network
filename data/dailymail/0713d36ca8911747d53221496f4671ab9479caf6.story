The two Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were both aged around 13 when Back to the Future was first released.

So what better way to apply for a job at Google than by making your very own version of every geek's dream car - the cherished DeLorean which took Marty McFly flying backwards and forwards in time?

29-year-old Matt Riese, from San Francisco, really wants to work at Google - and whether or not he succeeds, his hovercraft-take on the film legend will at least get the search engine's attention.

Matt, according to Bloomsberg, is not your typical Google candidate - his current job is as a crab fishermen.

But Google is renowned for liking the quirky types of tech enthusiast - as their own in-house job interview questions have shown - and they must admire the fan-boy dedication which went into producing the car.

Back to the Future was the seminal sci-fi franchise of the 1980s, combining a powerful time-travel concept with a cool car, classic guitar riffs, and a nostalgic look back to high school in the 1950s.

With a young skate-boarding Michael J Fox at the helm, the film jumped from 1985, to the 50s, to the dark distant future of 2015, and then back to the Wild West, all thanks to a DeLorean turbo-charged with a 'flux capacitor', or time machine to you and me.

The original DeLorean was the brainchild of controversial US businessman
John DeLorean who managed to secure £100 million of funding from the 
Northern Ireland Development Agency to build the car outside Dunmurry 
near Belfast.

Despite 
having an incredible design which included gullwing doors, the DeLorean 
was a spectacular failure as a car and a business.

It was slow, unreliable and 
production ceased after just one year in when the company filed for 
bankruptcy in 1982. Just 9,200 models left the factory with around 7,000
thought to remain in existance.

But Wynne set up the DeLorean Motor Company in 1995, 16 years after leaving the UK in 1979.

He
also acquired the remaining tools, spare parts and distribution rights 
for the car along with the trademarked name DMC - cashing in on the name
with deals with the likes of Nike, Mattel and Sony.

He will also sell you a completely re-manufactured DeLorean using unused original parts from £37,000.

A used DeLorean on the UK market normally goes for between £15,000 to £30,000.

Matt started his project in 2008, and in 2010 turned to Kickstarter, which funds creative projects, to raise the $5,000 needed to make the hover-car a reality (minus the time travel mechanisms).

The 'car' is actually a fibreglass construction, painted and sprayed to take on the classic DeLorean lines - gull-wing doors included.

Placed on an inflating base with an engine, the car can take to the waters around McCovey Cove - near  to the San Francisco Giant's stadium, offfering baseball fans a sprinkling of sci-fi to go with the weekly matches.

The hover-car has previously featured on the AT&T's Park's Jumbotron screens - after Matt took it for a ride during a match.

He originally made the hovercraft as he 'just wanted to do something big' on the run-up to leaving college, but what was expected to be a three-month project became a labour of love

But if it can land him a job with the company that's currently testing self-driving cars, it will be a job well done.

Under the skin: The fibreglass construction is lightweight, and sits on top of an inflated hovercraft base

Taking shape: The hovercraft, with its fan attachment, took more than two years until it was ready to travel through time ... or at least, take to the waters

How it looks now: The labour of love led to an almost exact replica of the famous time-travelling car
