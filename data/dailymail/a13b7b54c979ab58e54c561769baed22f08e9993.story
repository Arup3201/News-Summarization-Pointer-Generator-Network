Four of the Premier League's leading teams - Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool - will come up against sides they historically struggle against this weekend. 

In a mirror of games that were played one month ago, Chelsea face Newcastle, the first side to beat them this season, while joint leaders Manchester City travel to Goodison Park where they have lost 10 of 17 meetings.

And, Arsenal can expect another battling encounter against Stoke who have beaten them in their last two meetings - with Liverpool hoping there's no reappearance of the beach ball that assisted Darren Bent against Sunderland in 2009.

Chelsea are one of four teams to come up against their bogey sides in the Premier League this weekend

CHELSEA vs NEWCASTLE 

AS mentioned, Newcastle were the first side to beat Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea this season and have won four of the last six meetings between the two sides. 

Unfortunately for them they will be missing their main man. Papiss Cisse  has scored four against Chelsea, his best haul against any Premier League team, but the Senegal striker is at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Key Man: In Cisse’s absence, goal-scoring responsibilities will fall on Ayoze Perez. The summer signing is the club’s second-top scorer this season with five in 19 PL appearances.

SUNDERLAND vs LIVERPOOL

Since Darren Bent’s beachball-assisted goal in 2009, Sunderland have given Liverpool some tough tests. 

They have held them to three draws at Anfield, including last month’s 0-0, and have worried Liverpool’s defence, even in defeat.

Key Man: Costel Pantilimon could be important for Gus Poyet’s side. His saves to shots rate of 78 per cent is the best of any keeper this season.

EVERTON vs MANCHESTER CITY 

City might have won the last three games between the teams but they still don’t like travelling to Goodison Park. 

Despite a 3-2 away win last season, City have lost 10 of their 17 Premier League games at Everton, drawing four and winning just three.

Key Man: Romelu Lukaku. The powerful forward had a good game against West Ham and will hope to improve Everton’s hit rate. They not scored in four of their last six games.

ARSENAL vs STOKE 

Arsenal never have an easy time of it against Stoke. Mark Hughes’ side have won the past two games, including a 3-2 thriller last month, and have only lost three of their last eight against Arsenal. 

The good news for Arsenal is they have not lost at home to Stoke in the Premier League.

Key Man: Peter Crouch has scored eight against Arsenal, his joint-highest total against any club (the other being Blackburn).
