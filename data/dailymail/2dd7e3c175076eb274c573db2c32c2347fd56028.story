David Cameron’s assault on cheap alcohol descended into a fiasco last night within hours of its launch.

Drinks firms threatened legal action over the Prime Minister’s controversial plans to tackle the scourge of binge-drinking by imposing a minimum price of about 40p per unit on alcoholic drinks.

They claim the proposal is illegal under EU competition law. Some ministers are also understood to fear that the strategy could fall foul of the courts.

Public health minister Anne Milton recently told MPs that minimum pricing was ‘illegal’ while Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, is also believed to have warned Cabinet colleagues that it may breach European rules.

Tackling the scourge: The idea behind minimum pricing is to increase the price of super-strength ciders, cheap vodka and special brew lagers to dissuade binge-drinking and reduce its toll on health services, police and society in general

Alan Johnson, Labour’s former Home Secretary, revealed yesterday that he had considered imposing a minimum alcohol price when he was in office – but was repeatedly told by government legal advisers it would be against both British and European law.

Last night Mr Cameron stood accused of hurriedly bringing forward the alcohol strategy in an attempt to distract attention from George Osborne’s Budget, which has been attacked from all sides for imposing a ‘granny tax’ on pensioners.

The announcement had been pencilled in for next Monday, but it was instead unveiled to a half-empty House of Commons yesterday – highly unusual as MPs are usually in their constituencies on Fridays.

Indeed, this was only the fourth time in ten years that a minister has made an announcement to the house on a Friday – previous occasions tackled the more urgent topics of Libya, swine flu and Iraq.

The idea behind minimum pricing is to increase the price of super-strength ciders, cheap vodka and special brew lagers to dissuade binge-drinking and reduce its toll on health services, police and society in general.

Announcing the plans yesterday, Home 
Secretary Theresa May even suggested that the minimum price could end up
 being as high as 50p a unit.

But critics say it will punish responsible drinkers on low incomes at a time of austerity.

Last night Gavin Partington, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which represents drinks producers, warned the Government to prepare for a court battle, saying: ‘We think this is going to lead ultimately to legal challenges. Minimum pricing is illegal under European laws.

‘It would be a drinks company taking the case, or perhaps a group of drinks companies. It is too early to say at the moment... but looking at case law, there is every reason to believe it is illegal.’

Article 34 of the EU Treaty says countries cannot impose restrictions on trade between countries. In 1978, the European Court of Justice ruled that Dutch legislation setting out minimum prices for certain spirits was illegal as it placed imports at a disadvantage.

The Coalition’s alcohol strategy also includes plans to ban buy-one-get-one-free alcohol deals and other bulk discounts.

Mrs May said: ‘This strategy is 
targeted explicitly at dangerous drinkers, problem pubs, irresponsible 
shops and harmful drinks. Those who enjoy a quiet drink or two have 
nothing to fear from our proposals. The local pub has nothing to fear, 
the responsible off-licence has nothing to fear.

‘This is a comprehensive strategy to 
take back our town centres from the drunken thugs and to restore them to
 the law-abiding majority.’

But
 Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘It’s gesture politics of the 
worst kind, it’s the Nanny State running riot. It’s a tax on poorer 
people – it won’t affect the price David Cameron pays for a bottle of 
wine.’

Legal threat: Drinks firms say imposing a minimum price of about 40p per unit on alcoholic drinks is illegal under EU competition law

Fellow Tory MP Nigel Mills said there was a danger minimum pricing would lead to a surge in black-market alcohol brought over from the Continent.

Sam Bowman, head of research at the Right-wing Adam Smith Institute, said: ‘Minimum alcohol pricing is anti-fun Victorian paternalism, and the Government is engaged in a misguided moral crusade against drinking.’

However, the plans were welcomed by health professionals and the police.

A Downing Street source said Mr Cameron was confident that minimum pricing was legal, stating: ‘There has been a big misunderstanding about this. If we were setting a market price in order to protect our domestic industry then that would be illegal, but that is not what we are doing.’
