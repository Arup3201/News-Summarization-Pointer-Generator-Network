David Cameron is hosting arch-Eurocrat Herman Van Rompuy for dinner at Chequers tonight, just weeks before crucial European elections.

The Tory leader will dine with the President of the European Council, who is also due to stay the night at the Prime Minister’s official rural retreat.

Nigel Farage said the timing of Mr Cameron’s intimate meal with the Brussels bureaucrat ‘could not be better’ as Ukip prepared to unveil a £1.5million poster campaign attacking immigration from the EU.

David Cameron has invited President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, for dinner at Chequers

Mr Van Rompuy is expected to stay the night at Chequers, although Downing Street would not comment on whether he would be served a continental breakfast

Mr Cameron has sought to win back disaffected Tories who have been won over by Ukip with the promise of an in-out referendum.

The Prime Minister says he will claw back powers from Brussels, before staging a vote by the end of 2017.

He has held a series of meetings with other European leaders who also want to see reform, particularly over access to benefits by EU migrants and red-tape strangling business.

Ukip is poised to top the polls in European Parliament elections on May 22.

But Mr Cameron’s decision to give Mr Van Rompuy the honour of dinner at Chequers will be contrasted with Ukip's regional push to appeal to voters concerned about immigration.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'This is one of a number of meetings that President Van Rompuy is having with heads of government around Europe.

'It is an opporunity to talk around the future direction of the next European Commission and EU reform priorities.

'Also I am sure they will discuss the latest on the situation in Ukraine. It is a working dinner.'

The spokesman confirmed Mr Van Rompuy would also be staying the night: 'If someone is coming for dinner in the evening, it is polite to ask them to stay the night.'

However, he refused to be drawn on whether he would be served a continental breakfast tomorrow morning.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage contrasted the dinner at Chequers with his own trip to Sheffield today to launch his controversial posters

Mr Farage told MailOnline voters on May 22 could deliver a 'severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake'

But Mr Farage told MailOnline: 'How entirely and utterly appropriate. David Cameron equals Herman Van Rompuy. Nigel Farage equals Sheffield.’

‘It says absolutely everything about David Cameron. The timing could not be better.

‘This is a European election that matters. You can make a difference. If you are with us and the 77 per cent people who think immigration needs to be controlled, vote Ukip.

‘You could deliver a severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake on May 22.’

However, Ukip has become embroiled in a fresh racism row after it unveiled the billboards which will appear across the country in the run-up to polling day.

The party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’

Controversial:
 Ukip's new posters are being funded by £1.5m of funding from 
millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Skyes to launch its biggest ever 
publicity drive ahead of the European Parliament elections in May

Adverts: Under the slogan 'take back control of 
our country', the party complain that 75 per cent of British laws are made 
in Brussels and that UK taxpayers fund the 'celebrity lifestyle' of EU 
bureaucrats

Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’

All the posters call on voters to ‘Take Back Control of Our Country’ by backing Ukip in the European elections.

Tory MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, wrote on Twitter: ‘At a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant.’

Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘UKIP would have us believe they stand for working people but the truth is very different - they're even more right wing than the Tories.

‘A vote for UKIP is a vote for higher taxes for working families, charges to see your GP, huge tax giveaways for the rich and even deeper cuts to public services. Only Labour can make Britain better off.’

Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said the posters were ‘extreme even by the standards of the Front Nationale’, the French far right party Mr Farage has tried to distance Ukip from.
