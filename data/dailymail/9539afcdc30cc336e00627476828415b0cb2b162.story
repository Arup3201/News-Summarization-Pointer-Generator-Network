Flush British Gas bosses have splurged £10,000 on a festive Alton Towers 'jolly' for staff in charge of cutting off customers who cannot afford to pay their bills.

Warrant officers - who can break into homes to shut off the power - were sent to the Staffordshire theme park to learn how to cope with irate customers after the energy giant's 9.2 per cent price hike.

In return they were put up in a £60-a-night hotel and enjoyed a three-course meal in a function room decked out in fairy lights and sprinkled with fake snow.

Around 80 'debt team' staff had to attend a series of seminars over two days, British Gas said.

Campaigners against fuel poverty today accused 'disgraceful' British Gas of 'rewarding those responsible for condemning people to poor health and death'.

'It beggar's belief that the company is still spending 
money on parties and hotel rooms for staff when customers are finding it
so hard to pay their bills. It's extra insulting when the staff being 
wined and dined are the ones who cut people off,' a company insider told the Mirror.

Fuel Poverty Action added: 'Taking staff on a jolly may be fun for them but millions are facing a cold harsh winter.'

Track record: Last month British Gas sent customer service staff on a £20,000 'morale boosting' trip to a hotel for a talent show

Warrant officers are a form of bailiff, who are given permission by magistrates to break into a home if the householder or landlord has failed to pay his bills for a prolonged period.

They then cut off the electricity or gas.

British Gas said today that the staff from all over Britain were at Alton Towers.

'The two day event at the Alton Towers conference centre consisted of seven seminars for our field based debt team. The staff involved in the training live around the country so we provided them with accommodation and a meal, after which they bought their own drinks,' a spokesman said.

It came three weeks after the company sent workers on a £20,000 'morale boosting' talent show at another hotel.

Yesterday official figures revealed the spending of the average family has fallen by £18.40 a week since 2010, mainly because of spiralling energy bills.

The Office for National Statistics said families have cut back on driving and going out to restaurants to pay for gas and electricity.

Researchers said that higher spending in ‘housing, fuel and power’ was ‘driven in part by rises in electricity and gas prices, and this is an area where there may be limited scope for many households to reduce consumption’.
