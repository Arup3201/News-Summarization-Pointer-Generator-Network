Tottenham have hijacked Liverpool's move for Sevilla left back Alberto Moreno by tabling a £14million offer plus Roberto Soldado on loan and including midfielder Etienne Capoue.

Moreno is one of the hottest properties in Spain at the moment and has attracted interest among England's elite including Chelsea and Liverpool.

The 
Anfield club were thought to be leading the race to sign the exciting 
21-year-old. But new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino wants to make Moreno
 his first summer signing and has given the green light to the lucrative
 offer.

Cut: Moreno (back) is a Spain international but narrowly missed out on their World Cup squad

Pochettino has made the capture of a new left-back a top summer priority and will now go toe-to-toe with Brendan Rodgers to get his man.

Liverpool have offered £20m for the defender, but Sevilla value Moreno at £25m.

However the Reds are still favourites to land Moreno due to their participation in next season's Champions League.

It remains unclear what Sevilla's 
response to Spurs' offer has been, but the Spanish club will hope for a 
bidding war between Liverpool and Tottenham in the coming days.

Future potential: Moreno has three caps for Spain at just 21-years-old

Anguish: Roberto Soldado has been offered to Sevilla on loan as part of the deal having scored just two Premier League goals from open play in his first season at Tottenham

Frustration: Soldado joined Spurs in a £26million move from Valencia but struggled to adapt to the first team

They have also thrown in Capoue, who cost £8million, but will move to Seville for nothing, although Spurs retain 50 per cent of his re-sale fee.

Interestingly, Tottenham's decision to include Soldado as part of the deal raises serious question marks over the striker's future at White Hart Lane.

The forward arrived from Valencia last summer with the reputation of being a prolific goalscorer, but failed to live up to his billing as he struggled for goals in his first season.

And it now looks like he has been deemed surplus to requirements by Pochettino.
