British teenagers are too lazy to do the ‘menial’ jobs snapped up by immigrant workers which keep the economy moving, Boris Johnson claimed today.

In a highly-provocative intervention, the London Mayor backed TV chef Jamie Oliver who complained about ‘wet behind the ears’ youngsters who ‘whinge’ about working long hours.

Mr Johnson said that far from being ‘apoplectic’ at the claims, he was left ‘vaguely depressed’ by the fact that too many young Brits lacked the drive to seize every opportunity which comes their way.

Good point: Boris Johnson told the Tory party conference that too many young Brits view some jobs as too 'menial' for them to accept

Question: The London Mayor suggested some young Londoners ate not always able and willing to take up opportunities

In a speech to the Conservative party conference, Mr Johnson said he knew he had ‘probably got myself in trouble’ with his criticism of youngsters, adding: ‘But then, that is my job.’

He told delegates: ‘This is where the speech gets tricky - the question we have got to ask ourselves is: are young Londoners always able and willing to take up opportunities in the opportunity city that we are trying to create?’

He said Oliver 'had a point' when he complained that European immigrants were 'much stronger, much tougher' than Brits and warned his restaurants would close without them.

Mr Johnson said more needed to be done to persuade youngsters to view the low-paid, low-skilled jobs which London 
creates in such abundance as 'stepping stones, as a beginning to a life in 
work that can take them anywhere'.

Boris Johnson

At the 2006 Tory conference, Mr Johnson fell out with Jamie Oliver over the chef’s campaign to make school meals healthier.

Addresing
David Cameron in the conference hall today, Mr Johnson said: ‘Dave, I 
have made it a rule of these conferences never to disagree with Jamie 
Oliver, because last time I did so I was put in a pen and pelted with 
pork pies by the media.

‘But
the other day he said something that made me gulp because he was 
complaining about the work ethic of young people these days.’

Agreement: The London Mayor backed TV chef Jamie Oliver who complained about 'wet behind the ears' youngsters who ‘whinge’ about working long hours

Recognition: Mr Johnson said he could see 'looks of sad acknowledgement' on the faces of the audience as he read out Mr Oliver's remarks

Gulp: Mr Johnson said he knew he was going to get into trouble with his speech, but added: 'That's my job'

In an interview with Good Housekeeping in the summer, Oliver said: ‘The average working hours in a week was 80 to 100. That was really normal in my 20s. But the EU regulation now is 48 hours, which is half a week's work for me. And they still whinge about it.

‘British kids particularly, I have never seen anything so wet behind the ears!

‘I have mummies phoning up for 23-year-olds saying to me, 'My son is too tired'. On a 48-hour-week! Are you having a laugh?'

TV chef Jamie Oliver

Oliver added: ‘I think our European 
immigrant friends are much stronger, much tougher. If we didn't have 
any, all of my restaurants would close tomorrow. There wouldn't be any 
Brits to replace them.’

Turning
to the conference audience, Mr Johnson said: ‘I am seeing looks of 
apoplectic… no actually I can’t. I can see looks of sad acknowledgement.
I can see a vague depressed look of recognition.

‘I
know and you know that there are millions of British kids who are as 
dynamic and young people are as dynamic and go-getting and motivated as 
any potential millionaire masterchef, of course there are.

‘But my question is what if Jamie has a point, what if he has half a point, or even a quarter of a point.’

Controversy: Mr Johnson said Jamie Oliver may have phrased his attack in a 'provocative way' but admitted he was on to something

Future: Welfare, crime and education reforms are needed to better prepare young people for the jobs market

Applause: While Mr Johnson's speech was more downbeat in previous years, he received a standing ovation from delegates

Asking the audience if they agreed with Oliver, they shouted back: ‘Yes!’

Mr Johnson added: ‘He is on to something. He may have phrased it in a provocative way but he was saying something that I think resonates, right?

‘But if he has a point then we need to think about what are the possible origins for that difference in motivation that he claims to detect.

‘We need to think about what we politicians are doing about it. If it is to do with welfare as some people say it is then don’t we need Iain Duncan Smith to get on with reforming that system.

‘And if it’s to do with education as some people think it is then don’t we need Michael Gove to get on with his heroic work restoring rigour and realism to the classroom.

‘And getting away from the all must have prizes approach where all pupils must be above average in maths.’

Laughs: David Cameron was in the audience for Mr Johnson's joke-filled speech

Challenge: Mr Johnson said more needed to be done for young people to 'harness their talents more effectively'

Fans: Mr Johnson has been the centre of attention since arriving in Manchester for the Tory conference

He said young people also need ‘boundaries’ and ‘solidity to their lives’ to stop them falling into unemployment and crime.

‘We have got to tackle that complex of problems, crime, welfareism, educational underachievement.

‘And you’ve got to make sure that kids growing up in London are able to take the opportunities that our city offers and at the same time we must make sure that they don’t dismiss some jobs as “menial” which is a word I sometimes hear.

‘And they see them - those jobs which London creates in such abundance in the same way as Jamie Oliver’s eastern Europeans see them – as stepping stones, as a beginning to a life in work that can take them anywhere.

‘I think there is a vast and latent genius in these young people and if could harness their talents more effectively then they would not only have more fulfilling lives but we could drive even faster the great flywheel of the London economy that is now the most diverse in Europe.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted he was 'fudging' his response to questions about his political ambitions

Boris Johnson has admitted that he is 'fudging' over whether he could make a return to the Commons at the general election.

There has been growing speculation that the mayor of London could become an MP again before the end of his term in 2016.

David Cameron fuelled the rumours by disclosing that he had discussed the idea with Mr Johnson.

The Prime Minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the mayor could 'absolutely' make a comeback before the country goes to the polls in 17 months' time, and said he would give him a 'warm welcome'.

Mr Johnson was mobbed by media and Tory activists as he toured the exhibition hall at the party's conference in Manchester.

During a round of broadcast interviews, he was asked by BBC Radio 5 Live whether he was determined to keep fudging his answers on whether he wanted to return as an MP in 2015.

'Yes,' he replied to laughter. Mr Johnson, who served as member for Henley until 2008, dodged a barrage of questions about the possibility of serving as mayor and an MP at the same time.

Stressing his commitment to his current role - to which he was re-elected last year - Mr Johnson said: 'I have got a huge job to do... I am going to give it my all.

'I don't want to leave office until some of the things we have got going are absolutely in the bag.

'The programme is to be mayor of London for the next 750 days, or whatever it is.'

Asked which parliamentary seats he could look at if he did seek a return, Mr Johnson said: 'The seat I want, I can describe it to you, it has a spongey bottom bit and it swivels and it is to be discovered in the office at City Hall.'

The mayor said Mr Cameron's words about him were 'very kind', but insisted the Tory leader was capable of winning the general election without his help.

'I am a toenail in the body politic,' he joked.
