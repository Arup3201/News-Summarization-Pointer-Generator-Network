It is an undisputed fact that when you mess you the bull, you get the horns, but what happens when you mess with your wife?

A video has surfaced online showing a drunken amateur matador trying to take on a bull during a festival in Peru, only to be forcefully stopped by his more clear-headed spouse.

The short clip, which has been uploaded online by Reuters, depicts the raucous, alcohol-drenched celebration of the annual Senor Espiritu Santo festival in the city of Ayacucho, which took place last Sunday.

She's not messing around: This clear-headed wife pushed her lush husband away from the bull he was planning to fight during an annual festival in Peru

Tough love: The woman smacked the man on the head to discourage him from getting back into the fray and pinned him to the fence

Driving her point home: The caring wife gave her beloved another whack just to make sure he doesn't go near the bull

The event traces its roots to the 17th century when Spanish rulers tried to incorporate indigenous people in their customs and celebrations.

Each year, the event culminates in amateur bullfights, which often result in injuries for the wannabe matadors. 

About 30 seconds into the clip, a woman shows up on screen pushing her 'inebriated' husband away from the action.

The visibly angry wife smacks the man on the back of the head, pins him against a nearby fence and then drives the message home with another whack.

Not for the faint of heart: The annual Senor Espiritu Santo festival in the Peruvian city of Ayacucho each year culminates in an amateur bullfight

Ancient tradition: Bullfighting came to Peru in the 17th century with the arrival of Spaniards

Gored: The bullfight held in a makeshift ring  left at least 10 people injured

No time to waste: Spectators in the crowd jumped in to help gored bullfighters and drag them to safety

Other participants of the festival, however, were not as lucky, probably because they did not have loving spouses to look after them.

The bullfight held in a makeshift ring quickly got out of control and left at least 10 people injured.

Spectators in the crowd jumped in to assist gored and mauled bullfighters and drag them to safety. One young boy jumped on top of a car to avoid the bull's path.

According to local media, many of the aspiring matadors appeared to be intoxicated during the festivities.

Crime and punishment: A drunken ring assistant who untied the rope used to protect participants was later lashed by the crowd

Panic ensued when a drunken ring assistant untied the rope used to protect participants from the increasingly enraged animal sporting a pair of massive horns.

When the bull was freed, it charged toward the crowd causing spectators to flee. The man responsible for releasing the bull was later grabbed by members in the crowd and publicly lashed as punishment.
