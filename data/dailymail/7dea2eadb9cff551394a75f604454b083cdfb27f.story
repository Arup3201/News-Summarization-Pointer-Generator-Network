Confidence among firms has risen to its highest level in five years as Britain leads its main rivals on the road to recovery.

The optimism of company bosses is backed by figures indicating that the UK is outpacing Germany, France, Japan, the US and even China.

Both sets of results will be a major fillip to Chancellor George Osborne who has declared that the economy has moved from ‘rescue to recovery’.

David Cameron will also be cheered as the Prime Minister has talked repeatedly about being in a ‘global race’.

The bullish prognosis for Britain comes from a survey of global economies by US banking giant JP Morgan and analysts Markit.

Their examination of services and manufacturing shows activity in these crucial sectors grew at its fastest pace for 16 years in July, even beating China.

Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ‘The UK is showing stronger growth at the start of the third quarter than America and its eurozone competitors.

‘Although there have been some signs of stabilisation in the eurozone, it is still hovering around the stagnation mark.’

The comments underline official figures which show the recovery is gathering pace in Britain. The economy grew 0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of June, double that in the first quarter of 2013.

There has also been a flurry of positive data in recent weeks, with strong growth in car sales, manufacturing and house prices.

These signs of revival have cheered bosses, with a closely watched report showing that confidence is at its highest level since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008.

The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development analysis shows that employers expect to hire more staff this quarter – which would help to make it the sixth consecutive quarter of jobs growth.

It also shows that the net employment balance – which measures the difference between the proportion of employers who expect to increase staffing levels and the proportion who expect to cut jobs – has hit 14 in the second quarter. This marks an increase from nine in the first three months of the year.

Mark Beatson, CIPD chief economist, said: ‘These results suggest we should see further jobs growth over the summer and autumn, and hopefully reflect a degree of optimism about growth prospects.’

The decline in British wages is the fourth worst in the EU since the downturn began, according to official figures. 

Workers here have endured more savage cuts to their wages than even the Cypriots. Figures from the House of Commons library show average hourly wages have fallen 5.5 per cent since mid-2010, adjusted for inflation.

This marks the fourth biggest decline out of the EU’s 27 members since 2008.British workers saw their salaries fall almost twice as steeply as those in Cyprus, which received a bailout from Europe in March. Only Greek, Portuguese and Dutch workers have fared worse.

Hourly wages in Germany rose by 2.7 per cent in the past three years. Experts have warned there is little to suggest that salaries will rise soon. 

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said a third of British workers who stayed in the same job endured a wage cut or freeze between 2010 and 2011.

Last night the Treasury said it has taken 2.7 million people out of income tax by raising personal allowances to £10,000.

A spokesman said: ‘The economy is on the mend, but we appreciate that times are still tough for families.’

Details of wage levels emerged as  official figures are expected to confirm that inflation remains well above the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target.

The Consumer Prices Index is set to show prices up 2.8 per cent in July after a 14-month high of 2.9 per cent in June.

However, the economic crisis has taken
its toll on pay packets, with wages in the UK recording one of the 
largest falls in the European Union, official figures show.

Mr Beatson warned: ‘There is little 
sign of improved confidence about employment prospects feeding through 
into pay expectations, which remain below the rate of inflation.

‘Clearly employers feel they do not 
need to raise pay to meet recruitment goals and, with turnover low, 
retention is unlikely to be a pressing issue for most organisations.’

Yesterday Shadow Treasury Minister 
Chris Leslie said: ‘Despite indications the economy is improving, the 
reality is that most ordinary people are struggling to stand still.

‘Even those who have not seen a cut 
in their wages are seeing the pound in their pocket shrink in value 
because of high inflation.’
