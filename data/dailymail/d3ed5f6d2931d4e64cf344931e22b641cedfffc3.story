The world's smallest woman has big shoes to fill sitting next to Brahim Takioullah. 

Jyoti Amge, who is just 2ft tall, is dwarfed by the 1ft 3in soles of Takioullah who has been officially recognised by Guinness World Records as having the biggest feet out there. 

They are four times larger than those of 19-year-old Jyoti Amge, the world's smallest woman.

Ms Amge, who is 2ft tall and from Nagpar in India, has feet measuring 3.72in long, which look tiny compared with those of the 31-year-old Moroccan who holds the title of the world's second-tallest man at 8ft 1in.

The pair have posed for a series of photos to highlight their difference in size as part of an attempt to get thousands of people's feet into the record books.

The Amazing Feet challenge is one of the largest mass-participation world records ever attempted, with 50,000 pairs of feet needed to be photographed and uploaded on the officiallyamazing.tv/feet website to set a world record for the largest online photo album of feet.

Anyone wishing to get involved can submit a photo of their feet to the website.

Amazing Feet is running all summer and is open to the public.

Last year Ms Amge reached new political heights joining a campaign for Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) win the civic elections in Mumbai.

She has also previously spoken about her dreams to be a Bollywood actress. Ms Amge suffers from achondroplasia, a bone degeneration disorder that leads to dwarfism.
