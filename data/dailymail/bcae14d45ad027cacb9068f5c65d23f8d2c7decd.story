The two British drug mules held in Peru face being handed 15-year sentences this week as their hopes of a more lenient jail term crumble.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, agreed to plead guilty to smuggling £1.5million’s worth of cocaine in the hope their term would be reduced to six years and eight months.

But with sentencing due to take place in a closed court in Lima on Tuesday, the girls’ lawyers have so far been unable to agree a plea bargain with prosecutors.

Melissa revealed her despair in a prison diary.

She wrote: ‘I have prepared myself for the worst . . . I think of how I will be in 15 years . . . and yes it does still scare me.

‘I would really like to have this over with by Christmas because the fear of the unknown makes me more anxious. I’ve been waiting four months already and the delays and changes are annoying.’

The diary displays Melissa’s fears about being transferred after sentencing to the prison Ancon 2.

It is miles from Lima, making it much harder for her family to see her. 

She is also terrified that she will be separated from Michaella, with whom she has shared a cell since their arrest.

She
 added: ‘I am consistently aware of my immediate transfer to Ancon after
 my sentence and would much rather stay in [Virgen de] Fatima for the 
Christmas period because of the fear of the unknown in Ancon.

‘[It is] really far from Lima making 
visiting much more difficult for my family when they come and it’s over 
populated so I could possibly be separated from Michaella. (That’s 
something I have not prepared myself for).’

Melissa revealed her despair in a prison diary. She wrote: 'I have prepared myself for the worst... I think of how I will be in 15 years... and yes it does still scare me' 

Last night Melissa’s distraught family were praying for their daughter to receive the minimum sentence. Melissa’s father Billy said: ‘This is a really tense time for us – we’ve been told sentencing is going ahead on Tuesday. Melissa has done everything she can, we just have to hope and pray for the best now.’

Writing from her cell, Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, also described her devastation at being told that under current Peruvian law she does not qualify for the benefits that allow some prisoners to get out after serving only a third of their sentence.

The girls had hoped that by working or studying they could use the privilege to cut a six-year jail term to just over two years.

She wrote: ‘All this time the idea was I would be sentenced to six years eight months but then serve a third of that if I worked or studied [in prison] – so roughly two years three months – but now I will have to serve the full sentence.

‘I have never been someone to 100 per cent believe something someone tells me without evidence but of course being told I would be doing two years three months gave me somewhat of a rough guide when realistically it’s actually miles off what I will be doing.’

She added: ‘Apparently things regarding the law in Peru change so much that anything could happen. Who knows, the president might give a pardon and want all of the Europeans chucked out of Peru.’

The pair have served more than four months in the squalid Virgen de Fatima prison since being arrested in August trying to carry 24lb of cocaine on to a flight to Spain from Lima’s international airport.

The girls initially claimed they were kidnapped on the party island of Ibiza during a summer of partying and forced at gunpoint to traffic the drugs.

Although they subsequently declared their willingness to plead guilty, the Peruvian authorities have yet to officially accept the pleas, which means they could still be given the maximum of 15 years.

Sentencing has already been delayed twice as Peruvian judges strike for higher pay.

Although it has been set for Tuesday, a last-minute delay is still possible.

If the girls are given seven years or less they are eligible to apply for transfer to the UK, though this must be agreed by both governments.

The girls will also be required to pay a civil fine before release, likely to be several thousand pounds each.

On Tuesday, a day Melissa described as ‘one of the worst yet’, the women were driven to a court for sentencing – even though their lawyers had already told them that it would be postponed.

She wrote: ‘I was marched to court for nothing. I was transported all day from Fatima to Sarita Colonia [prison] then to other places. I kept wondering what was taking so long but I guess I will never know. Finally I was brought back to Fatima.’
