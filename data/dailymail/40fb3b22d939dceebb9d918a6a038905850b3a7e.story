The Apple store in Pudong, Shanghai is a temple for all who religiously follow the technology giant’s products.

And now Apple has been granted a patent, not for one of its products, but the giant glass cylinder staircase that sits at the heart of the Chinese outlet.

The staircase is comprised of a glass tube that has curved glass stairs snaking around it.

The glass tube has a white Apple logo floating inside, and a small, shallow moat surrounding it.

The glass cylinder leads to the local underground beneath a square central business district of Lujiazui in Pudong.

It was designed by architect Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, who has also worked with Apple stores in New York and in London. 

Apple's patent not only covers the design of the cylinder, but more also the type of glass and construction methods

Apple's patent not only covers the design of the cylinder, but more also the type of glass and construction methods used to erect such a structure, according to Apple Insider.

The Shanghai cylinder is made almost entirely out of huge monolithic glass slabs, with only connecting joints made out of metal.

‘The Chinese build is more complex, however, as the specifications required the glass pieces be curved to form arcs. These panels were then joined to create a circle and ultimately a cylinder,’ said the report.

The whole look of the store, conceived by Steve Jobs, is now covered by a number of U.S patents.

The store on Shanghai's Hong Kong Plaza opened three years ago, on the same day a second Chinese store opened in Beijing.

Apple already has a 2007 granted patent covering the Store's famous in-store glass straight staircase for which CEO Steve Jobs is listed as one of the inventors.

The company is reported to be looking at similar cylindrical design for future stores.
