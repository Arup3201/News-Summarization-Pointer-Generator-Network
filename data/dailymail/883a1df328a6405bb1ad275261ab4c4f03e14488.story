Her remarkably smooth skin and taut complexion has already attracted plenty of attention. But yesterday it was Amanda Holden’s eyebrows that were, well, raising eyebrows.

Gone were the wispy blonde strands that once framed her eyes – and in their place were darker, well-defined arches that helped make the 43-year-old look more youthful than ever as she arrived to begin auditions for this year’s series of Britain’s Got Talent.

Her secret? It appears Miss Holden is now a devotee of HD Brows, the £40 once-a-month treatment also beloved of celebrities including fellow Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon, singer Tulisa Contostavlos and Strictly star Frankie Bridge.

The HD – ‘high definition’ – process has seven steps designed to sculpt the eyebrows and combat the sparse look that plagues many women after years of over-plucking.

Launched by beauty specialist Nilam Patel, it includes treatment to stimulate hair growth, followed by colouring, shaping and applying make-up to give a dramatic finish. 

The number of treatments needed to achieve the desired look varies, but upkeep sessions are recommended every four to six weeks.

Last night a source close to Miss Holden said: ‘Amanda has let her eyebrows grow and has a brow shaping treatment called HD Brows by Nilam [Patel] at Eyebrow Queen.’

Alison Eiffe, an HD Brow specialist who works at Reveal Salons in Farringdon, London, said: ‘The look that HD Brows gives you is very symmetrical and measured so it looks great on camera.

‘It’s the combination of all seven steps that gives you a really crisp and sharp outline.’ 

The seven-step process starts with a consultation, at which clients may be given a daily cream to stimulate hair growth. 

The second step is the application of an eyebrow tint and the third is to design the desired shape of the brows. 

Amanda's brows are considerably thicker than they were before, they also appear to be darker thanks to the £40-a-month treatment

In the fourth step, the desired shape is created by waxing; in the fifth, the eyebrows are threaded to remove any fine hairs that escaped the wax; and in the sixth, tweezers are used to pluck any remaining hairs and give a sharp, precise finish. 

The final step is to add liner and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps. Mother of two Miss Holden has previously admitted to using Botox to smooth her skin, but has since said she has stopped.
