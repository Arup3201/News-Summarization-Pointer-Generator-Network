The Obama administration has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warning signs over the past two years that showed a growing number of unaccompanied children from Central America were crossing the Mexican border into the U.S.

Agencies like the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as politicians north and south of the border were all ‘ringing alarm bells’ about the federal government’s capacity to manage the situation, according to a report presented to the Department of Homeland Security in March.

The 41-page report was compiled by a team from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).

The Obama administration has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warning signs over the past two years that showed a growing number of unaccompanied children from Central America were crossing the Mexican border into the U.S.

In August 2013, the researchers had discovered a makeshift transportation depot manned by Border Patrol agents at the Fort Brown station in Brownsville, Texas.

Thirty agents were assigned to perform such tasks as washing the children's clothes, driving them to offsite showers, and making them sandwiches. 

The White House was even directly involved in efforts to care for immigrant children in early 2012 when it helped negotiate a temporary shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.

Yet the Obama administration considered the problem a ‘local’ one.

‘There were warning signs, operational folks raising red flags to high levels in terms of this being a potential issue,’ an anonymous former senior federal law enforcement official told The Washington Post.

Obama’s domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, has denied that the administration was slow to react and said the current crisis is 'off-the-charts different.'

'It was not the same pattern,' she said. 'We assumed a significant increase, but this was not the same kind of trend line.'

The Border Patrol has since revised their original estimate of 60,000 children for the year to 90,000 illegally entering the country by the end of September.

Last month, Obama ordered an emergency 
response overseen by the National Security Council and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, and asked Congress to approve $3.7 
billion in emergency funds.

The UTEP report also claims that warnings came from outside the federal government as well.

The first ladies of Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico cited 'worrisome statistics' showing an upswing in unaccompanied minors in April 2012.

The same month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry wrote a letter informing the president that the number of unaccompanied Central American minors crossing the border was up 90 percent from the previous year.

He criticized the Obama administration for 'perpetuating the problem' by its inaction.

'Every day of delay risks more lives,' wrote Perry. 'Every child allowed to remain encourages hundreds more to attempt the journey.'

During the president's 2012 reelection campaign he announced plans to defer the deportations of certain immigrants brought to the country illegally as children before June 2007.

Critics now argue that the administration chose to ignore reports about the growing number of immigrant children and instead focused on trying to push his reform bill through Congress.

'Was the White House told there were huge flows of Central Americans coming? Of course they were told. A lot of times,' one former government official told the Post.

'Was there a general lack of interest and a focus on the legislation? Yes, that’s where the focus was.'

The flood of children crossing the Mexican border illegally and without their parents has slowed down in recent weeks, two senior Obama administration officials said on Friday.

Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas have found fewer than 500 children crossing the border illegally this week, the officials said.

Last month, agents arrested as many as 2,000 child immigrants a week.

The Obama administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since Oct. 1. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said earlier this month that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied child immigrants could be apprehended by the end of the budget year in September. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and El Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren will meet with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on July 25.

Biden has been the point person for contacts with these Central American leaders. He last spoke to them by phone on July 9 and was in Guatemala for meetings on June 20.

The U.S. has been urging those governments to take steps to stem the exodus of children and warning that the U.S. will take steps to send them back promptly.

The volume of child immigrants has significantly taxed resources at the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services departments in recent months and prompted President Barack Obama to ask Congress to approve an emergency $3.7 billion spending bill to deal with the situation he has called an "urgent humanitarian crisis."

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the latest trends in border arrests, said Friday it's too soon to know what has led to drop in border arrests.

They said illegal border crossings along the Mexican border tend to slow during the summer.

Prospects for action on the U.S.-Mexico border crisis faded on Thursday as lawmakers traded accusations rather than solutions, raising chances that Congress will go into its summer recess without doing anything about the tens of thousands of migrant children streaming into South Texas

Customs and Border Protection has launched a public relations campaign to warn would-be immigrants and their families in Central America that the trip to the U.S. border is dangerous and immigrant children will face deportation after they are apprehended.

But since the trip through Mexico can take weeks or even months, recent border crossers are unlikely to have seen much of the campaign.

Along with dealing with the flood of children traveling alone, the Border Patrol has also arrested more than 55,000 people traveling as families, mostly mothers with young children.

Because of a lack of detention space many of those people have been released with a notice to report back to immigration authorities at a later date.

The Obama administration has repeatedly declined to say how many people have been released and how many have reported as ordered.

In recent weeks the Homeland Security Department has opened a family detention center with space for as many as 700 people center in Artesia, New Mexico, at the Border Patrol's training facility.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday that a detention center in Karnes County, Texas, would be converted to house families starting in the next few weeks. That facility currently has space for 600 people.
