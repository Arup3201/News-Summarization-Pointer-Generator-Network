Top U.S colleges swamped their 
international rivals in wealth-stakes. On a global scale. Oxbridge 
universities were the only British institutions to make the cut.

17 of 
the top 20 wealth creators are U.S colleges.Despite the reputation of Oxford and 
Cambridge as bastions of the aristocratic elite, relatively few of their
 multi-millionaires inherited their wealth.

More than two thirds of Oxbridge 
alumni worth more than Â£20million made their fortunes through their own 
efforts with no help from their families.

The overwhelming majority of 
'ultra-high-net-worth individuals' from U.S. colleges are male.

Only 8% 
of Harvard's wealthy alumni are women.

For Yale graduates, the situation is even more one-sided - 96 per cent of its super-wealthy alumni are men.

MIT has the lowest female representation at 2%
