A teenager who had plastic surgery after being bullied for years about her looks has returned to school and said she is ready to forgive her tormentors.

Nadia Ilse, 14, was born with bilateral lop-eared deformities - a condition which means the folds within the ear are missing and part of the ear sticks out.

In June, she underwent surgery and had a nose job, a chin implant and her ears were pinned back.

Before and after: Nadia Ilse, 14, from Georgia, was born with bilateral lop-eared deformities on both ears, a condition where the person is missing the folds within the ear and the bowl of the ear sticks out

Previously she had worn her hair over her ears to cover them, but after the surgery she returned to school, starting ninth grade with her hair pulled back off her face for the first time in years, reported ABC News.

The bullying at her school in Georgia, had become so bad that she often had to stop herself from crying and traveled home from school in tears.

'They said I have the biggest ears that 
they've ever seen, they called me Dumbo, elephant ears, Nadia said.

Surgery: Nadia had a chin implant to balance her face and a nose job to fix a deviated septum. In total, the she received $40,000 worth of surgery for free

She did not want to tell her mother of the bullying because having recently lost her job, Lynda was
already coping with increasing medical bills for her 9-year-old son, 
Josh,

Nadia's younger brother has cerebral palsy and is due to undergo heart surgery soon.

Instead she told her mother she was 
suffering from migraines so when Lynda did find out she was shocked, but
a year later Lynda's mother agreed to plastic surgery

'I let Nadia make the decision. She's 
been begging me for so long to get her ears pinned back and so that's 
what she wanted to do and so I just supported her,' said Lynda.

Previously she had worn her hair over her ears, left, but after the surgery she returned to school, starting ninth grade with her hair pulled back off her face right, for the first time in years

Nadia's mother explained that in her view it was no different to someone having braces to correct their teeth. 

The Little Baby Face Foundation, a 
Manhattan-based organization which provides free surgeries for children with facial deformities agreed to take on Nadia's case.

Ear surgery, or otoplasty, is the most common
plastic surgery procedure among teens, with over 11,000 surgeries 
performed last year, according to The American Society for 
Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. 

Tense times: Nadia did not want to tell her mother of the bullying because having recently lost her job, Lynda was already coping with medical bills for her 9-year-old son, Josh, who has cerebral palsy

Dr. Thomas Romo, the president of the 
organization and the head of facial plastic surgery at Lenox Hill 
Hospital in New York City, said Nadia was a candidate because of her deformities and not because she was bullied.

He said she met the foundation's 
criteria to have the corrective surgery, even her deformities may not have seemed appeared extreme.

Nadia originally went to the foundation to her ear 
pinned back, but after a consultation Dr. Romo also suggested she get a chin implant to 
balance her face.

The bullying had become so bad that she often 
had to stop herself from crying in front of her the bullies and traveled
home from school in tears

She also had surgery on her nose to fix a deviated septum.

In total, Nadia received $40,000 worth of surgery for free through the foundation.

Nadia is now due to undergone counseling after the years of bullying.

'I believe in forgiveness, but I will 
never forget the times that they did that, the times they made fun of 
me, and the times they hurt me,' she said. 'You have to make them earn 
it.'
