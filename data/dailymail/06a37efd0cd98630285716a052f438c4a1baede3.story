Usain Bolt has pulled out of races in Ostrava and Paris over the next month, and the world and Olympic 100 metres champion is fast running out of time to be fit enough to compete at the Commonwealth Games this summer.

Bolt has yet to commit to representing Jamaica in Glasgow but was expected to contest at least the 200 metres, after potentially running in the Diamond League meeting at Hampden Park on July 11 and 12.

But the world record-holder has taken to his Facebook page to apologise to fans for withdrawing from competitions in Ostrava in the Czech Republic and Paris, France on June 17 and July 5 after admitting he is 'not ready' to begin his European season.

Injured: Olympic and world 100m champion Usain Bolt has pulled out of two Diamond League meetings

Doubt: Bolt could miss out on representing Jamaica at next month's Commonwealth Games

Lightning: Bolt has won every title available except Commonwealth gold and he may miss out again

Bolt missed a large chunk of training
 earlier this year owing to a foot injury and, although he insists he 
has now fully recovered from the problem, he still feels he lacks 
sharpness and is behind in his training programme.

The
 27-year-old has competitions scheduled for later in August and 'hopes 
to be back soon' but is running out of time to be fit enough for the 
Commonwealth Games. The men's 200m starts on July 30.

Bolt
 said on his official website: 'As reported a few weeks ago I had to 
miss some training in late March and early April due to a foot injury. 
Thankfully my foot is 100 per cent healthy now and I am back in full 
training.

'Unfortunately 
due to the training that I missed I am behind where I am at normally at 
this time of year and will not be ready to race in the Ostrava Golden 
Spike meet or Meeting Areva in Paris.

'I hope to be back in competition soon but how soon will depend on my training in the next few weeks.

'It
 is important for me to take my time this year as I have three tough 
years ahead in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as I attempt to defend my World and 
Olympic titles.'

Champions: There was a Jamaican 1-2-3 in the 200m at the 2012 Olympics in London

Venue: Hampden Park will be the main athletics stadium at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games
