A woman who gained 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, started shedding the weight after running her first half marathon - and has since lost 135lbs.

Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, struggled with her weight her entire life before she was diagnosed with PCOS in 2000. Six years later she managed to slim down by following a grueling diet and exercise plan - but her restricting regimen wasn't sustainable and she soon began piling the pounds back on, gaining 120lbs. In 2013 however, she underwent lap band surgery to help control her weight, and was soon inspired to start running. 

'I was always drawn to that finish-line feeling, but I never thought running was possible for me,' she told Woman's Day. 

Shocking transformation: Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, lost 135lbs after having lap band surgery in 2013 

Starting out: Before she lost the weight (L), Michelle joined a running team and began training for her first half marathon. She finished her second New York City Half Marathon this month (R) 

'It was difficult and painful when I was heavier,' she recalled. 'But I was so motivated by my friend's story of how exciting her race was. I knew I wanted to try it.'

Michelle completed both the 2014 and 2015 New York City Half Marathons, and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the New York City Marathon this November.

Her training plan, which includes spin classes, bootcamp classes and weight lifting, as well as running, has helped her lose 135lbs. 

And now that she has slimmed down, Michelle is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back.

New woman: Michelle put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain (L).  After her weight loss surgery, she learned how to control her portions (R)

Not easy: Even though Michelle struggled to run when she was heavier, she stuck with it

'I used to hate dating and think I'd have to settle for just anybody, but I don't feel that way anymore,' she said. 'The most important change is I accept myself.'

Michelle noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs, she is finally happy with herself.

But getting to this point was far from easy for Michelle, who had tried almost everything to control her weight. 

Before she was diagnosed with PCOS in her senior year of high school, Michelle had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair.

More confident: Michelle said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation

PCOS made her insulin-resistant, so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight. She was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked.

Michelle eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist. She managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year, but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life. 

When the weight slowly crept back onto her frame, she finally considered lap band surgery, which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed. 

The procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, essentially shrinking stomach capacity.

Personal win: Michelle can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the New York City Half Marathon 

Michelle noted that she didn't want people to think she had 'taken the easy way out', but she quickly learned it was a 'tool, not a miracle'. 

She still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices, while maintaining a regular workout schedule. 

Michelle proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon.

And when one of her students congratulated her for winning the race, Michelle didn't correct her, explaining that, in a way, she felt like she had won after overcoming such adversity in order to achieve her goals.
