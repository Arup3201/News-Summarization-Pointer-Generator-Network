It is the 'holy grail' of Chinese porcelain, a 500-year-old antiquity owned by emperors - and now the world's most expensive cup of tea.

An eccentric Chinese art collector has been photographed enjoying a cup of tea from a rare 15th-century antique he purchased at auction for £21million.

The 'chicken cup', named after its hen and cockerel decorations, was created during the Ming Dynasty reign of Emperor Qianlong and was bought by billionaire Liu Yiqian in April.

Tea for me! This extremely rare 500-year-old cup Liu Yiqian is pictured drinking from is one of only 17 left in the world. He paid a staggering £21m for the cup which has chickens and cockerels on it

While most would expect an antique of such prominence to go directly into storage or on display, Mr Liu decided he would put his chicken cup to a more immediate, and practical, use.

He told the Wall Street Journal: 'A Sotheby's staffer poured me some tea. I saw the [chicken cup] and excitedly poured some of that tea into the cup and drank a little.

'Emperor Qianlong has used it, now I've used it. I just wanted to see how it felt.'

The prized object measures just 3.1 
inches in diameter and is widely considered the 'holy grail' of Chinese 
porcelain with only 17 remaining in the world - four of which are in 
private hands.

The cup was made during the reign of the Chenghua Emperor, who ruled from 1464 to 1487.

'There's no more legendary object in the history of Chinese porcelain. This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art,' said Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Asia.

Mr Liu made his fortune on the stock market during communist China's increasing shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s, investing much of that money in art.

He's one of China's 152 billionaires and is dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, he is thought to be China's 200th richest person.

However, Mr Liu's stunt has angered some, who claim he is not treating the antique with the proper respect and simply using it as a rich vanity project.

His employees have dubbed him 'the eccentric Mr Liu' and he is known for wearing t-shirts to work and growing beards.

Liu Yiqian is not only one of the richest people in China, but he is part of a golden generation who made their fortune during China's gradual shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s.

Born into a working class family in Shanghai, the 51-year-old's break came in his 20s when he first invested in the stock market - a shrewd move which grew into a two million yuan windfall that catapulted him into the billionaire he is today.

As an older man he and his wife Wang Wei have poured their wealth into rare and expensive Chinese artwork. They now own two exhibition spaces in Shanghai, known as The Long Museum, which house their collections alongside other exhibitions and researchers.

Their collection is vast and expensive. While Mr Liu's new £21m 'chicken' cup made headlines, it is just the latest acquisition in a long history of expensive purchases.

For example, in October 2010, Mr Liu paid £6.4m for a Qing Dynasty imperial throne with carved dragons at Sotheby's Hong Kong.

Later that year 60 of the couple's Chinese paintings and art works - which dated back to the Song Dynasty 1,000 years ago - were shown at a Chinese Museum. They were reportedly insured for ten billion yuan - nearly £1bn.
