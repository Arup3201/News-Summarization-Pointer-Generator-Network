Floyd Mayweather has vowed to 'shut up' and 'punish' Amir Khan in a fight his dad Mayweather Snr is 'desperate' to see him accept.

Khan remains hopeful he will one day fight the undisputed pound-for-pound world No 1 after coming close to facing Mayweather earlier this year.

The five-weight world champion ran an online poll asking the public to decide who he should fight next. Although Khan won the 'official' vote, the American chose to face Marcos Maidana instead.

But the Money Man, who showed off his cash in an Instagram post on Thursday, has revealed he wants to take on the 27-year-old from Bolton, if only to appease his dad, who is keen for him to take the fight.

Mayweather said: 'My Dad is desperate for me to take - the Khan fight - he just wants me to shut the kid up and put him down.

'My Dad doesn't like fighters trash talking his son - but he knows as well as I do that if the fight happens - then I am going to punish him. If he thinks he can trash talk me and get away with it he needs to think again. 

The 37-year-old believes he already know how he would go about beating Khan

'He (Khan) is a good fighter - he has quick hands - but I am a far more intelligent fighter than him - and I could already tell you how I would beat him.'

He added: 'My Dad wants the fight, I want to put him on his backside, so hopefully we can make it happen.

'I have always said that nobody has any right just to get a fight with me. I am nobody's pay day, I am nobody's meal ticket. I take fights that I believe will test me, and will put on a good show for the fans.

'I ain’t ever taken a fight just because somebody has been running off their mouth. If Khan gets his fight - it will be because I think he deserves a shot.'
