A school governors' chairman says he was forced to quit his post after joining Ukip because they political party's policies are 'against it's ethos.'

Mike Ward claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip.

The Scarborough councillor, 70, who had previously stood as an independent, said he was invited to a meeting with headteacher Sue Whelan after his political switch was reported in local media.

'I had been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years and chair for five years when, as a Scarborough Councillor, I recently joined Ukip,' said the retired teacher.

'After this was reported in the local paper I was called in to school to see the head. She then asked me to resign saying Ukip’s policies were against the ethos of the school.

'I was astonished as politics had never played a part in my time as a governor but after some soul searching over the weekend and not wishing to cause the school any further issues I tendered my resignation which she accepted.

'Dedicated': Mr Ward has been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years, and chairman of the board for the past five years. He says politics had 'never played a part' in his time at the school

Desire for change: Mr Ward said the school's pupils 'must come first', and says he is 'neither extremist or racist', but is 'strongly advocating change'

'The pupils must come first.

'I am neither extremist or racist. I have always been independent, strongly advocating change.

'Ukip is fully committed to putting residents, their wishes and needs, first.

'More common sense must be applied to local decision making. It is the party for change, neither left or right but rather right from wrong.' 

Party leader Nigel Farage said it was 'atrocious' that Mr Ward had been asked to resign.  

'It’s atrocious that Cllr Mike Ward a long standing, conscientious and dedicated School Governor has been forced to resign as a Governor of Eskdale School, a school he deeply cares for, just because he is a member of Ukip,' said Mr Farage.

'Mike is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the School and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way.

'This is discrimination pure and simple and I find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. Questions need to be asked about why this has happened.

'In the meantime I stand with Mike and I can only hope the School sees sense and reinstates him.'

Mr Ward stepped down from the governing panel claiming his decision made him 'persona non grata' at the school, which Ofsted inspectors ruled earlier this year requires improvement, having previously branded it 'outstanding'. 

Inquiry: Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall has called for a full independent inquiry into Mr Ward's resignation, and says he should be reinstated

Mr Ward has been a school governor at Eskdale for eight years and chairman for the last five. His teaching career included a two year stint in Filey.

A complaint by a member of the public about his resignation has led to an internal investigation by the school into his resignation.

But Ukip has now called for a full independent inquiry - and for Mr Ward to be reinstated, despite his resignation.

'This is an outrage, Mike has been a dedicated governor for years and it is totally unacceptable that membership of UKIP should be considered to be incompatible with being a governor,' said the party's deputy leader Paul Nuttall.

'This is discrimination against a conscientious man who has worked tirelessly for the school and it is a disgrace that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. He purely has the interests of the school and local youngsters at heart.

'There must be a full independent inquiry into this debacle and Mike should be re-instated. He is a former teacher and university lecturer and I'm sure his fellow governors had no problems with his completely unrelated political membership.

'Everyone is entitled to their own political views and I'm sure the other governors have theirs and possibly even belong to a political party but like Mike just concentrate on seeking the best for Eskdale School.' 

Despite initially vowing to carry out a full investigation, North Yorkshire County Council has now distanced itself from any inquiry.

A council spokesperson said: 'North Yorkshire County Council has received a complaint from a member of the public about the resignation of the chair of governors at Eskdale School in Whitby.

'This is a matter for consideration not by the County Council but by the school's governing body.

'We understand that the governing body is taking this complaint seriously and will respond to the complainant.'

A school spokesman told MailOnline today that Mrs Whelan would not be commenting on Mr Ward's claims.
