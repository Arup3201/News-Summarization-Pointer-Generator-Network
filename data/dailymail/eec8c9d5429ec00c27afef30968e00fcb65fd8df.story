It appears that the holiday season has been a little too taxing for this football commentator.

Former coach Mike Ditka, 74, was seen snoozing live on air when ESPN cut back to the studio after a live report during Sunday's NFL Countdown.

Fellow host Keyshawn Johnson quickly spotted Ditka as he drifted off and started to slump - and shook him vigorously, jolting the former Chicago Bears player and coach awake.

Ditka twitched a few times before shaking himself straight and getting back to the job.

Seated beside fellow hosts Chris Berman, Tom Jackson and Cris Carter, he had taken the opportunity to get some shut-eye as they listened to a live report from Josina Anderson in Miami.

'No big deal,' one commenter wrote beneath the video on CBS. 'I've fallen asleep many times during that program.'

It's not the first time a commentator has been caught having a catnap.

Last year, Fox News station KTBC in Austin linked to reporter Doug Luzader in Washington but he was found fast asleep.

The split screen showed anchor Joe Bickett sitting in the studio and Luzader against the backdrop of Capitol Hill with his head bowed.

When he received no response from Luzader, he then tried to rouse him, repeating: 'Hello Doug, hi Doug...I guess not....'

The station quickly cut from the split-screen and Bickett glossed over the embarassing mishap with: 'We'll check in, in a minute' - although they did not.
