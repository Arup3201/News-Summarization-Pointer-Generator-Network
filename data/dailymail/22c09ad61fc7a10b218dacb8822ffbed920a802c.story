The best-selling author of more than 30 erotic novels has filed for bankruptcy.

Kristina Laferne Roberts, whose pen name is Zane, has published more than 18 erotic novels including  Addicted, which hits movie theaters this week.

She started by secretly writing and posting her creations online after her children went to bed - and ended up on the New York Times best-seller list 26 times.

But last night it emerged she is 'the top tax cheat in Maryland' and has been forced to file for bankruptcy.

Bankrupt: Kristina Laferne Roberts, known to readers as Zane, has filed for bankruptcy owing over $540,000

The Washington Post reports that Roberts, a marketing graduate from Prince George's County, owes the IRS over $540,000.

Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot called Roberts the state's top individual 'tax cheat' with undeclared earnings dating back more than 10 years.

The state has been trying to collect back taxes from Roberts since 2003. 

Finally, in June, she filed for bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Maryland, the Post said. 

Roberts listed her total assets at over $1.4 million including two houses in Maryland, and claimed more than $3.4 million in liabilities.

That figure includes more than $1.4 million owed to creditors and more than $337,000 in back state taxes.

A call to Roberts' attorney was not immediately returned on Sunday.

The news has emerged just days before the movie adaptation of her novel Addicted is released across the US.

'Cheat': The Maryland Comptroller branded Roberts the state's top individual tax cheat after years of dodging

It tells the story of a gallerist who risks her family and flourishing career when she enters into an affair with a talented painter and slowly loses control of her life. 

Directed by Bille Woodruff, who created Honey, and starring Sharon Leah, of DreamGirls fame, it is slated to be a box office hit. 

Her other work includes New York Times best-seller Afterburn about the liaison between a chiropractor and a bank clerk in Washington DC. 

Dear G-Spot, also critically-acclaimed, is a collection of letters from people that have contacted Zane with sexual questions - 'the preacher's wife worrying about being judged, the virgin, the guy next door, the gay man next door, the woman with low self-esteem, and the other woman with a sex drive over the moon'.

Career: She started by secretly sharing her work online after her children went to bed but has since landed a book deal with Simon & Schuster and been named on the New York Times best-seller list 26 times

Roberts became Zane in November 1997 after sending chapters she had written to people she met online, she told theGrio last year.

'I wrote a short story and shared it with a few people I'd met online,' she said. 

'I self-published three more stories online and got about 8,000 hits by word of mouth alone.'

Numerous publishing firms offered book deals, but she refused to tone down the explicit nature of her work: 'They were asking me to tone down my material. They said it was too graphic.'

'That wasn't something I was going to do; I'd received so many emails from readers thanking me for affirming that they were normal, who felt empowered by my material.'
