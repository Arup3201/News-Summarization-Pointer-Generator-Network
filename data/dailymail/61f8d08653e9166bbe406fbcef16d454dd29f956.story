Arsenal legend George Graham has said that Danny Welbeck will work his socks off for Arsene Wenger's side, but must improve his finishing if he is to be a success at the Emirates.

Graham, speaking to Alan Brazil on talkSPORT, described him as 'willing', but noted that he has a lot to prove before he is fully accepted at Arsenal.

'Welbeck is a very willing boy,' he said. 'He works his socks off for the team and has a good attitude.

'He's got to improve his finishing a lot though. At Arsenal he will get chances, so we'll see how good a finisher he is.'

Welbeck joined the Gunners for £16 million from Manchester United on deadline day, and has scored one goal in his first three appearances.

He has come under heavy criticism in the past for his lack of goals, with a 0.22 goals per game ratio so far in his career.
