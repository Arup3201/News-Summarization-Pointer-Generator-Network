Weston-Super-Mare's postponed FA first round tie with Doncaster Rovers sparked ugly scenes among away supporters after the match was deemed unplayable due to a waterlogged pitch.

Referee Tim Robinson called the the game off 21 minutes before the scheduled 3pm kick-off time, deeming that some parts of the Woodspring Stadium ground were unsafe.

Robinson's decision angered many Rovers' fans who felt they had wasted a journey after travelling hundreds of miles down to Somerset.

One supporter managed to invade the pitch to vent his frustration, before being dragged off by police, while others tried in similar vain but failed as some bottles were also thrown.

Rovers' manager Paul Dickov tried to speak to fans from the touchline but was shouted down - with many hanging around in the ground 40 minutes after the game had been called off.

Following the postponement, Doncaster manager Dickov told BBC Sport: 'I'm disappointed. We prepared for the game and we were ready to play.

'We have to respect the referee's decision, but we felt if it was going to be called off, it could have been done earlier.

'I remember playing in a lot worse than that. You just get on with it.'
