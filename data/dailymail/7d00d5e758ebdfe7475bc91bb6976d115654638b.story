The race might be getting a bit uncomfortable over in the Nationalist camp.

But even Alex Salmond wouldn’t have welcomed the international intervention from his latest unlikely supporter – North Korea.

Russian separatists in Ukraine have already embarrassed the SNP by launching an online campaign to support independence.

Even Alex Salmond wouldn’t have welcomed the international intervention from his latest unlikely supporter – North Korea

North Korea - whose leader Kim Jong-un is pictures here posing with female soldiers - is said to be strongly supportive of Scottish independence

Now North Korea, the repressive communist state led by Kim Jong-un, is reportedly keen to develop trade with Edinburgh because they ‘like the taste of whisky’.

So Chung-on, director of the International Affairs Bureau of The General Association of Korean Residents of Japan, confirmed that the vote would be reported in North Korea if the Scottish Nationalists win.

He said: ‘The result will be very important and if the Scots do vote to become independent, then North Korea will be prepared to respond to that.’

But he went on to say that budget concerns would probably prevent North Korea from setting up an embassy in Edinburgh. 

Soon after stories about the regime’s support were published, people began to post photo montages of Mr Salmond dressed as the North Korean leader online, with a variety of nicknames. 

And Choson Sinbo, a newspaper aimed at Koreans who live in Japan but swear allegiance to Pyongyang, also hinted at the party line on Scotland . 

The paper is staunchly loyal to Kim Jong-un, and its managing editor Choe Kwan-il told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I think independence would be very positive for Scotland.’

Kremlin supporters have come out in support of the SNP. War correspondent Alexander Kots tweeted this picture of 'Babay’, a bearded pro-Russian fighter who became a minor celebrity in Crimea. The picture shows him playing the bagpipes with the caption: ‘Today we are all Scots’

He went on to say: ‘We have not reported on the vote in Scotland yet, but we will after it has happened. 

'I believe every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality. And I believe a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.’

He added: ‘I believe independence will be positive as it will encourage personal exchanges and provide both countries with business chances. North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so we can be beneficial to each other.’
