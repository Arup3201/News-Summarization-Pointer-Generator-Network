A new father who was out celebrating the birth of his son has died after becoming involved in a 'large scale disturbance' inside a pub.

Benjamin Bolsenbroek, 23, suffered injuries to his face and body in the incident, which happened at the Park Hotel in Middlesbrough in the early hours of yesterday.

He had been out with friends celebrating the arrival of his son Kianey, who had been born just a few days earlier.

Today, his heartbroken partner Georgina McGuire paid tribute to 'the best dad ever'.

In a statement on Facebook, the new mother said: 'I am numb. Only the support of my true love Benji Bolsenbroek would get me through such a traumatic time, but I am taking comfort in the fact he got to witness our perfect son enter the world.

'He was the best dad ever and had so much more to give but he lives on with all of us in Kianey.

'I am truly overwhelmed by all of the support, just hoping deep down I will wake soon from the worst nightmare of my entire life.'

A postmortem examination into the death 
of Mr Bolsenbroek - known as Benji - has proved inconclusive and the 
cause of death is being treated as 'unexplained', according to Cleveland
Police

At a press conference today, Detective Superintendent Rob Donaghy said a 'large scale disturbance' had taken place inside the pub in Linthorpe Road at around 12.20am.

He said Mr Bolsenbroek, who lived with Miss McGuire in Thornaby, Teesside, had 'somehow become involved'.

'During the incident, Benji was assaulted and the involvement of others and the part they played is a major focus of my investigation,' he said.

'What we do know is that the pub was busy at the time and a large scale disturbance took place and Benji was there at the time.

'We received a number of calls reporting this disturbance and officers did attend shortly afterwards.

'When officers arrived it appears that those involved in the disturbance including Benji and his friends had left.'

After the disturbance, Mr Bolsenbroek's friends and family took him back to his mother’s house nearby - where he began to feel very unwell.

He was taken in a taxi to James Cook University Hospital, where his condition deteriorated very rapidly.

Det Supt Donaghy said: 'Just minutes later, he was dead and that is where this complicated inquiry began.

'Yesterday, I had numerous officers carrying out investigations at various locations in Middlesbrough.

'We are also examining CCTV footage and have spoken to a number of witnesses and other people with information. 

'My absolute priority is to get answers for Benji’s family who have suffered the rollercoaster of emotions with the birth of a baby, then the heartbreaking death of their son and brother.'

A pathologist is carrying out a number of further tests to determine the cause of Mr Bolsenbroek's death, which is being treated as 'unexplained'.

Anyone who was in the pub on Saturday night and has not yet spoken to officers is asked to contact the police on 01642 303202, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
