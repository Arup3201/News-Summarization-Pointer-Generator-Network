Thirteen people have been forced to jump from a skydiving plane just moments before it nosedived and crashed into a New Zealand lake.

The group had quite literally jumped for their lives after the plane suffered engine problems shortly after take-off, the pilot ordering all on board to get out ahead of it plunging into Lake Taupo on New Zealand's north island.

The plane came to rest in shallow water in the lake.

The group had a lucky escapes as the plane suffered engine problems shortly after take-off. They were ordered by the pilot to leave immediately before it then plunged into Lake Taupo

Skydive Taupo chief executive Roy Clements told the New Zealand Herald said 'all parachutists including the pilot exited the plane and landed safely'.

There were six crew and six passengers on board, they leapt out in tandem, while the pilot jumped out when it became obvious the plane was on its way down.

Ambulance crews reported that, remarkably, just one person required treatment for scratches after plunging into a bush.

One witness told the paper that he watched it unfold after hearing the plane had 'conked out', he saw the parachutes open but wasn't sure if the pilot had escaped.

There were six crew and six passengers on board, they leapt out in tandem, while the pilot jumped out when it became obvious the plane was on its way down. It had lost power shortly after take-off at 1300 metres

Authorities say the skydiving plane's engine cut out some 1300 metres off the ground.

Taupo Mayor David Trewavas said the region hosted the most parachute jumps of any in the southern hemisphere, and they are carried out by 'very experienced operators'.
