Australian baseball player Christopher Lane was killed by a single bullet that hit his back and penetrated both of his lungs and his pulmonary artery, an autopsy has revealed.

The state medical examiner's report, which was released on Tuesday, states Lane suffered a single bullet wound, which authorities said came from a .22-caliber revolver.

The student and baseball player at East Central University was struck while taking a jog through Duncan, Oklahoma on August 16, allegedly by two teenagers who were 'bored'.

The results came as President Barack Obama passed on his condolences to the devastated family.

In a statement released more than a 
week after Lane's tragic death, the president said he knew the victim's 
loved ones were going through trying times.

'As
the President has expressed on too many tragic occasions, there is an 
extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life 
short,' White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told the Herald Sun.

'The President and First Lady's thoughts and prayers are with Chris Lane's family and friends in these trying times.'

Obama's condolences came after 
Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said she thought it would be a 'nice gesture' 
if the president extended his sympathies to the family.

'It
would be nice if our nation were to certainly express their 
condolences, how very sorry we are,' the Republican governor told Fox 
News.

'This is a very 
unusual circumstance, we don't anticipate that someone would commit such
a brutal crime upon an innocent person. I think it would be a nice 
gesture for him to do that.'

Sadness: Lane's girlfriend Sarah Harper is pictured left at a memorial on Sunday and right with Lane

Family and friends of the 
slain 22-year-old student will attend a private funeral for him on Wednesday in Essenden, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.

It
will mark nearly two weeks since Lane was shot in the back and left for
dead while out running in Duncan, Oklahoma on August 16 - allegedly by a
group of teenagers who were bored.

His
heartbroken American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, accompanied his body to 
Australia last week. She was pictured attending a memorial baseball game
held by Lane's former club at the weekend.

After the event, she said that the 
memorial had been 'beautiful' and thanked his friends for getting her 
through an 'excruciating' week.

'This past week has been excruciating but seeing how much you guys love him really comforts me,' she wrote.

Devoted: Lane is pictured at East Central 
University, where he was on a baseball scholarship. In a radio interview, he
said that he had loved every minute being in the U.S. and had big 
dreams for the future

As preparations were being made for 
the funeral, Mr John Edwards, who coached Lane when he was young, said 
he planned to meet officials of the Victorian Government to discuss 
creating a 'little league' field in his honor.

Edwards,
who also coached Lane as a senior player at the Essendon Baseball Club,
revealed that the state government had put forward the idea of 
replacing a disused baseball field with a Chris Lane Memorial Field.

In just four days a campaign he started to get the field set up has received the support of more than 20,000 signatures.

'When
this started, we thought the chances of it happening would be a million
to one,' said Mr Edwards. 'Now we've gotten so much support, it's more 
like 50 to one.'

On Monday, an interview Lane gave to an Australian radio station just after moving to the U.S. emerged.

In
the interview with Sports Central in Melbourne three years ago, the 
then-19-year-old gushed about his experiences as a budding baseball 
player while attending college in Oklahoma.

'I've only been over here for about two 
months now and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every minute of it,' Lane said in the interview. 
'It's certainly a great experience I'm having right now.'

Lane is extremely humble in the interview, which can be heard in full on NewsOK. He told the host he is in the U.S. because 'I was really lucky'.

'I'm the only one that's you know, 
studying in a foreign country and able to play a sport I love,' he said. 'If nothing, I'm going to gain an awesome
experience that I'm going to look back on for the rest of my life.'

Lane
said he had been playing baseball since he was five but added that, 
while he loved the sport, he was concentrating on getting a thorough 
education in the U.S.

'Most important for me is to get the 
education and I have the bonus of being a student athlete... if I get my
education sorted then everything goes right,' he said.

The
interview was carried out when he was at Redlands Community College, 
and he said that after two years there, he hoped to get into a four-year
U.S. college - and maybe reach the major league.

'It would certainly be a dream,' he said. 'But you 
know, you can only work hard and I've got hopefully four years, fingers 
crossed over here, so there's plenty of opportunity to put my hand up 
and see how far I can go.'

In
yet a further heartbreaking twist, he assured the host that the 
Americans loved having Australians in the country. The host concluded: 
'We'll keep in touch with you over the next several years.'

After the interview, Lane was granted a scholarship to attend East Central University.

Police
have arrested James Francis Edwards Jr. 15, Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and
Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, in connection with his shooting.

At the weekend, hundreds of friends gathered on 'Laney's' field of dreams in Melbourne, where his sporting life as a catcher had begun.

Remembered: Players from Essendon and Melbourne University baseball clubs release balloons before a memorial game in Melbourne on Sunday for the slain Australian baseball player

Devastated relatives and friends 
released black and red balloons - the colors of the Essendon club where 
Lane had previously played - which were marked with his player's number,
40.

Referring to the trauma
that the Lane famiy faces as details emerge in the U.S. courts, his 
father said: 'Distance isn't going to change the size of the task ahead,
but we still have three beautiful daughters and we have grandchildren.

'They
need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives. 
Whatever task you need to do, you get up each day and you have to move 
forward.'

He and his wife, he said, had been moved by the 'tremendous tributes' to their son.

'So
many people have been prepared to roll out and support him,' he said. 
'He was much loved, but I have never doubted that for a minute.'
