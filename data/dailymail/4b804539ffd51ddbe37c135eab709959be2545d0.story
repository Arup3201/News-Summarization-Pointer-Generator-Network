Penny Jacquet began getting menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes nearly 20 years ago 

For most women, the menopause is an uncomfortable phase of life where symptoms usually pass within three to years.

But Penny Jacquet is still struggling more than two decades on. 

Nineteen years after she first began experiencing hot flushes, she is still battling them - and says she fears they will never cease. 

Appearing today on ITV's This Morning, the mother-of-two said: 'My symptoms began in 1995, a couple of years after the birth of my second daughter.

'Early menopause is common in my family, but while my mother and grandmother sailed through theirs, mine was terrible from the start.

'One day, on a visit to London with my daughter, I had ten hot flushes. 

'I can't remember anything we saw because I felt so ill and kept having to run outside for fresh air.'

Mrs Jacquet told  hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'My periods stopped, my skin started itching and my hair became brittle.

'Before a hot flush, I'd have a panic attack - it was awful.

'I didn't know where I was, what I was doing - my self confidence totally went. 

'In the end, I worked it out that a few seconds after the panic attack....woosh - and my face would be scarlet and dripping in sweat.'

She said while her symptoms did affect her socially, she had little choice but to get on with life, given that both her daughters were still at school. 

Her husband, she says, has been kind and understanding - but her persistent symptoms have dented her self confidence, she said.   

'I couldn't take hormone replacement therapy because I have breast cysts, which can lead to an increased risk of cancer if HRT is taken.

'So, I tried every natural remedy, from black cohosh to evening primrose oil.

'I used oestrogen and progesterone creams to help with the discomfort during sex, but nothing would work. In the end, I gave up and thought: "I'll just have to wait until it's over".

'But it didn't end. And many of the symptoms - the itching, soreness and hot flushes - are still with me.

'I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just coped. At its worst, it made me feel very alone, because I couldn't believe anyone else could be going through what I was.

'I had no idea other women had symptoms that were as debilitating or lasted as long.' 

Ms Jacquet was speaking out to mark World Menopause Month. 

Around four million women in the UK alone go through the menopause every year, with the average age being 51.

Up to 80 per cent of women experience symptoms other than the ceasing of periods, such as hot flushes, mood swings, memory loss, night sweats and painful sex, GP Dawn Harper told the programme.  

She said: 'I see really successful women who just lose it - they can't even decide what pair of knickers to put on in the morning.'

She went on to explain that women such as Penny, who began showing signs at 42, are considered young for the menopause. 

'Anything over 45 but before around 50 is considered early - and anything over 40 is premature.'

Commenting on Penny's case, Dr Dawn Harper (right) said the symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better. She added that many women suffer unnecessarily in silence 

Dr Harper added that while the age periods begin is based largely on body weight, there is a strong genetic link when it comes to the age of menopause.  

And commenting on Penny's case, she said: 'The symptoms will not go on forever - the flashes and mood swings will get a lot better.'

She went on to explain that many women feel they have to simply put up with symptoms of the menopause - which is wrong.

'Far too many women just accept vaginal dryness and uncomfortable sex.

'You don't have to put up with it and you don'd need to be frightened of HRT. 

This Morning asked viewers which of the following symptoms affected them most when going through the menopause?

They said:  

Hot flushes and night sweats: 49 per cent 

Psychological (including mood swings and anxiety) problems: 27 per cent

Sleep problems: 9 per cent

Vaginal problems: 8 per cent 

Joint aches: 7 per cent 

'It's not HRT or nothing - for flushes and sweats there is an old-fashioned blood pressure treatment that can help.

'Dryness can be tackled by applying [the hormone] oestrogen to the area.

'There are so many options available - including remaining a healthy weight and eating plenty of soy, which raises oestrogen levels. 

'It's definitely worth talking to your GP about it.' 

The official definition of the menopause is the last period, with the stage leading up to this known as the perimenopause. 

Contrary to popular belief, the average age of the menopause has not changed, says leading expert Dr Heather Currie, of the website Menopause matters.

'It may be that slowly, more women are beginning to talk about the perimenopause,' she said. 

The most commonly recognised early symptoms of the menopause include hot flushes, night sweats and disturbed sleep. 

However they may also include bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, tiredness and a general lack of energy, adds Dr Currie.

'It's not uncommon for symptoms to be gradual, and come and go, which can confuse the issue. 

'However the most obvious sign is usually a change in the regularity of periods – even in the late thirties or early forties.'
