Daniel Sturridge is in danger of missing the Merseyside derby after Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed the striker will be out for 'up to three weeks'.

The 25-year-old returned home from international duty early having picked up a knock during a training session before England's trip to Switzerland.

Now Sturridge could miss the rest of September - a period in which Liverpool play five matches.

Rodgers also revealed that Emre Can faces six weeks on the sidelines and Joe Allen could miss the game against Aston Villa as the pair both returned from international duty injured.

The Liverpool manager said: 'It could be up to three weeks (before Sturridge is fit again), which is obviously disappointing. I always tell them to concentrate on their country when they go away.

'Emre Can could be out for up to six weeks with his ankle when they got 6-0 up. Joe Allen is also a doubt after playing on a dreadful pitch with Wales.'

Rodgers also criticised England's medical staff for their handling of Sturridge's injury.

Joe Allen, pictured playing for Wales against Andorra, has also suffered an injury problem

He said: 'For us it would have been a recovery day. I speak regularly with Roy (Hodgson, England manager). There is always good communication but I haven’t spoken to him after this round of games. 

'I speak regularly with international managers. Roy has probably been led by sports science department. But you can’t throw a blanket over them. One recovery programme doesn’t fit them all.

'Luis Suarez, for instance, needed to do extra work on his second day of recovery. It is about maximising his availability.'

Mario Balotelli's contribution will be important in a busy period for Liverpool which sees them begin their Champions League campaign, and host Middlesbrough in round three of the Capital One Cup.

Rodgers played down suggestions that Balotelli was involved in an altercation during a training ground friendly against Wolves.

'It’s a story that was made up,' the Liverpool manager said. 'We played a game here and both Kenny Jackett (Wolves manager) and I were here. Both teams needed it. It was really competitive and Mario has been as good as gold since he has been in.'

Rodgers added: 'We have planned out the team for the next five games. You have to rotate but also have to be consistent. There won’t be wholesale changes.

'We have had a great transfer window. Alberto Moreno was excellent against Tottenham and Javier Manquillo settled in straight away. We have been very specific with the type of players we have brought in.

'I have been really, really pleased.'
