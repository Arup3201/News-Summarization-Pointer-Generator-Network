Magnus Peterson has been jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of a string of fraud offences having duped investors out of hundreds of millions of pounds

A hedge fund boss whose investors lost £350million when his Mayfair firm collapsed as a result of his rogue trading has been jailed for 13 years. 

Magnus Peterson forged relatives' signatures, wrote fraudulent IOU's and lied to auditors to keep the Macro Fund afloat while he extracted millions from the company for himself.

The fund collapsed in 2009 in an 'emblematic' example of the financial crash, with 51-year-old Peterson convicted of eight counts of  years later.

Today the Swedish national was jailed for 13 years at Southwark Crown Court. 

The father-of-four was previously ruled against in a High Court action launched by creditors of one of his companies. 

It was this ruling which prompted the Serious Fraud Office to criminally investigate the financier after previously fearing there was no 'realistic prospect of conviction'.

During his three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, jurors heard how Peterson blew 20 per cent of the fund over a few days of 'disastrous' trading.

Having convinced investors - many of whom were pensioners - to agree to an 'option overlay', Peterson told clients they could not lose or gain five per cent of their original input. 

The trader began using a separate company, Weavering Capital, to mask how much of his clients' money he had lost.

Trading with money from the Macro Fund, he invented deals and profits produced by the latter company to keep the scheme going. 

At one point the financier forged the signatures of his father-in-law and brother in Sweden on documents including one declaring responsibility to the Irish Stock Exchange.

But following the credit crunch of 2008, investors began seeking returns on their original cash instalments. 

It was then that Peterson launched a Ponzi-like scheme - using fresh cash investments to pay off debts to older clients.

As jurors were told, 'he was robbing Peter to pay Paul.' 

In 2009, the Macro Fund was closed and Peterson later arrested in one of the first prosecutions of its kind following the financial crash.

The Serious Fraud Office did not pursue allegations of fraud however in the belief there was no realistic prospect the trader would be convicted. The case was closed in 2011.

The following year, a High Court action launched by Weavering Capital creditors however found he and some others liable for millions. 

Mr Justice Peter Smith (left) described the trader as 'charming and clever'. The criminal case into his practices was reopened by David Green QC (right) when he took charge of the Serious Fraud Office

In its wake and with the appointment of David Green QC at the SFO alongside threats of a judicial review from scorned creditors, the case was reopened.  

While swindling investors out of millions, it emerged Peterson had pocketed £7million for himself by the time he was brought to court.

He was found guilty of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading and acquitted of seven other counts including fraud by false representation. 

Sentencing today, Mr Justice Peter Smith said the trader had 'fooled' those who trusted him with investments.

'You were playing for high rewards and the punishment should reflect that, which is why I am sentencing you to 13 years in prison.

'Investors were entitled to expect integrity from you.

'The jury found you guilty on eight counts of disloyalty, fraud and forgery. The Macro fund was liquidated in 2009 with losses of more than half a billion dollars for investors.

'You are a clever man and the fraud was clever, dishonest and sophisticated. You are articulate and have charm and your submissions to the jury were fluent although they made no real sense.

He added the man had duped regular people out of hard-earned savings and contributions intended for charity.   

'These were not just adventurous speculators, they included those saving for their pensions and charities.

'You did not have direct dealings with those cheated, but you knew well enough who would be your sorts of victims.

'It is no excuse that others might have been expected to safeguard the interests of others, and that others were involved in your wrongdoing.

'You acted in concert with others and it beggars belief that you were not leading a scheme and that others were not led by you.' 

According to the Serious Fraud Office, it was one of the first hedge fund prosecutions of its kind to arise out of the 2008 financial crisis.

Amanda Pinto, QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, said: ‘This case is about a fraud carried out by Mr Peterson, through the investment fund the Macro fund, which he ran between 2003 and 2009. 

'Investors put millions of dollars into the Macro fund...In the end, the fund went down to the tune of over 600 million dollars, losing all their money.

‘And this was not because of bad luck or incompetence - this was because of dishonesty.’

Southwark Crown Court (above) heard how the trader had 'fooled' investors into giving him more money 

‘The Macro fund was in dire straits’, Miss Pinto added. 

‘At the very same time, he was personally extracting hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the Macro fund for his own and his family’s benefit.’  

Gideon Cammerman, representing Peterson, said: 'There was a sense he was bound to be discovered. 

'WCF was impecunious, the repayments could never have been met. The fraud was sustained over a period of time with a large number of victims.'

He described Peterson’s actions as 'foolhardy and stupid', but added they were not to make him rich but to maintain his lifestyle.

Dressed in a checked shirt, grey jacket and dark blue trousers, Peterson looked stunned as he was led away.
