Everton are considering signing Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi after Tim Howard was ruled out for six weeks with a torn calf.

Manager Roberto Martinez is drawing up a list of possible targets and knows Al Habsi well from his days at Wigan. 

However, the Oman goalkeeper is due on international duty in the Asia Cup in Australia later this month and that could threaten any immediate deal.

Everton have also made enquiries about Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk who is the subject of interest from Sunderland.

Celtic want £8m for the Dutchman and manager Ronny Deila said: 'Finding a replacement now is much harder than in the summer when it’s much easier. You also have a period to play them into the team. But in the January windows it’s important to keep the players you want to keep.'

Meanwhile, Wigan midfielder Roger Espinoza is to leave the Championship club in January. The 28-year-old, who was a member of the team that won the 2013 FA Cup, may return to Sporting Kansas City.
