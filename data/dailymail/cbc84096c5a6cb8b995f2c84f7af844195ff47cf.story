A terminally-ill, father-of-three who spent the last few months begging pharmaceutical companies to give him an unapproved cancer drug has died, it emerged today.

Nick Auden, 41, from Denver, died from stage 4 melanoma at his home on Friday surrounded by his wife Amy and his children Locky, seven, Hayley, five, and Evan, one.

Nick and his family believed that the immune-boosting cancer drug  anti-PD-1 would be able to shrink his tumors for good.

PD-1 - Programmed cell death protein 1 -
 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PDCD1 gene and is 
currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment.

His family had been campaigning for access to a clinical trial of the drug, a treatment currently being tested by pharmaceutical companies Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).

An online petition called Save 
Locky's Dad garnered half a million signatures. But Nick could not 
convince either company to give him the drug.

Last week, he flew to MD Anderson 
Cancer Center in Houston with wife Amy for a last-ditch experimental 
treatment that they hoped would stop the cancer from spreading, Cancer 
Connect reports.

But it was too late. After being 
admitted to intensive care during the treatment, he was flown to his 
Denver home on Tuesday in an air ambulance so he could spend his last 
days with his family.

'We were airlifted back to Denver mid last week. We got home in time so 
the kids could see him. It is a tragedy and I am barely coming to terms 
with it,' his wife told Cancer Connect on Sunday.

Brain tumour: Auden did not qualify for the clinical trial for the cancer drugs because he had a brain tumour, among other complications

The father-of-three did not qualify for a clinical trial because of a health complication.

Auden said he was told that in order to be accepted into a clinical trial for the anti-PD-1 drug, he would need to have either no brain tumors or brain tumors that were at least no longer growing.

Dr Jedd Wolchok, an oncologist, who is a melanoma specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, says the drug had the potential to cause brain swelling in people with existing brain disease.

Since Auden had brain tumours, he and his doctor worked to stabilise the tumours using a combination of drugs and other therapies.

After months of monitoring his brain scans, in July, Auden got good news: His tumors had not grown, and he qualified for the Merck trial.

But hours later, Auden experienced abdominal pain and went straight to an emergency room, because there was a possibility he had a perforated intestine.

Sure enough, he did, and he was instantly disqualified from the trial.

Without the drug, Auden's doctor told his
 wife, Amy, that ‘this is the end of the road’, and that her husband had
 between six and nine months to live.

Auden's story started in March 2010, when he had a cancerous mole removed.

Although it put him at risk for more skin cancer, he continued to live an active life, running, biking and hiking.

But in September 2011, Auden said his doctors told him the cancer had returned and had spread throughout his body. The official diagnosis was stage 4 melanoma, which around 90 per cent of people do not survive.

But when he learned about the anti-PD-1 drugs and their ability to treat melanoma, he saw a chance to survive.

Wonder drug: Studies of Merck's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumours shrink

Not approved: Pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb, based in New York, is one of the two companies still trialing the anti-PD1-1 drugs

Studies of Merck's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumors shrink.

Of those who took the highest doses of the drug, 52 per cent experienced tumor shrinkage.

Wolchok, who has not met or treated Auden but has corresponded with him through email, told ABCNews that immune cells typically don't attack cancer in a meaningful way because of a kind of natural brake function called PD-1.

There are currently no anti-PD-1 drugs in ‘compassionate use’ trials -- trials for individuals who don't qualify for clinical trials but still want the drug, but according to Wolchok, if the medication works, ‘some people might even be cured’.

Auden’s only chance of survival was to become an individual case study under compassionate use rules, which give people access to experimental drugs even if they don't fit into clinical trials.

That's when the ‘Save Locky's Dad’ campaign took hold.
