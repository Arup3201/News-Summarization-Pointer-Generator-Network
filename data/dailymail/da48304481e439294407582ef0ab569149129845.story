In a bid to reinvigorate its flagging economy France is to loosen its strict retail regulations, keeping shops open seven days a week.

The country's regimented rules on Sunday trading are rooted firmly in the tradition of keeping Sunday as a rest day for workers, since a law on the matter was decreed in 1906.

In 2009, the rules were relaxed a little, and there are exceptions in some tourist destinations such as Paris and the south of France, but many shops are still shut on Sundays.

Sorry, we're closed: France has a long tradition of Sunday being a rest day, which many  want to maintain

It is hoped that permitting shops to open on Sundays will allow Paris to match London's reputation for shopping culture.

A draft bill, which was leaked to the French press this week, featured plans to deregulate the protected legal trade, a move to unveiled next month.

Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, a 36-year old ex-banker, said: 'We must allow those who wish to work on Sundays to do so, as long as they are suitably compensated in terms of wages and rest, because they want this extra work.'

Seven-day shopping: London is famous for its shopping, and France believes Paris can match that 

The bill would propose that shops can open on 12 Sundays a year from five currently, with added flexibility for those located in big train stations and tourist areas 'of international stature'.

The current rules are seen by many as old-fashioned, and some believe that extended trading hours will help create jobs and fight competition from internet shopping.

But many French people are protective over their day of rest, including President Francois Hollande's Socialist majority in parliament. 

The issue has led to protests and trials, with unions insisting it will hurt workers' rights and small shopkeepers worried that they will not be able to compete against the major chains.

The mayor of Paris,  Anne Hidalgo, said the change in law will kill off small shops in the city centre - a 'key factor of the capital's economic dynamism and attractiveness'.
