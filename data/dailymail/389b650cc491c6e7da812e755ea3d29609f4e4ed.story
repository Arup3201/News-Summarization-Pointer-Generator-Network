The teenage girl who called police for help to kill a spider in her house has been revealed to be wheelchair-bound and suffering from muscular dystrophy.

Makenna Sewell, a student at Forest Grove High School in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, admits she felt silly calling the police department to kill a spider - but she insists it really was a danger to her and her brother.

She said that the spider was a brown recluse - a species with venom so toxic that it can prove deadly. Her mother had recently been bitten by one and had to be hospitalized.

Makenna Sewell said she felt silly calling police to kill the spider, but said she legitimately feared for her safety

Makenna, who has muscular dystrophy, said she was afraid that the spider - which she believed to be a deadly venomous brown recluse - would harm her or little brother

And she insists it was BIG. 'It was no quarter-size house spider. It was massive! It was massive,' she told KPTV.

She told an emergency dispatcher on August 16 that the spider was the size of a baseball. Brown recluse spiders don't typically grown larger than three quarters of an inch in diameter.

She also says that she didn't call 911 - instead she called the police non-emergency number for advice on what to do.

'Just seeing a spider that big and knowing what it did to my immune system and me having a compromised immune system and a younger brother, I just knew that it wasn't good and I had to call someone,' she said.

She said she had called her parents, but couldn't reach either of them.

When an officer arrived, she said, he was surprisingly gracious - and quickly swatted the arachnid with a rolled up newspaper.

Makenna said he insisted she keep the dead spider and send it in for testing - because he had never seen one that big, either.

She said she feels grateful that she lives in the sort of town where a teenager can summon a police officer to kill a spider.

The audio from her police call reveals a comical scene.

'I'm home alone and there is a giant spider on the back of my couch, and I'm talking giant. I've never seen a spider this big and I have no idea what to do,' she told the slightly perplexed operator.

The teen estimated the spider was the size of a baseball and said it was appeared similar to a tarantula.

She told the dispatcher that she generally wasn't fazed by spiders, but a family member was recently bitten by one and had to go to the hospital.

She said she initially tried to get hold of her parents but failed.

'I don't know if you guys have anything I can do, or if I just sit here and stare at it and wait for someone to get home to kill it,' she asked in the genuine plea, according to KPTV.

The 911 dispatcher contemplated how to handle the situation, and finally agreed to have an officer contact the panicked teen.

'Is that ridiculous?' she asked.

When the officer arrived at the home, he reported the spider was about 2 inches in diameter and disposed of it with an old-fashioned rolled up newspaper, police said.

Though it's not standard protocol for them to respond to a call about a spider, Forest Grove police said they decided to help the young lady out in this instance.
