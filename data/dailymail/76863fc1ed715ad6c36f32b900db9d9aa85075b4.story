Celtic striker John Guidetti has caused a stir after appearing to sing 'the H*** are deid' on Dutch television.

The 22-year-old Swedish striker was performing a chant the supporters sing to him when he plays.

As the programme's credits began to roll, he sang: 'Oh John Guidetti, puts the ball in the net-y, he's a Super Swede and the H*** are deid, walking in Guidetti wonderland.'

Guidetti has scored 13 goals since joining Celtic on loan from Manchester City this season

A group of Rangers fans have been petitioning Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to ban the word 'H**' from football grounds.

The group say the term incites 'religious hatred' and is 'a derogatory and sectarian term for a Protestant'.

There is no indication that Guidetti, who is on loan from Manchester City, had any idea of the meaning of the chant, but he caused anger nonetheless by saying he thought it was 'a good song'.

A spokesman for the anti-sectarian charity Nil by Mouth told The Scotsman there was a need 'for a proper education programme for Scots footballers'.

He added: 'Clubs should make it clear to them the kind of language likely to provoke others.'

Guidetti was repeating a song that he had heard sung in the terraces while he played 

Celtic manager Ronny Deila said recently he had not given up hope of signing Guidetti on a permanent basis
