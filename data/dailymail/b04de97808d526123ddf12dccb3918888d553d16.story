Chic in a crimson hat and an elegant cream tulle dress, British supermodel Jodie Kidd smoulders as she strikes a pose in a set of stunning photos released to mark Saturday's Derby.

The 35-year-old model is the official face of the Investec Derby Festival and appears in a series of beautifully designed hats by milliner Phillip Treacy.

Each of the hats is inspired by parts of the Epsom Downs Racecourse where the Derby takes place, among them the Hill, the Duchess's Stand and the Queen's Stand.

Speaking about the photos, Kidd said: 'I am really proud to take on the role [of being the official face of the Investec Derby].

'Modelling three different looks for the shoot shows that 
despite its prestigious racing reputation, fashion is a huge part of the
 day.'

Like Royal Ascot, organisers at the Investec Derby Festival operate a strict dress code, particularly in the Queen's Stand.

On Derby day itself, when the monarch is scheduled to appear, female racegoers are asked to wear 'a formal day dress, or a tailored trouser suit, with a hat or substantial fascinator' while men are expected to come in morning dress.

The Derby is the most prestigious of the five British Classics - and the only one that the Queen hasn't yet won.

Despite first place having so far eluded her, the monarch did manage a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

First run in 1780, the Derby is also boasts the largest prize money - £1,325,000 - of any British race, and as a result, attracts some of the world's top equine talent.

Hotly tipped runners in this year's event include the favourite, a chestnut three-year-old named Australia, and his stablemates Orchestra and Geoffrey Chaucer.

'I have been a fan of horses since I was 10 years old and find 
racing almost hypnotic,' added Kidd.

'I look forward to sporting one of Philip 
Treacy’s creations and watching these beautiful animals compete in the 
greatest flat race of them all.'

The Investec Derby is part of the QIPCO British Champions Series and will be broadcast live on Saturday 7th June by Channel 4 Racing. See britishchampionsseries.com

Beautiful: Princess Diana wore this peach marabou trimmed John Boyd number to Royal Ascot in 1982

A hat that once belonged to Princess Diana is to go on display in London as part of an exhibition celebrating the summer racing season.

The peach John Boyd straw hat was worn for a visit to Royal Ascot in 1982 just weeks before the birth of Prince William.

Joining Princess Diana's hat at the exhibition, which is being held at Mayfair restaurant 34, are pieces by  Robyn Coles, who has created titfers for Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and Lara Jensen, a milliner whose creations have been worn by Lady Gaga among others.

Hats Off To The Racing Season, which runs until June the 20th, is curated by millinery specialist Gemma Williams.

Speaking about the exhibition, she said: 'The exhibition will include hats designed by some of the most famous British milliners of the past 30 years.

'I am extremely excited to partner with 34 in Mayfair to showcase some of the world’s greatest and most striking hat designs.'
