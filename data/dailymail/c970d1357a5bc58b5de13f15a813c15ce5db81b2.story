President Obama has spoken out against the startling frequency of shootings in America, saying that the country should be 'ashamed'.

'We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens. And it happens now once a week. And it's a one-day story. There's no place else like this,' he said on Tuesday during a forum hosted by Tumblr.

The shooting at Reynolds High School in Oregon on Tuesday that left one student dead before the shooter killed himself marked the 74th shooting since the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary school.

Disheartening: President Obama said Tuesday (pictured with Tumblr founder David Karp) that the U.S. has to do some soul searching over the prevalence of school shootings

Question time: The topic of gun control came up during a Tumblr forum at the White House on Tuesday and was asked by someone directly effected by the shooting at UC-Santa Barbara two weeks ago

The question was raised by a student from UC-Santa Barbara, where there was another shooting two weeks ago.

'The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis.'

-President Obama, talking about how the prevalence of mental health issues is not the only reason why school shootings have become so common across the US

In spite of the wave of support that came after the Sandy Hook shooting, the Obama administration was unable to usher a gun control bill through the proper channels, meaning that no tangible change has gone into effect.

'I've been in Washington for a while now, and most things don't surprise me. The fact that 20 six year olds were gunned down in the most violent fashion possible and this town couldn't do anything about it is stunning to me,' he said.

'My biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage.

First love lost: young victim also had a girlfriend at the time of his death. She described Hoffman as her first love on Twitter

'The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis.'

He
 says the difference is that Americans have the ability to stock up on 
weapons and ammunition, but the problem will not change until 
politicians are willing to stand up to the strong National Rifle 
Association.

It's an issue the country needs to do some 'soul searching' on, he said. 

'This is becoming the norm and we take it for granted in ways that, as a parent, are frightening to me,' he said.

'Right now, it's not even possible to get even the mildest restrictions through Congress, and we should be ashamed of that.

He
 pointed the finger at both members of Congress who are unwilling to 
stand up to the NRA as well as citizens who are not motivated enough to 
force their representatives to change.

Hero: Reynolds High School coach Todd Rispler (pictured with ex-student Billie Jean Brown, right, and her friend) was wounded by the gunman today in Portland, Oregon but is expected to make a full recovery

'Rispler deserve a medal,' one student wrote

Obama
 said that the lawmakers have to 'feel the heat' from their constituents
 because 'until that happens, sadly, not much is going to change'.

Data compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety that is an average of 1.37 school shootings for every school week since the Sandy Hook tragedy.

This troubling statistic is based on the fact that an average school year typically lasts 180 days, meaning that in the 18 months since Sandy Hook there have been 
approximately 270 days, or 54 weeks of school in attendance since that 
day.

The Everytown for Gun 
Safety data shows that the shootings have occurred across the country, 
from east to west as 31 states have suffered gun violence at schools.

Last tweet: Hoffman tweeted just minutes before the shooting, writing 'let's just end school with a bunch of stressful test [sic]...yay..' Pictured above in another photo from Facebook

Georgia has endured the most, with 10 attacks while other notable incidences have happened seven times in Florida, five in Tennessee, four in North Carolina and four in California.

The
 vast majority of shootings have occurred in high schools and then 
college campuses, with elementary and middle school shootings more of an
 anomaly.

Police have identified Emilio Hoffman as the victim from the Tuesday shooting at Reynolds High School.

They
 have not released the name of the shooter, and it remains unclear if 
they specifically targeted Emilio, a ninth grader, or if he just 
happened to be in the gunman's path.

A
 physical education teacher was also shot in the ordeal, though he was 
just injured and able to run to the school office to initiate lockdown 
procedures.

Classmates paid tribute to the fallen 
high-schooler on Twitter, who remembered him as an outgoing student who 
was an outstanding athlete. According to a roster posted on the school's
 website, Hoffman played midfielder on the JV soccer team last fall.

'Wow
 I can't believe that you are gone..RIP Emilio Hoffman. You were a great
 soccer player and a great friend. My prayers go out,' one user wrote.

Reynolds soccer coach Allan Berry described Hoffman as a 'nice,quiet young man' and told the Oregonian he expected the 14-year-old to make the varsity team the next season.

'I'm sure the boys will choose to make this season for him,' Berry said.

Hoffman
 also played for a club team. Total Futbol Academy Barcelona-Oregon 
coach Randy Olson called Hoffman an 'all-around good kid' who was apart 
of their 'soccer family.'
