Andy Murray claims to have identified and spoken with the person he wants to be his new coach - but insists an announcement may not be made until after the French Open.

‘I have an idea of exactly what I want and I’ve thought about it a lot,’ he told the BBC on Friday. ‘I have spoken to them and I’ll see. It is not like you chat to the person and the next day it is done.’

John McEnroe has said he would be willing to replace Ivan Lendl and Murray has previously insisted he needs someone who can give him more time than the Czech was latterly able to provide.

Closing in: Andy Murray has decided on who he wants to succeed Ivan Lendl as his coach

Set in clay: Murray, preparing for the French Open at Roland Garros, will soon announce his new mentor

‘I wouldn’t expect anything in the 
next few days but I’m closer than I was in Rome last week. It’s not 
about rushing,’ said the Wimbledon champion, having also been 
linked with Mats Wilander, Bob Brett and Larry Stefanki

‘You
 have to get a contract in place and there are always a few little 
complications in that respect. But, as long as the desire from both 
people is to work together then I hope it can happen fairly soon.

'There 
is always a bit of detail that needs to get worked out and more in-depth
 discussion about things.

‘Hopefully,
 nothing will happen in the next couple of weeks because I’ll still be 
here (at Roland Garros), but maybe just after.’

Murray
 has been given a middling sort of draw, facing Kazakhstan’s world No 55
 Andrey Golubev in the first round with a possible  quarter-final 
against Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka.

Unlikely: John McEnroe's name has been connected with the role from the outset, but time will be an issue

Contender: Sweden's Mats Wilander is another former legend to be connected to the Murray camp

Challenge: Murray fell to Rafael Nadal in the Italian Open and will have to get through the eight-time French Open champion to make the final

First round: Andrey Golubev (Kazakhstan)Second round: Marinko Matosevic (Australia)Third round: Phillip Kohlschreiber (Germany)Fourth round: Richard Gasquet (France)Quarter-final: Stan Wawrinka (Switzerland)Semi-final: Rafael Nadal (Spain)Final: Novak Djokovic (Serbia)

The British No1 seemed reasonably unfazed, although is aware of the danger Golubev presents.

‘He
 plays exciting tennis, goes for his shots, and when he’s on he makes it
 very difficult,’ said Murray. ‘His form has been inconsistent because 
of his game style but he beat Wawrinka in the Davis Cup this year, he’s 
got a big forehand and doesn’t hold back.’

Murray
 has been joined here by James Ward, who carved himself a small piece of
 tennis history on Friday when he became the first British man in 41 
years to qualify for the French Open.

The
 London cabbie’s son scored one of his best career victories — and a 
minimum payday of £20,000 — by coming back to beat highly-rated former 
American college champion Blaz Rola 4-6, 6-4, 12-10.

Historic: James Ward became the first Englishman to reach the French Open through qualifying

Heather
 Watson could make it a highly unusual British double on Saturday if she can 
overcome Estonian Anett Kontaveit in the women’s final qualifying round
 to also make it into the main draw.

But Friday was a reminder of the stirring Davis Cup performances for which British No 3 Ward is best known.

His
 three-match run into the main draw had unpromising beginnings when he 
arrived a day late in Paris after watching his beloved Arsenal win the 
FA Cup last week. He not only got to watch the final, but met up with a 
few of the players afterwards before catching the train.

Unique: Heather Watson could make it a double for Britain is she wins Saturday's qualifying final

‘I
 probably should have been in Paris preparing early but I couldn’t say 
no to Arsenal,’ he said. ‘At 2-0 down after 10 minutes, I was thinking: 
“Everyone who knows I am at this game will absolutely slaughter me”.

‘My
 coach wasn’t too happy with me but he knows I’m  mad about Arsenal, so 
he let it go. Even though he’s an Aussie, he realised we haven’t been in
 too many finals lately.’

It
 was not all joy for the Brits  yesterday, with Jo Konta losing 6-7, 
7-5, 6-0 in the final round of women’s qualifying to Yuliya Beygelzimer 
and Dan Cox going out of the second round of the men’s event 6-3, 7-6 to
 Paolo Lorenzi.
