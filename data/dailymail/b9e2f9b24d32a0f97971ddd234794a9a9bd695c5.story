Warning: Mark Carney yesterday said a rise in the base rate was on the way, despite the risk that it could push the country back into a recession

Household debt is a ‘major risk’ to the economy and could tip Britain back into recession when interest rates rise, the Bank of England’s governor declared yesterday.

Mark Carney said that many families are in ‘a vulnerable position’ having overstretched themselves to get onto, or move up, the housing ladder.

Any large rise in mortgage or loan rates would mean less money being spent in shops – reversing the economy’s upward trend.

But in a stark warning to borrowers, he added that despite the risks, the first increase since 2007 is on the way.

Mr Carney said the housing market could spiral out of control if interest rates are left too low for too long.

‘The UK economy is starting to head back to normal,’ said the Canadian in a speech in Glasgow. ‘As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise.’

Mr Carney repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘gradual and limited’ to cushion the blow for highly-indebted borrowers.

But he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘tip the economy into recession’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages.

‘It is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us,’ said Mr Carney.

‘History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens.

‘If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession. Since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful.’

Mr Carney said that with household debt worth 140 per cent of disposable income, rates will stay ‘materially lower’ than the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis. He warned that this level of debt is ‘a major risk’ to economic stability.

A report published today says dealing with ‘the household debt hangover’ must be a priority as the ‘holiday period’ of low borrowing costs ends. The Resolution Foundation think-tank warns that the number of mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1million today to 2.3million by 2018.

The number of households in ‘debt peril’ – meaning they are spending more than half of their income on debt repayments – could increase from 600,000 to 1.1million. 

'Household indebtedness concerns us': Mr Carney listens as he is introduced before speaking at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow, Scotland,  yesterday 

Rates have been frozen at an emergency low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of ‘the Great Recession’ in March 2009.

But the UK is now the fastest growing advanced economy in the world and jobs are being created at a record pace.

This has led many observers to believe that interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent later this year or early next year before reaching 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2017.

That would push up mortgage costs for millions –although it would be welcomed by savers who have lost out since the financial crisis.

Issuing a warning on the housing market, Mr Carney said: ‘The Bank is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop. In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market.’

He was recently accused of behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ over his apparent changes of heart on when rates will rise. Yesterday he refused to be drawn on exactly when the first rise will come.
