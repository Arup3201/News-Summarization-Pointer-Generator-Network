January Blues are clearly unheard of in South Africa's Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, judging by the look of this hyena.

The series of images show the wild animal breaking out into what appears to be manic laughter. The butt of the joke is, however, anyone 's guess.

Photographer Bridgena Barnard who captured the hilarious sight said: 'The hyena with his Motley pattern coat entertained us like no other. A clown deluxe.

Tell it again: Grinning hyena looks more than pleased to kick off 2013

'Every time the camera clicked he juggled and gave a new pose, moving around and entertaining the photographer with absolute delight.

'Like a truly talented 'Kings Fool', he left this laugh for last - seeming to grin from ear to ear.

'He did not wait for the encore, just disappeared in the grass like a soft breeze.'

 Hyenas make a variety of vocalisations, including howling screams, wailing calls, and the well-known 'laughter' used to alert other clan members up to three miles away of a food source.

Researchers found that the pitch of the hyena's laughter reveals its age. 
Variation in the frequency of notes indicates whether an animal is 
dominant or subordinate.

Younger hyenas tend to have high-pitched 'giggles' while the dominant females of the group make a narrower range of sounds.

The cackles are usually produced when hyenas are squabbling over 
food. But the scientists say they may also be a sign of frustration or 
used to summon help.

Having a wild time: Looks like the hyena is in unstoppable belly laugh mode

Scientists believe the cackles reveal much about the hyena.

The pitch can reveal its age, and variation of notes indicates whether an animal is 
dominant or subordinate. 

This may allow them to establish feeding rights and organise their feeding activities.

The laugh may also help hyenas fend off lions who muscle in on their kills.

A solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion, 
whereas a hyena group often can 'mob' one or two lions and get their 
food back.

The other explanation, of course, is that they are just high on life

'The hyena's laugh gives receivers cues to assess the social rank
of the emitting individual,' said Dr Frederic Theunissen, who led the 
study at the University of California.

'This may allow hyenas to establish feeding rights and organise their food gathering activities.'

He said the laugh could also help hyenas fend off lions who often muscle in on their kills.

'A solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion, 
whereas a hyena group often can 'mob' one or two lions and get their 
food back,' he said.

'Giggles could therefore allow the recruitment of allies.'

When a member of the same hyena clan hears the call, it can identify the laugh and decide whether to answer or ignore it.

Hyenas, which usually move about on their own, live in groups of up to 80 led by a single female.

They are extremely noisy and their whoops, cries and cackles can be heard up to three miles away at night.

Although known as scavengers, they are actually efficient hunters, tracking down wildebeest, zebra, buffalo and gazelles.

A single hyena can devour up to 30lb of meat a day and a group can demolish a zebra in half an hour.

They can clamp their jaws with a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch - strong enough to crack the bones of a giraffe.

Creasing up: And the laughter continues. No January blues for this one
