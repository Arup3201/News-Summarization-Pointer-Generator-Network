A Scottish hospital has introduced a shopping trolley style coin unlocking system on wheelchairs – to force people to bring them back.

Raigmore Hospital in Inverness is thought to be the first in Scotland to bring in the controversial new system, which is commonly used by supermarkets to stop shoppers stealing trolleys.

While the hospital says there is no issue with patients stealing wheelchairs, it claims that often there are not enough of them available at the entrances because people tend to abandon them in various wards  and departments throughout the building.

But last night, the Scotland Patients Association condemned the move – pointing out that there was a huge difference between a supermarket and an NHS hospital dealing with the elderly, sick and infirm.

Chairman Margaret Watt said: ‘I find it quite obscene. We are dealing with sick people here. Patients are worried enough when they arrive at hospitals. I don’t think they need any added problems.’

Several hospitals in England have recently introduced the coin slot scheme, claiming that, in some cases, patients had tried to make off with wheelchairs.

Stafford Hospital, which was among the first to roll out the deposit system, said it had 20 chairs, worth £600 each, stolen over the past four years.

Critics, however, claimed that the loss of £1 would hardly act as a deterrent to a patient determined to take a wheelchair.

Edinburgh Royal Infirmary looked at introducing a similar scheme a decade ago after neighbours complained about wheelchairs being dumped in their gardens but the proposal was later dropped.

Raigmore spokesman Donna Smith said: ‘We received a lot of patient and visitor feedback that when people were coming in to outpatients, or our main entrance to the inpatient ward areas, there were no wheelchairs available.

‘As a result, we invested in new wheelchairs that are located at our two main entrances. They require a token or a pound coin to use, which can be redeemed when returned.

‘Our reception desk in outpatients also has spare tokens if the patient or visitor needs one or in case of an emergency.’

But Mrs Watt said: ‘Why can’t they get a porter to return the wheelchairs to where they are meant to be? That is something a hospital employee could be asked to do.

‘It would have been much better if they had tried to solve this problem without putting more pressure on the patient.’
