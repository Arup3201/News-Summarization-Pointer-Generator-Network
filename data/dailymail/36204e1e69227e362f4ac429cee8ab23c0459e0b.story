Intelligence chiefs are poring over footage of Isis executioner 'Jihadi John' to establish if he really has been injured in a US bombing raid - but have received 'no evidence' so far that he was among those hit.

The British killer, who orchestrated the horrific video showing the beheading of 16 Syrian soldiers and the severed head of American hostage Peter Kassig, was said to have been wounded in the air strike on a convoy reported to have included Isis mastermind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

But MailOnline understands that intelligence officers have no confirmation yet that he was on the convoy – or that he had been injured.

The Foreign Office has said it was aware of the 'report' that he may have been injured but is awaiting confirmation.

The news comes as new footage emerged showing Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the London rapper who was suspected of being 'Jihadi John' until intelligence chiefs ruled him out - blasting police tactics while being interviewed by an Australian news channel during the 2011 London riots.

Militant: Intelligence chiefs investigating claims ISIS killer 'Jihadi John' (pictured) had been injured in a US bombing raid have received 'no evidence' so far that he was among those hit

Murdered: The murder of American aid worker Peter Kassig (pictured) this weekend was reportedly in revenge for the air raid on November 8. In the murder video, Jihadi John appears not to be injured 

Significantly the murder of former US ranger Kassig – the fifth killing of a Western hostage 'Jihadi John' is shown taking part in – appears to have been filmed after the US airstrike on November 8.

The militant shows no obvious sign of injury and there has been speculation the killing of the Muslim convert was in revenge for the convoy strike.

Security officials also say it is unlikely that 'Jihadi John' would be allowed to travel with the ISIS leadership because his voice is so well known from the death videos where he spouts sickening jihadist propaganda.

Voice recognition technology used by both British and US Special Forces could potentially identify him in a convoy triggering drone attack.

This weekend is was claimed that the masked 'executioner' narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group's leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.

Sickening: The latest ISIS video showed a group of Syrian soldiers being marched along a desert road in Dabiq and brutally murdered by a large number of unmasked militants

Unsettling: The video also shows the mass murder of Syrian military personnel by beheading led by Jihadi John at a desert location. Unlike the murder of Western hostages, the killing of the Syrians is shown in full

This weekend it was claimed that Jihadi John had been injured in an airstrike targeting a convoy driving near the Iraqi town of Al Qaim, close to the Syrian border the previous Saturday.

It was claimed that both he and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been among a group of senior militants who attended a secret, heavily guarded meeting in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in the town. 

At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to a well-placed Syrian source.

A source speaking to the Mail on Sunday claimed that Jihadi John goes by the name Jalman Al-Britani and that he and the rest of those injured in the airstrikes - including Al-Baghdadi - were transported to a hospital in the city of Deir-ez-Zour.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

ISIS members apparently issued urgent calls through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital.

The news comes as a new video emerged of  Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the 24 year old Britain who was once the main suspect to be Jihadi John.

Although Bary is known to be fighting alongside ISIS in Syria, and photographs have previously shown his posing with severed heads in the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, intelligence chiefs are understood to have since ruled him out as the man in the terror group's filmed murder videos.

The footage - shot by 9News  on Saturday 6 August 2011 when rioting first broke out outside Tottenham police station - shows former rapper Bary in an agitated state as he rants to reporter Peter Stefanovic about police tactics.

In footage aired today's 9News bulletin, Stefanovic is seen interviewing another man before Bary commands control of the microphone.

'Let me tell you something. The police are protecting the police station, they're not protecting the people,' Bary said.

'A policeman said it out of his own words when I asked him 'why are you here'...He said I'm here to protect the police,' the rapper turned Islamic extremist added.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist Islam and is believed to have travelled to Syria last year 

Stefanovic told 9News he met Bary on the first night of the riots on the streets of Tottenham in North London. 

'There were hundreds of young people loitering near a burning building that police and firefighters were trying to control,' he said.

'There was a lot of friction and tension simmering on the streets and this group of young men crowded around me as I was filming a piece-to-camera.'

Bary abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist Islam and is believed to have travelled to Syria last year.

Earlier this year, he posted a photograph on Twitter of himself holding up a decapitated head with the message 'Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him'. The photograph is understood to have been taken in the terror group's de facto capital city Raqqa.

Bary is the son of Adel Abdul Bary - an Egyptian who recently admitted playing a role in the deadly Al Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.

Appearing in an American court in September, the 54 year old pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make a threat to use an explosive device, making a threat to use an explosive device, and conspiracy to murder Americans.
