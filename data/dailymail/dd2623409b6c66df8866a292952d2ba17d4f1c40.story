Preston North End 1-3 Manchester United. It wasn't pretty, and it was far from easy. What Louis van Gaal could have done with, was a striker on top form.

Preston aren't a bad side - they're fourth in League One and real contenders for promotion to the second tier of English football - but the might of Manchester United should have brushed them aside with ease. Radamel Falcao should have brushed them aside with ease.

Preston took the lead just after half-time, and they were in with a real chance of progressing to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup until Ander Herrera got the ball rolling, and Marouane Fellaini put them ahead. No Falcao in sight.

Van Gaal and United have a big decision to make regarding the future of the Colombian - he will cost them £43million if they decide to make his loan a permanent deal - and if Monday night is anything to go by, he doesn't seem worthy of the mega-bucks he is currently being paid. 

On 60 minutes, with Preston leading 1-0, Falcao was hauled off in place of Ashley Young. One hour, zero goals, zero shots.

There have been flashes since he made his Old Trafford debut in September. Four goals, a handful of decent performances, and a brief sign of what he could bring to the Premier League. But not enough.

There are rumours that he's unhappy with life at United; his agent Jorge Mendes took a swipe at Van Gaal last week, claiming that Falcao would've been better under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson.

'Falcao is a champion,' Mendes said. 'Recently he was being the best player of the match and after 70 minutes... there are things I don't want to discuss further.'

Mendes refers to his substitution, much like the scenario he faced after an hour against Preston on Monday night. Except he was far from the best player on the pitch on this occasion.

Falcao looked bemused as the fourth official held up a big red No 9, as though he didn't expect a change. As though United weren't 1-0 down against League One opposition with half an hour remaining.

Sportsmail columnist and former Arsenal and England defender Martin Keown, who was commentating on the match for the BBC, said: 'I wonder if we'll ever see him again in a United shirt. He's offered nothing to his team tonight.'

Louis van Gaal shakes Falcao's hand after he is substituted - the United manager has a big decision to make

The 29-year-old was left out of Van Gaal's squad to face Southampton in January - he's not immune to exclusion - and it wouldn't be a surprise if Robin van Persie gets the nod instead of him come the weekend, when United travel to Swansea.

There are 13 Premier League matches left of the season, before Falcao's future is decided. It's a gamble whichever way Manchester United decide to go. 

There is certainly talent there; Falcao has more than proved that in his successful career to date, at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco. 

But it just isn't working for him in England. These things take time, but time, and £43m, might be luxuries United aren't willing to afford.

It will cost £43million if they decide to keep him, and it is a huge gamble
