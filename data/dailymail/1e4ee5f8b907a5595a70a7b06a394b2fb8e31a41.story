Surveillance: Yulia Tymoshenko is being monitored 24/7

The former Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko is on hunger strike after being 'beaten' by guards in jail where she claims she is a political prisoner.

Her case is set to cast a shadow over the Kiev government which begins co-hosting the Euro 2012 football championships in six weeks with calls for a boycott of the football tournament by Western politicians.

'Yulia Tymoshenko has declared a hunger strike,' her lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said, adding she has not eaten since Friday.

Ukrainian officials admit that warders manhandled the opposition leader - once dubbed the Thatcher of Eastern Euope - after she refused to have hospital treatment for a longstanding spine complaint, fearing that state-appointed medics would poison her or infect her with a disease.

'There is a horrible haematoma on her stomach and there are bruises on her arms,' Vlasenko said.

He added that she was 'punched in the stomach' before losing consciousness.

'According to the law and the criminal administrative code, the prison service has the right to use physical force,' claimed local prosecutor Hennadiy Tyurin.

He denied undue force was used and no criminal probe has been opened.

Her treatment is set to spark angry protests marring the Euro 2012 contest which Ukraine co-hosts with Poland. England play three qualifying matches in the former Soviet state.

The football tournament is meant to showcase Ukraine's modern outlook but 51-year-old Tymoshenko's supporters are determined to use the spotlight to demonstrate against 'Soviet-style repression'.

Already Germany's commissioner for 
human rights has claimed a boycott by VIP Western politicians is 
appropriate, claiming she was jailed on political grounds.

'The Ukrainian government is gradually
realising that a number of leading European politicians could boycott 
the European Football Championship,' warned Markus Loning.

He demanded that pressure is increased on the Ukraine government. 'We wish to see it increasing,' he said.

A leader of Ukraine's Orange 
Revolution, Tymoshenko was premier for three years before narrowing 
losing to her arch-foe Viktor Yanukovych in the 2010 presidential 
election.

Since then she has faced an extraordinary legal campaign which has led to calls for the West to act against Ukraine.

She was jailed for seven years for 
abuse of office, crimes that are not recognised in the West. A barrage 
of other charges, including corruption, have been levelled against her 
which could keep her out of politics for two decades.

Yanukovych has refused to intervene claiming he wants to stamp out corruption.
