Child safety campaigners hit out at Tesco yesterday after it emerged that its mobile phone network was the only one of Britain's main operators that had failed to apply a 'porn filter'

Child safety campaigners hit out at Tesco yesterday after it emerged that its mobile phone network was the only one of Britain's main operators that had failed to apply a 'porn filter'.

Experts said the supermarket's failure to install the filters on its phones showed shortcomings in the initiative unveiled by Prime Minister David Cameron in July.

Mr Cameron succeeded in persuading 
all mobile companies to agree that networks should protect children from
being able to find inappropriate content online.

The companies signed 
up to an agreement that means parental controls are automatically 
switched on within phones.

In
a speech to the NSPCC in July he announced: 'On mobile phones, it’s 
great to report that all of the operators have now agreed to put adult 
content filters onto phones automatically. 

'And to deactivate them you 
have to prove you’re over 18 and operators will continue to refine and 
improve those filters.'

Vodafone, O2, EE and Three have all introduced the filters but Tesco Mobile, which has 200,000 customers in Britain, has not.

Britain’s
largest retailer also faced criticism for cultivating a family-friendly
image at the same time as failing to 
install the filters.

Tesco Mobile offers what it calls 'family perks' - special deals for customers who take two or more contracts out at once, such as parents who sign their children up for a phone contract when they take one out for themselves. 

A crossbench peer in the House of Lords 
made the revelation during the second reading of the Online Safety Bill,
a Private Member's Bill she introduced in May.

Baroness Howe of Ildicote said her bill would create a legal requirement for all mobile phone companies to install adult content filters, reported The Times.

'My Bill goes further than the Prime Minister has done so far.

'It introduces the missing element of legislative compulsion so that the industry really does make child internet safety a priority.'

'What we require is a robust system that affords children the same legal protections online as they enjoy offline, that delivers credible age verification and that covers all mobile phone operators and internet service providers.'

Nola Leach, Chief Executive of the Christian charity CARE, urged the government to support the bill.

'The shocking revelation about Tesco Mobile shows that it is not enough to rely on voluntary agreeements with profit-making companies to keep our children safe.

'The law needs to be changed to protect children when using the internet,' she told The Times. 

Odd one out: Tesco faced criticism for its Mobile arm not yet introducing the porn filters David Cameron announced in July - despite Vodafone, O2, EE and Three having done so

She said the case of Tesco Mobile showed that a voluntary approach was not working and
as a result, 'children are being exposed to sexually explicit material 
that the Prime Minister wrongly assured their parents they’d be safe 
from'.

John Carr, secretary of the Children's 
Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety, told The Times: 'We don't have 
anyone who can check the veracity of statements that companies make. We 
need something urgently.'

Tesco Mobile is jointly owned by Tesco 
and O2 and runs on the O2 network in the UK. Industry sources told The 
Times that the blocks should have operated on the Tesco Mobile network 
as standard, but technical faults had so far prevented the network from 
being able to apply them. 

Embarrassment: The revelation about Tesco may cause red faces in Downing Street after David Cameron gave assurances that all the major mobile operators had agreed to install porn filters

A spokesperson for Tesco Mobile told MailOnline that the reason the filters had not been installed was 
because some of their old systems needed upgrading, but that the firm 
was making these changes as a matter of 'absolute priority'.

She
said: 'We currently direct our customers to our free parental controls 
service which provides robust content management and this service can be
switched on at any time.

'From early 2014 we will also automatically 
filter adult content on all handsets and customers will have to advise 
if they wish filters to be removed.'

The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport told The Times: 'We understand 
this is a technical issue and Tesco has assured us that it is working 
hard to rectify this position.'
