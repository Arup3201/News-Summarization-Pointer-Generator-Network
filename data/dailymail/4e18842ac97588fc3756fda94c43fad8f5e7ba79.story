With a public execution, a violent beating and frenzied animals, it hardly sounds like ideal entertainment for children.

But film censors appear to think otherwise – granting The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a 12A rating, which means it can be seen by under-12s if they are with an adult.

Yesterday, critics attacked those behind the film for glamorising violence and exposing the young target audience to ‘unnecessarily graphic’ scenes.

Set in a futuristic North America, the film is the second adaptation taken from the phenomenally successful Hunger Games book trilogy by Suzanne Collins.

Starring 23-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, it explores life under a totalitarian government which annually requires a young ‘tribute’ from each district of the country to compete in a televised ‘hunger game’ – in which each competitor must try to kill off their rivals.

In one scene viewers witness a man being flogged and whipped by soldiers and are shown his wounded and bloodied back. Later, an elderly man is clubbed by two soldiers and publicly executed by a gunshot to the head.

The first Hunger Games film, released in March 2012, grossed £5million in the UK in its opening weekend, twice as much as the opening instalment of another teenage favourite, the Twilight Saga.

Yesterday Vivienne Pattison, of lobby group Mediawatch, accused producers of deliberately opening up the new film to children – regardless of the consequences the violent scenes will have on them – to generate box office sales.

She also claimed the flexible rating failed to protect youngsters.

Miss Pattison said: ‘The problem with this particular film is that it originates from a book designed for children.

‘And there is a very big difference between reading a gory image on the page than burning it into the retinas of young children watching it on the big screen in the cinema.

‘Although the rating suggests there may be some adult scenes there is still little guidance, and there is nothing in place to stop parents or guardians from taking children as young as six or seven to the cinema to see the film.

‘The story environment at times is quite realistic and therefore the horrific violence is glamorised.

'In a society in which children are exposed to so much violence and adult imagery we should be working to protect youngsters from further exposure in films and games. We don’t need to terrify children to entertain them.’

Prior to the release of the first Hunger Games film, edits were made in order to achieve a 12A rating in the UK.

Later the same year, a DVD was released of the international version, which restored the cut material but carried a 15 classification – warning of strong violence and threat.

Yet despite sharing the same themes, the  sequel, which will be out in the UK on November 21, passed uncut through the British Board of Film Classification with a 12A rating.

The BBFC report states the film contains ‘moderate violence and threat and infrequent strong language’.

Pippa Smith of the Safer Media campaign said: ‘The film industry puts too much responsibility on parents. It isn’t fair they should have to make the decision whether they take their child or not when the guidelines are so vague. Classification on films needs to be much stricter.’

But a BBFC spokesman encouraged parents to check their website for guidance before taking their children to the cinema, adding: ‘We consider the content of 12A rated films to be suitable for children aged 12 and over, and we would not recommend taking very young children to see them, though an adult may take a younger child if, in their judgement, the film is suitable for that particular child.’
