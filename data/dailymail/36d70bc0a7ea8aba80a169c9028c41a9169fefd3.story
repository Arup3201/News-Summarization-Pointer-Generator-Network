With a handshake and a smile, Britain's leading combat role in Afghanistan ended yesterday.

The headquarters of Task Force Helmand ceased operations after 13 years of bloody fighting and the loss of nearly 450 lives.

Five thousand UK troops will remain in the war zone – but only until December and under US command.

UK Brigadier James Woodham sealed the handover by shaking hands with US Brigadier General Daniel Yoo, who said Britain's sacrifice would go down in 'the annals of military history'.

Senior commanders say the Afghan army and police forces are increasingly able to maintain security.

But they warn that the threat of casualties will endure until the last soldier leaves. National elections on Saturday provide the first flashpoint.

Four hundred troops representing every unit in the task force attended the Camp Bastion ceremony, staged in front of a monument bearing 16 plaques – one for each brigade to fight there.

Padre Steve Whiting said: 'From the poppy fields of Ypres to those of Helmand province, our bravest and best have borne the cost of freedom for others.'

Brigadier Woodham, who commands 7 Armoured Brigade – the Desert Rats – said Britain should feel proud of its troops despite the mission's painful losses.

'They have served long and hard, demonstrated their professionalism, shown real commitment through some dark days. They have delivered the mission and given the Afghans a chance,' he said.

He said the military campaign had faced down Al Qaeda, trained 350,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen and set up schools and health centres.

Task Force Helmand was formed in 2006 when 3,000 servicemen were sent by Tony Blair to Helmand, a volatile Taliban hotbed in the south of Afghanistan.

The then defence secretary John Reid said he hoped 'not a shot would be fired' in what was expected to be a three-year campaign.

But violence spiralled and hundreds of troops have been killed by bullets and roadside bombs. The war has claimed 448 UK lives.

Packing up: British soldiers on their way out of Helmand province

The
 rest will focus on packing up kit ahead of the return home. Leaving 
Afghanistan is considered the biggest logistical exercise for UK forces 
since the Second World War.

Commanders have the job of bringing home 3,400 vehicles and 5,000 shipping containers worth of kit on a journey of 8,000 miles.

A committee in the UK decides what is saved and what should be scrapped or gifted to the Afghans.

So far, 1,753 vehicles and the equivalent of 2,750 containers have been returned.

Brigadier Martin Moore, of the UK's Joint Forces Support, said the £300 million redeployment operation was carefully thought out.

He added: 'We have got to get the balance right between taking equipment and recovering capability and leaving sufficient kit for fighters to do the job on the ground. We have to ensure we get out of here in good order with everybody alive.'

He said Camp Bastion would take on the 'expeditionary posture' of a military checkpoint.

Human rights legislation will stop soldiers fighting properly because they fear being sued, MPs will warn today.

They will say an unprecedented number of legal challenges is jeopardising the effectiveness of the armed forces.

The report of the Commons defence committee condemns the 'judicialisation' of warfare and warns of higher civilian casualties as risk-adverse commanders call in airstrikes instead of putting troops in the line of fire.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured right) responded to the findings by signalling last night that the Government is prepared to change the law to give soldiers more protection from the courts.

The European Convention on Human Rights allows foreign nationals – such as detainees held by British forces – to make frequently spurious claims in the UK courts.

Last month allegations that British troops executed Iraqis in cold blood were dropped only after a year-long inquiry costing £22million.

The MPs say this leaves servicemen vulnerable to 'almost unlimited potential for retrospective claims against them' and has led many to question whether they want to stay in uniform.

They also warn that a Supreme Court decision last year to let families of dead servicemen sue the Ministry of Defence for negligence has also undermined operational effectiveness.

The committee said: 'This seems to us to risk the judicialisation of war and to be incompatible with the accepted contract entered into by service personnel and the nature of soldiering.'
