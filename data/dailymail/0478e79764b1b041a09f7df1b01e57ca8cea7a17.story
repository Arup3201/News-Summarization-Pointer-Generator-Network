John Iveson, 36, disappeared 'without trace' just weeks before the birth of his sixth child - a son he has never met

A wealthy businessman was murdered and his body possibly fed to pigs following a row over a house sale, a court heard yesterday.

John Iveson, 36, disappeared ‘without trace’ just weeks before the birth of his sixth child - a son he has never met.

Although a £30,000 police reward was offered for information on his whereabouts, Mr Iveson has never been found.

Yesterday agricultural workers Paul Billington, 40, and Mark Done, 47, went on trial accused of murdering Mr Iveson more than five years ago.

Chester Crown Court heard Billington, a pig farmer and father-of-four, owed Mr Iveson ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ from the sale of his detached home.

Mr Iveson, described as a ‘wheeler-dealer’ and ‘hard-man,’ had been threatening and calling Billington up to 20 times a day to demand his cash.

Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said Billington had become desperate because Mr Iveson was taking every penny from him and he was struggling to make ends meet.

With the help of poultry farmer, Done, the pair killed Mr Iveson and got rid of his body on his farm, possibly feeding the property developer’s remains to pigs, the barrister added.

‘As farmers they had access to vehicles to move the body and land on which the remains could be disposed,’ Mr Thomas said.

‘Paul Billington used to incinerate pig carcasses on his land. He had macerating equipment to chop materials for feed.

‘Even pigs themselves have been known to eat human remains. In short, although we do not know what happened to John Iveson, a pig farmer would be very well placed to dispose of a body without a trace.’

The jury was told that in 2006 Iveson agreed to sell his £325,000 family home, in Riverbank Close, Nantwich, Cheshire, to Billington.

He wanted to use the cash to buy land at Mile House Farm, a £550,000 farmhouse, in Worleson, near Nantwich, which he already part owned.

But Billington, of Rossett, near Wrexham, north Wales, struggled to find the cash and, in January the following year, Mr Iveson began threatening him that he needed his money.

‘By the time of his disappearance John Iveson was demanding a very large sum of money from Mr Billington,’ Mr Thomas said.

‘He wanted the money within a matter of days. He was telephoning Mr Billington up to 20 times a day and making threats. Mark Done was involved in the financial arrangements - he was a friend of both men.

‘Mr Iveson treated Mr Billington contemptuously. He had bullied him all the time he had known him. Paul Billington was becoming ill with worry. John Iveson was taking every spare penny he could get, leaving his own family without enough to pay their own bills.’

Mr Iveson was last seen at around 6.30pm on January 30 2007 when Billington turned up at his home to collect him for a meeting.

Earlier in the day he had been making arrangements to go out and celebrate his younger sister, Lucy’s 21st birthday, the court heard.

Despite several mistaken ‘sightings’ of Mr Iveson over the past five years it is ‘inconceivable’ that he simply walked away from his life, Mr Thomas added.

At the time of his disappearance his wife, Julie, 35, was heavily pregnant with the couple’s sixth child, a son, named Ryan, who was born on March 12.

She reported him missing, sparking a wide-ranging police investigation, including an appeal on the BBC’s Missing Live.

Mr Iveson worked on big contracts demolishing old warehouses and selling reclaimed materials on for profit. He topped up his income by dealing in imported cigarettes.

Mr Thomas said Mr Iveson’s life was a ‘complicated’ one.

‘He was something of a wheeler dealer, a rogue, a criminal who had spent 18 months in prison for violent disorder and wounding,’ Mr Thomas said.

‘He was generous to his wife - he was never short of money and bought her a BMW 4x4 car as a birthday present.

‘However, he had a short temper and there were times when he could be violent.

‘John Iveson had a number of affairs and one-night stands. He used to visit a strip club and massage parlour. But whether the victim is a saint or sinner, murder is murder.’

The case is reminiscent of the Thomas Harris novel and film, Hannibal, in which serial killer Hannibal Lecter’s only surviving victim attempts to capture him and feed him to pigs.

The body of undercover British soldier Captain Robert Nairac was also reportedly ground up and fed to pigs after her was beaten and murdered by the Provisional IRA in 1977.

Billington and Done, of Nantwich, Cheshire, deny murder. The case continues.
