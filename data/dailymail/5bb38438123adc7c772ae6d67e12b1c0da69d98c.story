Amid the din and the disapproving cat calls making their way down from The Jungle, Wayne Rooney will deliver his final instructions at Celtic Park.

It is on the field, in the moments before Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson gets this clash with Scotland under way, when England’s players will wrap their arms around each other.

The pre-match huddle is famous at Celtic — started here in the 90s when Tony Mowbray was captain of the club. On Tuesday, it is guaranteed to provoke a different reception.

There is a growing sense of maturity about England's Wayne Rooney ahead of the game against Scotland

Rooney admitted he had spoken to the younger players in the group about the atmosphere they should expect

‘Up to now I have spoken and a few of the lads have jumped in after, which is great,’ revealed Rooney.

‘It shows everyone wants to be vocal. It’s something we will continue to do and it’s really a reminder of the messages we have heard all week. What is said is between us.’

On Tuesday evening, in the famous stadium’s fevered atmosphere, the captain will have to shout to make himself heard. It promises to be full volume.

Away from the pitch there have been some softer tones, with Rooney taking some of the younger players to one side and explaining the competitive nature of this fixture over the past few days.

Nathaniel Clyne, Kieran Gibbs, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling were in the team that beat Slovenia 3-1 on Saturday. None of them faced Scotland at Wembley last August. There is a growing sense of maturity about Rooney these days and he is increasing in authority as captain.

When the Football Writers’ Association presented him with a cut glass crystal ball to commemorate his 100th appearance, his face was visibly moved by the sentiment.

The England squad looked relaxed ahead of the game but Rooney knows the atmosphere will play a big part

At Celtic Park on Monday night he graciously handed over an England shirt, signed by the whole squad, to a reporter who is heading for sunnier climes after this game.

He then skilfully and respectfully body-swerved a question about any ambitions to finish his career north of the border.

‘Some great players, the likes of Roy Keane, who I played with, have come here, but it’s not something I’d talk about now,’ he added.

‘I’m focused on England and Manchester United.’ Intriguingly, he appears more at home with the national team these days than he does at Old Trafford under Louis van Gaal.

At the age of 29, his future responsibility is to use his experience and standing in the team to help draw the best out of the players being promoted to the squad.

He has been there, seen it and not quite done it on the biggest stage of all. A fine legacy would be to tease the potential out of the younger players in this squad.

It seems faintly ridiculous to describe him as a pastoral figure, but that is what he is becoming around the England camp as he prepares to play for the 101st time.

He also spoke warmly about his United team-mate Darren Fletcher, showing support for the Scotland midfielder after his successful recovery from a long-standing bowel condition.

‘First of all it’s incredible for him to be playing again and to be back in Scotland’s team,’ he added. ‘It shows the character and the type of player he is. Obviously it was hard for Darren and his family, but he’s come through that with flying colours.

‘He doesn’t miss a training session. He’s fit and he’s ready to play, but he’s playing for Scotland and I’m playing for England.

‘We’re great friends off the pitch, but for 90 minutes we’re opponents.’

There is a sense of occasion about this fixture, a grand affair at one of Europe’s sporting cathedrals. It should be a humdinger.

Rooney’s best memory of the fixture dates back 18 years, when England midfielder Paul Gascoigne — then a Rangers player — scored one of the great international goals.

‘The biggest memory for me is Paul Gascoigne’s goal at Euro 96,’ he added. ‘That is the highlight from the games I’ve seen, but there will be many more before I was born. That goal is still fresh for me.’

Another one like that would certainly silence Celtic Park.
