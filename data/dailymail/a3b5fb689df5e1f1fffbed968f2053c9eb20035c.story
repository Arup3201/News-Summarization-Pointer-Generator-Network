Turkish police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters who tried to enter an Istanbul park at the centre of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government.

Hundreds of people were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday organised by the Taksim Solidarity group of political parties and non-governmental organisations. 

They are protesting over plans to redevelop the area.

Police intervened with a water cannon to break up a crowd of several thousand marching along Istanbul's main pedestrian shopping street towards Taksim Square where the park is located before firing tear gas to break up smaller pockets of protesters.

After a police crackdown on a small demonstration on May 31, the Gezi Park protests grew into broader action against what critics see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian style of government.

The unrest died down in late June but on Saturday police went in to disperse protesters who wanted to march on Taksim Square.

Erdogan has pressed for significant reforms in the economy and curtailed the power of the military which toppled four governments in four decades.

Opponents argue that during the June unrest he appealed increasingly to Islamist elements of his AK Party faithful.

Hours before Monday's police intervention, Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu spoke enthusiastically about the park's reopening.

'We have seen with the visit carried out today that all our work has been completed,' Mutlu told reporters in the park, which has been spruced up with the planting of new trees, plants and lawns since the protesters were evicted on June 15.

'People became brothers here, and it will be very crowded tonight because we all missed that brotherhood. This park will always be the symbol of people's unity, power and harmony,' university student Ozer Sari, 22, told Reuters.

However, 54-year-old Abdullah Dogan dismissed the idea that the protests were about protecting the park.

'This was about overthrowing the government, a government which did its duty and took over the park, cleaned it and returned it to the people in better shape,' he said.

Taksim Solidarity, which is opposed to the construction of a replica Ottoman era barracks on the site, had called on Sunday for its supporters to hold a public meeting. 

A police official told Reuters they evacuated the park because there were illegal groups inside who planned protests.

Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last month's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical Association.

The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner pressed Turkey on Monday to investigate reports police used excessive force to contain the protests and punish anyone found guilty.

A Turkish court has cancelled the Taksim Square redevelopment project, including the construction of the replica barracks, although the authorities can appeal against the ruling.

The ruling marked a victory for the coalition against the project and a blow for Erdogan, who stood firm against protests and riots he said were stoked by terrorists and looters.

Erdogan has said he would wait for the judicial process to be completed before proceeding with the Taksim plans, one of several large projects for Istanbul, including a major airport, a large Mosque and a canal to ease Bosphorus traffic.

If Turkey's top administrative court rules in favour of the development on appeal, Erdogan has still pledged to hold a referendum in Istanbul on the government's plan but he will drop the project if the court rejects it.
