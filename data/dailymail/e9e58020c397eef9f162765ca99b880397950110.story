After nearly eighty years behind the wheel, Jean Marriott is not only still driving but doing it in style after forking out on a brand new set of wheels.

The 94-year-old first got behind the wheel aged 15 in 1934 when King George V was on the throne, the first Donald Duck film was made and US bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde were killed.

Almost eight decades on, the mother-of-three is still going strong and has just purchased a new Nissan Micra.

She may be 94, but Jean Marriott from Norfolk has got no intention of giving up driving and has bought a new car to mark nearly 80 years behind the wheel

In her long and distinguished driving career Mrs Marriott has managed an almost perfect record.

She's chalked up just one speeding fine and has never been involved in an accident despite clocking up tens of thousands of miles.

Mrs Marriott still vividly remembers the day, during a holiday in Northumberland, when her motor engineer father persuaded her to take the controls of the family's Austin 12 Tourer.

'He was a keen motorist and he just wanted me to get started,' said Mrs Marriott, from Sheringham, Norfolk.

'There was a complete lack of traffic and the roads were beautifully cambered.

'I remember feeling very excited and can still remember the registration - WW 999. It always made me think of spending a penny urgently!'

Mrs Marriott has fond memories of picnics and outings in the tourer from the family home near Skipton, North Yorks, to the Lake District and Blackpool.

'My younger brother and I always had to sit in the back,' she said.

'It was jolly cold with the top down and We would cower behind the cellophane screen, wrapped in rugs.'

She was 17 when she passed her driving test first time in 1936 - the year after it was introduced in the UK.

But she remembers it did not go without drama.

While trying to reverse up a steep hill, the clutch became very hot and she had to abandon the attempt.

Sprightly Jean, who has only ever had a single speeding fine, doesn't rule out still driving when she is 100

'It was the car's fault, not mine, so the examiner passed me - plus he was a friend of my father.'

Her one brush with the law came when she was in her 80s and was driving to Hertfordshire to visit one of her children.

After a long wait in a traffic jam, she was finally able to get going but was booked and fined Â£60 for driving at 35mph in a 30mph limit.

Nowadays she uses her car to visit her daughter, Barbara Veitch, in Wiveton, Norfolk, or to shop and see friends in nearby Cromer and Holt.

'I enjoy driving and I think I'm quite good at it, although I'm more cautious nowadays,' she said.

'I'll continue driving as long as my health will allow me to and I'm looking forward to taking my new car out for a spin.'
