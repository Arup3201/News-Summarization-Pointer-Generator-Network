Gentlemen might have once preferred blondes but a new poll has revealed that's no longer the case - and it's all thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge.

Despite her lack of blonde locks, the brunette royal has been named British men's favourite beauty icon, triumphing over equally dark haired Cheryl Cole and Michelle Keegan in second and third places.

Her 'natural' make-up look and long flowing locks were preferred by 58 per cent of men asked, compared with just 31 per cent who said they liked Newcastle singer Cole's ultra-primped style.

Glamorous: The Duchess of Cambridge's natural make-up and glossy locks are a hit with Britain's men

And it isn't just men who love the Duchess of Cambridge's girl-next-door appearance and glossy mane.

A huge 61 per cent of women consulted named the former Kate Middleton as their favourite beauty icon, with Ms Cole once again in the runner up spot with 39 per cent of the vote.

Michelle Keegan, who is famous for her ultra-bronzed look, took third place in both polls and was picked out by fewer than a quarter of those polled.

She was joined on both lists by Harry Potter star Emma Watson and flame-haired model Lily Cole, as well as TOWIE star Sam Faiers and Strictly Come Dancing star, Abbey Clancy.

Others to make the top 10 for both men and women were singing sensation Rita Ora and fashion designer, Victoria Beckham.

Speaking about the poll, which was conducted on behalf of shopping channel QVC, Jo Lee, the beauty buying director, said: 'This research shows how important make-up is to us Brits.

'Not only does it help us to feel more comfortable in our own skin, but it's a real confidence booster.

'Perfectly prepped hair and a clear complexion can really go a long way.'
