It was part Little Bo Peep, part pantomime dame and shinier than a fresh conker.

The Duchess of Cambridge opted for a new hairstyle as she met schoolchildren yesterday – and it rather stole the limelight.

Instead of her usual relaxed waves, Kate’s glossy mane was pinned in a half-up, half-down style, back-combed on top, and teased into tight ringlets …to begin with, at least.

Straight from the stylist's chair: The Duchess of Cambridge's curls were in tact as she arrived for her visit to the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London yesterday. She wore a £450 coral dress from Goat

But it seems that even being a member of the royal family doesn’t make you immune to the perils of hot weather.

Not long into the visit to the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London, the heat and humidity caused Kate’s curls to drop rather dramatically.

The 32-year-old was left with rather limp locks – still pinned somewhat severely off her forehead.

Kate was at the school to find out about the progress of charity project she launched last year. 

M-PACT Plus provides early support for children affected by a parent’s drug or alcohol misuse.

The Duchess wore a £450 coral pink dress from Goat as she chatted to youngsters in the sunshine – but it was her hairstyle, which could have been a wig from pre-revolutionary, peri-wigged France, that came in for the most scrutiny.

The colour of her hair also attracted attention, for it appeared to have been lightened, and some strands looked almost blonde.  

Doing the twist: The Duchess' 'do from the back. Yesterday's curled style was a more theatrical look than the her usual glossy blow-dry, but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist, Amanda Cook Tucker

Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton believes this had been done using a gentle tint, rather than conventional bleach highlights, to avoid Kate ending up with unsightly roots.

He said: ‘Subtle lightening like this is achieved with a low peroxide formula.

‘The hair is only lightened towards the mid-length and ends, not at the roots, which would prevent root regrowth.’

Kate used to be a regular at the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea, but is now thought to go to Mayfair-based Italian stylist Rossano Ferretti, who charges £1,000 for a haircut.

Princess in pink: Kate's hair was pinned back to make sure that it did not fall in her face as she spent time talking to her young flag-wearing fans outside the school. Her style is also suitably formal for an official visit

Yesterday’s curled style was a more theatrical look than the Duchess’s usual glossy blow-dry, but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist, Amanda Cook Tucker.

She is believed to have achieved the style by blow-drying Kate’s hair and then using large curling tongs to create those ringlets. The top section of the hair appears to have been back-combed, and then pinned back.

Tightly curled hair like this will naturally drop over time, as the effects of hairspray wear off and gravity kicks in – and as Kate discovered, this happens more quickly in warm  or windy weather.

While Kate’s curls were enviably glossy, the tightly pinned-back style also managed to make her usually lustrous locks look thinner.

Unfurled curls: Kate's hair looks more lackluster as she leaves her visit with a framed painting under her arm. The piece of art - a portrait of her holding Prince George - was given to her by a young girl as she left

Online comments about the Duchess’s new style were mixed. Some declared the hairdo was ‘pretty’ and ‘elegant’, while others criticised the look, posting ‘What’s going with the hair? That’s the worst I’ve seen her look’ and ‘I had hair like that when I was five’.

Celebrity hairdresser Stephanie Pollard said: ‘I think she might have been aiming for a Jackie Onassis, a 1960s look to go with the dress." 

Of course Jackie Onassis’s hair was always much shorter than Kate’s and therefore her Sixties hair was never in danger of tipping into this odd hybrid of little girl ringlets and “grande dame”.

Still, while it may not be to everybody’s taste, the look is rather regal, echoing those swept-back styles of Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Anne.

It is also suitably formal for an official visit, though a little ageing on a younger woman.

Favourite style: Kate opted for a similar curly style - but without the pinned back mid-section - when she attended a ceremony in Quebec during her and William's Royal tour of Canada in 2011

One society stylist who did not want to be named said of Kate’s style: ‘She seems too old for the ringlets and too young for the severity on the top. What a strange “do”.’

Of course, this isn’t the first time the Duchess has displayed a penchant for curls.

There were ringlets poking out from under a stetson at the Calgary stampede in 2011 on her royal tour of Canada, a ‘yee-ha’ look that should have been completed with a piece of straw in her mouth and a bit of thigh-slapping.

She also sported ringlets at last year’s Remembrance Sunday parade, and was criticised because her habit of constantly twirling them looked like a display of vanity on a sombre occasion.

However, Barton points out how hard it is to dress hair for royal events.

He said: ‘Kate does suffer from time to time with ensuring her hair looks formal enough while looking young for certain occasions.’

In other words, it’s impossible to have formal hair that looks young, because young hair is messy hair, and that’s not very royal.

Denise McAdam, who was hairdresser to the royal family for 35 years, has said that the Duchess’s hair is ‘wonderful, maybe a little overdone at times’. Looks like yesterday was one of those times.
