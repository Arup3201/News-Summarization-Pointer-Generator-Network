A Southern California computer science student has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for hacking the computers of a future Miss Teen USA and other young women to try to force them to send nude photographs or undress on camera for him.

Twenty-year-old Jared James Abrahams pleaded guilty in November to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access of a computer, after his arrest in September.

The Temecula resident was sentenced Monday by a federal judge in Orange County judge.

Victim: Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf was one of a dozen women hacked by Abrahams. She went to the same high school as Abrahams

Abrahams was allowed to speak at the sentencing hearing, and took the opportunity to apologize to his victims - including current Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf.

Abrahams attended the same high school as Wolf and sent her an anonymous email last spring, claiming to have nude pictures of her and that he could post online if she didn't send him more photos.

In court on Monday, Abrahams expressed his 'immense sorrow' for the victims, specifically his former classmate.

'First off, I send out my sympathies to Miss Cassidy, her mother...I understand nothing I saw will take back the fear and pain I brought,' Abrahams said.

'I did what I did and I must live with my actions,' he added.

His mother also spoke at the hearing, and went on to describe how his poor decisions were in part influenced by having autism. She says Abrahams was diagnosed with the mental health disorder when he was just 12 years old, and had struggled to make friends most of his life.

'I don't think anyone can understand how lonely he's been for 20 years,' his mother told the judge.

Abrahams himself said he was feeling better after enrolling in two therapeutic programs for adults with autism, one at UCLA and the other at Loma Linda University Medical Center.

He says therapy has been helpful in teaching him how to make friends.

'Everything I did was to have a feeling of a sense of involvement,' Abrahams said.

While prosecutors were pushing for a 21-month sentence, Judge James V Selna decided on a lesser 18 months because of Abrahams age and mental health issues.

'I don't think autism is an excuse for his actions,' Selna said.

Wolf's mother agrees. She also had the opportunity to speak at the hearing and confronted her daughter's attacker, calling him a 'sexual predator'.

'There are no words to describe what you did to my daughter,' Wolf's mother said.

Turning her attention to the judge, she continued to say that she and her daughter 'lived in terror' because Abrahams threatened to send stalkers to their home and that they 'jumped' every time they heard the doorbell ring when they weren't expecting visitors.

'She was a minor and he was an adult at the time,' she said. 'That's child pornography and I consider Jared Abrahams a sexual predator.'

Abrahams will have to serve at least 85 per cent of his sentence behind bars, and will be placed under restrictive supervision once released. That supervision will include restrictions on his computer use to be determined by his probation officer. He will also be required to undergo mental health treatment and to stay away from his victims

Abrahams must self-report to prison by June 16.

Authorities say Abrahams hacked into the computers of several women and was then able to control their webcams and surreptitiously photograph them.

Abrahams directly extorted at least 12 women across the world, but also hacked into an addition 100 to 150 computers.

After hacking into his victims computers and taking pictures without their consent, Abrahams would send them emails and threaten to post the pictures if they didn't send him more nude photos, record a nude video or log into Skype to strip for him.

His extortion scheme was successful in that two women stripped for him in Skype and received webcam photos from other women in Southern California, Baltimore and Russia.

After being threatened by Abrahams, a victim in Ireland wrote him an email agreeing to get on Skype.

'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' she said according to the court record.

Abrahams shot an email back, saying: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals. Also age doesn't mean a thing to me!!!'

In an interview with the Today Show, Wolf described the terrifying moment she was threatened by Abrahams in March 2013.

Wolf, who was crowned Miss Teen USA last August, says she received the anonymous email that threatened to turn her 'dream of being a model...into (her being) a porn star' if she didn't give him a 'special performance'.

Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety

'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out.

'I wasn't aware that somebody was watching me [on my webcam],' she added. 'The light [on the camera] didn't even go on, so I had no idea.'

Instead of giving into his demands, Wolf called her mom who reported the incident to police and an investigation was launched.

Wolf has been using her year as Miss Teen USA to spread awareness of internet safety to girls her age.

'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.'
