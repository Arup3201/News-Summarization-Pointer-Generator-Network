Disappointment: Mr Zbudowskyj was found guilty of assaulting three women and a man after he was booed off stage

A stand-in male stripper is facing jail after losing his temper when dozens of disappointed women booed him off stage.

Leon Zbudowskyj, 30, was a last-minute replacement for a regular stripper called Fabio at the ladies-only night.

The £10-a-ticket show was held at the Baltic Inn, near Llanelli, and posters advertising the event had been on display for weeks.

But the novice stripper dived into the crowd and lashed out when he was heckled by the audience.

Magistrates at Llanelli, South Wales, heard how he hit Miss Lewis as well as landlord David Morgan and compere Debra Jones.

Zbudowskyj denied three charges of assault and one of damaging Mrs Jones’s spectacles.

But the stripper of Caerleon, Newport, was found guilty and could be jailed when he is sentenced later this month.

Posters had been on display for weeks advertising the experienced stripper Fabio.

But instead Zbudowskyj came on stage dressed as a fireman and began spitting frothy cream at the women in the audience.

Staff at the club on a country road near the village of Pontyates had to call police when Zbudowskyj threw himself off the stage sparking a mass brawl.

Five police cars were sent to break up the scuffles and Zbudowskyj was arrested and driven off in a police car still wearing his firemen’s outfit.

Compere Mrs Jones said at the time: 'He was diabolical, he was disgusting, he just didn’t have anything, no music, no dance routine.

'He looked like he had come off the street, he looked dirty, he was unshaven and he didn’t have a six pack. In fact, he looked like he had been hit in the face with a wok.

'He just wasn’t the sort of person you’d want to see take their kit off.'

The Ladies Night was held almost a year ago and has taken until now to come to court because Zbudowskyj was being treated in a mental health unit.

After his court appearance Mrs Jones, who performs as comedienne Just Debz, said: 'I’m just happy that he has been found guilty.

'To be honest I think he should be made a bit of an example of, as long as he gets a punishment fitting the crime I’m happy with that.

'It’s been a long process really and I’m just glad it is coming to an end.'

Fabio later appeared at the club for free to make up for the women’s disappointment.
