British women with breast implants at the centre of a health scare have been told there is no evidence they are linked to increased cancer risk.

It comes after the French government yesterday announced it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, made by Poly Implant Prostheses, to have them taken out.

There are fears the gel inside might leak out and cause cancer.

But the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency stressed that there was ‘no evidence’ this was the case.

More than 40,000 British women are believed to have the French-made implants, known as PIPs, which were among the cheapest on the market.

Fears about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago, when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands.

The French health watchdog ordered an inquiry, which subsequently reported ‘serious irregularities’ in the implants.

It has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body.

So far tests have failed to find any firm evidence the implants could trigger cancer.

But yesterday France’s health minister Xavier Bertrand announced that women could have the implants removed, paid for by the French health service, as a ‘preventative’ measure.

Responding to the announcement, the 
MHRA said: ‘We recognise the concern some women who have these implants 
may be feeling but we currently have no evidence of any increase in 
incidents of cancer associated with these implants and no evidence of 
any disproportionate rupture rates other than in France.

‘We therefore do not believe that the
associated risks of surgery from breast implant removal can be 
justified without further evidence.’

It emerged this week that 250 British
women are preparing to sue six clinics which fitted the implants in a 
class action case next month.

They are unlikely to be able to sue the
implant company itself because it has been declared bankrupt as it has 
no money and no assets.

The corrective surgery in France will be
paid for out of public health funds, with a new implant funded if the 
treatment was done as part of reconstructive surgery following breast 
cancer.

While the French 
are likely to spend millions reversing implant operations, the British 
authorities have continually denied that they are trying to save money 
by not doing the same thing. 

The Department of Health in the UK said they had consulted with nine countries over safety concerns before making the decision.

Around
one in 100 women in the UK receiving a French-made PIP implant has 
suffered rupture, where the seal has split, exposing the silicone to 
body tissue.

Sufferers: Catherine Kydd and Gemma Garrett had complications after having PIP implants

Amanda Harrison, from Ramsgate, was one such unlucky patient who suffered a ruptured implant four years after surgery.

Her Harley Street surgeon waived his fee to remove it this year but she still had to pay £1,500 for hospital costs and the anaesthetist.

The 40-year-old is still suffering today. The leaked silicone has spread to her lymph nodes and a scan has revealed two bulging lumps on her spine.

Gemma Garrett, 30, who was Miss Great Britain 2008, and beauty therapist Catherine Kydd, 39, have also had the implants removed after suffering painful complications.

While
implants which have ruptured should be removed, experts say other women
may face unnecessary complications from procedures to explant - take 
out - the implants.

Around 270 women are considering legal action, although the company responsible has gone into liquidation so claims are being directed against clinics and individual surgeons.

Sally Taber, director of the Independent Healthcare Advisory Services (IHAS) supported moves made by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to reassure women.

She said ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Malta and Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. 

A British health chief said the French decision to remove the implants had caused 'unnecessary alarm'

‘France are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm. 

‘Our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their GP or implanting surgeon.

‘There
is no evidence to suggest explantation is necessary and on top of that 
there are, of course, the associated risks with going under general 
anaesthetic that women should consider before rushing into any surgery.’

The French government admitted this morning that there was no conclusive evidence of a link between the sub-standard silicone and cancer.

The
PIP implants were pulled off the market last year, when the 
manufacturers were closed down by French authorities after being accused
of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years.

The non-medical grade silicone is believed to have been originally designed for mattresses.

They have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases.

In June, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said women with breast implants may have a very small but increased risk of developing ALCL, with 34 cases of ALCL identified worldwide.

French authorities will cover the cost for women to have the implants taken out.

But UK regulators have insisted there is no link with cancer – no such cases have been reported here - and there is no need for women to have them removed.

Figures from the MHRA suggest 84,300 PIP implants have been sold in the UK since 2001, with 411 cases of failure including rupture since 2001.

Based on the assumption that each woman has two implants, at least 42,000 women in the UK could be affected, according to the MHRA.

In the UK, women are advised to contact their breast implant surgeon if they have concerns.

Douglas McGeorge, ex-president of British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said ‘There is no medical evidence that these implants need immediate replacement.

'The current guidelines are that individuals with PIP implants should go back to their treatment facility, where the integrity of the implants can be assessed and a regime for monitoring planned.

‘Clearly many patients may choose to have something done in advance of implant failure, knowing the problems associated with these implants.’

British lawyers claim the MHRA should have acted sooner and more decisively to protect women.

Mark Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, which is representing more than 250 women, said some of his clients had complained of inflammation, fatigue and fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal pain disorder.

He said: ‘I do not believe that MHRA’s reaction to date has been satisfactory. I am and have been very critical of their role throughout the history of this product.’
