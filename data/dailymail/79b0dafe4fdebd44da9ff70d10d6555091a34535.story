Perched on the northern end of Great Salt Lake, Box Elder County is named after a tree native to the area.

Once an historical and cultural centre, a barren landscape and broken down buildings now populate the town.

Also the site of Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty artwork, it was this conceptual work that first inspired London-based photographer, Anthony Gerace, to fly out and explore the area.

Box Elder County, named after a native tree, is now a barren landscape dotted with abandoned buildings

The area is most famous for Robert Smithson's conceptual artwork, which inspired Anthony Gerace

As he researched the Jetty further, Gerace became more and more interested in everything that surrounded it.

'It's a case study in decline,' Gerace told MailOnline Travel of his photo project. 'How a community that has so much history can still have it rendered null by the encroachment of desert, salt and heat.'

'By tracing a path from habitation to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and finally to the scrubland desert and salt flats edging the Great Salt Lake, the project seeks to explain how history can fail and become meaningless in the face of nature's absoluteness.'

Gerace refers to his Box Elder photographer project as 'a case study in decline', capturing how nature is claiming back space as towns stand all-but abandoned

The community has been all but rendered null due to the encroachment of desert, salt and heat and declining local industries

For the project, Gerace traced a path to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and to the desert and salt flats

Ultimately, Gerace hoped that - despite the desolate images - that the project would say something positive

Despite the desolate images, Gerace wanted Box Elder to ultimately say something positive about the county and the country, more generally.

The project conveys a multitude of voices to varying degrees, even in a place this remote.

'What I ended up finding is that history itself conforms to the pervasive decline felt everywhere else in the country,' Gerace explains. 

'Everyday objects are raised to the status of relics while the places people live go to seed.

'Small wonders, such as the Golden Spike or the world's biggest peanut, for instance, are made canonical and static by the inclusion of a staffed museum that tries to obliterate anything negative from the record.'

Although inspired by the Jetty, Smithson's vision was ultimately not what Gerace expected it to be, but he still found inspiration in the sense of abandonment

Gerace also said that quickly 'perception became a joke,' since everything was flat and white in the landscape

Although Smithson's vision of the Jetty was admittedly not what Gerace thought it would be.

'We drove out to the Spiral Jetty on our third day in the country, and like all the days preceding and all the days following, it was sunny, dry and incredibly hot,' he remembers.

'Rozel Point, the part of the lake where the Jetty resides, is famous for a botched oil drilling operation, a piece of conceptual art and a pink algae that's the only that can survive in the hypersalinated water.

'Perspective becomes a joke: everything is flat and white and the horizon bleeds into the sky.

On that day, after walking the length of the jetty and photographing several dead birds, I began to walk toward the horizon.

'Utah was in the midst of a drought and that, coupled with the amount of salt around us and the heat, made me thirsty and crazy and bug-eyed.' 

More often than not in Gerace's landscape photographs, the horizon bleeds into the skyline

The series of photographs is about 'confronting the effect of entropy on objects,' says Gerace

He hopes that he's created a project that radiates the joy that comes with being some place strange

Box Elder County is sliding into an entropic state and the garbage and weirdness that's there reinforces that

'Really, [Smithson's work] is just a means of confronting the effect of entropy on objects and that's what the series ended up being about,' he adds.

'Box Elder is a place that's sliding slowly into an entropic state and the garbage and damage and weirdness that's there, and the absolutely beautiful but incredible hostile and alien landscape surrounding it, reinforces that.

'I'd wanted to make the project something that radiated the joy felt at being in a place so strange and different. 

'I'd wanted to engage with the space in a way that provoked a sublime response, and in a lot of ways it did, although not at all in the way I'd envisioned.'
