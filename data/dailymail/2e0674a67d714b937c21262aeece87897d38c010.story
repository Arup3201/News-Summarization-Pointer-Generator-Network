Tragic: Jayne Rowley, 47, pictured here with husband Martin, 45, at their daughter Victoria's wedding two months ago, died after catching malaria in Gambia

A mother-of-two has died after catching malaria while on holiday with her husband at their luxury villa in Gambia.

Jayne Rowley, 47, who made regular trips to the west African country over the past two decades, suffered a seizure after the bug attacked 'every organ in her body'.

Today her husband Martin Rowley, 45, spoke out about his regret that they did not 'religiously' take their anti-malaria medication.

Two days after returning from a 10-day break two weeks ago, the couple were rushed to Blackpool Victoria Hospital for treatment.

They had been staying in their three-bedroom holiday home in the Brufut area of Gambia, which they had owned for two years, where they regularly donated football kits and goalposts to local children.

But they did not follow medical advice to take tablets at regular intervals throughout the day, and on Wednesday Mrs Rowley - mother to Victoria, 22, and James, 17 - succumbed to the illness.

Her devastated husband of 25 years has spoken of the heartbreaking moment he waved his wife goodbye so she could be treated on a different ward before she died from the killer bug.

Mr Rowley, 45, from Lytham in Lancashire, said: 'I never thought anything of waving her goodbye at the time because I was still in a bit of a blur.

'We had been bed-ridden and we decided we had better go to hospital to get ourselves checked.

'We thought it must have been something more sinister than flu because I almost couldn’t walk, it was so bad.

'On the way she had a seizure which was horrendous for her.

'I wasn’t able to be by her side because I was being treated.'

Mr Rowley said he first started showing flu-like symptoms on November 17 and his wife started feeling ill two days later.

He said: 'The only way I can describe it is the worst case of flu you can experience.

'Whereas with flu the headaches get better, in this case they get worse and worse.

'It’s like being hit by a sledgehammer every moment of the day.'

The following week they went to hospital and Mrs Rowley had a seizure and ended up in intensive care.

He was told of his wife’s deteriorating condition in the early hours of Tuesday.

She was visited by 35 friends and family members before she died the next day.

Mr Rowley said: 'She was just a lovely girl and a good mother to our children. I’m still in a state of shock - I’ll never see her again.

'I don’t think the children will cope with it, they’re struggling.'

Before their visit they had not followed health warnings to regularly take anti-malaria medication before, during and after the trip.

Mr Rowley said: 'We were never religious with them so we might just have taken a couple of them.

Malaria, a tropical, mosquito-borne disease, causes fever and vomiting and can disrupt the blood supply to vital organs if it remains untreated. These symptoms become evident around 10 to 15 days after being bitten.

The parasite has become resistant to some treatments and, with no effective vaccine, trying to halt the disease has been limited to controlling mosquitoes, distributing pesticide-laced nets for homes and spraying the indoors of buildings with insecticides - the method known as vector control.

At-risk people, including pregnant women and children, can also take antimalarial medications during seasons when the cases of malaria are highest. The CDC points out that no antimalarial drug is 100 per cent protective and should be used in conjunction with other measures like insecticides.

Despite efforts, the disease still kills around one million people and leaves more than 200 million sick every year.

'We would be slack with them and just buy them locally in Gambia.

'When I saw her on Tuesday she was completely out of it and didn’t regain consciousness. It attacked every organ in her body.

'We
go back and forward a few times a year. We got complacent. I would 
recommend nobody does this as we have learnt by our mistake.'

The couple, who have owned and run Carpets of Lytham for many years, began feeling unwell after their return, which he had put down to returning to a cold climate.

After being bed ridden for several days they decided to seek medical help.

Mr Rowley’s condition has been treated and on Thursday he was discharged from hospital with a course of anti-malaria medication.

The couple met when Mr Rowley worked as a barman at the Ship and Royal pub in Lytham, Lancashire.

They later married and had two children who are both employed at their parents’ business.

Just two months ago, Victoria got married.

Mr Rowley said: 'The one thing we said last night was Jayne was at least alive to see Victoria get married, because it was the proudest day of her life.'

The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said only two people died of the disease in the UK last  year.

Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite which enters the bloodstream when a person is bitten by the female mosquito.

After a few days, the infected person will become very ill and fevered Malaria is a leading cause of illness and death, affecting 300 million people around the globe and resulting in 800,000 deaths a year.

Worldwide, a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds.

Dr Ford, who practises at the tropical medicine school’s travel clinic and is a clinical adviser for the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC), said malaria was treatable with early diagnosis.

But she said people needed to take a full course of anti-malaria tablets as part of their travel arrangements to high-risk areas.

According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) The Gambia is a major tourist destination for British tourists with more than 60,000 visitors a year accounting for 60 per cent of its tourists.
