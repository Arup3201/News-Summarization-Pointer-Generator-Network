Paul Bittar will leave his role as chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority when his three-year term ends early in the new year.

No specific reasons have been offered for why the Australian, appointed in September 2011 having previously worked as chief strategy officer for Racing Victoria, will leave his post, but he will involved in recruiting his successor who will be named in the autumn.

Bittar said: 'I am proud of what BHA has achieved in the past few years and it will be with some sadness that I will leave early next year.

Time to go: Paul Bittar, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, will leave his role early in 2015

'I love the quality and diversity of the racing staged in this country. I'll never tire of it and nowhere else can rival it in that regard.' Bittar's arrival at the BHA coincided with a well publicised stand-off over the new whip rules and he was credited with resolving the furore between the sport's governing body and jockeys.

He also helped place the BHA on a sounder financial footing, overseeing the signing of a £40million voluntary levy deal with Betfair among other commercial deals.

However, he has not been exempt from criticism either with the BHA's handling of the steroids cases involving Mahmood Al Zarooni and Sungate attracting widespread condemnation.

Connections of Kool Kompany are keen to supplement their juvenile for this Sunday’s Group One Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh.

Richard Hannon’s colt, who has won five of his six starts, will contest the juvenile feature at a cost of £16,000 (€20,000) if working well this week.

Tim Palin, racing manger for owners Middleham Park Racing, said: ‘We think he deserves his shot at Group One level and will be supplemented if he is thriving.’
