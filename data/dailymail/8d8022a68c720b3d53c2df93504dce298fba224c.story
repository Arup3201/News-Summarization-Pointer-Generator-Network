Ben Purdy, 18, has been named locally as the teenager who died after being shot in the eye on Sunday afternoon in Bermondsey, south London

This is the London teenager who died  after being shot in the eye by mace-wielding attackers in an apparent dispute over a girl.

Ben Purdy, 18, died in hospital yesterday with his family and friends at his bedside, after being gunned down during a violent row while walking through south east London on Sunday.

The teenager, who was studying plumbing at Lewisham College, was cutting through the Abbeyfield Estate in Bermondsey, Southwark, when he was shot through the eye at close range.

Ben, an avid Arsenal fan, was found slumped on the ground in a pool of blood and was rushed to hospital in east London with gunshot wounds. He died the next day. 

His 19-year-old friend was also injured during the attack, after being allegedly ambushed with what witnesses described as a 'medieval-style mace' and a baseball bat.

He has since been released from hospital.

Tributes have now poured in for the teenager - the tenth teenager to be murdered in the capital this year - on social media. 

His best friend Jack Walker described Ben as 'one in a million', while Connor Lucas tweeted: 'R.I.P Ben Purdy, so unfortunate that it happened to a nice lad'. 

Eskii Boy tweeted: 'My Condolences to Ben Purdy's Family.'

Another tweeted: 'Rest In Peace Ben Purdy, I still can't believe you left us. We are going to miss you so much.' 

Grace Rosie Day also tweeted: 'so young and not a fair way to go.' 

Police announced this morning that a murder inquiry had been launched  after Ben's death on Monday afternoon.

Two men, one aged 36 and the other aged 21, both from south London, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 36-year-old man was arrested at an address in south London in the early hours of Monday.

'A 21-year-old man was arrested after he handed himself in at a south London police station late on Monday afternoon.

'Both men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody at a south London police station.'

Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command based at Lewisham, is leading the investigation.

The teenager, who was studying plumbing at Lewisham College, was shot through the eye at close range during an apparent dispute over a girl

He said: 'We are retaining an open mind as to the motive behind this incident, but there is nothing to suggest at this stage that it was gang related.

'A crime scene remains in place at the scene.'

It is understood detectives are investigating the possibility the shooting was over an argument about a girl.

A friend of the teenager told the Evening Standard: 'Ben was a good guy and would play football in Southwark Park with his mates. He loved football and loved chasing girls.

'He had been with his girlfriend a few months, but she already had a baby with another man.' 

Earlier, witnesses had told how 18-year-old was initially knocked unconscious by the shot before coming around, as residents on the estate raced to help.

Nigel Fletcher, 46, said he saw the victim lying in a pool of blood wearing trainers, jeans and black coat.

He said: 'I looked out and saw the guy lying on the floor in a pool of blood. The others obviously fled as quick as they could.

Police said investigations remain ongoing at the scene and confirmed a murder probe had been launched

'He was just lying there still as a bat - he wasn't moving at all. I just assumed he was dead, dead instantly. There was blood everywhere.

'I heard the shooting, it sounded like two shots. There was a big bang, like a firework, but it was obviously a gun. It echoed around the estate.

'My missus came down and just said 'someone's been shot.' She told me she's heard arguing outside and then heard the shots and saw one or two of them running away.

'I've never seen anything like it. Things like this don't happen around here.'

The road and footpath remained shut to the public yesterday as police investigations continued at the scene

Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I looked out of my window because I heard a noise.

'A blue car sped away and there was a lot of shouting. One group ran one way and others ran through the car park.

'I didn't realise someone had been shot. I only realised when my neighbour said. I called for an ambulance and went down with a towel.

'He was white and I did see he had an injury to his eye. He was huddled over. He was alive but he was groaning. He was conscious.

'It all happened so quickly. I have lived here for two-and-a-half years and never seen anything like this before.'
