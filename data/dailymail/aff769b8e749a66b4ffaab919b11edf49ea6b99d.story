A machete-wielding raider allegedly attacked a women's choir in a terrifying church rampage because, it is thought, he blamed God for the death of his wife.

The man had a mask on with an attached Mohican-style wig and was shouting and swearing as he burst into the church hall, moments after attacking the vicarâ€™s car at St Barnabas Church, in St Paul's Cray, south east London.

A mystery hero, now identified as Steven Izegbu, 28, wrestled the machete-armed attacker to the ground and later revealed that he had become a British citizen just hours before.

Mr Izegbu took 
on the assailant after he went berserk, smashing up a car before attacking two female church singers and 
leaving several others terrified.

Richard Elliott, who helped the hero tackle the masked man, told the News Shopper website: 'I had 
never met Stephen before and he said he had just got his British 
citizenship that day.

'I said, welcome to the country, do not expect this every day.'

Ginny Warner said she was singing in 
her local ladies' barbershop group, as she usually did on a Tuesday 
night, when the man 
confronted her and her friends.

'A lady came into the hall and said, 
"Are there any men here because there is a lunatic outside the church 
smashing windows",' Ms Warner said.

'He then went to the vicar's driveway and was smashing up the vicar's car and then he started walking towards where we were.

'I was trying to peep through the curtains to describe him to the police without being noticed.'

The man managed to break into the 
church hall through a back door. 'He had a mask on with a Mohican hairdo
attached to it. He was shouting and swearing,' Ms Warner said.

'I ran out but one of the ladies fell 
over, I don't know if she was pushed or just fell over, but he snatched 
her walking stick from her and kicked her while she was laying on the 
ground.

'One of the other singers tried to help and also got hit.'

Ms Warner said the police had still not arrived and people had fled the hall when two passing strangers ran to their aid.

'A black guy who was a complete hero arrived and wrestled the guy on to the grass,' she said.

'From what I can gather he (the 
attacker) lost his wife recently, I think she died of cancer, and he was
angry at God and anything to do with the church. Other people said he 
had been a psychiatric patient.

'What made my blood run cold was that when the police arrived they said he had a machete with him as well.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan 
Police said: 'Police were called at 2018hrs on Tuesday, 31 July, to St 
Barnabas Church, Rushet Road, St Paul's Cray, Orpington, after reports 
of a man with a machete smashing the church windows.

'A 56-year-old man was arrested for 
assault and criminal damage. He was treated at hospital for a hand 
injury, but was discharged on 1 August and taken to a south London 
police station where he remains in custody.

'Five people were injured - three men [ages not known] and two women (one aged in her 80s, another aged approx 60).

'None of the injuries are believed to be serious and none were caused by the machete.'
