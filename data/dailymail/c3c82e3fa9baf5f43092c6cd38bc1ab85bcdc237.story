'Cost of living' crisis: Labour leader Ed Miliband controversially promised to freeze energy bills if his party wins the General Election next year

Complaints by consumers about their energy supplier have tripled in the past year and are on target to hit 50,000 for 2014, according to figures from the industry ombudsman.

In the year to November the Energy Ombudsman received 47,731 complaints, compared with 16,155 for the same period last year. At least 3,500 have been registered every month this year.

Energy costs have been at the centre of the ‘cost of living’ crisis that has dominated politics since Labour leader Ed Miliband controversially promised to freeze energy bills if Labour wins the Election next year.

The Government responded by persuading energy companies to lop £50 off the average cost of energy bills, which are just over £1,300 a year. An inquiry by regulators into the entire energy market is also under way.

There were more than 5,100 complaints in November. Almost 4,400 were about bills. Inaccurate bills accounted for 737 complaints that month.

The other main causes of complaints over billing occurred when no bill was received or the charges were disputed. Inaccurate meter readings also accounted for a large proportion of complaints.

The number of complaints relating to switching providers, a common cause of dispute in recent years as it has become easier to do and more frequent, fell in November. The top grievance about transferring providers was that the request to switch had not been acted on.

Chief Ombudsman Lewis Shand Smith said: ‘While November’s figures show consumers are increasingly willing to escalate complaints when they feel they have been wronged, it is encouraging to see a drop in the number of problems relating to transfers and sales.’

The figures are not broken down for individual energy providers. But in customer service rankings published by consumer organisation Which? in September, npower had the most complaints and ScottishPower was second.

Last month, ScottishPower was told by regulator Ofgem to improve customer service within three months or else it will be banned from actively recruiting customers, while npower faced a similar situation earlier this year. Both companies have paid millions of pounds in fines for poor customer service.

More than two million households have deserted the Big Six energy suppliers – npower, British Gas, ScottishPower, SSE, E.ON and EDF Energy – which dominate the UK market, for smaller, independent providers. Comparison sites show that consumers can save about £200 a year by switching.

Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: ‘Improving customer service is key.’
