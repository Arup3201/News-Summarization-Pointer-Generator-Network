The Seattle Seahawks look to make it back-to-back Super Bowl victories when they take on the New England Patriots, the last team to achieve the feat.

The Bill Belichick/Tom Brady axis rides into its sixth NFL showpiece, with an evenly-matched, intriguing encounter expected at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

Belichick will need all of his tactical nous to get one over Pete Carroll, who along with general manager John Schneider has transformed Seattle from also-rans to the team to beat in just five years.

Ahead of Sunday’s game, here are ten players who will shape the destiny of the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

Brandon Browner, cornerback, New England

Left Seattle in free agency after three years with the Seahawks. He will line up against his former team-mates with an inside knowledge on defensive schemes and how to hinder wide receivers Jermaine Kearse and Doug Baldwin.

Earl Thomas, free safety, Seattle

Dislocated his shoulder in the NFC Championship game but recovered sufficiently enough to say that the injury felt like a 10 on Wednesday. He was miffed to be tested for HGH by the NFL as a consequence, but the real examination will come against the likes of LeGarrette Blount and Rob Gronkowski.

Rob Gronkowski, tight end, New England

Tom Brady’s go-to guy is a 6ft 6in beast who wows fans and players alike with his antics on the field. His off-field ones aren’t bad either, but I digress. He is big, fast, powerful, and crucially fully fit for his second Super Bowl.

Marshawn Lynch, running back, Seattle

The unstoppable Lynch will carry the offense with his trademark bow-legged runs. He’s set for carries galore and with 815 yards and eight touchdowns in nine postseason games, who would rule out a second ring for Beast Mode?

LeGarrette Blount, running back, New England

Picked up off waivers in November, Blount returned to New England and helped them into the Super Bowl with 148 yards against Indianapolis. Whether he can repeat those numbers against Seattle’s third-ranked run defense remains to be seen.

Tom Brady, quarterback, New England

Is set to appear in a record-breaking sixth Super Bowl. If New England triumph, he will join Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana on four victories, but if the Seahawks can disrupt him in the pocket and deny him time as they did Peyton Manning a year ago, his task will be a difficult one.

Jamie Collins, linebacker, New England

Versatile, fast and capable of game-chinging plays, the second-year sensation is like a chess piece. He can do it all from rushing the passer, tackling running backs and covering downfield.

Russell Wilson, quarterback, Seattle

Has a record of 9-0 against Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks in his all-conquering three-year NFL career. If he leads the Seahawks to back-to-back titles he has a legitimate claim on elite level.

Richard Sherman, cornerback, Seattle

A shutdown corner with a motivational mouth to boot, Sherman finished the Green Bay game one-handed. But his recovery from a sprained elbow will be tested by Brady, Gronkowski and Co.

Kam Chancellor, strong safety, Seattle

Expect fireworks as All-Pro Chancellor, the hardest-hitting safety in the game, is likely to be charged with keeping Gronkowski quiet. This unenviable task is made more challenging as 11 of 17 passing touchdowns scored against Seattle were scored by tight ends this season.
