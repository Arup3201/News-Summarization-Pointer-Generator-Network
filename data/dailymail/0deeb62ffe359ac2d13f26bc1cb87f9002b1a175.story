Most people are taught as children not to play with their food. But one sculptor has made an artwork out of it.

Instead of using her loaf to make sandwiches, Polish-born artist Milena Korolczuk spent hours painstakingly creating intricate busts of faces of cultural icons from pieces of bread.

Incredibly lifelike and detailed depictions of rapper Jay Z, artist Andy Warhol, and even ancient philosopher Plato were carved from crusts.

Ms Korolczuk's stunning sculptures feature a range of celebrities and famous names.

But while some, such as Jay-Z and Andy Warhol, are instantly recognisable, some are perhaps less well known.

Her work includes the faces of German mathematician and astronomer August Ferdinand Mobius and Polish novelist Witold Gombrowicz.

She also includes mythological figures such as Prometheus.

As well as a range of famous faces, Ms Korolczuk also carved her very own version of Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, from the food.

She even created her own tiny version of the Earth itself.

Her creations are made entirely using balled up bits of Wonder Bread.

Little is known about Ms Korolczuk, though she is said to be better known among art circles for her film and photography that any sculpture work.

Although she works from her home in Oakland, California, Ms Korolczuk originally hails from Podlasie Zabludow in north east Poland.

She graduated from the Poznan University of Fine Arts in 2010.
