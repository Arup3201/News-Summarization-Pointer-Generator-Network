When Angeline O'Grady's husband Brian James O'Grady died in October 2011 from cancer, she planned to take his remains back to their hometown of Hull, England to rest.

The Trumbauersville, Pennsylvania resident boarded a US Airways flight back to England with her husband's ashes safe in her checked baggage.

But when she got off the flight and opened the bag, they weren't there.

Luggage lawsuit: Angeline O'Grady, left, is suing US Airways after her husband, right, Brian James O'Grady's ashes went missing from her checked baggage on a flight to return his remains to their hometown in 2011

Now she's suing the company for losing his remains.

The lost urn was just the culmination of a terrible day at the airport.

Initially,
 Mrs O'Grady planned to take the urn on board with her, but was stopped 
by TSA agents who told her she wasn't allowed to bring the cardboard box
 containing his urn through security because 'it's contents were not a 
solid substance'.

So she went back to the airline's front desk and put the box in her checked luggage.

Airport security: Mrs O'Grady wasn't allowed to take her husband's ashes through security, so put them in her checked baggage instead

Because of that delay she nearly missed her flight as well.

By the time she got to the gate, she was too late and the airline had already given up her seat.

Mrs O'Grady had to buy a $500 first-class ticket just to stay on the same flight.

But the real shocker happened after she arrived at her sister-in-law's house in Hull. She opened the bag she checked, and the box of ashes was gone.

Since reporting the disappearance, she says the company hasn't been helpful in trying to recover it.

'My kids, everybody's upset and US Air just blows us off,' she told WCAU in January 2012.

She filed a lawsuit yesterday in Common Pleas Court.

Where did it go? When she arrived at her sister-in-law's house in Hull, England, Mrs O'Grady opened her luggage and the box of her husband's ashes was mysteriously missing

Ignored: Mrs O'Grady reported the lost urn to US Airways, but says they have been unhelpful in trying to locate it

'US
 Airways, rather than Mr and Mrs O'Grady, has had the last word in 
determining Mr O'Grady's final resting place,'  the lawsuit reads. 'He 
is not at peace.'

Airline spokesman Andrew Christie issued a statement to the Philadelphia Daily News:
 'While we certainly send our condolences to Mrs O Grady, US Airways' 
investigation into this matter did not uncover any information 
indicating that US Airways is responsible for this unfortunate incident.
 We, of course, will defend ourselves against this suit.'

Goldman responded saying that he wants to know what kind of investigation they conducted.

'To merely say that our investigation did not reveal anything is inadequate and it's an insult,' he said.

'He was a great guy - he doesn't deserve this,' Mrs O'Grady said.
