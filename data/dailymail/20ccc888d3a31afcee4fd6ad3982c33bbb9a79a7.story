A quarter of those suffering from bowel cancer are diagnosed only once they are admitted to hospital as an emergency, say researchers.

Many of these patients are less likely to have potentially life-saving surgery because they are diagnosed too late and the cancer is too advanced, according to surgeons.

Women, the elderly and less well-off were most at risk of losing out on early diagnosis and care.

Too late? One in four cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed in A&E

A national audit found that around 
8,000 bowel cancer patients in England each year get attention only 
after an emergency admission to hospital.

Records on 31,000 patients admitted in a 12-month period were analysed by the National Bowel Cancer Audit and linked for the first time with hospital data.

The new data is in keeping with research by the National Cancer Intelligence Network about bowel and other forms of cancer released last month.

It found one in three cancer sufferers over 70 is diagnosed only after they turn up in A&E departments, sometimes with severe symptoms caused by the cancer, such as pain, breathing difficulties or fitting.

More must be done: Professor Norman Williams said patients who present at A&E with the disease are more likely to be suffering with end stage cancer

Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, which co-authored the latest data, said: ‘It is extremely concerning that so many patients are being diagnosed with bowel cancer at such a late stage.

‘Patients who present with this disease as an emergency  are more likely to be suffering with advanced stage cancer  and, as a result, are less likely to be suitable for potentially life- saving surgery.

‘More must be done to improve early detection and to raise awareness around the symptoms of bowel cancer.

‘The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening programme has now been rolled out across the country and it is so important that patients take up the invitation to be screened as this will vastly improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.’ 

The data, covering the period between August 2009 and July 2010, found 28 per cent of women patients – 3,820 of a total of 13,570 – were diagnosed after an emergency hospital admission.For men, this figure was 22 per cent – 3,870 of 17,240 patients.

Older people, aged 85 and over, accounted for 47 per cent – 1,690 of 3,580 patients.Altogether, 30 per cent of the most deprived patients were first diagnosed after emergency admission (1,470 out of 4,940) compared with 22 per cent of  the least deprived (1,410 of  the 6,550).
