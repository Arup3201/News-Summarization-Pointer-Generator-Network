Exit: Truett Tate is the last remaining executive with links to the ill-fated takeover of HBOS in 2008

A fresh row over ‘rewards for failure’ could be brewing after it emerged Lloyds Banking group is preparing to give its investment banking chief a £4.8million 'golden goodbye'.

The farewell package for Truett Tate, who will step down from the state-controlled bank this month, could be five times higher than the bonus waived by Stephen Hester at Royal Bank of Scotland earlier this week.

It comes just a week after the Prime Minister said rewards for failure made 'people’s blood boil' when – in the words of Bank of England Governor Mervyn King– hard-up Britons were suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’.

Mr Tate, 61, who is American, joined in 2003 and heads Lloyds' wholesale division. He was a main board director of the bank in 2008 under the ill-fated leadership of Eric Daniels and is thought to have voted in favour of the catastrophic decision to buy HBOS.

That meant the banking giant needed to be rescued with £20.3billion of public money – the state now owns 41 per cent of the bank - on which taxpayers are facing an £11.5billion paper loss because shares have fallen by 57 per cent since then.

In October 2010 Mr Tate told the BBC that despite the economic turmoil triggered by the banking crisis, the taxpayer should be delighted with its 'investment' into his bank.

Mr Tate, who earned £1.8m in 2009, said: 'There are a whole lot of people, myself included, who would love to get the kind of return on their investment that the taxpayer has made into this bank.

'They've made an investment that is making money. If you could come up with me, with an investment in the infrastructure which would have returned more for the taxpayers, I'm all ears.'

Former RBS chief Fred Goodwin was earlier this week stripped of his knighthood for bringing the financial system into disrepute.

The Cabinet Office said RBS’s failure, which cost taxpayers £45billion, helped ‘trigger the worst recession in the UK since the Second World War’.

Meanwhile, David Cameron
said a seven-figure bonus for Mr Goodwin's successor Mr Hester would be unacceptable. The boss 
of state-owned RBS then waived his annual bonus of nearly £1million.

It remains to be seen whether Mr Tate will follow suit.

Mr Tate, who works in Lloyds’ London headquarters, is leaving as part of a shake-up of the board 'old guard' who served under Eric Daniels.

Truett Tate joined Lloyds Banking in 2003 as managing director, corporate banking, before being appointed to the board in 2004.

He later became group executive director of wholesale and international banking.

He worked at Citigroup from 1972 to 1999, where he held a number of senior and general management appointments in the USA, South America, Asia and Europe.

After leaving Citi he was president and chief executive officer of eCharge Corporation from 1999 to 2001.

He was also co-founder and vice chairman of the board of Chase Cost Management Inc from 1996 to 2003.

He has also held a variety of directorships and non-executive directorships.Compensation for 2009Salary                                    £640,000Bonus                                 £1,120,000All other compensation              £47,000Total Compensation              £1,807,000

His
exit is part of a strategy that Lloyds' boss Antonio Horta-Osorio hopes 
will allow the bank to 'move to the next phase of Lloyds' 
transformation'.

He is expected to get a 12-month pay-off
based on his basic salary, which was £656,000 last year, according to The Times. Pension 
contributions will push this to £816,000, but the bank would not divulge
further likely payments.

He has rights to £2.821million worth of shares in the bank as part of a bonus scheme yet to crystallise, while other payouts could push the total to almost £5million.

Mr Tate will be replaced temporarily by Andrew Géczy, who runs the wholesale banking and markets, while a permanent replacement is sought.

Mr Horta-Osorio is overhauling the bank's management team in a bid to ease the burden on him following a period of sick leave.

There will be 10 people reporting to the chief executive, compared with 14 previously, after retail director Alison Brittain was given more responsibility and a new role of group corporate functions director was announced.

Mr Horta-Osorio recently said he would pass more responsibility on to his senior managers after stress-related exhaustion forced him to take two months off, which created uncertainty over the bank's leadership, sending shares in Lloyds tumbling to record lows.

The changes announced today will not only allow him to spend more time with staff, but are also part of his vision to turn around the taxpayer-backed bank and restore its sense of pride, he said.

The group's corporate functions director, who has yet to be appointed, will focus on areas such as human resources, legal and secretariat and group audit that are 'essential to transforming the group', whereas these directors previously reported to the chief executive.

Antonio Horta-Osorio has overhauled the management team at Lloyds Banking Group, forcing the departure of Mr Tate

And Ms Brittain, who currently runs 
Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland Community banks, will also take on 
responsibility for the Halifax Community Bank.

Miguel-Angel Rodriguez-Sola, director
of special projects, will take on the new position of retail strategy 
and commercial director and will also report to her.

Mr Horta-Osorio said: 'We have an 
experienced and committed management team and I am sure that we will, 
over time, achieve our aim of being the best bank for customers.

'By
doing that, we will provide our investors with sustainable returns and 
our colleagues with a sense of real pride in the bank.'

The Portuguese chief executive, who 
recently waived his bonus as a result of his sick leave, has already 
made numerous changes to the management team since his arrival in March,
as he stamped his authority on the business.

His
previous overhaul saw the departures of Archie Kane, head of insurance 
and Scotland, who retired, while retail head and most senior female 
employee Helen Weir decided to leave.

He
also split the insurance arm into two separate divisions, and appointed
fellow former Santander man Antonio Lorenzo as group director for the wealth 
and international division.

Shares in Lloyds rose 1 per cent in early trading today.

Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his role in the financial crisis

Tories demanded further action against failed bankers yesterday following the decision to strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood.

MPs called for more financiers, including colleagues of Mr Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, to lose the right to be called Sir.

But others condemned the action against Mr Goodwin, with business leaders claiming it amounted to hysteria.

Mr Goodwin’s friend, motor racing champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat while former Chancellor Alistair Darling said the decision to take away his title was tawdry.

Mark Field, Tory MP for the city of London, told The Times that stripping him of his knighthood was a 'witch-hunt' and it could even harm overseas business interests.

RBS had to be bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money after Mr Goodwin steered it to the biggest corporate disaster in British history.

Senior figures in Downing Street have also discussed attempting to strip him of his massive pension.

Mr Goodwin, whose knighthood was annulled on Monday by order of the Queen, is still receiving what is effectively a taxpayer-funded pension of £342,500 a year for life from RBS.

Some Tories want to tackle him about his pension in the expectation that he would challenge such a move using the Human Rights Act.

This would boost public opposition to the Act which they want to replace with a British Bill of Rights.
