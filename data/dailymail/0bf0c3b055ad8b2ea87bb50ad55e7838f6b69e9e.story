A convicted killer has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years after being found guilty of murdering a 17-year-old girl more than 30 years ago.

Colin Campbell, 66, who is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury, killed Claire Woolterton three years earlier, in August 1981.

The teenager’s naked body was found on the promenade by the River Thames in Barry Avenue in Windsor, Berkshire, by a man on his way to work.

She had initially been attacked at another, unknown location and her body showed physical signs consistent with having been partially asphyxiated and rendered unconscious.

She had been stripped of her clothes and sexually assaulted and then murdered by having her throat cut, a trial at Reading Crown Court heard.

Her mutilated body was also found to have several slash wounds and incisions around her vaginal area, jurors were told.

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said that 
‘for 32 long years’ the identity of her killer was unknown until 
advances in medical science and scientific technology came along

An
‘adhesive tape lift’ had been used on the teenager’s body to take 
‘debris from the surface of her skin’. It was then stored by police for 
30 years until the case was reviewed in 2011.

Campbell,
formerly from West London, was arrested in November last year and found
guilty of Claire’s murder by a majority verdict today, Thames Valley 
Police said.

The trial 
heard that Claire, who lived in Northolt, north west London, with her 
mother and her mother's partner, was last seen alive at around 10pm on 
August 27, 1981, walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in 
Ealing with the older married man she was seeing.

Usually after meeting her he drove her home, dropping her off nearby.

This is the tow path in Windsor where Claire was found after being sexually assaulted and murdered

But
Mr Wright told the jury: ‘Sadly, on this night, she and he having had a
disagreement, she decided to make her own way home and set off at 
around about 10 o'clock that evening.

‘It was a journey, sadly, that she did not complete.’

Claire,
who had left school at 16, was reported missing by her worried mother 
the next day. That evening she learned that a girl's body had been found
and realised it could be her daughter, the court heard.

Mr
Wright said Campbell, who pleaded guilty to hitch-hiker Ms Sainsbury's 
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, killed the 
29-year-old in December 1984.

Her
body was found in a wooded area of Denham Golf Course in 
Buckinghamshire, after Campbell picked her up in his car in Upper 
Richmond Road, Roehampton, on the evening of December 22.

There
were many similarities between the two killings: both women had been 
mutilated with sharp instruments, both had their clothes removed by 
their attacker and both bodies had been left in public places where they
could easily be found.

Ms
Sainsbury's left breast was cut off and never recovered, while her 
clothes were found in Campbell's garage. Claire's clothes were never 
found.

Following the verdict, Pete Beirne, head of Thames Valley Police's major crime review team, said:

‘Campbell has at no time shown any remorse for his actions and has delayed proceedings, adding to the strain on Claire's family and delaying the judicial process.

‘At the time of Claire's murder an extensive investigation was carried out, an investigation I was part of, and at that time Campbell did not feature in our inquiries.

‘Thanks to the work carried out by the major crime review team, working closely with our partners LGC Forensics and the Crown Prosecution Service, we were able to use modern-day technology to identify significant forensic evidence linking Campbell to the murder, which led to his arrest in November 2012.

‘I hope that Claire's family, who have shown courage during this difficult time, can take some comfort in knowing that her killer has finally received the justice he deserves.’

Ruth Bowskill, temporary chief Crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Claire Woolterton, who was making her way home in west London after a night out, had the misfortune to come across Campbell.

‘Claire was preyed upon, sexually assaulted, murdered and mutilated for his own sexual gratification.

‘Campbell is serving life for the manslaughter of a 29-year-old female hitch-hiker he picked up in west London December, 1984, and whose body was also dumped in Thames Valley and is clearly an extremely dangerous man.

‘Had it not been for his arrest for that offence, Campbell may never have been brought to justice for Claire's murder. It is thanks to cold case reviews and developments in DNA/forensic evidence techniques that we were able to secure this conviction today.’
