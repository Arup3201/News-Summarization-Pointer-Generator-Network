New England's tallest lighthouse has been sold for $78,000 after initial bidding was lackluster, perhaps due to being 6 miles from the Maine coast and a dark history of cannibalism in the area.

A federal government spokeswoman says the General Services Administration has accepted a bid for the Boon Island Light Station off York, Maine. The winning bidder is Portland, Maine, resident Art Girard.

The Administration closed out an auction of the 133-foot-tall lighthouse tower on Aug. 17. More than a dozen bidders vied for it. The government had to approve Girard's bid, which was the highest of the bunch.

Lonely home? Boon Island Light Station sits in the Gulf of Maine about six miles off the coast of York, Maine and is an isolated home perfectly suited for many a sea-loving hermit

Finally sold:The lighthouse sold for $78,000 after an auction was extended after getting a top bid of just $41,000

Climbing the stairs: Boon Island Light has the distinction of being the tallest lighthouse in both Maine and New England at 133 feet

The lighthouse was built in 1855 and is located on a tiny rocky island 6 miles off the Maine coast. It's still active as a navigational aid.

It is one of 57 active lighthouses in Maine and is the tallest in New England, though not the highest above sea level

At six desolate miles off an already sparsely populated coast, is it also its loneliest residence?

Initial bidding, which closed at 10am on Tuesday August 12, was lackluster.

Seven people bid on the lighthouse, with the top bid coming in at $41,000.

The government opened bidding up again.

Desolate: The isolate outcropping of granite is located six desolate miles from York, Maine and was once the site of a shipwreck where sailors eventually turned to cannibalism

Flashback: A photograph of Boon Island's lighthouse before the loss of the keeper's house in 1978

Tradition: Boon Island is among the five or so light houses on the New England and Gulf Coasts auctioned by the Coast Guard each year

In addition to its isolation, Boon Island's dark history could be to blame for not selling the first time around.

The barren outcrop of granite was the site of a shipwreck in 1710. The stranded sailors ultimately resorted to cannibalism.

The purchase also comes with stipulations.

While the buyer owns the rocky island and lighthouse, he or she would be required to allow the light to remain 'a navigational aid maintained by the United States Coast Guard,' according to Seacoastonline.com.

The light has been automated since 1978.

Boon Island is among the five or so light houses on the New England and Gulf Coasts auctioned by the Coast Guard each year.

Dilapidated: It appears that the new owner might have a bit of work on their hands

Protocol: While the buyer owns the rocky island and lighthouse, he is required to allow the light to remain 'a navigational aid maintained by the United States Coast Guard,' according to Seacoastonline.com
