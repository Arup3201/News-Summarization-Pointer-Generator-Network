Giant Japanese hornets attacked runners during an annual race at Highclere Castle, location of the fictional home of Lord Grantham in Downton Abbey.

Some 300 racers ran through the grounds of the picturesque Berkshire estate when the invasive insects swarmed over them. 

Dozens of runners were injured after they were stung by the pests who had crossed the English Channel from the continent.

Runners involved in a race through the grounds of Highclare Castle - home to Downton Abbey were attacked

Halfway through the run, the participants disturbed a large group of Japanese hornets in the undergrowth 

Runners were taking part in the annual run through the grounds of the fictional home of Downton Abbey 

One runner collapsed after five miles when dozens of the insects were disturbed in the undergrowth and stung him repeatedly. 

The victim was treated by medics at the scene before being taken to hospital in a car. 

Even the real Lord Grantham, Highclere Castle's owner Lord Carnarvon braved the menace along the six-mile course.

Race director Derek Matthews said the race was going well until they reached the halfway stage: 'Hundreds of angry hornets, threatened by the approach of the runners, mounted unrelenting, vicious attacks on the main field .

The runners had no idea that the hornets were waiting in the undergrowth. 

 'All was quiet when we marked, checked and cleared the course.

'We don't hold Highclere estate responsible in any way - it was an act of nature and it could happen to anyone out in the countryside.

'This year’s fine summer has increased wasp and hornet activity, and ramblers, cyclists and joggers should be aware if they venture into the countryside, and give these insects a wide berth.'

John Gundill, Highclere estate's manager, said race organisers had checked the course beforehand and were not aware of any issues.

He said: 'It's a hazrd in the countryside at this time of year,' adding that the race had been run without problems for several years. 

The Japanese hornet grows to 5cm in length and has a 6mm sting filled with venom

A single hornet can kill 40 honey bees in a minute

The carnivore hornets dismember the unfortunate bees even eating their honey. 

A swarm of just 30 hornets can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in just three hours 

Highclere is visisted by thousands of Downton Abbey fans every year but Mr Gundill reassured them that the race was not run on any of the public footpaths through the grounds.

The race was won by Gareth Watkins of the Hillingdon Athletic Club in a record time of 34 minutes 43 seconds. 

At least six people have been killed by the hornets in France. 

The insects can grow up to 5cm in length have can brandish a 6mm sting. 

It is believed the hornets first arrived in France from the Far East in a consignment pottery in 2004. 

The English Channel protected Britain from the menace but they managed to cross the 20-mile waterway earlier this year. 

Parliament was warned about the impending invasion in April by the Environmental Audit Committee: 'The Asian Hornet, which might soon arrive here, has killed six people in France.'
