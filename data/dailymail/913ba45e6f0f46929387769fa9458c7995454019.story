Football's authorities were accused of covering up the scale of problems caused by head injuries as senior politicians called for a Parliamentary inquiry into concussion in sport.

The FA and PFA have so far failed to publish any findings from a joint 10-year study promised after former England forward Jeff Astle's death in 2002 which a coroner found was due to 'industrial disease' caused by heading footballs.

Astle's widow Laraine has repeatedly asked to meet FA chairman Greg Dyke after he wrote to her in April apologising for the FA's behaviour following a Sportsmail investigation which discovered the study had, according to one insider, been 'kicked into the long grass'.

Mrs Astle also revealed she wrote to Dyke two weeks ago after her husband's brain was re-examined and he was found to have CTE - a degenerative disease found in the brains of boxers, rugby players and American Footballers - but has had no response.

'I think there has been a cover-up,' said Mrs Astle. 'It is an absolute disgrace. We are absolutely disgusted.' 

Mrs Astle was speaking at the launch of a damning cross-party report calling for a Parliamentary inquiry into concussion in sport.

The report's authors include Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said: 'Jeff Astle died of an industrial injury. It happened more than a decade ago but still nothing's happened. I think the Astle family has been treated utterly shabbily.'
