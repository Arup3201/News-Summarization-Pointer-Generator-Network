Ronny Deila is adamant Virgil van Dijk won’t be leaving Celtic next month — despite Sunderland weighing up an £8million offer for the star defender.

Arsenal, Southampton, Everton and West Brom have all been linked with moves for the 23-year-old, who still has two years remaining on his contract.

Sportsmail understands, however, that Black Cats boss Gus Poyet will be the first to step up to the plate with a bumper offer for the player next month.

Irrespective of what bids come in, Deila believes keeping the defender focused for the remainder of the campaign will no longer be an issue.

Van Dijk was omitted from the squad which drew at Dens Park in the first game after the August window closed, giving rise to the notion he was angling for a move south.

But Deila foresees no such problems if bids are now rejected – due to the Dutchman’s contentment with life in Glasgow.

‘He’s worth a lot of money,’ said the Norwegian. ‘But I am very calm. Virgil is enjoying his football, playing well and when I speak with him he’s happy here. That’s positive. He is such an important player for us.’

Asked, in the event that a bid is turned down, he might need to again drop van Dijk from his side at the start of February, Deila was insistent.

‘I think he has learned a lot from this,’ he added. ‘It’s not the first time a player has been affected.

‘Others have been through these things as well. Stefan Johansen was the same. He came from the Euro finals with Norway two years ago and played so badly for Stromsgodset. I have never seen him so bad because his mind was somewhere else.

‘You can see a bit of that in (John) Guidetti now, as well. If he can get his mind right, the goals will come again.

‘If you think too much about uncertainties, about what you’re going to earn, it takes energy out of what you’re going to do on the pitch. But Virgil learned from what happened in the summer and he knows that if he’s good enough things will happen. And this is the way he wants to do it - but now he’s enjoying football and that’s the most important thing.’

Celtic face Rangers, Dundee and Inter Milan in three high-profile knock out games early in the New Year with the two-legged clash with the Serie A giants the toughest of the three.

And Deila believes the exposure van Dijk will gain from playing in a game of such importance is such that it can only increase his chances of a more eye-catching transfer at some stage in the future.

‘He is a very good player now but he can be a world-class player,’ the Celtic manager opined.

‘That’s a good opportunity to show yourself but you do this over time.

‘Teams now will not see you in one game and then buy you, that’s over.

‘Then see you 10 or 15 times and you need consistency. Your levels have to be very high especially in defence because they need people they can rely on.

‘That’s something I think he has done better now than earlier in the season.’
