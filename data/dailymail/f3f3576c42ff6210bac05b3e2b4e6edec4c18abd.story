Alan Shearer has told Wayne Rooney it’s about time he delivered at a World Cup — but has backed the striker to go on and break Sir Bobby Charlton’s long-standing England goals record.

On the grandest stage, Rooney is yet to score. He was an injured imitation of himself at the 2006 competition, which ended with a red card against Portugal in the quarter-finals.

In 2010 he criticised his own supporters on camera after the dourest of draws against Algeria. ‘He probably hasn’t yet gone to a World Cup in the best of fitness and you can’t argue with his record at international level overall,’ Shearer said.

It's time! Wayne Rooney needs to perform at a World Cup, says former England striker Alan Shearer

‘He’s got 38 goals for England — 11 short of Bobby Charlton’s record, and I think he will go on to break it.

‘But he needs to have a big tournament with England and, if he does that, he will be the key to us having a successful World Cup. Listen, I’m a fan of Rooney. I think he ticks all the boxes as a player.

'But for him to be put in the same bracket as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he needs to have a great tournament in Brazil.

'Although having said that, Messi has yet to set the place on fire at a World Cup too.’

Alan Shearer will be a BBC pundit during the World Cup in Brazil.
