A heroic paratrooper who lost both legs and an arm in Afghanistan has spoken for the first time about the campaign of abuse he suffered from officers after returning  to Britain.

Corporal Tom Neathway, 30, overcame the loss of three limbs after a bomb blast in Helmand and was able to return to work with new recruits.

But he told The Mail on Sunday he left the Army with a broken heart after being ‘singled out’ and bullied by his Regimental Sergeant Major.

Corporal Tom Neathway claims he was driven out of the Army by his Regimental Sergeant Major, Alistair Hutcheson, who bullied him

An Army inquiry found Regimental Sergeant Major Alistair ', left, singled out' and bullied Corporal Neathway, right, over several months in 2011 and that the harassment was 'cumulative in effect over time'

Corporal Neathway lost both legs and his left arm in a bomb blast while he was serving with the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para) in Afghanistan's Helmand province

Cpl Neathway of the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para), broke his silence yesterday after a Government report revealed a  25 per cent rise in reported cases  of Armed Forces bullying in the past year

After suffering his devastating injuries, Cpl Neathway was targeted by RSM Alistair Hutcheson, 54, while they were working at the Parachute Training Support Unit (PTSU) at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire.

‘It was not the Taliban that cost me my life as a soldier, it was Hutcheson and those officers in the Army’s chain of command who ignored my mistreatment,’ said  Cpl Neathway.

‘I loved my job at the PTSU helping junior Paras making their first jumps, but Hutcheson would get other members of staff to call me at all hours, demanding to know where I was and questioning me over what I was doing.

‘He also criticised me for wearing gym kit of shorts and a regimental  T-shirt, which was practical given the problems I had with my artificial legs, which were continually falling off. He wanted me to wear uniform as if I was able-bodied. I looked ridiculous and would collapse in a heap. It was embarrassing.

Cpl Neathway said on returning to work after overcoming his injuries, the bullying he was subjected to was 'harder to cope with than being a triple amputee'

Senior officers also upheld Cpl Neathway's claims he was subjected to excessive phone calls at the RSM's behest and that he suffered unreasonable demands that he should wear uniform

‘Hutcheson kept on at me over several months and I couldn’t take any more. The psychological impact of what he was saying was harder to cope with than being a triple amputee. So I lodged an  official complaint.’

An Army inquiry found he was ‘singled out’ and ‘isolated’ by RSM Hutcheson over several months in 2011 and that the harassment was ‘cumulative in effect over time’.

Senior officers also upheld Cpl Neathway’s claims he was subjected to excessive phone calls at the RSM’s behest and that he suffered unreasonable demands that he should wear uniform.

In his treatment of the disabled soldier, RSM Hutcheson, also of the Parachute Regiment, was found to have failed to maintain the standards expected of his rank.

Cpl Neathway’s claim that RSM Hutcheson had whispered in his  ear ‘you’re not much of a  paratrooper any more, are you?’ was dismissed after the Army found no supporting evidence. The RSM denied making the comment.

After lodging his complaint, Cpl Neathway was forced to leave the PTSU, even though the offices had been adapted for severely wounded personnel. He returned to 2 Para’s base in Colchester, Essex, but the facilities were unsuited to a triple amputee.

Cpl Neathway left the Army last year, five years after he was blown up by the Taliban

Cpl Neathway, of Crowle, Worcestershire, left the Army in 2013, five years after he was blown up by the Taliban. He says that the psychological scars of being abused also led to the breakdown of his relationship with model Rachael Patterson, who he had met at a charity event.

Hutcheson has since been transferred to the Princess Royal Barracks at Deepcut, Surrey.

The Mail on Sunday can also reveal that following a separate enquiry, Hutcheson was accused of displaying ‘poor judgment’ after allegedly making disparaging remarks about the mental state of a Parachute Regiment officer who had recently returned from Afghanistan.

And in 1991 Hutcheson was fined £500 by the Army for physically abusing a recruit at a training depot.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Army takes all incidents of bullying and harassment extremely seriously and all allegations are thoroughly investigated.

‘We have robust processes in place to ensure all Commanding Officers are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect others harassment and discrimination, and any suspicion of bullying is dealt with immediately.’
