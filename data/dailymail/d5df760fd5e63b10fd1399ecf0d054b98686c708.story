Smartphones and social media are being harnessed by criminal gangs to send illegal sales of potentially dangerous sleeping pills, slimming tablets and Viagra soaring, according to Britain’s drugs watchdog.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) believes a combination of smartphones allowing people easier access to the internet, and ease of promotion via social media, has allowed illicit suppliers to target buyers more effectively.

This year, the agency has targeted gangs’ internet operations for the first time, removing 18,671 YouTube videos directing viewers to websites illegally selling prescription and counterfeit drugs.

Despite their actions, the MHRA reports a huge rise in black market sales of the drugs to people who may be too embarrassed to seek help from their doctor.

Over the course of 2014, the agency seized 1.2 million doses of illegally-supplied erectile dysfunction drugs including Viagra, 383,000 slimming products and 331,000 doses of sleeping pills, tranquillisers and anti-depressants.

Other drugs being sold illegally include hair-loss treatments, cognitive enhancers and anabolic steroids used by body builders.

Alistair Jeffrey, head of enforcement at the drugs watchdog, said: ‘Smartphones have allowed people greater access to the internet and all of a sudden this accessibility, combined with social media, has made a significant difference in how criminals reach consumers.

‘This is something we are looking at now in a serious way. There is a phenomenal market out there.’

Raids organised by the MHRA have found drugs stored in abysmal conditions, he added.

Mr Jeffrey, a former detective superintendent who previously ran the Metropolitan Police’s child abuse investigation command centre, said: ‘We’ve had cases where there have been mouse and rat droppings around the blister packs.

‘These people are not interested in sanitary conditions, they are in it for the money.

‘Besides the obvious risks of taking medicines made from rat poison and other substitutes used by gangs, there are also dangers in taking medicines without proper consultation.

‘There are definitely health risks because a patient might have a condition that means they should not take a certain drug.’

Mr Jeffrey said patients viewing the YouTube footage are directed to other sites purporting to be officially-registered pharmacies, which sell fake and potentially dangerous medicines.

The World Health Organisation believes that about half of all drugs sold online are counterfeits.

Many of the treatments are out-of-date or have been contaminated due to storage in appalling, unhygienic conditions.

The growth in illegal sales of prescription drugs is partly believed to be driven by the fact patients are unwilling to discuss certain embarrassing issues such as hairloss, being overweight or sexual dysfunction with their family doctor.

Instead they are resorting to seeking out their own cures online in the privacy of their homes. Most of the drugs being sold originate from China or India.

Bernard Leroy, director of the International Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines in Paris, said: ‘We are in a situation where internet usage is growing so fast that we are at risk of losing control.

‘This will become a major issue for public health in coming years. People are more and more focused on obtaining these medicines and people are going to the internet for them’
