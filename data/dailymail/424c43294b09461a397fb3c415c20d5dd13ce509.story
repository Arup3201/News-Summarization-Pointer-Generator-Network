The latest leaked images of the iPhone 6 appear to give weight to a number of separate rumours that have been doing the rounds for months.

They show a protruding camera, for example, which was first reported on in April, recessed volume controls, which were hinted at during the start of the month, and an embedded logo.

The images are purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model and were leaked by Russian designers Feld and Volk.

The leaked images were posted by Moscow designers Feld and Volk and claim to show the rear shell (pictured) and an embedded logo, alongside a cable that is said to be used for the home button. The images are purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model, which is expected to launch on 9 September

Reports of a protruding camera originated from Chinese site Weibo in April after an anonymous supplier working at Foxconn leaked the information online.

Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPad and iPhone models at an event in September.

Analysts believe Apple is working on two versions of different sizes for its iPhone 6, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally - the same size as the HTC One.  

A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5.

In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery.

The iPad Air is 20 per cent thinner than previous models, and Apple is expected to launch an equally super-thin iPhone, dubbed iPhone Air.

This is expected to be the smaller of the two handsets. 

Feld and Volk’s image is a close-up shot of this supposed raised ring, and could be used to attach additional lenses to the iPhone 6, as suggested in a patent also revealed in April.

Elsewhere, the recessed volume controls on Feld and Volk’s image are similar to those seen on the leaked images of the iPad Air 2 earlier this month.

It is likely that if Apple chooses to make a tweak, such as this, to one new flagship device, it will appear on both.

Another image taken by Feld and Volk shows an embedded Apple logo that the designers claim is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy.

Liquidmetal is a super-strong material that can be moulded into shape.

Finally, a cable seen next to the casing for the rumoured handset is believed to be for the home button.

The patent, initially filed in 2012, describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone camera (pictured).The system is similar to that currently used on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion

IPad sales slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter, according to the tech giant’s latest earnings report, amid reports demand for the technology is waning.
