Unknown: The murder of teenager Claire Tiltman in 1993 has never been solved

Detectives investigating the 20-year-old murder of grammar school girl Claire Tiltman are searching a house today as part of the on-going case.

Claire, 16, was stabbed to death in an alleyway in January 1993 as she went to a friend’s house to study in Dartford, Kent.

The youngster was stabbed in a frenzied attack and she staggered out onto a main road where she collapsed.

She was seen by a passer by who raised the alarm. She died at the scene.

Despite a huge police investigation, Claire’s killer has never been brought to justice.

Kent Police announced today they were carrying out a search warrant on a house in Stone, near Dartford, Kent.

It is thought the address was where Colin Ash-Smith lived at the time of Claire's murder.

Ash-Smith was questioned by Police in 1993 but never charged.

No arrests have been made during the current investigation.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate Cold Case Investigation Team conducted a search warrant at an address in Myrtle Place, Stone, near Dartford, Kent, on Thursday September 12 as part of their on-going enquiries into the historic murder of Claire Tiltman.

'It is standard practice that undetected murders such as Claire’s will be reviewed regularly. The activity on Thursday September 12 is part of that ongoing review.'

Investigation: Police today search a house in Myrtle Place, Stone, in connection to the murder of Clare Tiltman

Inquiry: The house is thought to 
be where Colin Ash-Smith lived at the time of Claire's murder. Mr Ash-Smith was questioned after Claire's death but never charged

Early this morning, five police vans arrived at the property, which is in a quiet cul-de-sac, and forensic officers began their search.

Neighbour James Monks, 65, a retired salesman said: 'I looked outside at about 8am and saw all these police vans parked outside, then more and more police turned up.

'I've no idea what was happening but now I know it's to do with Claire Tiltman.'

Throughout the morning, police removed several evidence
bags and put them into the back of a police van at the semi-detached 
cottage-style property.

The father of Colin Ash-Smith still lives in the house, but there is no suggestion any of the occupants are under suspicion.

Today,
Aubrey Ash-Smith, stuck two fingers up to reporters who were gathered 
outside his house and said: 'The police have searched here twice before.
I wish they would stop hounding us and leave us alone.'

Evidence: Officers take several bags from the property during the raid

Search: Boxes of evidence are taken from the semi-detached property earlier today

Mr Ash-Smith also protested his son's innocence.

Claire’s parents Cliff and Linda never gave up hope their daughter’s killer would be convicted.

Linda died from cancer in 2008 aged 56 and Cliff died of cancer in September last year aged 63. 

Claire was their only child.

Speaking from his bed in a nursing home in January 2012, Mr Tiltman said: 'It would mean everything to me to find out, after all these years, who did this to Claire. 

'It has been a long time, but I’ve never given up hope and never will.

'I can’t begin to put into words how this has affected our family.

'Claire has gone and her mum has gone - there is now only me.'

Kent Police said that no arrests have been made today.

The force marked the 20th anniversary of Claire's murder in January this year with a renewed appeal for information.

Chief Superintendent Neil Jerome, the divisional commander for North Kent was a police constable on patrol in Stone when Claire was killed.

He said in January: 'I remember getting the initial call and being told it was an accident that had happened.

'Obviously when we arrived at the scene things quickly changed to a serious assault.

'There was very little to go on in the early stages,

'I was tasked to look around the neighbourhood to see if there was anyone around, anyone covered in blood, any witnesses, but there was nothing.'

He added he was also on duty during Claire's funeral and believes there is someone out there who knows what happened to her.

He said: 'A huge amount of effort went into those early stages, it was a busy night, an area which would have mainly been used by local people.

'It's sad that an entire family has been wiped out. Claire's parents have gone to their graves not knowing who killed their daughter.

'There must be witnesses who haven't come forward, who are getting older now. Do they want to go to their graves with that vital piece of information?'

Claire's best friend Lisa Gribbin, who said Claire was often known as Tilt, said: 'We have a strong feeling that with both Claire's parents now gone, there is a need to carry on the fight to find her killer and finally get some justice for our dear friend.

'My eldest daughter has just turned 16 and I look at her and realise just how young Tilt was and how much she had taken away from her and her family and also us as her friends. She had her whole life ahead of her.

'You can never get over or forget what happened. Your life is forever changed.

'Our hope is that the person who knows what happened on that day will come forward allowing Claire, Lin and Cliff to finally get justice and for Tilt's murderer to be punished for taking her life so cruelly and destroying her family.

Search: Officers search for clues near to the site of Claire's death a few days after her murder

To mark the 20th anniverary of Claire's murder, Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate who is leading the cold case investigation into Claire's murder said: 'I have always maintained that the killer was a local person and that someone knows who he or she is.

'Last year, a good man [Cliff, Claire's father] went to his grave without ever seeing justice being served for the murder of his only daughter.

'This isn't the end of our investigation; we have always maintained that someone has information about this murder and we will continue to investigate it.

'I hope that this event may prompt someone to finally come forward with the key piece of information that we need to identify Claire's killer and help us bring this case to a successful conclusion.'
