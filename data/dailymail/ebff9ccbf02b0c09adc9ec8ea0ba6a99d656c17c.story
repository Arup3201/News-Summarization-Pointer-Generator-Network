Britain's Advertising Standards Authority said that it was assessing a number of complaints that Apple's advertising for the new iPad was misleading.

Apple has offered a refund to all Australian buyers of the new tablet in response to pressure from a consumer watchdog.

One model of the tablet claims that it is '4G' - but it will not work with Australian 4G networks.

There is no national 4G network in Britain - and it's uncertain whether the planned networks will even work with Apple's machine when they do appear.

The new tablet is labelled as '4G' - but the connection won't work in many countries including the UK

'All UK ads should avoid containing anything that is likely to mislead,' says a spokesperson. 'The Advertising Code states that ads must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information or by presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible or ambiguous way.

'Without going through due process we can't say whether the ad is likely to be problematic. If anyone has concerns about the iPad ad then they can lodge a complaint with us and we will establish whether or not there is a problem under the Code.'

Apple will email all Australian buyers of its new iPad to offer them a refund, a lawyer for the company said today.

The move came after the nation's consumer watchdog accused it of misleading advertising over one key aspect of the product.

The 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken legal action to
ensure Apple makes consumers aware its third-generation iPad cannot 
connect to a 4G mobile data network in Australia due to technical 
incompatibility.   

Apple
promoted its third-generation tablet as the iPad with Wifi+4G, but 
Australia has only one 4G network, operated by Telstra Corp, which 
operates on a different frequency to the 4G on Apple's new iPad.   

The
consumer watchdog argues that Apple's advertising was misleading and 
wants the court to force the company to correct its ads, refund any 
affected buyers and impose penalties.    

Apple
barrister Paul Anastassiou told the Federal Court in Melbourne that the
company would send emails to all Australian buyers to date, offering 
the refund.

The new iPad was launched in stores only this month.

While
the iPad is the clear market leader, and the new version with its 
faster chips, fourth-generation wireless and a sharper display is only 
expected to cement Apple's lead, the company has hit some bumps in the 
road.
