Arsene Wenger will sit down with Jack Wilshere this week to talk about the player’s conduct during his post-World Cup holiday in Las Vegas.

Wilshere risked the wrath of Wenger when he was pictured smoking and drinking in a swimming pool in Las Vegas last week as he partied with England goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Wenger condemned Wilshere’s conduct back in November when the 22-year-old was photographed smoking a cigarette during a night out and warned the youngster it would ‘damage his reputation’.

And now the Arsenal manager will see his midfielder to get to the bottom of what happened in America — but insisted he is not ‘deeply concerned’ by his actions.

Wenger said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him so it’s very difficult for me to make any statement. I know what you can make of the pictures.

‘I have to speak to him before I come out publicly. We will speak this week. I am not deeply concerned by it but I just want to know what happened.’

Wenger did admit that next season could be make-or-break for Wilshere, saying: ‘He is at an age where you want him to move forward. He has potential. I believe, for him, what is most important is to have a good preparation and focus on getting really fit.

'Jack is a great player, has a football brain and is ambitious. I’m sure if he can stay injury-free he can have a great season.’
