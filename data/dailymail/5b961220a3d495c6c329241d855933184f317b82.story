Despite admitting that he 'hates Twitter', Prince Harry will now have more of a presence on the social media site.

A 'Kensington Palace' account with the handle @KensingtonRoyal has been set up to provide updates on the work of the prince, as well as his brother and sister-in-law the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The first tweet from the account, which has already amassed thousands of followers since it was set up this morning, stated: 'Hello from Kensington Palace! Welcome to our new Twitter account.'  

Watch this space: The Twitter account will provide updates, pictures and videos on the work of the royals

Greetings: The first Tweet on behalf of Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said: 'Hello from Kensington Palace!'

The account promises to give 'updates, pictures and videos from Kensington Palace, about The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and their Royal Foundation.' 

Their second tweet echoed this stating: 'This account represents The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry - follow for updates on their work and the #RoyalFoundation'.

The account is following charities represented by the royals, including the Invictus Games and Save The Rhino as well as Clarence House - which provides updates on Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

Welcome: The first Kensington Palace tweet was quickly retweeted and replied to

Joint effort: Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge set up the Royal Foundation 'as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities'

They are also following Prime Minister David Cameron and Historic Royal Palaces, the charity that maintains and runs buildings like Hampton Court and the Tower Of London as tourist attractions.

The Kensington Palace account will be run by staff working for the royals but it is likely William, Harry or Kate may send their own Tweets when promoting charities they support.

Prince Harry admitted last year that he can see the benefits of using social media to promote charitable events, like last September's Invictus Games which he helped organise.

He did send a tweet from the account @InvictusLondon to promote tickets sales that read: 'Hope everyone will get behind #invictusgames. Great opportunity to support and thank the men and women who have given so much. Harry.' 

But he said it's a double-edged sword for him and his family as it can be an additional invasion of their privacy.

He said: 'I would love to get involved and go on social media and if it was for causes like this (the Invictus Games) I really would. 

'The issue for myself and my family, put quite simply, is that it's very hard for me to tweet about the Invictus Games and tweet about something that means a lot to me, whereas I at the same time really quite hate Twitter by the invasion of privacy. I think you all understand what I'm talking about.’

Despite being part of the iPhone generation, the princes and Kate are not up-to-date with the times as their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.

Beaten them to it: The Queen sent her first Tweet in October 2014

She has already sent her first tweet from her @BritishMonarchy account that has been providing 'updates, pictures and videos from Buckingham Palace about the work and activities of The Royal Family and the institution of Monarchy' since April 2009.

In October 2014, the Queen used the account to tweet about her visit to the Science Museum in London.

She wrote: 'It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.'

The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry was legally established by princes in September 2009 and became fully operational in 2011. 

The website states that along with Kate, 'they intend to use the Foundation 'as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities.'

Official updates on the royals are sent from the following verified accounts... 

The Queen: @BritishMonarchy

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall: @ClarenceHouse

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry: @KensingtonRoyal

Prince Andrew: @TheDukeOfYork

The charities they support include those close to their hearts such as the Armed Forces, sport and conservation.  

Prince Harry will support a programme created by the Foundation today. 

He will join forces with US basketball star Carmelo Anthony to recognise the first graduates of an ambitious sports scheme.

Harry and the New York Knicks player will present certificates to a group of young people who have completed the Coach Core course.

More than 30 people have finished the initiative which trains young people, who are struggling to find positive prospects, to become professional sports coaches and mentors.

The Foundation created the programme which is run in partnership with the organisation Glasgow Life in Scotland and the Greenhouse Charity in London.
