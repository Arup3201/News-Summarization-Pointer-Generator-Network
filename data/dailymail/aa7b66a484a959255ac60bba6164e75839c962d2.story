Phil Jagielka has warned England to be wary of 'confident'  Steven Naismith ahead of the Scotland clash and is hoping his Everton team-mate has an 'off-day'.

Club-mates Jagielka and Naismith are set to line up against each other as Scotland welcome England to Celtic Park on Tuesday night for an international friendly.

Naismith has been in good form for club and country this season finding the net on six occasions, and ahead of the clash Jagielka has revealed he wishes the 28-year-old striker was going into the game lower on confidence.

'Naisy is in fantastic form now, his confidence is high and I would much prefer him not to be that confident playing against England,' Jagielka told evertonfc.com.

'But it is brilliant for our club. When he first came to Everton, he came after a bad injury and didn't get the run of games that he would have liked, and as soon as he got that run of games he got his confidence up.

'He's been a massive part of the good stuff we've done this season, but hopefully he has an off-day when we play against Scotland.'

England defender Jagielka added that he will have no problem putting his club allegiance to one side when the pair line up on opposing sides on Tuesday.

'It will be a weird experience when you're going for balls together and I'm sure you'll not be thinking about all the banter that goes on, you'll be thinking about the game and after the game it will be back to normal being mates again I suppose.'

Naismith, who is set to win his 34th international cap, believes his game has improved since moving to the Premier League from Rangers in 2012.

'I'm definitely a better player now than when I came to the English league,' he added. 'That is probably something going into the England game that will help.

'Most of the Scotland team play in England, so we're used to playing against English players. You come up against these players week in and week out, so you know what you're going to get on the night and it does make you a better player.'
