Jeremy Forrest's devastated family last night defended their  son against claims that he is a  paedophile and said he is ‘paying for a mistake’.

His parents, Jim and Julie, revealed that their son ‘knows he’s been stupid’ but that depression caused him to run away with a 15-year-old pupil.

Forrest’s family said he had felt unhappy in his marriage to his  wife Emily and there was ‘a wedge between them’.

Support: Julie Forrest, pictured with children Tom and Carrie, said her son Jeremy must accept blame but that 'there were other factors' involved in the abduction of his 15-year-old pupil

The family spoke to The Mail on Sunday at their £800,000 four- bedroom house in Orpington, Kent.

At the house, all of Forrest’s  wedding photos have been removed and the belongings from his marital home have been moved to a specially built music studio.

Jailed: Teacher Jeremy Forrest is 'paying for a mistake' according to his parents

Retired IT worker Jim, 59, said: ‘One of the worst moments was when we went to pick up Jeremy’s belongings from the house he had lived in with Emily. Emily’s father was there and he told us to leave.

‘It was a shock – but it’s understandable. The two words I have had in my mind throughout all this are dignity and liberty.

‘As parents, there have been tough moments but family is very important to us and we’re behind Jeremy.'

'He has been stupid – obviously  running away with a pupil is not on – but the Jeremy who did that is not  the one I know.

‘He was in a very dark place  then, he was desperate. He is much better now.’

Julie said: ‘I’m not excusing his behaviour, and he has to accept blame, but there were other factors.

‘Emily was difficult for Jeremy to deal with. Jeremy is so giving and Emily enjoyed that as she needed constant reassurance.

‘When Jeremy started working at 
another school and things became  difficult, he needed support – but 
Emily wasn’t there for him.’

Jim said: ‘They shouldn’t have married. 
He wants to be like me –  I’ve been married over 30 years and he wanted 
the same. That’s why he proposed.

Failed marriage: Jeremy Forrest, 30, with his photographer wife Emily, 32. Raised in Chislehurst, Kent, her parents are partners in an optician's practice. Growing up she was an arty, creative, 'geeky' type

‘He was also not being supported  at school, there were rumours for seven months but the teachers did nothing.

‘The police visited the girl and took her phone – why didn’t they do that  to Jeremy?

‘Maybe they’d have found something and stopped things escalating. The girl had a tough past and was not properly cared for by her family.’

Jim revealed he has spent £50,000 on Jeremy’s court fees.
