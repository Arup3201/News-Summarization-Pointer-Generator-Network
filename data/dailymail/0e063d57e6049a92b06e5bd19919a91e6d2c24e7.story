A Team GB Paralympic athlete has been bombarded with hundreds of abusive tweets aimed at I'm A Celebrity contestant Gemma Collins because their names are so similar.

Wheelchair fencer Gemma Collis, 20, has been forced to defend herself against twitter trolls who labelled her a 'whale' and a 'fat slut' who should lose some pounds in the jungle.

She was horrified to find her timeline clogged up with abuse after The Only Way Is Essex star broke down in tears twice on her first day and had a panic attack before the helicopter was off the ground.

The Durham University student said: 'Oh god, it's started already... My name is Gemma COLLIS, I'm an athlete and not @missgemcollins from #TOWIE! So PLEASE stop tweeting me abuse!'

She later tweeted: 'Oh my word...don't!! Over 100 abusive tweets already!'

Minutes into the first episode, Darren Burns tweeted: 'Intro started and I already hate @GemmaCollis #hippointhejungle #ImACelebrity.'

This was swiftly followed by other Twitter users calling her a 'fat b****' and saying 'you need a diet cuz.'

Max Poynter said: 'I hope Gemma Collis gets all the trials, I hate her.'

A girl under the name of @coppxn said: 'Hopefully @GemmaCollis loses some pounds in the jungle.'

The reality TV star lived up to her drama queen status as she began bawling while the helicopter prepared to take flight.

She was selected as one of the celebrities to spend the first few days in the jungle jail and threatened to 'commit suicide' if TV show bosses did not give them food or treats.

But hundreds of Twitter users seem to be having difficulty telling the TOWIE star apart from Miss Collis. 

The  athlete competed at the London 2012 Paralympics just ten months after taking up wheelchair fencing for the first time.

Hundreds of abusive messages have been sent to the athlete by mistake, many of them commenting on the reality TV star's weight 

She developed a progressive nervous system disease called Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy in 2008 which affects the functioning of the nerves in her right leg.

This causes altered sensation and extreme pain and means she has been on crutches or used a wheelchair ever since. 

She has attracted sympathy from a number of Twitter users who told ITV viewers to 'spare a thought' for the Paralympic athlete.

This is not the first time social media users have directed online abuse at the wrong person.

Ian 'H' Watkins, member of pop band Steps, was forced to leave Twitter after facing a barrage of misdirected abuse aimed at  former Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins.

An academic called John Lewis from Blacksburg, Virginia, received hundreds of messages on Twitter after the Christmas advert premiered.  

Store bosses  promised to send a gift to thank the professor for redirecting people to the correct Twitter page, which is @johnlewisretail.
