Robin Gibb refused to have scans that could have detected his fatal tumours before they developed – so he could go on a world tour.

The Bee Gees singer died in May, aged 62, after a long battle with colon and liver cancer.

His heartbroken widow, Dwina Gibb, 59, has told how he initially ignored doctors' advice and her pleas to have the cancerous cells properly checked.

'Stubborn': Robin Gibb's wife Dwina said she could not get the star to take a break for his health

The cancer was spotted after the star had an operation to remove an intestinal blockage in October 2010.

But Mrs Gibb told the Daily Mail's Weekend magazine that she and son Robin John, 29, were unable to stop Mr Gibb continuing with his musical commitments.

She said: 'He didn't want to stop and I said, “Please just have the scan.” Despite all his wonderful ways, Robin could be very stubborn and he never liked bad news – he just didn't want to know.

'He went to do a show in New Zealand as they'd just experienced an earthquake.

'Maybe it was very important for him to do that show, but it was still important for him to have his scans.'

Mr Gibb toured for more than two weeks during November 2010 and his wife said the cancer had developed to a secondary stage – when the tumour starts to spread to nearby blood vessels – by the time he had a check-up.

Before he died from pneumonia, Mr Gibb astonished doctors by pulling out of his coma for several weeks after Mrs Gibb played a symphony he had composed with his son to mark the centenary of Titanic's sinking.

She said: 'We ended up having a wonderful few weeks with him.'
