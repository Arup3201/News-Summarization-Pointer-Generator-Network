A cyclist has been caught on camera smashing into a black cab in London and then fleeing without his bike.

The footage was released by the driver who claims the incident, which happened in Knightsbridge last month, left him with more than £300 worth of damage.

The clip begins with the black cab waiting at red lights around 10pm and there is a screeching noise as the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver gets out to confront the cyclist off-camera.

The driver can be heard saying: 'Where you going? You just hit my car. Why you running away?' 

As they both come into shot, the cyclist can clearly be seen trying to leave the scene, denying that he caused any damage - and even leaves his bike behind.

Crash: The cyclist can be heard refusing to exchange details and attempts to wrestle his bike from the driver

The cyclist, pictured, can be seen wrestling the driver for the bike, but then decides to cut his losses and retrieves his bag, right, before walking away after the alleged hit-and-run in Knightsbridge, London 

The cab driver, who asked not to be named, told the RawCrimeChannel on YouTube, that he wasn't sure why the cyclist was trying to get away.

He said: 'I'm not sure if the cyclist was drunk or not. Surely if he caused an accident he should stop, not try to run away?'

The dash-cam footage shows the cyclist - dressed in a blue top - refusing to exchange details or pay for the damage.

Walking away: 'He probably realised that it was his fault and didn't want to pay repair costs. Bizarre behaviour' 

He struggles to retrieve his bike from the driver and decides to cut his losses and removes his bag from the bike before casually walking off down the street. 

When asked why he thought the man left him with the bike, the veteran cab driver added: 'He probably realised that it was his fault and didn't want to pay repair costs. Bizarre behaviour.'

The driver is appealing for anyone with information to contact Charing Cross police station where the accident was reported and the green bicycle is being held.

The driver, who handed the bike in at Charing Cross police station in London said the damage is worth £300
