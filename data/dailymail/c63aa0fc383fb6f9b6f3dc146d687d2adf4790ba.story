Dr Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St. Paul's, said it is 'ridiculous' that George Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, used his Easter message to continue a 'peculiar obsession with gay sex'

From my parish next to the Elephant and Castle in South London, you can just about make out the top of the Palace of Westminster over the Sixties council flats. As the crow flies, it is just a couple of miles away.

But the people who live round here do not feel close to the sources of power or have much trust that it works on their behalf.

Likewise, from here you can see the skyscrapers of the City of London. But again, it is another world. 

Commuters know my parish as a route to somewhere else. Every day, many thousands drive around the notorious roundabout or rumble through on the Underground’s Northern line, which goes directly under the vicarage.

They often don’t give much thought to those stuck in bedsits or struggling to bring up children with no work. To be poor is to feel desperately ignored. As if your voice cannot ever be heard.

Easter, of course, is a time of hope. But hope is not exactly the same as optimism – at least not the sort of cheap optimism we get from our politicians, who are inevitably slaves to the electoral cycle and want to talk up every policy intervention as if it were going to change the world.

The Church, however, is not looking to get elected. And when we speak of hope it is not because we believe things are going to get better in the next six months. Hope is simply the belief that there is no darkness that cannot be overcome.

That at the heart of the universe there is something so fundamentally good and kind that it can absorb all disasters – even crucifixion.

Hope, then, is the defiance of love, 
defiance against what can feel like a bleak reality. It is built on the 
promise that love is stronger than death. And because of this, there is 
nothing of which we need to be afraid. Not fundamentally.

This
 is the good news of Easter – which is why it’s so ridiculous that 
former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey has used his own Easter 
message to continue his peculiar obsession with gay sex.

It
 is hardly earth-shattering good news if we reduce the Resurrection of 
Jesus Christ to some narrow moralism that seeks to police how people 
love each other.

Referring to Dr George Carey's comments as 'narrow moralism', Dr Fraser said we should not 'seek to police how people love each other'

In his attack on David Cameron, Lord Carey accused the Prime Minister of doing more than any recent political leader to feed the anxieties of those Christians who feel part of ‘a persecuted minority’.

To speak of Christians being persecuted in this country is an insult to those people in places such as Iran and Pakistan who really are.

But if the Resurrection that Christians celebrate on this day is all about some ultimate promise that all will be well, it is not an easy promise to live by. The new Pope has recently insisted that the Church has to make itself poor. This is not simply out of solidarity with those on the margins.

Still less is it political, though it may have political consequences. Over the centuries, the Church has done too much  to glamorise poverty when it is right and proper that we ought to be helping people find a route out of it.

Nevertheless, there is a wisdom that comes with being poor. Or rather, there is something the poor just cannot avoid that the wealthy find it easier to hide from – that we are all vulnerable, dependent creatures.

The problem with having lots  of money is that it can fool us into believing we are ultimately self-sufficient. Money can become life’s artificial protection mechanism against the fact that we are all going to die.

It doesn’t matter what designer clothes we wear. Or what fancy restaurants we eat in. Or whether we live in a penthouse and earn squillions in the City. We are all subject to the same basic logic that human existence is limited.

From the perspective of eternity, the short-term optimism of politicians is a trifle, and matters relatively little. The Church has in mind a bigger picture when is speaks of hope.

So, for instance, when Julian of Norwich famously insisted that ‘all will be well, all manner of things will be well’ she was surrounded by people struck down by the Black Death.

It wasn’t any sort of optimism that made her say this. It was something so much more basic, so much more elemental.

The poor get this. They have no illusion of self-sufficiency and so have a natural empathy with the idea that ultimate security comes from outside of ourselves. Over this bitter winter, we opened up our church as a night shelter for the homeless, something that is dramatically on the rise again. Makeshift beds were set up between the pews and around the font.

The people who came to the church were a mixture and there was no obvious common feature. But they were all desperate, one way or another. And they all knew they needed help. That’s the thing the poor know that the rich sometimes don’t –that we all need help.

Early this morning, just before dawn, I will bring into church a lighted candle, symbolising the new light of the Resurrection and its ability to triumph over the darkness.

One of the fears I always have is that a random gust of wind will blow the candle out and that the whole symbolism of light defeating darkness will be lost. But there is symbolism in this fear, too.

The flame of the candle seems such a fragile thing when set against the problems of the world. Can the faith that I have in the ultimate goodness of things really take on the challenges of our society?

What is this little flame against the drug needles that I have to clear up outside the church most weeks? What is this little flame against the stabbings and the gangs and the loneliness?

But from this flame, we light all the candles in the church. And suddenly the place is full of light. And then we will sing about thanksgiving and hope.

There is nothing naive about all of this. It is not a belief that we can magic away the social problems that exist in this part  of London. I have little doubt the same problems will be just as much in evidence next Easter.

I am not really much of an optimist. But I know for sure that the needles will not have the last word. The Resurrection is not something you believe as some simple intellectual proposition. That’s pretty difficult, for obvious reasons.

But it is something you live your life by. It is the compass that always points towards the rising of the new dawn. And those of us who set our course by this compass will not be deterred by the depressing state of the economy or its consequences. Our hope is given from elsewhere.

Yes, this can be scary and precarious. The source of our hope is not in our power to direct or even fully to understand. But if this is a form of foolishness, the deeper foolishness is to believe that we can escape from the dependency on things that are outside of our control. In reality, none of us can do this.
