A showdown over the passports of so called 'foreign fighters' – Americans and other westerners who have joined the ISIS terror army in Iraq and Syria – came to a head on Thursday when a U.S. senator killed legislation aiming to strip them of their citizenship.

Democrat Mazie Hirono, a freshman senator from Hawaii, objected on the Senate floor when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tried to fast-track his 'Expatriate Terrorists Act.’

Cruz bypassed the Senate's committee process in order to rush the legislation to a vote, meaning that any single senator could block it.

Since the Senate is sprinting through its final days in session this year, he said, putting the bill through committee 'would mean that it could not pass in time to prevent Americans fighting right now with ISIS from coming back and murdering other Americans.'

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz aimed to win quick approval for his bill, which considers aiding an anti-American terror group to be an 'affirmative renunciation' of US citizenship

Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono blocked the legislation, saying she and other Democrats wanted more time -- and likely pushing the issue off until after the November elections

'There is an urgency and an exigency to this situation,' Cruz said on the Senate floor. 

Hirono said she chose to throw up a road block because 'legislation that grants the government the ability to strip citizenship from Americans is a serious matter raising significant constitutional issues.'

She also cited letters of objection from the Constitution Project and the American Civil Liberties Union. 

The question of what to do about ISIS-aligned foreign fighters who have U.S. passports has occupied the attention of the FBI, the Homeland Security Department and the State Department, which issues passports and can revoke them if a judge agrees there's a compelling reason.

In testimony Thursday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry argued that the U.S. needs 'to stop the foreign fighters who carry passports from countries around the world including the United States.'

'What I want to make certain, Kerry told the congressional panel, 'is that anybody who has a passport [and joins with ISIS] 'who returns, returns in handcuffs – not through customs with their passport.'

'I don't think these guys are ten feet tall,' he said later.

Committee chairman Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, agreed.

'I think we need a way to approach this to make certain that their ability to come into the United States is made a hell of a lot more difficult than it is right now,' Royce told the secretary.

But Kerry warned about the possibility of interfering with law enforcement, saying that canceling a passport could give suspected terrorists a heads-up that they've been identified in Washington.

'We ... need to do that with sensitivity to certain investigations that may be going on,' said Kerry, 'because you don't want to flag something.'

In the same hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that 'the suspension of passports should be considered on a case-by-case basis,' not with a law that drives every circumstance toward a single outcome.

'Suspension and revocation of passports can be done on an expedited basis when the situation warrants, in a matter of hours or days,' he said.

FBI Director James Comey (left) and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson (right) said immediately canceling passports of ISIS foreign fighters might interfere with law-enforcement investigations 

FBI director James Comey said passport revocation is 'of interest to us,' but added that the U.S. can't do much to stop foreigners from friendly nations entering the U.S. – even if they're aligned ith ISIS.

The United States and its allies have identified people of French, Belgian, British and Australian origin who are confirmed to be ISIS-aligned foreign fighters. Without a safeguard, they would be able to enter the country without travel visas.

Comey said the FBI might encounter 'due process' challenges trying to persuade a court to cancel a passport for terrorism-related reasons, since much of the evidence in such cases would consist of secret intelligence.

'How would I protect sources and methods?' he asked. 'How would we be able to use, if at all, classified information to make the showing that would be necessary?

Comey also said a one-size-fits all mandate to strip the citizenship of foreign fighters might impede law enforcement investigations.

'Sometimes it makes sense under limited circumstances,' he said, 'to let somebody back in and cover them very closely to see who they connect with.'

'Sometimes,' he added, 'it makes sense to let them come back in the country and lock 'em up right away.'

The measure would have terminated the citizenship of any American who joins or assists a terror group that's likely to attack US interests

Hirono insisted that the bill raised constitutional questions and cited complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union

Kerry said he has authority to cancel passports; the FBI director said it's sometimes useful to let terrorists back into the country and watch them
