The former Navy SEAL who authored a soon-to-be-published book about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden is now facing death threats in addition to possible criminal prosecution.

An official al Qaeda website on Friday posted a photograph and the name of the former Navy commando responsible for the book, calling him 'the dog who murdered the martyr Sheikh Osama bin Laden.'

Meanwhile the head of U.S. Special Operations Command told current and former troops that the military would take legal action against anyone found to have exposed sensitive information that could cause harm to fellow forces.

'We will pursue every option available to hold members accountable, including criminal prosecution where appropriate,' Admiral Bill McRaven wrote in an open, unclassified letter emailed to the active-duty special operations community.

'As current or former members of our special operations community, authors have a moral obligation, and a legal duty, to submit their works for pre-publication security review,' the admiral wrote.

The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011.

The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC.

But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission.

By early on Friday, the man's name, photograph and age had been posted on the 'the Al-Fidaa Islamic Network' online forum, one of two websites officially endorsed by al Qaeda, according to Evan Kohlmann, founder of the New York-based security firm Flashpoint Global Partners.

It was followed by comments that called for the man's death, including one response that said, 'O' Allah, kill every one of them,' and another that said, 'O' Allah, make an example of him for the whole world and give him dark days ahead.'

Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday. MailOnline has decided to blur the image so as not to show the soldier's face; he is now facing death threats from al Qaeda in addition to possible criminal prosecution

Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name.

But that didn’t stop the Associated 
Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their 
own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers.

The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles.

Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James 
Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops 
soldier’s identity can be worrisome.

He said: ‘We protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it’s a concern.'

Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of
U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before 
Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and 
former troops from spilling military matters and national security 
issues.

Other departments, including the CIA, 
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White 
House, were also caught off-guard.

That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book.

Lt Col Gregory said that since he is 
now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the
Department of Justice.

McRaven's open letter to the 
active-duty special operations community said books and films about 
special operations teams could be useful educational tools, and the 
military would work with potential authors, but current and former 
service members would be held accountable if they endangered the safety 
of U.S. forces.

He said there was 'a distinct line 
between recounting a story for the purposes of education or 
entertainment and telling a story that exposes sensitive activities just
to garner greater readership and personal profit.'

Kohlmann said the former Navy SEAL 
could now be in physical danger from al Qaeda sympathizers seeking 
revenge for bin Laden's death, or hoping to gain prestige for 
themselves.

'They have a photo of the individual,
they have his name, his age,' Kohlmann said. 'I wish that all this was 
bluster, but there are a lot of would-be jihadists out there, including 
some in North America. This is the ideal opportunity for those kind of 
people.'

In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets

The book's publisher, Dutton, said 
the author was 'one of the first men through the door on the third floor
of the terrorist leader's hideout and was present at his death.'

It is not known whether 'No Easy Day'
contains details of commando operations that the U.S. government 
considers secret, but U.S. government officials said the account had not
been submitted for a required pre-publication review.

'Even if there is nothing classified 
disclosed, it should have been reviewed, and it was not,' said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

On Wednesday, the publisher said the 
book had been vetted 'for tactical, technical, and procedural 
information as well as information that could be considered classified 
by compilation' by a former 'special operations attorney.'

Jeffrey Carr, a cyber security 
expert, said al Qaeda officials were adept at using the Internet for 
recruitment, training and other searches, and he fully expected them to 
target the former Navy SEAL now that his identity had been disclosed.

'He's going to become the poster 
child for recruitment and assassination,' Carr said, noting that the 
case underscored the need for anyone in a high-risk profession to take 
great precautions with any information available on the Internet.

Carr said the man's relatives and 
former Navy SEAL colleagues could also be in danger if they could be 
traced through the Internet.

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House

Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus 
of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before 
Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and 
former troops from spilling military matters and national security 
issues.

Other departments, including the CIA,
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White
House, were also caught off-guard.

That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book.

Lt
Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military 
could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice.

But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day.

'We
don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a 
determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said.

But the publisher maintains that 
Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special 
operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag.

Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.'

Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down

No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin 
Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last 
year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan.

Maurer
spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer.

The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL.

The blog added that the book will 
culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the 
terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound.

No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com 
says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a SEAL Team 
Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates
in 2009.

Owen's book comes on the heels of 
another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed
three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary 
Clinton.

That explosive allegation is 
contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the 
White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader 
who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a 
myth.

Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday.

A
film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker 
director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19.

Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information.

The Obama administration denied the claims.
