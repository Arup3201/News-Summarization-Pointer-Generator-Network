The schoolgirl who ran away to France with jailed Jeremy Forrest has found love with another teacher, it was reported today.

The girl was aged just 15 when she sparked an international manhunt after eloping with maths teacher Forrest, 31, who is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for abducting her.

But she is now said to be 'ridiculously happy' after falling for a 20-year-old PE teaching assistant and part-time security guard.

The schoolgirl who ran away to France with jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has reportedly found love with another teacher

The girl, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, posted a picture showing the new man giving her a kiss on
 the cheek while she sticks her tongue out, reported the Sun on Sunday.

And
 her mother is understood to wholeheartedly approve of the relationship, 
telling the newspaper: 'He is really nice and we have welcomed him into 
our family and I am very happy for my daughter.'

Because the girl is now 16 and the new teacher does not work at her current school, their relationship is not illegal.

Friends of the teenager are also said to be keen on the new man and see him as a positive influence.

The news is expected to come as a devastating blow to Forrest who is currently serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for abducting the girl

The
 pair are said to have connected over a shared love of music and 
exchanged a series of flirty tweets before things became more serious in
 mid-February.

They reportedly spent two nights together last week and have bought tickets to see one of their favourite bands.

Last
 week she posted on Twitter that she was annoyed when people said that when someone moves on it meant they did not love the person they were with
 before.

The news is expected to come as a devastating blow to Forrest who was arrested in September 2012 when the runaways were spotted in Bordeaux after spending a week on the run.

Just last month it was claimed the girl had written to him in prison to say she still loved him and wanted to rekindle their relationship when he has served his sentence.

Forrest, whose wife left him after his betrayal, was not allowed to 
read the letters and has been transferred to tough Dartmoor Prison after
 making a complaint, it  was reported.

Forrest, who taught at Bishop Bell 
School in East Sussex, first kissed the girl when she was 14. The pair 
had sex after she turned 15.

When
 police were alerted they fled to France by ferry, travelling under 
false names.

He was spotted and arrested eight days later. Last June at 
Lewes Crown Court he was convicted of sex offences and abduction, and 
jailed.

Afterwards the girl 
said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with 
him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’

Forrest
 began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles 
when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something 
she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with 
bulimia.

She opened up to 
him about the break-up of her parents’ marriage before he kissed her in a
 classroom. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, 
which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest.

They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her.

He was convicted of child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court in June.
