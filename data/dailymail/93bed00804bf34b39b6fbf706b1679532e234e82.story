Tragic: Five-year-old Kelsey Smart died of meningitis after two doctors failed to spot the signs of the killer bug

A five-year-old girl who died from meningitis had been seen by two GPs less than 48 hours before she died, an inquest heard today.

The doctors thought Kelsey Smart was suffering from viral gastroenteritis but in fact she had the deadly brain condition.

The schoolgirl died in hospital on February 28 last year, the hearing at Avon Coroner’s Court heard.

She had been examined by an out-of-hours GP on the night of February 26 and seen again the following 
morning by a doctor at her local surgery.

Three
hours later Kelsey started fitting and was rushed to hospital where she
later died. Her mother, Hannah Smart, told the hearing in a written 
statement that she was concerned that none of the doctors who examined 
Kelsey had considered meningitis.

'We
had a meeting with a senior doctor and the Orchard Medical Centre, a Dr
Yates, who suggested that Kelsey had been let down by the doctors 
treating her,' she said. These feelings are echoed by myself and my 
entire family.

'I am 
concerned that at no point did any of the Frendoc staff or any staff 
at the GP surgery inform me about meningitis and what to look out for. I believe now that she had signs and symptoms pointing to meningitis.'

The
inquest heard that Kelsey, from Kingswood, Bristol, had first 
starting feeling unwell on the night of February 25 and was vomiting 
hourly.

She
was also tired and had developed a small pinprick rash on her abdomen 
and left upper leg. Mrs Smart said that by the following afternoon 
Kelsey was still unwell and she called Frendoc - an out-of-hours GP 
service in South Gloucestershire.

A doctor called back and having spoken to Mrs Smart told her to give Kelsey Dioralyte - a brand of rehydration medication - and if she could not keep that down to ring back.

When she was sick again Mrs Smart telephoned back and was told to bring Kelsey in.Mrs Smart and her daughter were seen by locum GP Dr Jens Rohrbeck.

Anger: Hannah and Jamie Smart with their surviving son Jayden. Kelsey's parents have criticised doctors who missed two chances to save their daughter's life

She
told the inquest: 'I showed Dr Rohrbeck the rash on Kelsey’s chin, 
tummy, chest and leg and he simply pressed the rash with his finger and 
said it was caused by the virus Kelsey had.

'To
me Dr Rohrbeck did not seem very interested in Kelsey or her illness. 
For a lot of the consultation he seemed to be staring at me looking 
blank as if he didn’t know what to do.

'When I asked him what was wrong with 
Kelsey he said she had picked up a virus. He explained he would send us 
down to the hospital to be seen but this would be a four-hour waste of 
time.

'He said it would be 
better for me to take Kelsey home and if she continued to be sick 
overnight I should take her to our family GP the next day. On the advice
of Dr Rohrbeck I took Kelsey home.'

The
following morning Mrs Smart rang her doctors’ surgery, The Orchard 
Medical Centre in Kingswood, asking for an appointment. Kelsey and her 
mother were seen by Dr Sarah Grant.

Mrs Smart said: 'Kelsey sat on my lap
during the consultation and Dr Grant took her temperature which was 
37.8 degrees and listened to her chest.

Mourning: The Smarts attend a memorial service for Kelsey. She died from Group B meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial strain of the disease, just four days after she started developing symptoms

'While
we were in the consultation room she was very agitated and she pulled a
clump of hair out of her head. Dr Grant did not pass comment on this or
suggest it was anything to worry about.

'I
again highlighted Kelsey’s rash which was still present in the various 
places on her body. Dr Grant prodded the rash with her finger and said 
it was linked to the virus. She said children often come up in rashes 
when they have a virus.

'Dr
Grant did seem to realise that I was very concerned about Kelsey and 
she told me to bring Kelsey back at 4pm if there was no change. All in 
all we were in the consultation room for about five minutes.'

By
lunchtime Mrs Smart thought her daughter was suffering from 
appendicitis and decided to drive her to hospital. On route Kelsey 
started fitting and Mrs Smart pulled over and called an ambulance and 
she was rushed to hospital.

Questions: Mr and Mrs Smart hold a photograph of their daughter. The youngster was taken to see two doctors during her short illness

Emergency
teams rushed Kelsey to the Bristol Children’s Hospital where she was 
treated with morphine and anti-inflammatories after doctors thought she 
may have had a stroke.

A neurosurgeon was brought in from neighbouring Frenchay Hospital to carry out an operation to try to remove fluid from the brain - but the disease had taken hold and Kelsey’s brain had swollen too much.

Hannah told the inquest: 'She was connected to a life support machine. We were told the brain surgery had been unsuccessful and her brain had swollen so much she was brain damaged.

'Leaving Kelsey in that hospital and knowing her heart was still beating was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.'

The Smart's have donated their daughter’s organs to help others - her heart has been given to an eight-month-old baby, a three-month-old got her liver and many more will also benefit.

'As a family we have been actively involved in fundraising for meningitis research since Kelsey's death,' said Mrs Smart, 'we miss Kelsey every day and want as many positives to come out of her death as possible.'

Dr Rohrbeck told the inquest he saw Kelsey at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and examined the rashes on her body but felt they were 'very, very small and inconspicuous' and combined with other symptoms pointed to gastroenteritis.

'I was concerned that she did look 
pale,' he said. 'The last thing I did was offer Kelsey a drink of water.
'She drank it and that reassured me that I could send her home with 
advice to call us back if she worsened or did not get better the next 
day.'

Questioned by Avon Coroner Maria Voisin, Dr Rohrbeck said that with 'hindsight' he would have sought further medical advice. 'I
thought I was dealing with viral gastroenteritis,' he said. 'I did not 
associate it with a meningitis rash. Personally I have never seen a case
like this before.'

Dr Lisa Goldsworthy, a consultant in 
children's emergency medicine at Bristol Children's Hospital, said: 'My 
feeling at the time and in hindsight was that by the time she had her 
fit and was less responsive, her brain had reached a critical level of 
swelling and the disease had taken hold.

'With an hour-and-a-half of the ambulance taking her to hospital there was nothing to be done.'

Her
colleague Dr Sara Hulme, a consultant in paediatric intensive care, 
told the inquest that had Kelsey been admitted to hospital earlier it 
was unlikely doctors would have been able to reverse the swelling to her
brain.

Treatment: Bristol Royal Hospital for Children where Kelsey died. The coroner at the inquest into her death recorded a narrative verdict

Dr Grant told the hearing that she examined Kelsey but was reassured that the rash on the girl's body was not getting worse. 'I did think about meningitis as the cause of the rash but discounted that at the time,' she said. 'The one thing that made me think that was the fact that the rash did not seem to have progressed.

'She had been seen 12 hours previously and a rash was detected. I think I was reassured that it did not seem to have got particularly worse over that time frame. I had a chat with mum and I booked a review appointment at 4pm the same day.'

Dr Grant said it was not unusual for a child to be seen by doctors repeatedly over a short period of time. 'I think that if there was no improvement during the day I would have asked the children's hospital to review her,' she said.

Coroner Voisin recorded a narrative verdict. She said: 'I am mindful of Kelsey's presentation when she was seen by each doctor. I am also mindful of the evidence of the two consultants from the children's hospital.

'It is clear from their evidence that earlier intervention is better but what cannot be said is whether earlier treatment would have resulted in a different outcome for Kelsey. Neither can we say exactly what would have happened if Kelsey had been admitted sooner. So based on the evidence I consider the appropriate verdict to be a narrative verdict.'

The coroner said she would not be making any recommendations about preventing a similar tragedy from happening again in the future. Rule 43 recommendations are made by coroners with the intention of preventing deaths and learning lesson from the cause of deaths.

'During the inquest I have been mindful 
of Rule 43 but having heard the evidence from the GP, taking into 
account the information provided to the practice since this event and 
training that has taken place, I don't think Rule 43 is appropriate,' said Ms Voisin.
