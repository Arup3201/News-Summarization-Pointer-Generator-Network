Firms selling bullet-proof children's gear - including Disney Princess and Avengers backpacks lined with Kevlar-type sheeting - are reporting a massive surge in sales in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre.

Salt Lake City-based Amendment II is among several firms being accused of callously cashing-in on the tragedy in which 26 people were gunned down including 23 children.

The firm is currently promoting a range of $300 bulletproof backpacks, alongside body armour in children's sizes, and say they have sold as many in a week as they usually sell in three months.

Cashing-in: Firms have been promoting bullet-proof products for children, including backpacks adorned with Disney Princess and Avengers characters,  in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre

Company president Derek Williams told motherjones.com: 'I can't go into exact sales numbers, but basically we tripled our sales volume of backpacks that we typically do in a month - in one week.'

Mr Williams also admitted that he would be looking to actively promote the products while the events in Connecticut remained high in the public consciousness.

He said: 'We want to be sensitive to how we do that, but we are gonna try to get the word out that this product does exist that there are ways to at least provide our children with some protection.'

Manufacturers boast the backpacks are capable of stopping bullets from a 
range of handguns and can also be used from the front as a shield

Amendment II, a Salt Lake City-based company is promoting $300 backpacks alongside bullet proof vests in children's sizes

According to the company website, the backpacks are capable of stopping bullets from most handguns and can also be used as shield.

Mr Williams added: 'Basically, there's three models; a SwissGear that's made for teens, and we've got an Avengers and a Disney Princess backpack for little kids.'

Amendment II also sells cheaper bullet-proof inserts which can be used into any backpack but Mr Williams said he would recommend spending the extra money as children could easily take these out.

He explained: 'With kids, you never know when they're gonna take something out of their backpack and not put it back in.'

Last resort: Instructions show how the bags can be used from the front as shield

A message on the company's homepage pledges to give 10 per cent of website purchases to families of the Connecticut victims.

It reads: 'We are4 deeply saddened by the recent events in Connecticut. Senseless violence like this shooting affects all of us no matter where we live.

'We have developed armored backpacks and personal shields in addition to our vests but clearly we still have far to go.'

The Disney corporation have insisted that the backpacks are not official merchandise and say they are investigating.

A spokesman for the corporation said: 'None of these products were ever authorized by Disney. 

'We have sent the company a letter demanding that all sales of backpacks depicting Disney Princesses, Marvel's The Avengers or any other Disney intellectual property cease immediately.'

Amendment II is one of several companies which appear to be looking to cash-in following the tragedy in Newtown.
