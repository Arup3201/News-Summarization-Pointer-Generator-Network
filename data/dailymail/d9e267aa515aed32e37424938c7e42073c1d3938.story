A video blog famous for filming a brain cancer surgery may have proof in a recent post that dogs can detect humans having nightmares.

In the video posted online, Charles Trippy says that whenever wife Alli Trippy has a bad dream, their two dogs jump on the bed and lay with her – one at her head and one at her feet. The video shows the two dogs laying on the bed as if to protect her.

The couple's video blog first became famous for
 filming his cancer surgery and has been viewed hundreds of millions of times.

Her protector: The Trippy's dog Zoe is shown lying with Alli Trippy as she wakes up from a nightmare

‘Alli had a bad dream, and I think Zoe heard it, and she freaked out and went up there by her head,’ he said. ‘Who says dogs don’t have feelings?’

Charles Trippy, a bassist for rock group We The Kings, then says the other dog, Miley, is at wife Alli’s feet ‘in case she farts.’

Miley, apparently in desperate need of attention, then climbs over the sleeping woman to Zoe and licks the inside of the dog’s mouth while it yawns.

‘Here to screw everything up,’ the bassist says to the dog.

'You're such a spaz': The Trippy's other dog soon comes over looking for attention

Not amused: Zoe yawns at Miley's antics as Alli rubs her ears

The brain cancer survivor can be heard throughout the video  talking to the dogs and trying to get Miley to move.

‘Miley’s here to just mess everything up,’ Charles Trippy says, as the dog playfully growls.

‘The camera needs to be on me at all times guys,’ the musician says as Miley looks at him and makes a loud noise, waking up his sleeping wife.

‘You’re such a spaz,’ he says to the dog.

The discussion: The couple talks about Charles' brain tumor and his diagnosis, on the blog of course

Despite the commotion caused by Miley, Zoe lays there, almost motionless while Alli Trippy pets her head as she slowly wakes up.

The dog then forces Zoe to move and is on Charles Trippy’s pillow licking itself while his wife rubs its belly.

The dog then scratches its ear and licks its foot, to which the guitar player says ‘that’s gross, that’s all your ear wax you’re licking.’

The video is one of over 1,700 uploaded over the last five years to the couple’s video blog, which is updated every day.

What began as a daily chronicling of the
 lives of a young married couple and their dogs, recently took a 
dramatic turn as the diary of a cancer struggle.

Recovery: Charles Trippy recovers after a brain surgery he stayed awake for and gave a thumbs up to his wife filming as he cracked jokes

An ongoing process: Mr Trippy even filmed himself having staples removed from his head

From the initial diagnosis of Charles Trippy having a non-malignant tumor after having a seizure following a 2012 concert to a recent surgery to remove a piece of his brain after the tumor was found to have become malignant, everything was filmed and uploaded.

The heavily sedated man even made jokes while awake during the surgery.

The video blog then charted his difficult recovery, return to the stage and follow up procedures.

In the process they have garnered over 1million followers and their videos have been seen over 427million times.
