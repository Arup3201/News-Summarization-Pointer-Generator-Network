A frail grandmother died after she hit her head when a police officer pushed her and she fell off a doorstep during a row, an inquest has heard.

Diane Botham died at her home in Southey Green, Sheffield, from bleeding between the brain and skull after she fell over and hit her head the previous day.

Mrs Botham's family are now angry a jury has found the police officer's force to be 'reasonable and necessary' given the fact she was a 'frail 61-year-old'.

In August 2012, police had been called to an incident at a property neighbouring Mrs Botham's when she became involved and was told to leave.

The inquest was told that she argued with two officers, was pushed and fell backwards from a step and struck her head.

PC Thomas Rogers said Mrs Botham tried to 'barge' past him so he used 'minimum force' to get her to move backwards and prevent a breach of the peace continuing.

He and colleague PC John Shaw said they helped Mrs Botham to her feet and she continued to shout and swear before her son escorted her away from the property.

The inquest heard Mrs Botham, who had been drinking that day - had become increasingly unsteady on her feet in the weeks before her death and found it difficult to climb stairs.

Returning home following the altercation, she spent the rest of the day on the sofa in her living room - remaining there until the last member of her family went to bed at 2am.

She was found dead the following day.

The jury concluded Mrs Botham died as a result of an acute subdural haematoma - a bleed between her skull and brain - caused by a blunt head trauma that had been triggered by the push by the police officer.

They added her alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, ongoing stability and mobility issues, a hepatitis C infection and an atrophic shrunken brain also contributed to her death.

Following the inquest Mrs Botham's family issued a statement saying: 'We are pleased with the conclusion that the push by a police officer played a part in our mum's death but disappointed the jury thought the force used was reasonable.

'Our mum was a frail 61-year-old lady. We do not think she posed a risk of violence.

'Nothing can lessen our sadness following our mum's death. We continue to believe that our mum should not have been pushed by a police officer.

'Our family continues to miss our mum, sister, grandma and auntie, everyday.'

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said the force had referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

He added: 'The IPCC concluded the force used by the officer was reasonable necessary, proportionate and justified and there was no case to answer for misconduct.

'The jury at the inquest found that the force used by the officer was reasonable and necessary.'

Solicitor Nancy Collins, representing the family, said: 'The evidence from the inquest demonstrated the use of force by the officer which caused a 61-year-old frail woman to fall backwards off a step was one possible cause of her death.

'The jury concluded the police push was the cause of death but that the use of force was reasonable.'
