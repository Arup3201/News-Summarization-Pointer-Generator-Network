A schoolgirl was ‘groomed’ by a suspected paedophile as she sat in class using a taxpayer-funded iPad given to her by her teachers.

The underage girl watched live footage on the device of the man performing an obscene sex act while she was in a lesson.

According to the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, teachers were just yards away from her as the man then told her to go to the lavatory to make an intimate film of herself.

The alleged incident came to light after one of the girl’s friends told teachers that the teenager had been contacting the man, believed to be in this 20s, using Skype. Teachers then informed the girl’s parents.

The school, Honywood Community Science School in Coggeshall, Essex, was criticised when it spent nearly £500,000 on iPads for each of its 1,200 pupils.

The school’s head teacher has admitted letting the girl down. He has begun an investigation and police are involved.

Last night the girl’s mother said police had not yet interviewed their daughter, a week after the incident came to light, potentially leaving other children at risk.

She also complained about the school’s lax internet security and said its ‘independent learning’ approach allowed pupils to study on their own using their computer tablets, creating an environment in which abuse was possible.

The mother said: ‘I feel my child was groomed at the school. This didn’t just happen in the playground. This happened in the classroom over a number of days. It would still be happening now if my daughter’s friend hadn’t told a teacher.’

The girl's mother complained about the school’s (pictured) lax internet security and said its ‘independent learning’ approach allowed pupils to study on their own 

The girl told The Mail on Sunday that she had first had a conversation with the man on an adult social networking website, which she claimed was easy to access, while she was staying with a member of her family over the Christmas holidays.

She first told the man she was 16 when in fact she was under 16, and within a few days they had swapped naked photos of themselves.

The girl said that when she later admitted she was not 16 he told her he didn’t care and continued to groom her.

She said she continued to have explicit conversations with the man ‘daily’ during a number of classes after she returned to school. Breaching school rules, she spoke with the man through Skype, which allows people to talk to and see each other via an internet connection.

The traumatised girl said the incident in which the man performed a sex act occurred during a lesson in January. Another incident happened as she watched a friend at a school activity a few days earlier. This was witnessed by two other pupils, the girl claimed. Despite the school’s ban on the use of social networking sites, the girl’s parents claim pupils are not monitored and can easily bypass the school’s ‘parental’ internet controls.

Inquiry: Headmaster Simon Mason has admitted letting the girl down

The parents said that while their daughter had initiated the contact with the man outside of school, Honywood’s internet and safeguarding policies had failed. They said they would be withdrawing their daughter from the school and were considering legal action.

The mother said: ‘All we asked is that she was safe, protected and educated, and the school failed.’

Honywood’s ‘independent learning’ ethos means pupils are given minimal teaching and encouraged to learn though computers.

They are set tasks by adults the school describes as ‘facilitators’. There is minimal teaching, with pupils encouraged to research and learn through the iPads. A 2013 Ofsted inspection of the school rated it as good overall and outstanding for ‘behaviour and safety of pupils’.

The girl’s mother met head teacher and deputy head teacher on Wednesday. The head of year, the parents, the police and the girl are due to meet to discuss the issue.

Last night, head teacher Simon Mason said he accepted the school had failed. He said: ‘I hold the responsibility for what has happened to this learner.

‘When families send their youngsters to school, they can reasonably expect that our ability to protect youngsters from those who wish to exploit them is absolute.

‘The sad reality is that a determined young person, encouraged by an exploitative adult, can find ways around any system created by any school. Fortunately in this recent case, we were able to intervene before any physical harm came to the youngster.’ Mr Mason said that teachers did walk around during lessons and monitored pupils using their iPads.

It is understood the school is investigating whether the iPads’ security system, that should prevent pupils accessing banned websites, was not working because it had not been updated.

The school is to inform parents about the incident in a newsletter this week.

Essex Police declined to comment.
