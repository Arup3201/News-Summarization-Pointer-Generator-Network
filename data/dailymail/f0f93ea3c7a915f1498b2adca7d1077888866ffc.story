Flanked by court officers and dressed in a striped jump suit, them man who had been entrusted to babysit little Jersey Bridgeman the night of her death appeared in court today to be charged with her brutal rape and murder.

Zachary Holly, 28, is accused of killing six-year-old Jersey after abducting her in the middle of the night and dumping her body in a vacant house two doors down from the home she lived in with her two-year-old sister and mother.

Holly, his arm shaking, listened as rape was added to charges of capital murder, kidnapping and residential burglary.

Zachary Holly is escorted to a hearing in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2012 to appear in front of a judge where he was charged with killing 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman

Jersey, whose father and stepmother were jailed last year for chaining her to a dresser, disappeared from her bedroom in her home in Bentonville, Arkansas on Tuesday November 20th - after babysitter Holly had put her to bed.

The little girl had just started kindergarten after moving back in with her mother DesaRae Bridgeman and died of asphyxia or lack of oxygen, and physical evidence also showed signs of her being sexually assaulted, according to court documents.

Holly was ordered held without bond and assigned a public defender. Formal charges will be filed sometime before his next court date, scheduled for January 7th.

He didn't say anything to reporters as officers escorted him to and from the courtroom in Bentonville, a community about 215 miles northwest of Little Rock that's best known as the home of Wal-Mart's headquarters.

Jersey's death comes after a short life marred by abuse. Last year, her father, David Bridgeman, and stepmother, Jana Bridgeman, were arrested child abuse charges in the nearby town of Rogers.

David Bridgeman told investigators that he restrained the girl to keep her from getting into medication and other things in the house.

He is serving an 18-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in June to false imprisonment, permitting the abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor.

The stepmother is serving a 12-year sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation, after pleading guilty to the same charges.

Last week, Jersey's body was found in a vacant house adjacent to Holly's and two doors down from where the girl lived with her mother.

The night before her body was found, Jersey had been next door, where Holly and his wife, Amanda Holly, would often baby-sit Jersey and her younger sister, according to the court document.

The document said Jersey's mother, DesaRae Bridgeman, told police she went next door to visit the couple after she came home from work around 11 p.m. on Nov. 19.

'Afterwards, Zachary Holly carried Jersey home to DesaRae's house, while DesaRae carried Jersey's younger sister, and they placed the two children in the same bed,' Bentonville Detective Sgt. Kris Moffit wrote in the court document.

When DesaRae Bridgeman woke up the next morning, Jersey was missing from the bed where her 2-year-old sister was still sleeping, the court document said.

DesaRae Bridgeman looked around the house and then asked Zachary and Amanda Holly to help her before calling 911 to report Jersey missing, according to the court document.

Police searched the Bridgeman and Holly homes before an officer noticed the back door of a nearby vacant house was open. Officers entered the house and found the girl's body.

During an interview with authorities that day, Zachary Holly denied having anything to do with Jersey's disappearance or death, police said in the court document. They said he was cooperative and agreed to give detectives swabs of his check for DNA tests.

He also agreed to give detectives the clothes he wore the night before Jersey's body was found, according to the court document.

Bentonville Police Chief Jon Simpson didn't immediately return a phone message left Wednesday. Prosecutor Van Stone and public defender Jay Saxton declined to comment after Holly's hearing.

Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chain the girl to a dresser as punishment.

No one answered the door Tuesday at the mobile home where police say Holly and his wife lived, but Amanda Holly's family issued a statement through a lawyer Wednesday asking for privacy.

'Jersey was a very sweet girl who our children and grandchildren considered their best friend. Because of this, we ask for privacy. The children in our family are not dealing well with the loss of their friend,' the family said.

Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving.

'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.'

The woman who first contacted the police about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar.

Bridgeman's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house.

'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit.

The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead.

'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added.

Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor.

For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years.
