A brave grandmother of 10 held a burglar at gunpoint until police arrived, after she caught him breaking into her Washington State home on Wednesday morning.

Witnesses called Spokane police around midnight to report a break in at a local business, after they spotted Sean M. Denny, 35, flee on foot without a shirt.

Around 15 minutes later, the elderly woman, Sandy Mize, called 911 and told dispatchers that Denny kicked in her back door.

The woman says her first reaction was to grab her gun, which she keeps by her bed.

'I told him I was armed. He kept coming, so I started backing up,' Mize told Krem.com.

She
said she fired one round, which didn't hit Denny. Then kept her weapon 
pointed at him in her living room until officers arrived at her home.

'He
laid on the couch. I stood there for a very short period of time. I 
asked him, "Did I hit you?" There was no response. No movement.

'So I made my way to the telephone and dialed 911,' Mize told the news station.

Shot: The woman said she fired one round, which hit her door, pictured, not the intruder

According
to police, Denny tried to run when officers arrived but he was caught 
with the help of a police dog and taken into custody.

Police said the grandmother was 
within her rights to fire at Denny as she was in reasonable fear for her
life and wanted to protect herself.

They presented her with a Spokane Junior Police Badge for her bravery.

'You have to be prepared for anything. You don't get do-overs. You can't ask for a time out, so just do what you need to do,' Mize said.

Jail: Denny was booked into the Spokane County Jail, pictured, on $25,000 bond

Denny was charged with one count of 2nd degree burglary, one count of residential burglary, and resisting arrest.

Denny was booked into the Spokane County Jail on $25,000 bail after he was treated at a local hospital for his minor injuries.

Mize's neighbours were proud of the grandmother's gall.

'I think it's great,' neighbor Vicki Plastino told KXLY.com. 'She's wonderful. More power to ya woman. Don't mess with us old folk.'
