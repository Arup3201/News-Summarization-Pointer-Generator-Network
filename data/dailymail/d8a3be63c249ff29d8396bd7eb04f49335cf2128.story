Flatforms, which lack the discomfort of high heels or steep wedges, may be summer’s newest footwear trend – but they might also be the most dangerous.

Though the retro-looking lovechild of a flat shoe and a platform may feel comfortable, their inflexible elevated form makes walking on uneven surfaces a serious occupational hazard.

Vogue writer Liana Satenstein recently revealed that she tore a ligament after one of the many falls she has suffered while wearing flatforms, and in Japan, where they have been popular for many years now, flatform-related accidents are widespread.

Watch your step: Flatforms, the popular love child of a flat shoe and a platform, may look pretty sturdy, but their inflexible structure makes them tricky and dangerous to walk in, particularly on uneven surfaces

Yamuna Zake - a yoga instructor who specializes in 'foot fitness' and teaches classes on how to walk elegantly in high heels - suggests that better attention to weight distribution can help wearers master the art of the tricky flatform.

'Distribute your weight from your big toes to little toes so you are never keeping all your weight bearing into one point in your foot,' Ms Zake told Vogue.

'If you keep your weight in your heels, it is easier to keep the ankles from collapsing inward. This keeps the ankles strong and feminine while also preventing swelling.'

Origins: Flatforms are a later version of the iconic platform sneakers often worn by The Spice Girls, pictured in 1990

The flatform concept was first popularized in the 90s - most notably by The Spice Girls, who wore sky-high lace-up versions - although they didn't gain their new high-fashion hybrid name until they came back around in style three years ago.

They made another revival on this year's spring 2014 runways, with Tommy Hilfiger and Alice + Olivia among the designers to send them down the catwalk, and they have been spotted on the famous feet of Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Willow Smith, to name a few.

Suki Waterhouse - British model and current squeeze of Bradley Cooper - has even designed her own range of them for UK brand Superga.

Fans of the esteemed flatform, however, would be prudent to watch their step, in order to avoid falling victim - literally - to this current fashion fad.
