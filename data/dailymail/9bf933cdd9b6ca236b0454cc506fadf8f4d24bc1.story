Hundreds of Somali children are dying as they trek to the world’s biggest refugee camp amid the Horn of Africa’s worsening food crisis, the UN warned yesterday.

Elhadj As Sy, Unicef’s regional director for eastern and southern Africa, said many youngsters were so weak from starvation that they died before reaching the Dadaab camp in Kenya.

The overcrowded United Nations site houses more than 370,000 civilians who have fled Somalia’s civil war and a devastating drought which has left up to ten million at risk.

And Antonio Guterres, the UN's
high commissioner for refugees, said agencies must do what they can to persuade militant groups to allow them access to those badly affected.

As many as 12million east Africans 
have been hit by drought  - with Somalia thought to be the worst-hit - 
and are now in need of urgent help.

Thousands suffering from famine are now streaming towards the war-torn Somalian capital 
city of Mogadishu - despite fierce fighting between the Government and 
the insurgent group al-Shabaab.

The
rebels now control almost all of Somalia's centre and south and have 
refused to allow foreigners to work in their territory. However a 
spokesman for al-Shabaab said last week that they would be willing to 
allow in aid for the starving masses.

Yesterday, the head of the UN refugee agency said Sunday that 
drought-ridden Somalia is the 'worst humanitarian disaster' in the world
after meeting refugees who endured unspeakable hardship to reach 
the world's largest refugee camp.

Crisis: Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, has seen an influx of 61,000 Somalis since the beginning of the year - 20,000 of them in the last two weeks

The
Kenyan camp, Dadaab, is overflowing with tens of thousands of newly 
arrived refugees forced into the camp by the parched landscape in the 
region where Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya meet.

Sex And The City actress Kristin Davis visited the camp this weekend to meet refugees as part of her role as an ambassador for Oxfam.

She looked shocked as she met Somalians and heard how they had fled famine, in some cases walking for weeks.

She met Madina Farah Yusuf, who arrived at the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya a week ago after walking for 10 days with her seven children.

On the way she came across four other young children who had lost their parents. She took them in and brought them all to Dadaab, where they are now taking shelter under a tree.

She said: 'We left Somalia in fear 
our lives. There was so much hunger and war. Bandits robbed us of our 
food and clothes on the way. I found these four young children as we 
came. They were on their own as their mother had died of starvation.

'We brought everyone here (Dadaab) as
we thought we could get help. But we stay under this tree. It gets very
cold at night, and the children cry. We only have one blanket.'

The World Food Program 
estimates that 10million people already need humanitarian aid. The UN Children's Fund estimates that more than 2million children are 
malnourished and in need of lifesaving action.

Antonio
Guterres, appealed to 
the world to supply the 'massive support' needed by thousands of 
refugees showing up at this camp every week. More than 380,000 refugees 
now live there.

In 
Dadaab, Guterres spoke with a Somalia mother who lost three of her 
children during a 35-day walk to reach the camp. Guterres said Dadaab 
holds 'the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable of the 
vulnerable'.

The mother, Muslima Aden said: 'I became a bit insane after I lost them. I lost them in different times on my way.'

Guterres
is on a tour of the region to highlight the dire need. On Thursday he 
was in the Ethiopian camp of Dollo Ado, a camp that is also overflowing.

He said: 'The
mortality rates we are witnessing are three times the level of 
emergency ceilings.

'The level of malnutrition of the children
coming in is 50 percent. That is enough to explain why a very high 
level of mortality is inevitable.'

Dr Dejene Kebede, a health officer for UNHCR, said there were 58 deaths in camps in one week alone in June.

Most
of the deaths take place at the registration office and transition 
facilities of the refugee camps in the southeastern Dollo region of 
Ethiopia, the health officer said.

Up
to 2,000 Somali refugees are crossing the border into Ethiopia every 
day, UNHCR said. Thousands of families arrive in poor conditions often 
after walking for days in search of food.

Guterres
said the influx is overwhelming for UNHCR and other international and 
local aid organisations: 'Nothing can compare to what we have seen this 
month. I believe Somalia represents the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.'

The camps are full and lack capacity to provide the Somali people with food and shelter.

This
makes effective health treatment almost impossible, said Jerome 
Souquet, head of Doctors Without Borders at the Dollo Ado camps.

He said: 'We
can treat the severely malnourished children, but they will definitely 
come back to us underfed because there is not enough food and almost all
of them suffer from diarrhea.'

Habiba
Osman Ibrahim, a 76-year old Somali refugee from the 
al-Shabab-controlled Luk region of Somalia, said she walked for three 
days with her two underfed grandchildren. Al-Shabab is Somalia's 
dangerous militant group. It had forced out all international aid 
groups, but earlier this month said they could return considering the 
desperate conditions.

The
epicenter of the drought lies on the three-way border shared by Kenya, 
Ethiopia and Somalia, a nomadic region where families heavily depend on 
the health of their livestock. Uganda and Djibouti have also been hit.

The
World Food Program said it expects 10 million people in the Horn of 
Africa to require food assistance. WFP currently provides food aid to 6 
million people in East Africa.

Somalis
desperate for food are also overrunning Dadaab, the world's largest 
refugee camp in neighboring Kenya, which is seeing some 10,000 new 
arrivals each week, six times the average at this time last year.

The
U.N.'s refugee agency says Dadaab's three camps now host more than 
382,000 people, while thousands more are waiting at reception centers 
outside the camp.

Yesterday, a U.S. official revealed 
his fears that the Ethiopian Government might be underestimating its own
country's needs in the worsening famine crisis.

Officials
announced 4.5million Ethiopians needed food aid - a 40 per cent 
increase on last year - but aid agencies believe the actual number to be
higher. The three-country drought crisis is also devastating 
communities in Kenya and Somalia.

Jason
Frasier, mission director of US Aid in Ethiopia, said: 'We are 
concerned that we are underestimating the situation, especially in the 
southern provinces.'
