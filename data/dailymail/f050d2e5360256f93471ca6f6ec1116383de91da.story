Two airplanes narrowly averted a midair crash near the Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston this week in what was the second such incident in as many months.

A Singapore Airlines jumbo 777 flew within 200 feet vertically and about a half-mile horizontally - about eight football fields - of a Delta Air Lines A320 just before 7pm on Thursday.

Air traffic controllers caught the error and corrected the airplanes courses before they got any closer.

A Delta Air Lines Airbus A320, as seen here at Denver International Airport in 2010, was the plane that nearly collided with the Singapore Air 777. The incident was the second in as many months near the airport

The incident took place about 10 miles northeast of the airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which requires aircraft to remain separated at least a half-mile vertically and three miles horizontally, is investigating the incident, the Houston Chronicle reported.

'An air traffic controller noticed the deviation and issued traffic 
alerts and instructions to the pilots of both aircraft,' Lynn Lunsford of the FAA said on Saturday. 'The FAA is still
 determining the closest proximity between the two flights,

'As a result of a preliminary analysis of the 
event, the FAA has taken steps to ensure that all flight crews are aware
 of the top altitudes for standard departure routes,' he added.

The FAA in late May began investigating a similar incident that occurred in the skies above Houston in which two passenger jets came within a mile of each other earlier that month. An air traffic controller's mistake put one aircraft in the other's path.

That near-miss, in which the planes were 0.87 miles apart horizontally and 400 feet vertically, occurred about two miles southeast of the airport and involvedÂ  United Airlines Flights 601 and 437 just after takeoff.

The controller then issued instructions to separate the planes, officials said.

Audio from the control tower confirms that controllers asked Flight 437 to turn right immediately, while they told Flight 601 to 'stop your turn, stop your climb, stop your turn', according to CNN.
