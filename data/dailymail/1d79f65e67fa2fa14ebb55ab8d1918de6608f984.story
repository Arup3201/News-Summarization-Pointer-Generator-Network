Giant ‘cannibal’ slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across Britain, experts have warned.

Two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for Spanish slugs - an horrific, aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory.

The species, nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives, was first spotted in this country in 2012.

Sightings have since been reported in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, London and Hampshire.

But this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further.

Dr Ian Bedford, the expert who first identified the species three years ago, warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters.

‘If this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before May we could see very high numbers of the Spanish slug this year,’ he said.

Dr Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said the slug - which officially is called Arion vulgaris and originates in southern Europe - cannot survive extreme cold temperatures.

Common native slugs, although less aggressive, are much better at surviving cold conditions. Experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year, because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes.

The winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps, blizzards and frosts, which hit the new population of Spanish slugs hard.

But the intervening two winters have been much warmer, particularly in southern England which has barely seen any snow in 24 months.

The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C (39.9F), and the year before was even warmer at 5.8C (42.4F).

The average English winter temperature is 4.2C (39.6F).

The Spanish slugs, which are thought to have made it to the British mainland on imported vegetables, have been recorded feeding on dead mice, meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets. They also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners.

Unlike native species, they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them.

They also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs, so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly.

Dr Bedford said: ‘If you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water, add a bit of household bleach, and then bury the remains 18 inches deep.

‘If they spread it could really affect British farmers. We found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs.

‘If we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year.’

Anna Platoni, entomologist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year.

‘Although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity, it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important, rather than over the winter,’ she said.

‘They tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather.’

Sarah Fuller, marketing director at Wyevale Garden Centres added: ‘Slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners, making this hobby and pastime a true 24-hour activity.

‘Last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month.

‘It’s likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods.’
