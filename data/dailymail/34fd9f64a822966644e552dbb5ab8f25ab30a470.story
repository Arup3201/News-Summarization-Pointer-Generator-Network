The Warwick Rowing Club know how to perk up a Friday afternoon. 

The university students have just released the 2015 version of their naked calendar and there is no shortage of bare skin in sight.

As well as raising money for their rowing club, the men are also putting cash from the sales towards their charity - Sport Allies, which works to combat homophobia in sport.

Warwick University Rowing Club have released their fifth naked calendar. Previous editions have been sold in 77 countries and raised £200,000 

Five years ago, the rowers at Warwick University were just a middle-ranking sports club without the funding to repair their boats. 

Then in 2009, decided to release a naked calendar to raise some-much needed funds for repairs and new equipment. 

Since then it has gone on to be sold in 77 different countries and raised £200,000 for good causes. 

As well as the calendars, the boys now have their own range of posters, t-shirts, art prints, hoodies, and greeting cards. 

Laurie, a second year student at Warwick University said that they decided to start the Sport Allies charity to give something back to the people who bought the calendars in the first place. 

He said: 'It was really the gay market that was supporting the calendar and buying it and in turn supporting the boat club.

'Sport allies is about standing up and confronting homophobia in sport

'It’s a chance to really change things.

'Sport doesn’t have to be a homophobic environment and shouldn’t be a homophobic environment.' 

Sport Allies is an outreach programme for young people challenged by bullying, homophobia or low self-esteem. 

The charity already has support from senior sports figures like double Olympian and World Medallist rower Tom Solesbury. 

As well as going into schools, the rowing club plans to create online content accessible to young people all over the world, linked to resources that will tell them how to get the local support they need.
