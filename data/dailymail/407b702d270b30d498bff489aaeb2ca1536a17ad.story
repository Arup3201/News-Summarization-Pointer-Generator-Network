Jailed: Thomas Donelan, 20, from Levenshulme, Manchester was jailed for two years for the possession and supply of the Class A drug to Serena Harding, 16

A trio of young men who supplied ecstasy to a school girl who later died were sentenced today.

Twenty-year-old Thomas Donelan, who supplied the class A drug to Serena Harding, 16, was jailed while two others received suspended sentences in the incident.

Miss Harding, the daughter of a drugs counsellor, suffered a fatal heart attack when she took the rave drug last August.

The teenager from Warrington, Cheshire, had travelled to 
Manchester to see close friend Michael Millington and his pals Donelan and Dean Williams.

Miss
 Harding had taken the class A drug to impress Millington, 19, a 
medicinal chemistry undergraduate at Liverpool University, who boasted 
of his heavy drug use, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Lisa Boocock said: 'Serena indicated that she was willing to try it. She said she had never
 tried it and indicated that she was looking forward taking it.'

The court heard that Miss 
Harding and Millington were joined by Williams, 18, before they went to 
Donelan's house to buy MDMA, a pure form of ecstasy.

Miss Harding later collapsed at Reddish Vale country park and was found under a bench by a passer by who called an ambulance.

Millington
 had gone to get the teen some water, had told Williams to go home and 
then joined Serena in the ambulance which took her to hospital where she
 later died.

Miss Harding's devastated parents, Kenny and Diana Harding said today: 'Every day we ask ourselves "how can this be".

Everything to live for: Miss Harding's devastated parents said Serena was so loving and sometimes wise beyond her almost 17 years

'Serena filled all our hearts; she was 
so loving and caring and was sometimes wise beyond her almost 17 years. 
The tears we cry everyday are futile because she will never come home 
again.

'She should have been turning 18 this August. She would have been 
going to Uni, as she was expected to do exceptionally well at college.'

The fashion and design student had been on her first night out after being ill with a flare up of Crohn's disease all summer.

Sentenced: Dean Williams and Miss Harding's friend Michael Millington, not pictured, received suspended sentences for their part in the tragic incident

Miss Harding had suffered from the 
long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the 
digestive system and rarely went to parties or drank alcohol.

Tragically, the teenager had almost stayed at home because she had a job interview the next day and wanted to prepare for it.

He parents said: 'Serena just wanted to be like 
everybody else her age. We never thought for one moment that she would 
try any drugs because of her medical condition and she was always 
adamant that she wouldn't.

'We believe Serena got out of her depth and 
gave in to peer pressure.'

They added: 'You need ID for cigarettes and 
alcohol. Drug dealers don't ask for ID. They don't care how old you are.
 It's too easy for teenagers to get hold of drugs.'

Donelan, 20, of Levenshulme, Manchester, was sentenced to two
 years at a young offenders intuition for 
possession and supply of a Class A drug.

Williams of Brinnington, Stockport received a suspended sentence of six months in jail and
 250 hours unpaid work while Millington, of Lymm, Cheshire was sentenced
 to 12 month suspended sentence and 300 hours unpaid work for supply of a
 Class A drug.

Representing Donelan, Michael 
Lavery, said the young man had started to use illegal drugs due to the 'pressure' of studying for his A levels.

Mr Lavery said: 'His mother is severely disabled, he's 
her principal carer and he began to take the drugs as an escape and to 
assist him in studying for his A-Levels.

Mr Lavery told the court how Donelan and
 his mother had fled from London, from an abusive father and that 
Donelan witnessed many incidents of domestic violence.

Sentencing Judge Maurice Green, said: 'This is a tragic case for all concerned, the greatest tragedy clearly 
is that resulting from the death of a 16-year-old girl, Serena Harding.

'It's impossible to quite understand the devastation that her family must feel as a result of losing that young girl.

'All three of you must now understand that these drugs are not harmless - they are pernicious. As a result of your involvement with ecstasy a young girl died.'

'If ever there was any case which brings home the dangers of taking illegal drugs, this is it .There was a misguided understanding that it was harmless and enjoyable.'
