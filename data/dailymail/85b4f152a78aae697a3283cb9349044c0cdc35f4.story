Should the day ever come when I am asked to perform an after-dinner party trick, I have just the thing prepared: a word-perfect rendition of Master Of The House from the musical Les Miserables. All 125 lines of it.

If the assembled company want an encore — and they won’t, for I cannot sing in tune — I could also do I Dreamed A Dream, One Day More, Do You Hear The People Sing? and A Heart Full of Love.

If Les Mis weren’t to the party’s taste, I could do a medley of numbers from Cats, Oliver!, Miss Saigon, Phantom Of The Opera or any of a dozen West End musicals.

For there are few things I enjoy as much as a high-kicking, leotard-slinking, barricade-mounting, chandelier-crashing, helicopter-blade-whirring, big-budget West End musical.

Emily Blunt and James Corden also star. Freeman said the big show-stopper Children Will Listen makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up

While others may flee up the aisles at the first sign that an adorable urchin is about to break into song, I am slap-bang in the middle of the front row clutching my programme, tapping my foot to the music and singing under my breath.

It doesn’t have to be a stage show. A Disney or Rodgers and Hammerstein film — The King And I, The Sound Of Music — will do the trick. Or just the soundtrack listened to through headphones, causing least distress to others.

There has rarely been a better time to be a fan of musicals. We are enjoying a particularly purple patch. 

It was announced recently that producer Cameron Mackintosh is to make a new film of the musical Oliver! with star ballet choreographer Matthew Bourne.

Meanwhile, the musical adaptation of the film Made In Dagenham, starring Bond Girl Gemma Arterton as a factory worker crusading for equal pay, has been nominated for a host of awards at the Adelphi Theatre in London.

Cats has opened to rave reviews (‘Mi-wow!’, ‘Purr-fect!’ ‘The cat’s whiskers!’) at the Palladium, with The X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger singing Memory, the show’s big ballad.

The Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins has just opened at London’s Menier Chocolate Factory, starring comedian Catherine Tate.

Imelda Staunton — a veteran of Sweeney Todd and Guys And Dolls — is soon to arrive in the West End as Mama Rose in Sondheim’s Gypsy after an acclaimed run at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

An updated Annie with a hip-hop soundtrack opened in cinemas on Boxing Day, which was followed last week by Into The Woods, a film adaptation of another Sondheim great — the Broadway musical sending up traditional fairytales.

It stars Meryl Streep as the Witch, Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf, and James Corden and Emily Blunt as the hapless Baker and his Wife. Musical heaven!

I cannot remember a time when I didn’t love musicals.

The person to thank, or possibly blame, was the wonderful nanny, a proper Poppins, who came when I was three and my brother was one, and stayed for a decade.

She arrived, not descending from the sky holding a parrot-headed umbrella, but in a little white Vauxhall with a glovebox full of cassettes.

It was she who introduced us to the soundtracks of Les Mis (still my favourite), Cats, Oliver!, Kiss Me, Kate, Grease, West Side Story, My Fair Lady, Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Bugsy Malone, Evita and Blood Brothers. 

We listened to them on the school run until the tapes unspooled.

I have never, however, suffered the delusion of The X Factor auditionee. There was not a moment, even when I was very young, when I thought I could be Grizabella or Eva Peron, Tallulah or Nancy. 

Disney's Frozen, released in 2013 and starring Idina Menzel, is the highest grossing animated film of all time

But I have always loved listening to those who can sing the socks off an audience.

I was lucky to grow up in a decade when Disney produced some of its greatest musicals.

The Little Mermaid opened in 1989, when I was two. Beauty And The Beast followed in 1991 and Aladdin in 1992.

In 1995, The Lion King won awards for best score and best original song (Elton John’s Can You Feel The Love Tonight?) at the Oscars. Hercules was in cinemas in 1997, Mulan in 1998. 

And then, the studio went off the boil. Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Wall-E were all hits in the Noughties, but not one was a musical.

Disney didn’t come up with another film you could really sing-a-long to until Enchanted in 2007. Hollywood starlet Amy Adams plays Giselle, a cartoon princess who wakes up in modern Manhattan.

When Giselle sings an aria to summon the dear little birds and creatures of the forest in the traditional Disney princess manner, she finds herself surrounded by the city’s rats, mice, pigeons and cockroaches.

Amy Adams in Enchanted. Disney didn’t come up with another film you could really sing-a-long to until the 2007 film. Freeman went to see it in the cinema four times because the songs were so hummable 

The songs were so hummable I went to the cinema to see it four times — the only time I’ve made multiple trips to see one film.

I can understand why little girls today watch Disney’s latest musical Frozen dozens of times and sing its anthem Let It Go, which has been watched nearly 300 million times on YouTube, until their parents beg for mercy.

When it comes to the musicals that endure on stage, there is a curious truth: the more improbable the source material, the greater the success.

The writers of The Producers got it spot on when they imagined a pair of shysters putting on a musical about the rise of the Nazi party that is certain to fail, in order to make off with the investors’ money.

The best-laid plans inevitably go awry and Springtime For Hitler is a smash hit.

Les Miserables is based on a 1,200-page Victor Hugo novel about the wretchedness of the poor in 19th-century France.

Cats was inspired by a collection of children’s poems by T. S. Eliot, whose most famous work The Wasteland, an epic modernist poem, has baffled scholars for decades.

Oliver Twist, which inspired the musical Oliver!, is one of Charles Dickens’ nastier books. The death of Nancy is particularly brutal, and there’s not a word about singing milkmaids or dancing pickpockets.

The really great musicals — those that run for 25 years and sell hundreds of thousands of albums — have a peculiar alchemy of music and lyrics. They send you home singing.

When I saw Matilda, the fizzingly brilliant musical adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s book, I had the show’s big number, When I Grow Up, on my mind for weeks after.

Of the current crop, I had most been looking forward to Into The Woods. Last month, I inveigled my way into a screening.

I walked home afterwards, hardly noticing the Christmas shoppers, singing (quietly) to myself the whole way.

Sondheim’s score whips along. The lyrics are witty and ludicrous — only he would try to find a rhyme for ‘arugula’, a type of salad leaf. 

The big show-stopper Children Will Listen makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

I cried with laughter when, from the top of a waterfall, Hollywood pretty boy Chris Pine, playing a dim-witted Prince Charming, belted out Agony, a lament about being thwarted in the pursuit of his Cinderella.

It isn’t perfect. Depp is no tenor and nor is Corden. Meryl Streep, a veteran of the Abba musical Mamma Mia!, falls short of Bernadette Peters, who played the Witch in the first Broadway cast.

I’ve had the original album for years. Some of the songs — according to my computer — have been played more than 300 times.

The joy of a musical — and this is the test for all those opening in the coming months — is that it should send you home humming, tapping your feet and, in the best Gene Kelly manner, even swinging from lamp-posts while singin’ in the rain.
