London Fashion Week might be swiftly developing a reputation for sleek styling and wearable fashion but it appears some designers haven't got the memo.

From Sister by Sibling's oddball knits to KTZ's loo roll holder headgear and Yeachin Kim's condom shaped hat, there has been no shortage of bizarre looks appearing on the catwalk.

But although some of the Fashion Fringe and off-schedule designers have produced typically outlandish garb, other new talents, Felder Felder for example, appear to have raised their game.

Designer sisters Dani and Annette Felder produced a slick collection, dominated by rich burgundy hues and crammed with quirky riffs on the classic trench coat.

The packed out show had a glittering front row that included the Saturday's Mollie King, actress Mischa Barton and presenter, Zara Martin.

Also impressing the critics was the collection from Jena.Theo, which wowed with its sand-blasted prints in delicate blush and blood red.

Meanwhile hotly tipped young designer Christopher Raeburn, showed a characteristically sporty collection made - unusually - from Teflon.

More commonly found coating the bottom of non-stick saucepans, the designer nevertheless managed to use the material to produce neat two-piece skirt suits, along with several versions of his trademark parka.

Elsewhere, up-and-coming talent, Eudon Choi, referenced London's outlandish side by sending models down the catwalk in outfits accessorised with bizarre flower-filled headscarves.

The unwieldy headpieces lent a folksy vibe to delicately pretty dresses, wearable chunky knit jumpers and neat wide-leg slacks.

Choi later revealed that the inspiration for the collection had been David Lean's epic film adaptation of Russian novel, Dr Zhivago.

'Julie Christie, who played Lara in the film, was my muse,' said Choi, 'mixed with Russian folk costume, art and culture.'

Flower power: Eudon Choi's flower and fur filled headdresses certainly made an impression

Big seller? These two odd looking coats by KTZ are unlikely to have many takers
