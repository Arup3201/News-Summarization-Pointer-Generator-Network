Ombre may have been a big hair trend in 2014 thanks to super fans Vanessa Hudgens and Jessica Alba, but in the fickle world of fashion and beauty, it's already old news.

The latest quirky colour trend to be trialling is pixelated hair and, as the name suggests, it involves having pixel style graphics coloured onto your locks.

Pioneered in Spain by hair colourists Jose Luis Almendral, Marco Antonio Restrepo, and Jorge Cancer of Madrid’s X-presion Creativos, the look is making waves on social media.

A new Pixelated hair colouring trend is making waves in the beauty world after three Spanish hairdressers created it - beauty giant Revlon recreated the look for its campaign, pictured

The trio, who dub it the 'xpresionpixel' look, posted some snaps on their Instagram page and the beauty world seemed to approve. 

Square blocks of colour are soaked into the hair, before being blended and cascaded into one another to create the graphic effect. 

The colouring technique can either be subtle, using tones similar to your natural hair colour, or much more daring using clashing neon shades. 

According to Buzzfeed, the technique is infiltrating salons in Spain, London and New York.

In fact, beauty giant Revlon recreated the look for its campaign.

Speaking about the new trend, Rebecca Counsel, Art Director, HARE&BONE, said: 'The Pixelated Colour placement has been a growing trend in the hair industry for some months now. Colour is fast becoming one of the key style areas to really experiment with your look and create something individual. This colour trend is almost an evolution from ombre and the pastel tones that have been here, there and everywhere; we’re all becoming much more adventurous when it comes to colour which is really exciting.

'For me, the look is really inspired by digital prints and kaleidoscopic patterns on the catwalk for SS15 – from Elie Saab to Gareth Pugh. The structure of the pixelated placements also link back to 1970s video games which were an inspiration for Vivienne Westwood’s MAN SS15 collection.

'This look works best on short, straight and structured styles where movement and texture are minimal, that way you can really show off the colour and detail. I would also highly recommend playing with a trend like this that’s so transitional in the fringe area, that way it’s more of a temporary technique that can be grown out easily. For colour, suitability and placement I would recommend speaking to a professional colour technician and do not try to create this look at home!'.

Pioneered in Spain by hair colorists Jose Luis Almendral, Marco Antonio Restrepo, and Jorge Cancer of Madrid's X-presion Creativos salon, the look is gaining momentum 

Amy Fish, Colourist at George Northwood, added: 'This is for those cool kids who are a little bit over pink and blue dip dye and want to try something a bit more effective. It's not for everyone's hair type, and will look best when the hair is straight.' 

In other hair news, hacials - or hair facials - are taking off in salons.

Nioxin have launched Dermabrasion services for the scalp, which promise to remove build-up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation.

Aveda, meanwhile, have a Healthy Hair Service whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp's oil levels. 

They then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair, which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. 

The trio, who dub it the 'xpresionpixel' look, posted some snaps on their Instagram page to much acclaim
