A young woman is traumatised after a man ejaculated on her back in the middle of a mosh pit at a music festival.

The 20-year-old woman, only known as Emma, was enjoying listening to the band Thundamentals in a crowded mosh pit at the St Kilda Festival in Melbourne on Sunday February 8 at about 8.20pm when a man standing behind her performed the lewd act and then 'calmly' disappeared into the crowd.

The disgusted woman immediately took her top off, which is being forensically analysed by police, and asked a stranger to hold her wallet and phone while she went off to change her clothes.

'Everyone was jumping up and down on the ground along with the music so it was hard to tell if he was sort of going along with it or sort of doing something else, she told The Age.

'I just felt something on me and turned around and saw him doing up his fly.'

Detective Senior Constable Carin Wood said it was disturbing that someone would have the courage and desire to do such an inappropriate act in public.

Emma admitted to being really appalled by the bizarre incident.

'It's really gross, pretty disgusting, he must be sick in the head to do something like that,' she said.

Moorabbin Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team detectives are investigating the incident and have released a FACE image of a man they believe may be able to assist with their investigation.

He is described as being Indian of appearance and aged between 18-30, with a dark brown complexion, average build, short black hair and brown eyes with acne scars on his cheeks.

Detectives would also like to speak to a woman who held the victim's wallet for her while she changed her clothes.

Anyone with any information about the incident or the man responsible is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au
