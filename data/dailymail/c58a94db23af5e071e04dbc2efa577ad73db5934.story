Anderson Cooper‘s partner Benjamin Maisini is adding to his growing empire of New York drinking establishments with the opening of a new bar and restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen district of Manhattan.

The 5,000-square-foot restaurant will be located at 753 Ninth Avenue, in a neighborhood known of its prominent gay community.

The bar is a joint venture between Maisini and his business partner Pablo Raimondi who together own a company called Oxido.

Anderson Cooper’s involvement in the business is unknown although he could become a regular attraction at the new bar.

This latest joint will be their third opening. They already own two other bars in the city - Bedlam, a straight-friendly Victorian-themed cocktail bar and Eastern Bloc, a Russian-themed gay bar, both located in the East Village.

‘Finalizing this deal was a long process and sometimes very challenging – the former tenant Vintage Bar was there for 17 years and did not want to leave,’ James Famularo, a broker representing Oxido told The New York Observer.

Ninth Avenue is becoming increasingly desirable for bars and restaurants because of its location not far from Times Square and the Theater District.

French-born Maisani and CNN host Cooper have been dating since 2009, they live in a converted firehouse in New York City's West Village with their dog, Molly.

Anderson, who publicly came out last July, said of his decision: 'It just got to the point where
I've been torn for a long time between a desire as a reporter to just 
do my job and be known as a reporter and at the same time I do think 
visibility is important. 

'I do think that the tide of history only moves
forward when everyone is fully visible. I didn't want to send a message that there was anything I was 
ashamed about or unhappy about or not comfortable with.

'That was the 
main thing for me. I appreciate all the support I got and all the 
encouragement. I am the same person I always was, I do the job just the 
same way.' 

The couple briefly split last August after Maisani was spotted kissing another man in a public park, but less than two weeks later they had reconciled their differences and enjoyed a vacation together in Croatia.
