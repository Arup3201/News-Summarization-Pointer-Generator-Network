Police are draining three fishing lakes in their search for the weapon which was used to brutally murder a Saudi student.

Detectives are still on the hunt for Nahid Almanea's killer five days after the 31-year-old was stabbed 16 times and left to die as she walked along a quiet footpath in Colchester, Essex.

The crime bore similarities to another fatal stabbing in a Colchester park, leading to fears police could be up against a serial killer.

Today officers said they want to speak to a man who was wearing a distinctive beige Italian-style designer jacket near the crime scene on Tuesday.

Hunt: Police are draining three fishing lakes near where Saudi student Nahid Almanea was stabbed 16 times and left for dead in Colchester, Essex. It is the second brutal knife attack in public in the town in three months

Painstaking: The first lake was drained yesterday and the other two will be drained in days to come

Intensive search: Police are urging residents to look for any discarded knives or bloodstained clothing

DCI Steve Worron (pictured) said he wants to speak to a man wearing a designer jacket similar to this one

They released a photo of a similar jacket as officers led an 'intensive' fingertip search around three fishing lakes near the footpath where the student was killed.

Essex Police DCI Steve Worron said: 'We have received information from
 witnesses about a man who was seen on the Salary Brook Trail between 
10.20am and 10.40am, shortly before Nahid was found.

'He
 was walking from the direction of the university towards the Greenstead
 estate. He has not yet come forward and we urgently need to speak with 
him.

'He is described as 
being aged in his late teens to 30. He had very black, thick hair which 
was quite short and a two to three inch mop style on top. He was clean 
shaven, of average build, tanned appearance and was not wearing glasses.

'He was wearing baggy trousers, which may have been lightweight cotton.

'He
 was also wearing a very distinctive jacket which is described as being 
an Italian designer item, it was slightly longer than waist-length, had 
brown buttons up the front and two pockets also with buttons.

Police released footage believed to be Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke not long before her death

Police previously released descriptions of other men they wished to speak to over the 31-year-old's murder

'It was beige in colour, and had a belt which may or may not have had a buckle.

'We
 have issued a picture of a very similar jacket which we would ask 
people to look at â€“ although the material could either be suede as in 
the picture or leather.'

Earlier this week police released the haunting last known CCTV images of the victim, who was studying English language at 
Essex University.

She was wearing a full-length Muslim robe called an abaya and a 
hijab headscarf when she was attacked.

Police said they were looking into possibility she was targeted because of her headscarf, though later were keen to stress that there was no firm evidence to suggest she was.

Today officers drained the first of three fishing lakes near the murder scene.

DCI Worron said: 'One of the three fishing lakes close 
to the scene has been drained and specialist officers are now searching 
at that location for any items of significance to the police enquiry.

Forensics: Police near the murder scene today. Officers have told Colchester residents to be vigilant

Quiet: The footpath is on the outskirts of Colchester near the University of Essex

Police have used sniffer dogs in their search for the killer and have received several calls from the public

'The other two lakes will also be drained and searched.

'We
 are continuing to urge residents in Colchester to check their gardens, 
hedges, rubbish bins, and communal areas around flats for any trace of 
any discarded weapons or blood stained clothing or footwear.'

Similarities: James Attfield was killed in March

He said police, who are yet to find the murder weapon, are 'open-minded' about links between the student's death and that of James Attfield.

Mr Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in Colchester in March.

'Our advice to people is that we have 
now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where 
the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron.

'Against that background we 
would advise everyone in the town to remain vigilant.

'Both of these attacks were on lone people who were in locations where it appears no one else was nearby at the time.

'For
 that reason we would remind people to take sensible precautions to stay
 safe. This includes avoiding any situations in which you could find 
yourself isolated and alone in a public area.'

DCI Worron said police had received a large number of calls about yesterday's appeals, especially about a man who was seen running away from the footpath at 10.56am on Tuesday.

'Those calls are being followed up and we are conducting further house to house enquiries around that individual today,' he said.

However, he added there were still more people using the footpath on the morning of the murder who had not got in touch.

Police arrested and questioned two people this week over the murder - a 52-year-old man followed by a 19-year-old man - but eliminated both from their enquiries.

Witnesses should call Essex Police on 01245 282103.

'Our advice to people is that we have now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron. Pictured: An officer in the search
