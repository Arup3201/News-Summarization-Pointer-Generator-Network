At one point the men stumble within a few metres of a young girl sitting in a pram. 

One of the men appears to have a serious gash below his right eye, and blood can clearly be seen on his face.

The footage is filmed by a young male who shouts encouragement as the fight heats up, with the men landing blows on each other's head and body.

A number of passers-by stop to watch the scene unfold, until the arrival of gardai appears to break up the fight.
