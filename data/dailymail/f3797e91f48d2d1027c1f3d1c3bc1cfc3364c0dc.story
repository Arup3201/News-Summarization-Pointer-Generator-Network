A group of suspected extremists accused of plotting a terrorist attack on British police officers or soldiers have appeared at the Old Bailey.

Tarik Hassane, Suhaib Majeed, Momen Motassim, Nyall Hamlett and Nathan Cuffy all face charges of conspiracy to murder and the preparation of a terrorist act.

The men allegedly pledged their allegiance to Islamic State before buying a series of guns and carrying out surveillance on Shepherd's Bush Police Station and White City Barracks in London.

Prosecutors allege they saved images of Metropolitan Police officers from social media site Instagram and carried out covert meetings and discussions to forge their plot.

The charges detail that the group allegedly used code words for money, mopeds and firearms and had downloaded and circulated an extremist fatwa.

They are also alleged to have been in possession of extremist material, including a video of the beheading of Islamic State hostage Steven Sotloff, the US journalist.

Cuffy, Majeed and Motassim all face further charges of possession of ammunition and firearms with intent to endanger lives.

The weapons include a Baikal handgun, a Baikal IZH 79-8 self-loading pistol, an American double action.44 calibre gate loading revolver, a Rossi.38 special calibre revolver, a Victoria 1911.32 automatic calibre pistol and a Jieffeco 1920 6.35mm Browning calibre self-loading pistol.

The conspiracy is alleged to have taken place between July 8 and September 25 last year.

In total, prosecutors have brought 13 charges against the men, who all appeared via video link for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey this morning.

The court heard representations from each of the suspected terrorist's lawyers who agreed to serve various documents in time for another preliminary hearing on February 27, where all five are expected to enter pleas.

A trial, expected to last between eight and ten weeks, has provisionally been scheduled for June 10 at Woolwich Crown Court.

Mr Justice Wilkie said: 'It seems a sensible approach for everyone to be arraigned on the same occasion and there is no reason why that should not take place four weeks from now.'

All five defendants will appear via video link at the Old Bailey again on February 27.
