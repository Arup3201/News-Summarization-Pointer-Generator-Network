Breathtaking aerial photographs have revealed isolated communities in some of the most remote areas of Africa.

Canadian photographer Joel Krahn witnessed  villages, pastures and lone huts while flying over isolated regions in Kenya, Sudan and Nairobi this year.

The 25-year-old captured beautiful images of incredible landscapes and evidence of civilisation across the remote plains of Africa during journeys between locations for a non-profit company.

Hobby: The Canadian photographer worked for missionary group Africa Inland Mission for three months

'I was assigned to some remote places while I was there and had to fly around in small aircraft a lot of the time,' says Joel.

'I probably spent more than 25 hours cramped into the co-pilot's seat gazing out the window.

'The African landscape is vastly different from vistas I am used to seeing flying in Canada. And after flying for hours and hours over parched land, I wondered how anyone could live there.

'But sure enough, whenever I looked for it, I could see evidence of civilization, whether it was a hut, a road, or the outline of a pasture.' 

Remote: Krahn spent over 25 hours flying in small aircraft to remote places and took photographs, such as this of a Kenyan river, during his journeys

Beautiful: The photographer witnessed some incredible landscapes - this image is of the Didinga Hills, South Sudan

Joel worked for missionary group Africa Inland Mission from May to July and captured the beautiful collection of aerial landscapes as he flew back and forth to rural locations.

The pictures show scenes such as the Nile River weaving its way through South Sudan, the luscious green Didinga Hills and sprawling rural villages in Kenya and South Sudan.

Joel said: 'I love the patterns and abstract graphics that aerial shots show. It's a much different perspective from above than it is from the ground.

'When you're on the ground, you see only a small portion of what you're part of and can easily lose sight of the larger picture.

'But from above, you see that you are indeed just a small part of something much bigger.

'There's so much to this world, and we often focus on only ourselves. Broadening your world view can really impact and enrich your life.'
