Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was clearly in awe of the company he was in on Thursday night - taking the opportunity to have a selfie with American rapper French Montana and Scott Disick.

Wilshere, who has been out of action for three months after injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November, admitted he rarely asks to have photo with people - but clearly broke his rule for Montana and Disick.

On Instagram he said: 'Not many people I would ask for a selfie....but @letthelordbewithyou has to up there' #Lad #Legend.

Disick - whose long-term partner is Kourtney Kardashian - features regularly in the American TV programmes 'Kourtney & Khloe Take the Hamptons' and 'Khloe Take Miami', while Montana used to date Kourtney's sister Khloe.

Wilshere was taking some time out to relax from a gruelling training schedule as he eyes a return to the Arsenal first team early in the new year.

He posted a picture of him training hard in the gym on Thursday with a protective boot on as he continues his recovery from his ankle injury.

The diagnosis for the England midfielder's injury was three months out, with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger recently confirming Wilshere is 'progressing as planned'.
