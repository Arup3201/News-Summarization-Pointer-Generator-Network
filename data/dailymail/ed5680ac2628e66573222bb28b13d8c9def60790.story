This was the scene as hundreds of travellers arrived in a quiet village before packing out the parish church for a funeral service.

More than 1,200 mourners descended on Aldermaston in Berkshire with a cortege consisting of six stretched limousines, three horse-drawn carriages and five flatbed trucks covered in flowers.

Traffic police were called to the roads surrounding St Mary the Virgin Church as huge crowds arrived to pay their respects to Brian Frankham, a prominent member of a nearby traveller community.

After the service, many of the travellers are said to have moved on to a wake seven miles away. Mr Frankham is believed to have lived on a travellers' site in the parish

The procession was led by a man riding a white horse, followed by three horse-drawn carriages - one of which contained the coffin. A crowd of about 200 people followed the cortege before meeting hundreds more at the church.

One floral tribute showed what appeared to be a brown shotgun and red cartridges on a background of white flowers, along with the words 'Dangerous Brian'.

Another message of condolence said: 'Uncle Brian. Someone special. Wonderful memories woven in gold. This is a picture I tenderly hold. Dearer still as the years depart.'

Eyewitnesses described seeing crowds of people attending the service with dozens of cars parked up on side roads in the area. After the service, many of the travellers are said to have moved on to a wake seven miles away.

Parish council chairman Dave Shirt said Mr Frankham was part of a community that lived in a travellers' site within the parish boundaries.

Many of the pubs closed for lunch as the funeral service took place. Earlier, hundreds had followed a cortege as it made its way into the village

He said that the council rarely had any contact with Mr Frankham, who, he said, had changed his surname a number of years ago.

Councillor Shirt said pubs near the church closed at lunchtime, adding: 'I was talking to a traffic police officer who said there were 1,200 people. There were lots of cars swamping the village and blocking the roads.

'It was quite a spectacle to see the culture of their community with so many people and the way they did things and the use of the horses. It was well worth seeing.

'They went off to the wake seven miles away from us afterwards. I have not heard anything since then.'
