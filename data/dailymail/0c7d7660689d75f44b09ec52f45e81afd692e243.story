A controversial late-term abortion provider has been captured on video recorded by an undercover pro-life activist comparing a fetus to 'meat in a crock pot.'

The footage made public Wednesday by the anti-abortion group Live Action was secretly taped on two separate occasions by two pregnant women who came to the Nebraska clinic of Dr LeRoy Carhart in December and March pretending to seek third-trimester abortions.

Carhart, one of only four physicians in the country currently performing late-term abortions, is heard on the recording laying out the gristly details of the procedure, explaining to his would-be patients that he will inject a shot into the fetus that will make it get 'soft' and 'mushy.'

Busted: Dr LeRoy Carhart (pictured) was recorded telling undercover anti-abortion activities posing as would-be patients that their fetuses would turn 'mushy' like 'meat in a Crock-Pot'

Pro-life crusade: The videos were made as part of a national campaign targeting abortion providers like Carhart

At one point, the doctor, seated at a desk in his office, compares the unborn baby to 'meat in a Crock-Pot,' and he later jokes that he has a toolkit containing a 'pickaxe' and a 'drill bit' to remove the remnants of the dead fetus from the womb.

A first portion of the video was recorded on the morning of December 7, 2012. It begins with the Live Action undercover activist entering Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska, with a large poster hailing the doctor as a 'hero' hanging on the wall of the waiting room.

The unnamed woman, who is described as being 22 weeks pregnant at the time of the sting operation, is ushered into the doctor’s office and is seated opposite him.

In response to the patient's inquiry regarding the procedure, Carhart explains that the fetus in her womb would be injected with a shot through her stomach , which is supposed to kill it and induce birth.

'If everything works right, they come out-you just deliver them and they come out fine,' he says.

Gristly details: Carhart explained to his 'patient' that he would inject the fetus in her womb with a shot that would kill and induce delivery three days later

'If, for some reason, that doesn't happen, then we have to take them out in pieces.'

When prompted by the undercover pro-life activist, the physician explains that the medicine injected into the unborn baby kills it and the fetus turns 'soft - like, mushy,' allowing the mother to 'push it through.'

The bogus patient inquires what exactly makes the fetus soft, to which Carhart responds: 'the fact that it's not alive for 2 or 3 days.'

He then adds, 'It's like putting meat in a crock pot, okay? it gets softer It doesn’t get infected...'

Carhart has been in the news in recent months following the tragic death of his patient Jennifer McKenna Morbelli.

Small club: Carhart is one of only four doctors currently providing late-term abortions in the US

Locations: Dr Carhart operates two clinics in Nebraska and Maryland

The 29-year-old teacher from upstate New York, traveled to Carhart's clinic in Germantown, Maryland, in February to terminate her pregnancy at 33 weeks after it became apparent that her fetus had developed abnormalities.

Following a complex multi-day procedure, the 29-year-old married woman allegedly suffered a ruptured uterus and passed away from massive internal bleeding in a nearby hospital.

Although the circumstances of the woman's death remain unclear, the pro-life community has rallied around the tragic case, accusing Dr Carhart of being directly responsible for Morbelli's death.

Dr Carhart, 69, one of only four physicians in the country who openly perform late-term abortions, has been in the cross-hairs of pro-life groups since 2005, when another patient of his died after having her pregnancy terminated.

 Carhart had been practicing in Nebraska until 2010, when the state banned abortions performed after the 20th week.  After that, the doctor began traveling to the clinic in Germantown to provide his services.

Pro-life activists have been picketing the clinic for the past three years, carrying signs and even trying to talk Carhart's patients out of doing the procedures on their way into the office.

In March 2013, just weeks after McKenna 
Morbelli’s death, the pro-life Live Action group sent in another 
undercover activist who was 26-weeks pregnant to inquire about 
performing an elective late-term abortion, emphasizing that there is 
nothing wrong with the baby.

The physician once again explains on tape how the baby would get 'mushy' like 'meat in a Crock-Pot' after being injected with a shot.

First public comment: Dr Carhart told an activist pretending to be a patient that Jeniffer McKenna Morbelli died from complications unrelated to her abortion

He then goes on to describe how if 
the woman is unable to deliver the fetus on her own, the medical staff 
will take out the baby from her womb with a 'toolkit,' adding jokingly 
that his arsenal includes 'a pickaxe, a drill bit.'

When the woman expresses concern that she might go into labor in her hotel room, Carhart tells her that she could call him rather than 911, and his staff would come, take away the dead fetus and help 'clean up the mess.'

Towards the end of the consultation,   Carhart briefly addressed Morbelli's case, marking the first time that he has publicly commented on the woman's passing.

The 69-year-old doctor tells the woman seated in his office that the 29-year-old deceased patient had a 'allergic reaction' to her pregnancy that was unrelated to the abortion procedure, adding that her fetus had severe abnormalities.

According to an initial finding by the Maryland Medical Examiner's Office, McKenna Morbelli died of natural causes and suffered a rare complication during delivery.

The video released Wednesday by Live Action is part of a national campaign meant to expose abortion providers as baby killers. So far, the group has made three undercover recordings targeting doctors.

The organization claims the videos show that doctor are willing to kill babies in violation of the federal Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which requires them to try and save a child born alive during a failed abortion.

Live Action's edited video does not show Carhart addressing this issue, however on extended transcripts obtained by The Washington Post, the doctor says repeatedly that he would follow the law and do everything to save the baby.The 69-year-old physician also offers his patients alternatives to abortion, including adoption and foster care.
