Arsenal target Sami Khedira says he cannot see himself leaving Real Madrid in January.

The Germany international is out of contract in the summer and has so far failed to agree terms on a new contract. He is free to talk to foreign clubs in January and Madrid want an answer otherwise they will look to sell rather than lose him for nothing.

However, Khedira said: ‘Right now, I cannot see any reason why I would leave the club this winter.’

Arsenal target Sami Khedira says he cannot see himself leaving Real Madrid in January

Talking to Germany’s Kicker magazine, he added: ‘Real Madrid is a great club to be at. This club has a place in my heart and there is absolutely no reason for me to say that I want to or have to leave.

‘I get the feeling I am still wanted (by coach Carlo Ancelotti).’

The 27-year-old recovered from tearing his knee ligaments to play a part in Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League triumph, yet he took the bold decision to drop out of the World Cup final less than two months later when beset by another injury.

‘I would make the same decision if I had to again,’ Khedira said. ‘But the moment I realised that I could not play - that was by far the toughest and saddest moment of my career.

‘I had to fight with my body, my condition and with myself as a person,’ Khedira said. ‘I was just really empty and drained. I needed a bit of time before I really recovered.’

Khedira made two brief appearances in Real’s first two games of the season before a muscular injury ruled him out for six weeks.

He has since made two substitute appearances in La Liga, but was left out of Ancelotti’s squad for the win over Rayo Vallecano last weekend, raising doubts that he had a future at the club.
