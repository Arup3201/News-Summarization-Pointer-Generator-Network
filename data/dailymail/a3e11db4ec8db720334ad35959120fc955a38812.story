A tiny deer weighing the same as a bag a sugar has been rescued from a back garden after being abandoned by its mother.

The muntjac, appropriately named Snowflake because it was found in icy conditions, was discovered outside a home in Sible Hedingham, near Colchester, Essex.

The owner took the freezing fawn to a nearby wildlife centre and staff there have been looking after him ever since.

Snowflake is smaller than a cat and weighs just 2.2lb - about the same as a bag of sugar

It is believed the deer became separated from his mother shortly after birth and was too small to keep up with her.

The
man who found him said that he could hear the mother calling in the 
distance but thought it best to take the animal to the Wildlives Animal 
Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre.

The newborn deer was in shock and could have died as temperatures plunged below freezing in East Anglia.

Rosie Catford, from the animal rescue centre, said they would hand rear Snowflake until he is able to take care of himself.

The deer will be released into the wild close to where he was found when he is five or six months old.

Ms Catford said: 'Snowflake was born in 
the snow. Deer tend to give birth and then leave the fawn in the 
undergrowth and return to feed it.

'We always say that if you find a fawn
on its own then that's normal. But this chap rang the RSPCA to say he 
had a deer in his garden and he was worried about it and had put a 
blanket on it.'

'We told him to remove the blanket, then he rang back and said he was still concerned and sent a photo which showed it had actually collapsed.

'The little deer was in trouble and so we are assuming that his mother had just given birth because he is relatively newborn. It was a bit of a shock to the system to be dropped like that into the snow.

'He just wasn't strong enough to follow his mum into safety and now he's been handled there's no way she would take him back.

'Snowflake's not strong enough to stand up yet - he only weighs a kilo and is smaller than a cat.

'But he's doing well and is being bottle-fed with a milk formula now and should be fine.'

Snowflake was found in a residential garden in Sible Hedingham, near Colchester, Essex on Sunday
