Jeremy Clarkson's replacement on Top Gear might not be too far away after Zenit St Petersburg manager Andre Villas-Boas showed he's enough of a petrolhead for the job.

Former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss Villas-Boas posted a photograph of himself on Instagram behind the wheel of a 1958 MG A roadster on Thursday morning.  

Villas-Boas's love of motors is no secret. He first told of his passion when in charge of Chelsea, revealing he owned five bikes and shares 12 vintage cars.

'It feels fantastic,' Villas-Boas said. 'You feel the need for it. Driving is very adrenaline-fuelled and it makes me feel good. We all have our passions and respond in different ways.

'It has been a lifelong passion. My first bike was a 350cc heavy engine. I took my licence and drove it in a national competition in Portugal – then I broke my arm so I was out. 

'I was coaching Porto youth at the time. The first bike was a Yamaha XT 350, then I had Hondas then a couple of KTMs. I have a couple of them now.'

Villas-Boas also hopes to one day take part in the Dakar Rally which is now held in South America.

'I have a couple of bikes from the Dakar Rally that I own,' he added. 'One is for my collection, the other I ride it. I am a bit of a "crazy head" so I have enduro-bikes as well. I go into mountains with the big rocks and almost kill myself. I have a couple of trials bikes and cars with different owners, because we have an extension collection and split ownership of them.'

Villas-Boas is currently the manager of Zenit St Petersburg who are in the Europa League quarter-finals

Villas-Boas could have done with going on a long drive following his team's 1-0 defeat by Torino in the second leg of their Europa League last-16 tie.

Zenit still qualifed for the quarter-finals with a 2-1 win on aggregate, but Villas-Boas's touchline row with the Torino bench soured the match. 

'I lost my head,' he told Sport Mediaset. 'I got it completely wrong and I apologise for my behaviour. I was angry with the Torino team manager, but it was not the behaviour of a coach and I am sorry.'
