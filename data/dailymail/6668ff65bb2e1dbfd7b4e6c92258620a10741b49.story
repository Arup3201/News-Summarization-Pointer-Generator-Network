Police in China are trying to unravel a bigamy case that resulted in three children being poisoned to death.

The three victims were a boy and two girls  who ate the poison at the family home in Xinglong Village in the Ningxia autonomous region.

A fourth child, a girl, survived the ordeal.

Following a police probe lasting 40 days, officers discovered the killer was the second woman in a bigamous relationship, and the mother of two of the girls that died.

The boy was the grandson of the first wife, who was also mother to the girl who survived.

Yang Juan, 35, is the illegal second wife of Zhao Fu, 48, who fathered three of the four children with the two women living in his home - a serious crime under China's strict one-child-only law.

Police said Fu had been taken ill after marrying his second wife and that had put strain on his relationships.

Despite that, to others in the village, the whole family 'seemed to live happily together' in the village Xinglong in Tongxin County in north-western China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

But dark passions were bubbling under the
 surface of Yang Juan. She plotted the murder of the children because 
she was jealous of wife number one Wan Mai, 43.

Police say she hid the poison purchased from a pharmacy in the wall of their garden and brought it out in March to murder the youngsters.

'We cannot understand why she acted so brutally against innocent children, especially killing her own, we suspect that she may have poisoned her own children with a lesser dose to deflect the blame, but still ended up giving too high a dosage,' said a police spokesman.

'There is only one child now and a grieving mother and father.'

Her husband also faces charges of bigamy and breaching China's one-child policy, while Yang Juan will almost certainly face a firing squad for murder.
