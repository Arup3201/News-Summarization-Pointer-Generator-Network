Nestled among moss-covered rocks, these forgotten pillboxes, gun batteries and tank traps are forlorn reminders of how drastically Britain's coast changed to stop a Nazi invasion.

Many of the Second World War defences captured by photographer Marc Wilson now blend in with their surroundings, dangling precariously over the sea or being split in two by the forces of nature.

Mr Wilson, 46, travelled 23,000 miles to photograph 143 forgotten coastal relics across Britain, as well as northern France, Denmark, the Channel Islands, Belgium and Norway.

Forgotten: Photographer Marc Wilson has documented the abandoned war defences littering Britain's coast. Left: Studland Bay in Dorset, where a full-scale D-Day rehearsal took place in April 1944. Right: Concrete tank defences in the forests near Lossiemouth, Moray

Moss: Long since abandoned, the 1892-built Verne Battery on the Isle of Portland in Dorset stored field guns and housed ammunition in preparation for the D-Day landings. It also became an anti-aircraft artillery battery. Portland stone was used to build the Cenotaph in Whitehall

He researched the sites meticulously on the internet - and once he got there, he often found the places he was photographing were not even well-known among  locals.

Mr Wilson, a father of one from Bath, told MailOnline: 'I've been a photographer for 15 to 20 years and I'd often come across military topics in my work. Like most people in England my family has a wartime history and I decided it was something I wanted to look at more closely.

'My family came from Poland, Romania and Switzerland so they were all caught up in the conflict. Another member of my family flew in the RAF. Somehow, as a photographer, I think this is my act of remembrance.

'I started with a simple Google search and moved on to literature and other sources to find the wartime remains.

'Some of them are very well-known but others were a lot harder to find. It was important to me to find more subtle ones, which people either didn't know about or which blended into the landscape.' 

Camouflage: A pillbox among rocks at St Michael's Mount, Cornwall, a strategic defence since the time of the Spanish Armada. In 1940, it was again garrisoned and fortified with a light anti-aircraft battery and three pillboxes made deliberately to blend with their surroundings

Left: Essex's Dengie peninsula had to be  defended, as it would have offered invaders a short passage to London bypassing the Thames and the Medway. Right: In Studland Bay, wartime defences have become overgrown and almost completely hidden by trees near the water line

Cracked: The elements had hewn this German defence in two at Wissant, northern France. The Nazis believed the Allies would regard Wissant, the closest point on mainland Europe to the English coast, as an ideal beach for an invasion. This defence was removed in 2013

For one shot, a never-used pillbox by the sea in Dorset's Studland Bay, the tide had to be just high enough to touch the concrete base - but not high enough to drown Mr Wilson.

'It was viewable from a beach but it wasn't easy,' he said. 'I had to do a lot of research. A fully high tide would've cut me off completely and once I had the shot it was a case of grabbing my tripod and running.'

Another image, shot from the site of the D-Day landings in northern France, shows the temporary harbour structures which allowed the landings to happen 70 years ago and which still float undisturbed within sight of the coast.

At St Michael's Mount in Cornwall, a pillbox appears almost completely camouflaged among oblong grey rocks on an overcast day.

In Portland, Dorset, Mr Wilson captured the Verne Battery - built in 1892 beside what would be the world's largest man-made harbour. Used in the First World War, it was expanded after 1939 and used to house ammunition used in the D-Day landings. 

And in Lossiemouth, Moray, a line of concrete anti-tank defences are themselves covered in moss, stretching to the horizon through the forest along a line  sliced through the trees.

Grim: This fortification at Abbot's Cliff, part of the famous white cliffs of Dover in Kent, would have been a crucial lookout for enemy planes

Striking: On the other side of the Channel, at Arromanches les Bains, the British built a floating harbour which was used for ten months, landing 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies. It can still be seen today as distant black specks in the water

Travelling far and wide: Flekkeroya, Norway (left), where German soldiers built a huge coastal fortress preventing Allies from using the Skagerrak - the stretch of sea between Norway and Denmark. Mr Wilson (right) travelled 23,000 miles for his project and spent £16,000

Some of the locations are no longer in sight - either submerged by the shifting sands and waters or by more human intervention. Some, especially on the continent, were destroyed by the governments of the countries Mr Wilson was visited.

Others are barely visible - blending into the landscape so well that it is a struggle to see them.

The £16,000 project was made possible after almost half the total was raised through online crowdfunding.

Mr Wilson thanked the donors, adding: 'It was incredible to get the funds. I think it's a subject matter that touches everyone, and that made me realise how important it was to follow through with the project'. 

The images, which first appeared in a touring exhibition last year, are now being published together for the first time in Mr Wilson's book, The Last Stand.

Mr Wilson added: 'These man-made objects and zones of defence now sit silently in the landscape, imbued with the history of our recent past.

'Some remain proud and strong, some are gently decaying. Many now lie prone beneath the cliffs where they once stood.

'Whilst I capture the individual beauty of these objects in their landscapes, the series of photographs becomes much more than a set of traditional landscapes. My aim is that the collection will become a permanent photographic record of the past.' 

The Last Stand (2014) is published by Triplekite and is available for £35.
