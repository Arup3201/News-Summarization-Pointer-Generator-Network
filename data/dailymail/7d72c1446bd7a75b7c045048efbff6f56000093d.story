A United Airlines flight experienced severe turbulence on Monday afternoon injuring two passengers and three crew members. The flight landed safely and no one was killed.

Passenger Bill Dahlin spoke of hearing people scream and of hearing a woman call out for her baby

The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot, 'declared a medical emergency after a flight attendant was injured by turbulence. The plane landed in Billings without incident.'

A United Airlines spokeswoman said the airline would do all that it could to investigate the incident so that it does not occur again.

'Our primary focus is assisting our employees and passengers who were injured, and our flight safety team will review what happened,' the spokeswoman said.

CNN reports that there were 114 passengers on board and five crew members.

Two passengers and three flight attendants were taken to the hospital and all were treated and released except for one flight attendant.

Passenger Bill Dahlin spoke to KTVQ about the frightening experience.

'There was a lot of screaming, a lot of hollering,' Dahlin told the station.

'I was scared,' said passenger Grant who was traveling with his mother Laurel

He said that passengers were surprised by the sudden drop and that the crew was equally troubled.

'I think they were somewhat panicked,' said Dahlin.

'I think they were trying to assess things themselves so they really didn't offer any explanation because of what happened so quickly,' he continued.

He explained how one female hit the ceiling of the plane so hard that it cracked.

'I have flown a lot, and I do know you run into things like this,' Dahlin said. 'This [turbulence] happened to be a lot rougher than what I'm accustomed to.'

'The flight crew probably was in the same boat we were,' said Grant's mother Laurel

Passenger Joe Frank, 20, told The Denver Post that the plane dropped violently and he heard a loud bang.

He said a baby was propelled out of a parent's arms and landed in a seat nearby, but the infant didn't appear to be hurt.

'I didn't have my seat belt on, so I hit my head pretty hard but what hurts is my lower back and hips,' he said.

Ktvq also spoke to a a passenger named Grant who traveled with his mother Laurel.

'I was scared. It was really scary,' said Grant

'The flight crew probably was in the same boat we were,' said Laurel.

The airline will continue to investigate the incident further.
