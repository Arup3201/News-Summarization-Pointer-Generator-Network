In agony: Andy Norman, 33, is on high doses of morphine in an Icelandic hospital as he tries to cope with the excruciating pain of frostbite

A polar explorer whose charity 
trek across the Greenland ice sheet turned to tragedy has been left in 
agony due to the severe frostbite he suffered, his best friend said 
today.

Andy Norman, 33, of Bracknell Forest 
near Ascot, was one of three men whose tent was ripped apart as storm 
winds of up to 95mph howled across the barren, frozen landscape.

His companion on the trek, Philip 
Goodeve-Docker, 30, froze to death before rescue teams were able to find
them, and he and third team-member Roan Hackney are being treated for 
frostbite.

Mr Norman was last night on high doses
of morphine to numb the excruciating pain of his injuries as he 
recovers in an Icelandic hospital, said his friend Georgina Lilley from 
Wokingham.

She told the Evening Standard: 'I 
spoke to him last night and he was in a lot of pain. He had asked them 
to lower his morphine dosage and I could tell he was in pain.

'It’s very typical of him because he 
is very fit and health conscious. I expect he will recover quicker than 
most and might even be back in a week or so.

'He just wants to get home but so far we don’t know for sure when that’s going to happen.'

The IT worker and his two companions 
had been on a 370-mile unsupported trek across Greenland's frozen 
interior to raise money for charity when they were caught in 
unexpectedly bad weather.

Fierce winds ripped away part of the 
tent, leaving the three men exposed to the freezing gale and 
temperatures plummetting to minus-35C. They radioed for help, but it 
took rescue teams 24 hours to find them.

Mr Goodeve-Docker, of Ealing, West London, who had dubbed the trip a 'frankly nutty adventure' died before help arrived.

Chief Inspector Paul Pitersen, of 
Greenland police, said: ‘By the time we got to them Mr Goodeve-Docker 
had frozen to death. They were very unlucky. They were simply in the 
wrong place at the wrong time.’

Tragic: Philip Goodeve-Docker, 30, froze to death after being caught in a bitter storm in Greenland

Mr Norman and Mr Hackney, the team 
leader, from New Cross, London, who was initially left in a coma, were 
discharged from intensive care in a Greenland hospital on Monday.

Mr Norman's parents were today by his bedside after travelling to Iceland.

Mr Goodeve-Docker's family, from 
Stockbridge, Hampshire, have so far been too upset to comment, but they 
wrote on his Facebook page: 'On Sunday morning we had a phone call to 
confirm that Philip sadly died.

'To our son, brother and friend, we 
are so glad that you were on your adventure and expedition that you had 
wanted to do for so long.

‘You will be unbelievably missed.’

Ambition: The trio were crossing the Greenland ice cap with two friends on a 'trip of a lifetime' when the group got into trouble

Mr Goodeve-Docker, who was embarking 
on his first trip and had been ‘training furiously’, wrote about the 
dangers of one of the most ‘deadly landscapes in the world’.

The events manager estimated the trek 
from east to west across the Greenland ice sheet, the world’s second 
largest, would take 30 to 35 days.

He wrote: ‘We will travel 550-600km 
across one of the most dazzling,  beautiful, yet barren and deadly 
landscapes in the world, dragging all our own supplies (between 
100-135kg).

‘This is one of the great polar 
challenges, through which we face such dangers as polar bears (not cute 
and cuddly), crevasses up to 500+ metres deep, polar winds, temperatures
of 5C to -50C, plus the horror of three men with one tent and no 
washing.

‘Part of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.’

Mr Pirie-Gordon, who had helped fund 
polar exploration as treasurer and honorary vice-president of the Royal 
Geographical Society, was also treasurer of the QNI (Queen’s Nursing 
Institute), the charity for which his grandson hoped to raise money.

More than £5,000 worth of donations continued to pour into his JustGiving charity website yesterday.

One person wrote: ‘Would have paid any money to have you back my friend, still can’t believe you are gone.’

Another added: ‘In memory, you made a difference and lived large!!’

Experts suggested the expedition was hit by what are called katabatic winds, which can exceed 100mph.

Billy Payne, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said gusts of 95mph were reported on the east coast of Greenland on Saturday evening.

Temperatures fell to minus 5C (23F), or minus 14C (7F) with wind chill.

‘It is likely the interior (of Greenland) would be much colder. These sorts of winds obviously are dangerously high,’ he said.

Desperate: They radioed for help, but it took rescuers 24 hours to locate them on a glacier in Greenland

Mr Norman had said the temperature on 
the first day was around minus 20C (minus 4F) but was expected to hit 
minus 35C (minus 31F) overnight.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We 
are aware British nationals were in difficulty during an expedition in 
Greenland. Sadly one of the men, Philip Goodeve-Docker, died.

‘We are providing consular assistance to their families.’
