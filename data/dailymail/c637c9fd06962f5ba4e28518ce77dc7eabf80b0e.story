Fine: Royal Navy lieutenant Roland Wilson leaving court. A judge said the crew were like 'rabbits in headlights'

A Royal Navy lieutenant who became an internet hit after he crashed his racing yacht into a bright red 870ft oil tanker was today ordered to pay more than £100,000.

Roland Wilson, 32, was the skipper on the 33ft pink-sailed yacht Atalanta of Chester, which he 'inexplicably' allowed to collide with the Hanne Knutsen tanker - despite seeing it from five miles away.

The yacht’s crew comprised Royal Navy officers with experience in some of the world’s most prestigious sailing races, including the Fastnet and Sydney-Hobart race.

But they failed to predict the tanker’s movements off the coast of the Isle of Wight, Southampton Magistrates’ Court heard, despite seeing it almost 15 minutes earlier.

By the time married father-of-one Wilson, from Stanley, Perthshire, realised his predicament, he and the crew were 'like rabbits in the headlights'.

One crew member, a Navy commander, jumped overboard while another, a serving petty officer, was taken to hospital with head injuries.

Footage of the incident, which happened on the first day of world-famous Cowes Week racing regatta in August 2011, went viral and has now been viewed almost one million times.

The crash ripped off the yacht's mast in front of thousands of spectators, many of whom can be heard gasping in shock in the video.

Wilson denied charges of contravening naval regulations while responsible for a vessel, telling the court the tanker had sounded its horn to indicate it would turn to starboard but then did not, leaving him in front of it.

District Judge Anthony Callaway, himself a keen sailor, confessed it was an 'isolated incident' and it was unlikely anybody could have 'fielded a better team, at least on paper'.

But he said the accident should have been easily avoided, adding: 'Anyone in the eastern Solent that afternoon would have seen the tanker.'

Wilson was today fined £3,000 after he was convicted of three counts of breaking maritime regulations, and made to pay the full prosecution costs of £100,000 - much of them incurred by expert witnesses reconstructing his route.

He told the court he had no formal yachting qualifications but claimed: 'Experience is more important than paper qualifications.'

The court heard Wilson, a Durham University physics graduate, can no longer afford to sail the Atalanta because he no longer has a job and is living off savings.

He gave no comment outside court.

The judge questioned why the crew had sailed into danger rather than away from it, and criticised them for not starting their engine to motor away from the vessel despite having 'plenty of time' to do so.

Judge Callaway said: 'This was a serious yacht, crewed by serious people, who were in the regatta for a serious purpose. They were well-equipped in terms of their experience and ability to deal with any situation.

'This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel, crewed by inexperienced, clueless, and foolhardy people, who frankly have no business being on the water at all.

'The potential for even greater and tragic consequences is in my judgement apparent.'

He said, however, that Cowes Week as a whole was safe. 'Attempts to call into question Cowes Week in its present form are unjustified and unnecessary,' he said.

He added it was 'exceptionally busy' in the Solent at the time and said: 'Nobody sets out in Cowes Week to have a collision, let alone with a tanker.'

Responsibility for the incident lay entirely with the skipper and not the event's organisers, he said.

Solent shipping by-laws prevent yachts sailing any closer than 0.6 miles in front and 328ft either side of a vessel longer than 492ft.

Yet the court heard the yacht crew had spotted the 120,000-tonne tanker up to 15 minutes before the collision.

Prosecutor Charles Row said the incident 'could potentially have catastrophic consequences resulting in manslaughter or death as a result of an unlawful act.'

David Giddings, then principal race officer at Cowes, described visibility on the day as 'very good' said he had not seen a similar incident in 20 years.

Maritime Coastguard Agency expert Roger Towner had also branded Wilson’s actions 'inexplicable', saying the eight-man crew broke 'all the rules of the road'.

Captain Jeremy Smart, head of enforcement with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said after the case: 'It was very fortunate that Mr Wilson’s actions did not result in very tragic consequences.

'This case should serve as a reminder to all who use the water that a good lookout, a full appraisal of the situation and early action is essential to avoid incidents like this.'

The court heard Wilson joined the Royal Navy in 2006 and left in February this year, but remains a reservist.

The day of the collision was the fifth time he had raced at Cowes and he had a flat on the Isle of Wight overlooking the Solent.

He said he had a short-lived position at financial services company Credit Suisse after he left the Navy, until the impending court case came to light.

He is now working on new designs for inflatable boats.

Wilson was fined £2,000 for one offence of failing to keep a proper lookout, and £500 each for two offences of impeding the passage of a vessel.

He was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and full prosecution costs of £100,056.68.
