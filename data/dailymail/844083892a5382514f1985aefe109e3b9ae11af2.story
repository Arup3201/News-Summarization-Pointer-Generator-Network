A pastor and high school dean who is accused of shooting one of his students in the head was living a 'double life' as a gangster, prosecutors claim.

Shaun Harrison, 55, preached non-violence at Boston English High School before he allegedly fired a bullet into the face of a 17-year-old who was said to be selling marijuana for him.

It was the moment, prosecutors said, that his two lives - one as a teacher and one as a drug-pedaling gang member - merged.

Harrison, a father of eight, appeared in court on Thursday to deny assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery, and unlawful possession of a firearm.

'Double life': Shaun Harrison, 55, allegedly has gang tattoos below his collar bone and is accused of using his students to sell drugs. He has pleaded not guilty to shooting one of his students in the face

The court heard that he allegedly shot one of his students in the face 'execution-style' and hid his 'gangster life' - including gang tattoos below his collar bone.  

The unnamed Boston English High School student survived and told police he had been selling marijuana for Shaun Harrison for the past several months, according to Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Michael Bradley.

Bradley said the student had been told by Harrison, 55,  that they were on their way to a house where the student could pick up marijuana and girls on the night of the shooting.

After Harrison's home was searched on Thursday police found an illegally-owned rifle and shotgun in his bedroom, which Bradley said the minister had told police were weapons he had inherited from his father. 

The father-of-eight is an ordained Baptist minister and was the 'dean of students' at Boston English High School. The student allegedly told police he was selling marijuana for Harrison for the past several months

Harrison only began working at Boston English High School at the beginning of January and served as a 'community or family outreach coordinator,' school spokeswoman Denise Snyder told the Boston Globe. 

She said he was unofficially recognized as the 'Dean of Students'. 

Harrison's defense attorney Kernahan Buck said he also ran anger management and substance abuse programs at the high school. 

He has since been fired from the high school, according to interim school superintendent John McDonough.

The Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Harrison was an ordained Baptist minister who left the church, of which he was a member, in 2012 to form his own non-denominational church.

Rev. Opal Adams, an associate pastor at the church, told the Boston Globe that Harrison did anti-violence work with young people in the community.  

Harrison's sister Susan believes he was 'setup'. 

'My brother is a good man and I don't know how this happened,' she told the Boston Globe. 

Harrison's son Jeremy, an anti-violence activist who worked to keep kids off the street, was arrested after shooting his girlfriend in the head while cleaning his illegally-owned firearm in 2013. She was critically wounded, according to the Boston Herald. 

Harrison was charged on Thursday with assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery and unlawful possession of a firearm.

His bail was set at $250,000 cash.
