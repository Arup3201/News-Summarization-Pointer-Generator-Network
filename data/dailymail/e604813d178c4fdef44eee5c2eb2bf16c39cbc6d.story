A Diego Maradona connection is one of the many thing that unites them – one has always been made to feel like the Son of God in Argentina - the closest thing the country has ever had to its most famous No 10. While the other used to be the son-in-law of God married to Diego's daughter Giannina.

They are like brothers when they meet up with the Argentine national team and both would have loved to have played for the same club side. But on Tuesday Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero will be the best of enemies as they face each other at the Etihad Stadium.

It was just two weeks ago when, despite the proximity of Tuesday’s match, Aguero made the most of a free-weekend created by Manchester City’s elimination from the FA Cup to fly with partner Karina Tejada to Barcelona and spend the weekend with Messi and his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo.

Sergio Aguero and Lionel Messi are very good friends but will be opposite sides on Tuesday night

The girlfriends are close, as are the sons. Messi’s son Thiago was given a baby-Argentina full strip by Aguero shortly after he was born and Messi is like a godfather to Benjamin, the son Aguero had with Giannina.

Messi wrote the foreward to Aguero’s recent autobiography and if Messi and Antonella finally get married this summer, as has been speculated, then Aguero would be short odds to be his best man – once the pair have gone about the business of trying to win the Copa America in Chile this June.

Their talent has brought them together on the international stage but the two men had very different beginnings.

Aged 15, Aguero was making his debut in the merciless Argentine first division for the club he had always supported, Independiente.

Both Aguero and Messi have been in good goalscoring form for their teams this season 

Messi was already at Barcelona’s La Masia youth academy at the time living the dream of playing alongside Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique training in the shadow of the Nou Camp with aspirations of making it to the first team one day.

Aguero had grown up in the tough La Villa Itati neighbourhood – a densely populated criss-cross of dark alleys and narrow streets where 50,000 of Argentina’s poorest people tried to eke out a living and where he shared a two-bedroom corrugated iron and concrete prefab with father Leonel, mother Adriana and six siblings.

Messi comes from slightly more affluent beginnings and it was a distant relative in Cataluña that helped enable him and his father Jorge to travel to the Catalan capital when the boy was just 13 and take a trial with one of the biggest clubs in world football.

Their very different paths eventually converged in 2005 at the Under 20 World Cup in Holland. In the pre-tournament squad meet-up legend has it that Aguero became a figure of fun in the team canteen when he failed to recognize Messi, who had already become the most famous young footballer on the planet.

Aguero asked ‘who’s that?’ to the amazement of his team-mates and when the two players were finally introduced their first conversion involved Aguero commenting that his middle name Leonel was the same (more or less) as Lionel. Perhaps Messi was already getting sick of being noticed and, delighted that the other had not recognised him, took to Sergio immediately.

They became pals as Argentina won the tournament beating Nigeria in the final with Messi scoring twice and Aguero playing the last half an hour as a substitute. The won Olympic gold together in Beijing in 2008 and are room-mates at every tournament for their country.

When Aguero moved to Atletico Madrid they began to play against each other with various meeting between their respective sides that usually ended with Messi coming out on top. Aguero would invariably find the back of the net in defeat however – he scored five goals in 12 meetings against Barcelona.

In total Messi has won eight of the 11 encounters between the two players. But those meetings all came when Aguero was still at Atletico Madrid. Last year he was injured and never faced his great friend.

The question both will be asking now is: ‘Will the script change with Aguero in the sky blue of Manchester City?’
