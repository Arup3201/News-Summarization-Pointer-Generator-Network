When Spice Girl Victoria Adams married football star David Beckham in a royal-thermed ceremony complete with His and Hers thrones, one of the most powerful celebrity couples of all time was born.

After meeting at charity football match in 1997 their romance quickly blossomed into one of the most publicised love stories ever, culminating in their fairy tale wedding.

Now the crown worn by Victoria during the lavish nuptials is to be sold at auction with a guide price of £25,000 - though experts say a superfan of the singer-turned designer could well pay a good deal more.

The gold and diamond crown tiara made by acclaimed jewellery designer Slim Barrett, is to be sold in the Fine Jewellery sale at Bonhams auction house in London.

The tiara, entitled East of Paris, which Victoria wore throughout the ceremony, is valued at £18,000 - £25,000 and is crafted from 18-carat latticed yellow gold, set with large brilliant-cut diamonds and suspended diamond drops.

The couple were married on July 4 1999 by the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, at Luttrellstown Castle, in Ireland and the couple's four-month old son Brooklyn was the ring bearer.

To complement her crown Victoria wore a £60,000 wedding gown by Vera Wang and sat alongside her husband on matching gold thrones.

'Inspiration for ‘East of Paris’ came from my love of Eastern design and Parisian haute couture' artist Slim Barrett commented, '...so I set out to fuse the two styles.'

The Victoria and Albert Museum exhibited the work in 100 Tiaras, Past and Present and it was included in the prestigious Diamond Divas exhibition at The Diamond Museum in Antwerp.

Emily Barber, Director of Bonhams Jewellery Department commented: 

'Interest in the tiara expected to be two-fold because it is designed by acclaimed jeweller, Slim Barrett, whose pieces rarely come up for sale at auction.

'Posh and Becks' fans will no doubt be clamouring to get hold of such a momentous piece of their idols' history

'The fact that it was worn by international style icon Victoria Beckham on her wedding day adds even further interest to the piece, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience.'

Slim Barrett is an Irish born jewellery artist and master metalworker
