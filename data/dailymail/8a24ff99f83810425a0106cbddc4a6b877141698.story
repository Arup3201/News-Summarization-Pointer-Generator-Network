A NSW Police spokeswoman said emergency services were called to the cafe shortly before 9.30pm after reports that a man had been assaulted.

Dectectives were told that the victim was in the cafe before he was punched in the head by another male customer, who the victim did not know and later fled the scene.

The police spokeswoman told the Daily Mail Australia that no one has been arrested and police are still searching for the offender, described as being of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander appearance.

'We've been told that the man in the video was hand cuff because police were trying to calm him down after witnessing the attack but at this stage, we have not identified the offender,' she said.

A friend who was with the victim at the time, gave him first aid until paramedics and police arrived.

The spokeswoman told Sydney Morning Herald that it was not immediately clear why the offender attacked the man and alcohol was not believed to be a factor in the assault.

The injured man was treated with suspected head injuries at the cafe before he was taken to St Vincent's Hospital.

A St Vincent hospital spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that the man was in a stable condition but had walked out of the emergency room on Friday morning.

'We believe it was not a life threatening situation and luckily he's fine,' he said.

The offender is aged between 18-25 years old, approximately 180cm tall and slim build and was last seen wearing a grey-coloured t-shirt, blue jeans, black shoes and was carrying a bag.
