A festive ice rink erected in a town centre has been branded a 'diabolical mess' after bungling contractors built it on a slope.

Hundreds of parents and children were left disappointed by the shoddy winter centrepiece in Evesham, Worcestershire, after builders left the slope uneven and resembling a 'cobbled street'.

The 'hazardous' skating rink in the town's Market Square has since been pulled down less than three weeks before Christmas due to health and safety concerns.

As well as erecting the rink on an uneven surface, contractors used dozens of panels which were also uneven, leaving the arena looking like a 'cobbled street'.

Inspectors ruled last Friday that the rink was unsafe, and despite contractors attempting to rectify the problems, the attraction was shut down at the weekend.

Father-of-two Daniel Lewis, 45, said: 'The ice rink looked down right hazardous. For starters it was on a slope which was quite steep in some places.

'In the middle and around the edges of the rink the panels were sticking up all over the place.  It looked like a cobbled street. My kids were gutted.  

'They were inconsolable when I had to tell them they couldn't use it because it was unsafe.'

Evesham town clerk Frank Green said: 'We have organised the rink for the past two years with the same company and never had any problems but the rink which was used this time was different.

'The panels that formed the floor of the rink were sticking up and were trip hazards and those at the side of the rink were also unsuitable.

'The rink was inspected on Friday and it was found to be unsafe and the contractor was asked to rectify the safety issues.

'Attempts were made but after further inspection on Saturday morning safety concerns still remained.' Evesham town council ordered the rink, which measures 50ft by 50ft, from company Skate Spectacular.

Mayor of Evesham cllr Jim Bulman added: 'It was a diabolical mess.

'The town council feels badly let down by the contractor who provides the facility.

'The ice rink was supposed to be the centrepiece for the whole weekend, which was totally ruined.

'It's a huge disappointment. I know how much distress it will have caused local children because they would have been really looking forward to it.'

Owner of Worcestershire-based Skate Spectacular Ronald Bishton yesterday admitted the blunder.

He said: 'It's just gone pear-shaped. I wasn't there myself so I don't know what's gone wrong.

'I'm just very disappointed with what's happened. I'm gutted.

'I've offered to provide the council with another rink at a reduced rate maybe in the new year.'
