In just a few days’ time the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be moving into their new home at Kensington Palace following a £1.5 million overhaul.

Filled with priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, the elegant 20-room apartment will be the centrepiece of the couple’s new court and a family home for their baby son, Prince George.

Decorated in shades of cream and eau du nil, it is said to be the epitome of ‘Style Anglaise’ –encapsulating the classic look of an English country house with a modern twist.

And it couldn’t be more of a contrast to the relatively modest four-bedroom farmhouse William and Kate quit on Anglesey earlier this month when the prince left his job as a Search and Rescue pilot.

One of Kate's favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on Anglesey was the decidedly unglamorous Homebase DIY store

In fact, the Mail can reveal, one of Kate’s favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on the island was the decidedly unglamorous Homebase DIY store on the Penrhos Industrial Estate in Holyhead.

According to staff, the royal would spend up to an hour browsing, particularly in the lighting and bathroom department, and couldn’t resist purchasing a few nick-nacks for her home.

Among her purchases was a three-tier chocolate brown ‘faux leather’ letter tray costing £22.99.

‘You’ll never lose a document again’ the store boasts of this ‘polyurethane and MDF’ bargain.

Perhaps William and Kate kept treasured pictures on this cork memo board, which she bought for £12.99

The Duchess snapped up this faux leather magazine file in brown for just £10.99

This three-tier letter tray, made of faux leather, £22.99, will undoubtedly have been useful for storing Royal correspondence

Kate apparently purchased this 'Love' cushion for £9.99, which the Homebase website says 'features applique stitched detail, and instantly updates any room'

The Duchess also bought a matching ‘faux leatherette’ magazine file for just £10.99.She also snapped up a  £12.99 cork memo board that is clearly popular amongst Homebase clientele, scoring an impressive four out of five star rating on the firm’s website.

It also seems as if the couple ensured they dined royally, using pillar box-red House of Style Colourama Round plate coasters, a snip at £1.49 (a reduction of 50p). The website says helpfully that they will ‘protect your tables as well as adding a splash of colour to the room)

The piece de resistance, however, has to be the shop’s red felt cushion with the word ‘Love’ emblazoned on it – which first hit the shelves costing £9.99 but can now be snapped up for just £3.99.

Called the Home of Style Love Cushion, it is said to ‘instantly update any room’ – although it is not clear whether that includes one in an historic royal palace.

The 20-room Kensington Palace apartment has undergone a £1.5 million overhaul and is said to be decorated in neutral shades and to be filled with priceless antiques from the Royal Collection

Whether any of her Homebase bargains will find their way into the Cambridges’ new home at Kensington Palace remains to be seen (although if they did, the Queen, who has a keen eye for a bargain herself and is a regular user of cheap Tupperware, would be sure to approve).

The couple are due to move into Apartment 1A, which once belonged to Princess Margaret, in the next few days.

The apartment is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and Queen Mary.

It boasts generous living space, including five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, staff bedrooms and ‘ancillary’ rooms.

The previous resident of the young couple's apartment was Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon

Former residents include Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter, and the late monarch’s grandson, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, followed by, most recently, the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon.

The couple, who moved in following a £1.5 million programme of refurbishment in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ new kitchen (which has since been ripped out) complete with sleek Formica and teak units.

It has been barely touched since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, however, and in recent years has been managed by the charity Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which used the apartment as office and exhibition space.

As HRP has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work, the Queen was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to William and Kate.

This was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is believed to be more than £100,000.

It has since emerged that a further £1 million-worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on the transforming apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen.

While William and Kate are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘soft furnishings’ personally (and it is understood that this will include a state-of-the-art new kitchen) all structural work, rewiring, re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally-friendly heating and hot water systems, is being met by the government.

So far the bill is £600,000 and rising, much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos. A further £400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof.

The Duchess, we can also reveal, is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the Queen for the nation, with which to furnish her new home.

The Collection is comprised of more than a million objects d’art collated by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years.

Although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation, one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘borrow’ items to furnish their private homes.

Kate is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases, dining tables and chairs.

A palace source argued: ‘It is the same for the Queen and other Members of the Royal Family with regards to both their private residences and their offices. The alternative is [that] everything sits in storage. ‘

Contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer, Kate has eschewed offers of professional help and is, it can be revealed, overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office.

The Duchess, who has a history of art degree, is said to have ‘a real interest in design’ and has been encouraged by her father-in-law, Prince Charles, to ‘stamp her personality’ on the project, albeit using British-sourced, environmentally-friendly products as much as possible, naturally.

She has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket Chelsea Design Centre in London but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as Peter Jones and John Lewis.

‘It’s a big task but she’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it,’ said a source.

Although aides working for the Duke and Duchess admit the works being carried out at Kensington Palace are ‘extensive’, they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘bare minimum’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately.

‘Currently, the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation,’  said one.

‘The cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the Royal Family privately.

‘The couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum.’

The spokesman added:  ‘It is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon moved into the apartment, following their marriage in 1960. ‘
