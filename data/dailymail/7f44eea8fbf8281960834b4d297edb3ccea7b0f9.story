Next week it will be 30 years since HMS Coventry sank during the Falklands War.

And now comedienne Miranda Hart's father, David Hart Dyke, has opened up to relive the ordeal.

He was the captain of the ship, which was shot down by Argentinian Skyhawk jets on 25 May, 1982 and sank to the bottom of the South Atlantic.

David, now 72, only just managed to survive the destruction of the destroyer, while 19 out of the crew of 300 died in the tragedy.

Hart Dyke has now discussed all about the experience and relived how he was commanding the ship when radar screens showed that there were four Argentinian planes heading towards HMS Coventry.

Ordeal: David Hart Dyke was the captain of the destroyer, which sank, killing 19 crewmembers, when Argentinian jets shot it down on 25 May, 1982, seen here with a 10-year-old Miranda and family

He knew when 'they were taking off from the runways in Argentina' but he soon lost track of them and had to face a tricky decision, which he still dwells on to this day.

David told the Daily Express: 'Things happen quickly. On my left was the air warfare officer saying "get the missile out" and a chap on my right saying "I think they are to the north-west".'

He eventually decided to not send out any Sea Harriers and opted to deploy missiles instead because he 'wasn't sure the Harriers would get there on time'.

The ship was eventually hit by a bomb and as it sank Hart Dyke was the last to leave the destroyer, which had been deployed by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to help liberate the Falklands following Argentina's invasion.

He recounts: 'It was black, with people on fire... I was momentarily stunned and came round seconds later...

'By the time I got up it was all happening. I walked down the ship's side - it was almost horizontal at that point'.

David swam to the nearest raft and managed to survive.

But while it was a terrifying ordeal which still has its place in history, his daughter Miranda, who was just 10 when her father was sent to command the Coventry during the conflict, doesn't remember it having much of an impact on her.

The funnywoman and TV star insists 'the impact' was 'minimal' and she even just asked her mum for a flapjack when she was told about his lucky escape.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent HMS Coventry to try and liberate the Falklands after Argentina invaded, but the ship was sunk in 1982

Dyke Hart has since released a book on his experience, Four Weeks In May, but he refuses to ever go and visit the Falklands.

And while he will attend a 30th anniversary dinner to commemorate the disaster next Friday, he's adamant it will be his last.

David now spends his time painting, gardening and playing tennis while he enjoys his eldest daughter's work on screen.
