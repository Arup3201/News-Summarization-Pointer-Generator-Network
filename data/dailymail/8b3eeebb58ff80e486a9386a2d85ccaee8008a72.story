A security camera has captured a suspected racist shooting on the Moscow metro as two men armed with handguns attacked a dark-skinned passenger.

Two men sit on the underground train in the Russian capital when a fellow passenger travelling in the same carriage attracts their attention.

One of the attackers nods to the other, whispers something, and then both draw guns in the vicious assault which was caught on footage obtained by Life News, a major Russian media outlet.

Chilling: One of the attackers, centre, brandishing a pistol in his right hand, closes in on his victim, in the foreground wearing a baseball cap

Point blank: The man lashes out at his defenceless victim then points the pistol in his face before firing a second round

The younger one uses a 'traumatic hand
 gun' to shoot into the abdomen of Khashim Latipov, 30, from Dagestan, a
 region in the Caucasus region of southern Russia.

He kicks him and shoots again, putting the gun at the man's head, as other passengers flee to the far end of the carriage.

The
 two men then turn their backs on the victim but keep threatening their 
victim with guns until they flee the train at Nagornaya station.

Fear: Fellow passengers on the Moscow Metro rush to the other end of the carriage as the second attacker also pulls out a weapon

Faces of both attackers are caught by the security camera in the November 17 incident.

Miraculously, Lapitov survived the attack but is seriously wounded.

'The IDs of the shooters are not known yet, we are searching for them,' a law enforcement source told Life News.

'The victim was taken to the hospital, with one bullet in his jaw and serious damage to his face.'

Wounded: A stunned Khashim Latipov takes his top off to use as a makeshift bandage as he bleeds profusely from a serious wound on his face

Concern: Passengers gather around the seriously wounded man as blood gushes from his injuries

Maimed: Lapitov survived the attack but is seriously wounded following the attack

Lapitov has undergone surgery, and new operations are expected, it was reported.

The footage was released in a bid to catch the attackers.

The incident comes as Russia is under scrutiny over alleged racist incidents, with a number of recent attacks, and taunts of foreign players at football matches.

The attack comes less than three months before thousands of Winter Olympics fans will travel to Russia for the Sochi games.
