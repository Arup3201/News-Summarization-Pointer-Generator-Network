Detroit Lions defensive end Ziggy Ansah took a cab journey from the team’s Bagshot base all the way to north London on Tuesday to reunite with his older sister after six years apart.

The Ghanaian-born defensive star turned up unannounced at his older sibling’s doorstep and overwhelmed his sister, Elizabeth Giddings.

Ansah had planned to meet up with his sister later in the week, but instead spent five or six hours with her on Tuesday — the day the Lions landed in the UK for their game against Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Sunday.

‘I didn’t tell her I was coming actually,’ Ansah said at Detroit’s Pennyhill Park headquarters on Thursday. ‘I know her address, took a cab, went to her house and knocked on the door. She just fell on the floor and was overwhelmed.’

‘We do talk, but we haven’t seen each other for a while. We just talked, she cooked some African food for me which was great.’

Giddings is one of Ansah’s four siblings (the other three live in Ghana), and is seven years older than the defensive end. She also has two children, making Ansah an uncle.

He said: ‘Her little boy is just in love with me. He told me to get him a Halloween costume, so I got him a Spiderman costume and he wore it the whole time.’
