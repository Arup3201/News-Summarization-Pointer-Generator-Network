Vladmir Putin put the world on course for a new Cold War yesterday, annexing Crimea and telling the West to get out of Russia’s back yard.

As Russia was accused of war crimes after the death of a Ukrainian soldier, Putin defiantly told a joint session of the Russian  parliament that he would not accept Western influence ‘next to our home or on our historic territories’.

And in a stark warning that Ukraine risks dismemberment if it seeks to join the EU or Nato, he said he would not tolerate Western countries ‘behaving as the master of the house outside our fence’.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a treaty for Crimea to join Russia

Russian President Vladimir Putin (second right), Crimea's Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov (front left), Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov (back left) and Sevastopol Mayor Alexei Chaliy shake hands after a signing ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow

An emotional Putin signed a document 
reclaiming Crimea and declared: ‘In the hearts and minds of people, 
Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.’

The
 speech sent shockwaves through the international community and appeared
 to have upended two decades of diplomacy since the fall of the Soviet 
Union designed to imbed Russia as a member of the international 
community.

It came as a 
Ukrainian officer and a member of a local Crimean self-defence brigade 
were shot dead when pro-Russian militia stormed a military outpost in 
the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Adoring public: Putin was last night riding the crest of an adulatory wave after righting what many Russians see as an historical wrong and reintegrating Crimea and the Black Sea fleet headquarters of Sevastopol

Nationalistic fervour: Dozens of Russian flags flutter in the breeze below a typically overcast Moscow sky

Ukrainian
 Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the storming of the military 
facility showed that the dispute ‘has gone from the political stage to 
the military by the fault of the Russians’.

He
 added: ‘Today, Russian soldiers began shooting at Ukrainian servicemen 
and this is a war crime without any statute of limitations.’

David
 Cameron yesterday condemned the decision to annex Crimea ‘on the basis 
of a sham referendum held at the barrel of a Russian gun’.

On the crest of a wave: Russian President Vladimir Putin stands next to Crimean Premier Sergey Aksionov as he addresses a rally in Red Square, Moscow, celebrating  Crimea's decision to join with Russia

Cult of personality: Russians hold flags adorned with Putin's face and a slogan reading 'We are together!'

Mr Aksionov, the new Crimean premier, raises his fist as he shares the stage with Speaker of the Supreme Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov, left, and head of Sevastopol city administration Alexei Chaliy, right

He
 said: ‘The steps taken by President Putin today to attempt to annex 
Crimea to Russia are in flagrant breach of international law and send a 
chilling message across the continent of Europe.

‘President Putin should be in no doubt that Russia will face more serious consequences.’

The
 Prime Minister will call on fellow EU leaders to bring in a new round 
of tougher economic sanctions, plus an arms embargo, when they meet at a
 Brussels summit tomorrow.

Branding
 the crisis ‘the most serious test of European security in the 21st 
century’, Foreign Secretary William Hague made clear that two decades of
 reaching out to Russia were at an end and that relations were likely to
 dive.

Foreign Secretary 
William Hague said Britain had suspended all military co-operation with 
Moscow. Suggesting Russia should be kicked out of the G8 group of 
nations, he said: ‘We should be ready to contemplate a new state of 
relations between Russia and the West in the coming years that is 
different from the last 20 years.’

Last
 night, Russian politicians and media were telling  Putin to grab back 
oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan and authoritarian Belarus as well as more 
slices of a battered Ukraine.

Senior politician Sergei Mironov hailed ‘the great day when the gathering of Russian lands began’.

Adolf Hitler made a spookily similar speech to Putin when he seized the Sudetenland, making similar references to common themes

The uncompromising autocrat got to his feet and made a bombastic speech as he seized a part of a neighbouring state dominated by his own countrymen.

It came in the midst of a referendum condemned by other powers as a sham, with voters intimidated by the autocrat’s looming tanks.

The move was greeted with delirious pleasure by his own citizens but seen as a portent of international strife by other Western countries.

The despot in question is not Vladimir Putin but Adolf Hitler. The occasion was not the annexation of Crimea but the Nazi  seizure of the Sudetenland, the German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia.

Putin, who spoke to the Russian parliament yesterday, appears to have stolen many of the themes of his speech from the Fuhrer’s address to the Reichstag as he seized the Sudetenland in October 1938.

Putin said Crimea had always been Russian: ‘In people’s hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia.’

Hitler said of the Sudetenland: ‘The  Sudeten German population was and is a German.’ Putin insisted he would fight for Russians everywhere.

Hitler’s imagery was also emotive. ‘More than 1,000,000 people of German blood had in the years 1919-1920 to leave their homeland.’

Putin criticised Western nations, and  Hitler complained that his efforts to reach out to the West were rebuffed.Putin said Russia would retaliate against Western sanctions.

Hitler said: ‘As a National Socialist, I am accustomed to strike back at an attacker.’

Putin claimed he would not invade other parts of Eastern Ukraine if Russia was allowed to exercise influence: ‘Don’t believe those who try to frighten you with Russia and who scream that other (Ukrainian) regions will follow after Crimea. We do not want a partition of Ukraine.’ 

Hitler also claimed that his ambitions would stop at the Sudetenland. ‘I have declared that the frontier between France and Germany is a final one.

Germany has no interests in the West.’ Five months later, he invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia; 14 months after that, he invaded France.
