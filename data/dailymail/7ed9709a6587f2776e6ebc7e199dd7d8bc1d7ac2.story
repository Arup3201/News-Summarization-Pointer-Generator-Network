Kathryn Beale, 41, who makes smoothies from raw placenta is being investigated by public health officials 

A mother-of-two who makes smoothies from raw human placenta is being investigated by public health officials.

Kathryn Beale produces the drinks for new mothers from their own afterbirths for around £25 each.

The 41-year-old insists the smoothies, produced as soon after the delivery as possible, are perfectly safe and that they have many  benefits.

But health officials, worried about potential 'serious health risks', attempted to gain an emergency court order banning them.

They were unsuccessful, but Ms Beale has offered to stop making the drinks pending a visit from officials to inspect her hygiene standards.

'Most species of mammal eat their own placenta straight after birth, raw - it is normal in the animal kingdom,' said Ms Beale from Swindon, Wiltshire.

'We are unusual in that we don't routinely do it. It is full of iron, stem cells and hormones and is reputed to help with milk production and post-natal depression.'

For the placenta smoothies Ms Beale visits the new mother in their own home or private hospital room as soon after the birth as possible.

She puts a couple of pound-coin sized pieces of the placenta into the blender and mixes it with fruit, including berries and bananas.

What is left can then be dehydrated, ground into powder and put into capsules for the new mother to take.

She can also create the pills, which cost around £150, using the Chinese method.

This involves the placenta being steamed with lemon, ginger and chilli and it is believed to have enhanced healing properties.

The capsules are Ms Beale's most popular product.  

Ms Bearle got involved in consumption of placentas - known as placentophagy - two years ago after meeting the founder of the Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network. 

She only makes placenta products for mothers who provide their own organ for processing.

She explained: 'Women who want to use their placentas are tested during pregnancy, and if we know the placenta carries any blood-born pathogens we will not use it.'

Last week Swindon Council went to court seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order against her but it was not granted as she had no future clients booked.

Instead, public protection officials will visit her home next week to check on what she is doing.

'I have voluntarily stopped taking bookings until they approve everything.' she the mother-of-two, who is still breast feeding her second daughter born in 2010.

'I am assuming I will get a food hygiene rating, provided they do not decide to close me down.

'I do not believe I am doing anything that puts myself or the public in any danger. There are more than 50 people around the UK doing the same thing.

'When I do this it is a more time-consuming process because I have to follow the right procedures and constantly wash my hands.

'Mums will often take theirs' home and cook it or bury it in the garden.

'If I am doing it at least it is safer, because it needs to be thoroughly dehydrated to kill all the germs.'

Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow have used placentas for their supposed health benefits.

One Direction star Harry Styles also dabbled in the fad when he had a luxury sheep placenta facial. 

Ms Beale also makes umbilical cord keepsakes which are made by shaping the umbilical cord into either a spiral or a heart-shape and dehydrating it until it becomes translucent shades of gold and red. 

Swindon Borough Council said: 'We can confirm Public Protection officers attended court on Tuesday, March 10 seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order in respect of raw human placenta practices. The order was not granted on this occasion.

'Our investigations continue and we are therefore unable to comment further at this stage.

'While the health benefits of this activity are not clear, the processes involved in the production of human placenta for human consumption present a number of potentially serious health risks, which explains this action.'
