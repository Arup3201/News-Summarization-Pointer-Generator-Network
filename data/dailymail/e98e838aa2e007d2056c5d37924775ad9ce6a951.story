Father and daughter were shown walking down the aisle together at Heidi's wedding to Spencer Pratt on the Hills 

According to NBC 9, 'Due to the statute of limitations, Montag is only eligible to be charged with crimes that occurred after July 1st, 1996, when the victim would have been 16 years old.'

The victim said she is coming forward after all these years to protect other possible victims and young girls.

Sources close to Heidi however claim that the woman 'is determined to destroy the family,' and had previously stalked her and husband Spencer Pratt.

TMZ reports Heidi is also certain her father will be exonerated.

If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of four to 12 years and a fine of up to $750,000.

The victim claims the abuse ended when the she rebuffed Montag one night after he crawled into bed with her and pulled down her underwear to have sexual intercourse with her.

'Get the hell out of my room,' said the victim, to which Montag responded; 'I thought that's what you wanted. I thought you loved me the way I love you.'

The victim who, given the time frame, could not have been Heidi or her sister Holly, says that Montag also performed oral sex on her and would insert a vibrator into her vagina.

The victim says the abuse happened approximately 50 times.

A source claims that Heidi does not believe the charges brought against her father are true

Holly and Heidi were together in September for Holly's wedding 

Montag divorce Heidi's mother, Darlene Egelhoff, in 1990, and both went on to remarry, Bill to Terri O’Hara.

He appeared on The Hills when Heidi married Spencer Pratt, and even walked his daughter down the aisle. 

The family also suffered some tragedy in 2008 when Eric O'Hara, Terri's son, diedafter falling from an icy roof.

Montag was also at Holly's wedding this past September in Colorado, sharing the first dance with his daughter as she married Richie Wilson.

Holly is also pregnant with her first child she recently announced. 

Montag works as a ski instructor in Aspen these days according to his Facebook

Heidi made sure her father gave his blessing to Spencer when he asked for her hand in marriage

The strained relationship between Heidi and her father was a big part of the show around the wedding, and in 2010 Montag gave an interview to Radar Online about his daughter, calling her out for not visiting him or reaching out as he was being treated for a bacterial infection.

There was also tension on The Hills when Heidi told Spencer he would need to ask her father if he wanted to marry her, with Spencer very much intimidated by Montag. 

The two seem to be on better terms these days however. 

Montag currently works as a ski instructor and coach at Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club according to his Facebook page - a job that does involve him teaching youth skiing.

The organization’s executive director Mark Cole told The Aspen Times, 'I was not aware of this until the police department showed up at my office in the late afternoon.'

Cole also told parents of children in the program; 'The alleged incident does not involve anyone under his care at AVSC or the Aspen area. The investigation is ongoing and we are cooperating with authorities every step of the way. We will keep you informed as the situation unfolds.'
