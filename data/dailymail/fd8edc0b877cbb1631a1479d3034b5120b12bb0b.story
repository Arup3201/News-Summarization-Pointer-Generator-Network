House prices are dropping all around Britain as the financial crisis grinds on unrelentingly.

But in one exclusive part of the capital records are being set – with the cost of the average home breaking through the £1million barrier.

Figures from the Land Registry yesterday showed that a typical property in Kensington and Chelsea would set a buyer back £1,022,515.

Those lucky enough to have bought 15 years ago – when the average price was just £240,000 – would have quadrupled their money.

Buyers are not guaranteed to get much for their cash, with a 689sq ft one-bedroom flat in the royal London borough on the market for a seven-figure sum.

The vendor is asking more than six  times the price of the average home in England and Wales of £160,417. Space is at such a premium that a double garage in Knightsbridge has been put up for sale with the estate agency WA Ellis for an extraordinary £525,000.

The majority of buyers of these ‘prime’ properties are foreigners, according to another estate agency, Knight Frank. Over the past year, 55 per cent of its sales have been to non-Britons, with Russian, Indian and French buyers topping the list.

Peter Rollings, of estate agents 
Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘London has become a store of wealth. We are 
still selling to people who will not even live in the properties they 
buy, and some will not rent them out. You can buy a one-bedroom flat in 
Chelsea for £600,000, but to the man in the street this sounds 
ridiculous.’

The Land 
Registry figures show that prices have jumped by 11.6 per cent over the 
past year in Kensington and Chelsea, putting more than £100,000 on to 
the value of a home.

Nick 
Gaunt, of Knight Frank in Chelsea, said: ‘In the last week or so, I have
 dealt with Nigerians, South Africans, Irish, Italians and Iranians as 
well as people from Turkey and Switzerland and of course the UK buyer. 
They see London as a safe place to park their money.’

House prices are falling sharply in the majority of regions.
