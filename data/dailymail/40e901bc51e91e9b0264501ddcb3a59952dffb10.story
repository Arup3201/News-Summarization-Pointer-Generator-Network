A 12-year-old boy will be one of the first patients in the UK to undergo an experimental epilepsy treatment using drugs derived from cannabis.

The trial comes after a series of US-led studies found cannabidiol (CBD) could reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with acute epilepsy.

Patients will receive the medication, Epidiolex, which is chemically based on CBD, a compound found in marijuana that is not psychoactive, therefore does not give a 'high'.

Now, the study is to be extended into the UK, and patients are being selected for a randomised and controlled trial of the treatment.

It will run in hospitals in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and London.

Max Robertson, 12, who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the UK to trial the experimental drug Epidiolex, which is based on Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound found in marijuana

The initial focus will be on children with Dravet Syndrome, a rare but serious type of epilepsy that is difficult to treat. 

Some children will receive the treatment while others will receive a placebo.

Dravet Syndrome usually develops before the age of one and causes prolonged seizures lasting more than five minutes. 

It has a significant impact on the child's development and can be fatal.

Researchers will also study the effect on children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a type of childhood epilepsy that is difficult to treat.

This syndrome normally develops when children are aged between one and six and is characterised by frequent seizures of different types.

Only children whose seizures cannot be controlled with existing medications will be invited to take part in the new trial, researchers said.

Max Robertson, 12, from Haddington, East Lothian, who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the UK to trial the cannabis-sourced medication.

His mother, Lorraine Haddington, 41, said: 'Max was a five-month-old baby when he was diagnosed with West Syndrome.

'He used to be happy and noisy, but he had his first Tonic-Clonic seizure just after his fifth birthday, and about four or five years ago he was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.

'Sometimes I just think he suffers but he can't tell us as he can't talk at all. He's in his own little world now and we don't get much interaction from him now.

The new trial will focus on Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy.

Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life.

Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP).

They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding.

There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures.

Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet syndrome.

'Last year we heard on CNN about the little girl in Colorado who stopped having seizures after she was put on CBD, and as soon as we heard we mentioned it to the hospital.

'Around that time we met with our doctor (Dr Chin) and he knew that we were very keen on it.

'I got in contact with the company who produce the drug and they said that if we got the go-ahead from the hospital then we could go ahead.'

Epidiolex is being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, a British biotechnology company which is also sponsoring and funding the trial.

Mrs Haddington said: 'There was a lot of red tape as there's been no trial in the UK yet, so they are concerned about safety, but we're almost there.

'We don't have the time to wait for clinical trials as to how it will affect people.

'I don't know if it will make a difference but we really just want to try it as I've lost count of how many medications he's tried over the years.

'The early data from the U.S. is giving us a lot of hope which we've not had for a long time.

'We believe it's going to be started in March or April and will run for about 12 weeks although we've not been told exactly what it is yet. We think it's a liquid chemical from the plant.'

Dr Richard Chin, of the University of Edinburgh's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, one of the hospitals where the trial will take place, said: 'Many children with serious forms of epilepsy do not respond to the medications that we currently have available.

'We need new means of treating these conditions so that we can give back some quality of life to these children and their families.'

Ann Maxwell, founder of the paediatric epilepsy charity the Muir Maxwell Trust, added: 'I welcome the launch of these trials as it marks an important milestone in our long journey towards understanding the condition and improving the treatment of those suffering this severe form of epilepsy.

'As the mother of a teenager with this life-altering condition, I strongly support the exploration of ground breaking medications that could seek out new ways to improve patients' life quality.

'I am excited to see organisations from across the UK work together on the development of this treatment and look forward to the trials' results.'

Professor Helen Cross, of Great Ormond Street Hospital, added: 'Severe epilepsy can have an incredibly debilitating effect on individuals.

'These trials will allow us to accurately test the viability of treatment with CBD in a safe and controlled way.'

The trials will take place at the University of Edinburgh's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool and London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex are already used in the U.S., U.K. and other European countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer.

Two other cannabis-derived drugs, Cesamet and Marinol, are also used in Canada and the U.S. to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and AIDS-related anorexia.
