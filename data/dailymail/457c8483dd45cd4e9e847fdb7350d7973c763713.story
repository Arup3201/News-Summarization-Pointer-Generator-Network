The humble onion has a lot more to offer than flavouring your stew and is coming into its own as a beauty product and ALICE ROBINSON bravely applied a clothes peg to her nose and tried out some beauty recipes. 

SLATHER ON FOR SHINY HAIR 

THE THEORY: ‘Onions are naturally acidic — if you use them in hair masques, the acidity will close the cuticle of the hair and make it look shiny,’ says consultant trichologist Iain Sallis.

THE TEST: Grind an onion with equal amounts of coconut or olive oil to make a hair rinse. Leave on for two hours.

MY VERDICT: I reluctantly pick up my grater and shred an onion into a bowl. I mix the pulp with virgin organic coconut oil from a jar.

The resulting oily mush is full of onion bits, and I flinch as I smear it into my hair, which feels unbelievably greasy.

Bits of onion fall on the floor every time I move — it probably would have been a good idea to wrap my head in clingfilm or an old towel. I sit very carefully and sulkily at my laptop, trying not to shed onion on the keyboard.

After two hours, I dash to the shower — almost retching at the acrid smell of warm, raw onion under hot water. I use my usual shampoo and vigorously brush my hair as I wash it off.

After blow-drying, my hair does look and feel glossy — and thankfully doesn’t smell, not even of coconut.

It would be less stressful to just pay up for a blow-dry or expensive conditioner. Nonetheless, it works. 3/5

GROW YOUR HAIR FASTER 

Make an onion hair masque for thinning hair

THE THEORY: Onions and honey have been used in recipes to counteract thinning hair for centuries.

‘In the Middle Ages, onions were prized and prescribed for the relief of headaches, coughs, snakebite and hair loss,’ says Iain Sallis. ‘There is no scientific evidence of this being effective at all.’

However, an article published in the Journal of Dermatology a decade ago showed promising results.

THE TEST: Make an onion hair masque for thinning hair — mix the juice of one onion with 2tsp of honey and leave overnight. Use two or three times a week.

MY VERDICT: My hair is thinning a little but I’m not sure I’d opt for this as a solution.

I don’t even need to spell out how anti-social wearing eau d’onion juice is. Add in sticky honey, and it’s completely off-putting.

I dutifully apply the foul mixture, wrap my head in a towel and try to go to sleep as best I can.

In the morning, I gratefully wash my hair which is, of course, after just one night, no thicker.

But even if it made me look like Rapunzel, I wouldn’t do it again.1/5

TAKE THE STING OUT OF BITES

THE THEORY: ‘Many believe the effects of a bite or sting can be relieved by rubbing it with an onion,’ says Eric Block, professor of chemistry at the State University of New York.

‘This effect is believed to be due to compounds such as quercetin. This is said to inhibit the formation of prostaglandins. These are responsible for allergic response and pain.

‘Many believe the effects of a bite or sting can be relieved by rubbing it with an onion,’ says Eric Block, professor of chemistry at the State University of New York.

‘In laboratory studies, quercetin inhibits the enzymes that are involved in allergic response, though not specifically pain production.’

THE TEST: Using a slice of raw onion to help reduce the effects of insect bites and nettle stings.

MY VERDICT: Clearly it is not possible to capture an insect to sting me, so I ask my husband to put on his gardening gloves and bring in a nettle from the bottom of the garden.

I rub it on my hand. The moment I feel that burning and itching sensation I frantically rub on a slice of onion. To my astonishment, the pain instantly subsides. No white mark from the nettle comes up on my hand and although it starts to sting again after a couple of minutes, another firm rub of onion gets rid of it.

Extraordinary, though be aware of Dr Patterson’s warnings on possible skin irritation.5/5

REDUCE DARK SPOTS

Mix equal quantities of onion juice and fresh yoghurt and massage into your face for ten to 15 minutes

THE THEORY: ‘Onions are said to get rid of dark spots and pigmentation,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘Some peels contain an onion extract which will increase skin cell turnover. When combined with lactic acid in yoghurt, it will have a mild peeling effect. It’s pretty labour-intensive. Also, it would be hard to work out quantities and how often to do it.’

THE TEST: Mix equal quantities of onion juice and fresh yoghurt and massage into your face for ten to 15 minutes.

MY VERDICT: I extract onion juice (see right) and stir it into yoghurt.

Although onion yoghurt sounds like something you would be force fed in George Orwell’s Room 101, after I carefully rub it onto my face, my skin feels smooth and dewy, though I can’t yet see any change in my age spots. It’s suggested you do this daily, so if I can bear it, I might persevere.2/5

HOLD YOUR NOSE FOR GREAT SKIN

THE THEORY: ‘Onions have been the subject of dermatological interest for many years, as it has been suggested they have both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects,’ says Dr Mervyn Patterson at Woodford Medical Clinic in Essex.

A recent study showed onion juice had some effect on reducing skin scarring following Caesareans and further studies have suggested it may help with scar healing in both adults and children. So could onions help with skincare?

Possibly. But Dr Patterson warns: ‘When unrefined onion juice comes into contact with the skin, there’s a risk of it becoming irritated.’

THE TEST: Make a mask with 2tbsp of flour, 1 ½tbsp of fresh onion juice, a pinch of nutmeg and ½ tsp of milk. Mix together to make a thick paste and apply to the face for up to 20 minutes. Remove by dabbing on some milk and massaging it away.

MY VERDICT: It’s all very well mentioning onion juice, but extracting the stuff is harder than it sounds, especially if you don’t have a juicer.

Standing with tears pouring down my cheeks, I grate two onions and press the resulting mush through a sieve and into a bowl.

It reeks and takes a good ten minutes. The resulting paste looks like bread dough and stinks to high heaven. I tentatively dab it all over my face, trying to breathe as little as possible.

I avoid putting it anywhere near my eyes. But on my skin, thankfully, it doesn’t sting at all. It feels cool and soothing, but I’ve never been so pleased to remove a face mask, which comes off in great gooey chunks.

Once I scrape off the last bits, my skin is left feeling lovely and smooth — and not smelling of onions. 4/5

BANISH ROUGH PATCHES ON YOUR ELBOWS

‘Onions have anti-microbial properties which help to kill some bacteria and yeasts,’ says Iain Sallis. 

THE THEORY: ‘Onions have anti-microbial properties which help to kill some bacteria and yeasts,’ says Iain Sallis. ‘Clinical tests would need to be done before recommending them for any skin conditions.’

THE TEST: Wash the affected body part with an infusion of onion skins.

MY VERDICT: I am thankfully low on skin disorders, but I do have rough dry skin on my elbows.

There are many complicated ways of making infusions, but I simply drop a load of onion skin into a mug of hot water (interestingly this doesn’t smell too bad — like a sort of soup, though my husband flinches when I offer him a ‘cup of tea’). I dip my left elbow carefully into the mug of onion ‘tea’ and slosh it around for a few minutes.

It does feel slightly less rough-compared to the other. I suspect this would need doing daily to have any real effect, and reckon a good emollient cream might work just as well.3/5
