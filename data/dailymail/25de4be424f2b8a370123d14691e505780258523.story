Shocking CCTV footage captures the moment a grandfather of two was almost killed by a punch from a young man angry about being asked to turn his music down.

The 68-year-old victim and his attacker Bon Williams, 20, from Dandenong North in Melbourne, were travelling on a bus together when Mr Williams started playing music out of the speakers on his mobile phone.

The victim sat down next to Mr Williams and asked him to turn the music down, and Mr Williams responded by saying 'you can't tell me what to do' and swearing at the man, the Dandenong Leader reported.

A 68-year-old grandfather  was almost killed by a punch from 20-year-old Bon Williams in Dandenong North

Mr Williams knocked the man unconscious because he was angry about being asked to turn his music down

In CCTV footage captured  from the side of the bus on March 4, Mr Williams can be seen getting off the bus with a number of other passengers and putting down the case of Wild Turkey Bourbon and Cola that he was carrying.

He then turns to face the victim who also gets off the bus and walks towards Mr Williams with his arms out and his palms open.

Mr Williams then punches the victim in the head and he drops to the ground, where he hits his head on the concrete and can be seen lying unconscious.

Mr Williams then picks up his case of Wild Turkey and walks away slowly, while other passengers exit the bus to rush to the 68-year-old man's aid.

The victim suffered swelling and bleeding on the brain, a broken nose and four of his teeth were knocked out.

Mr Williams pleaded guilty to recklessly causing serious injury in a Dandenong court last month but escaped a jail sentence, instead being placed on a 12-month community corrections order.

In court Mr Williams said if he ever spoke to his victim he would say: 'I'm remorseful and very sorry ... for being violent and aggressive.'

Earlier, the court heard Mr Williams had ADHD and problems with anger management. He was ordered to seek treatment and to undergo mental health assessments.
