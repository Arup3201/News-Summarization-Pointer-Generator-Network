The FBI spied on citizens who were not the subject of investigation because of typographical errors, according to a government watchdog.

The Justice Department's inspector general has found that while the FBI has improved handling of national security letters, the agency could do better.

The watchdog identified several areas that the FBI needs to improve upon, including the 'tendency to collect data on the wrong person because of routine mistakes.'

'We found that the FBI's corrective measures have not completely eliminated potential intelligence violations resulting from typographical errors in the identification of a telephone number, email address, or social security number in an NSL,' the report reads.

'These typographical errors cause the FBI to request and, in some instances receive, the information of someone other than the intended target of the NSL.'

National security letters allow investigators to collect private information, including from telephone companies and Internet service providers, without a judge's approval.

Earlier reports from the department's inspector general identified widespread violations in the program, including information obtained in non-emergencies.

The report released Thursday examines the program from 2007 to 2009 and how well the FBI has implemented recommendations from the earlier reports.

The inspector general says the FBI has fully implemented 31 of 41 recommendations from prior reports on the topic, but must improve in other areas, including reducing errors.

It also made 10 new recommendations.

The FBI says in response that it's continued making improvements in recent years.

According to the National Journal, the inspector general added a footnote to the public version of the report, saying that the FBI had demanded too many redactions on the 232-page report.

'We disagree with these markings, which have the effect of redacting information that we believe is important to the public's understanding of the FBI's compliance with NSL requirements,' it reads.
