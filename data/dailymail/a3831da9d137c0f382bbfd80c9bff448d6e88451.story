President Barack Obama has begun his annual winter vacation in Hawaii.

The president, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia landed in Honolulu shortly before midnight local time. Their two dogs, Sunny and Bo, joined them aboard Air Force One.

Obama has no public events scheduled while he's in Hawaii. On previous trips, he's enjoyed regular rounds of golf, visits to restaurants and family trips to get shave ice, a Hawaiian version of a snow cone.

Last year, gridlock in Congress forced Obama to return to Washington the day after Christmas. This year the Obamas are hoping their vacation will go uninterrupted.

The president, who was born in Hawaii, is scheduled to be in Honolulu through Jan. 5.

'You know, the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Mr Obama told reporters. 'That's how I intend to approach it. I am sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' 

This
 will be the first family's sixth Christmas in Hawaii since he was 
elected president, and in keeping with tradition they are expected to 
spend their 17-day vacation in the Oahu neighborhood of Kailua.

The
 White House announced last week that the Obamas would depart  on December 21, since it was expected to be a light work schedule for the president in 
Washington. 

The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000

The president and his family traditionally spend their Christmas break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views.

The Obamas cover the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $1 million.

For his first three years in office, the Obamas rented a $24,500-per-week gated Plantation Estate, which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of Kailua Bay.

Since then the Obamas have rented a few different houses on Kailuana Place, which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area.

'It's exciting. It's really an honor to have him here, and when he's around – actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around,’ Lanette Hayashi, who lives locally, told Hawaii News Now.

'We go through two security points and so the second one, we have to get out of our car.  We have to be searched ourselves, plus our car has to be completely searched,' said a woman called Madeline, who has lived on the street for more than four decades.

When the President visits, the canal running through the Kailuana Street neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by Navy seals and a Coast Guard cutter is positioned in the bay. 

It is one of the many security measures put in place, including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays.

'I understand he's the President and so he needs his security, but I'd like for him to pick next year another spot. This would be really nice,' said Madeline. 'At first it was exciting, but now it's no longer exciting.  It's maddening.'

Last year, Obama was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to Washington on the day after Christmas to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with Congress.

This year, Congress is on track to approve a two-year budget deal before the Christmas holiday and so he isn't scheduled to return to Washington D.C. until January 5.
