Chinese media reports that two University of Southern California students from China were murdered in their luxury BMW because they were 'showing off their wealth' has caused outrage among the victims' friends.

Couple Ying Wu and Ming Qu, both 23, were sitting in the 
3-series when a gunman fired at the vehicle shattering the car
 windows.

The woman, Wu, was found slumped in the front passenger 
seat in the early hours of Wednesday morning near the campus in Los Angeles.

Blown out: The windows of the BMW luxury car were blown away; Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help

Mourning: More than 400 Chinese students participate in a memorial service on campus of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, for the murdered couple

The wounded man, Qu, managed to run to a nearby home, where he 
pounded on the door pleading for help but soon collapsed.

In
 a statement released on Thursday, classmates and friends of Wu and Qu 
said they are 'deeply grieved and angered at the distorted reports of 
our friends', reports the LA Times.

As news of the shooting broke, media outlets first reported that Wu was found dead in a new BMW.

Headlines in China have focused on the make of the car because luxury vehicles have become a political issue in the country.

But
 in their statement, friends say Qu had recently purchased the BMW, 
which was in fact a used 2003 model with 80,000 miles on the clock. He 
had planned to use the car to commute to a job after graduating this 
spring.

They said the car had no license plates because they had not yet arrived and not because the car was new, reports the Times.

Evidence: Police believe they were murdered either in an attempted robbery or car-jacking that left material evidence behind connecting to the suspects

'Ying and Ming lived a simple life 
during their nearly two-year study at USC. In order to keep their living
 expenses down, they both shared rooms with other classmates.

'Ying even chose to live on the west side of campus, where it is comparatively cheaper and less safe.'

The friends ended the statement by imploring people to 'ignore the rumors and help tell the truth', reports the Times.

Paramedics took the victims to 
downtown's California Hospital Medical Centre where they were announced 
dead on arrival, authorities said.

'This is every parent's nightmare,â€™police Cmdr. Andrew Smith told the Associated Press.

The couple were both graduate students from China studying electrical engineering, the university said in a statement.

Rough around the edges: The neighbourhood, though gentrifying, is in a seedy area of Los Angeles

Investigators say it may 
have been a robbery or a carjacking attempt. Witnesses said the car was 
in the roadway, not at the curb, at the time of the shooting.

The
 gunman fled and no one has been arrested, Cmdr. Smith said. Police have
 taken the BMW away for examination and were attempting to determine if 
there were any surveillance cameras in the area.

Four people have been killed this year in the area, police said, but violent crime is down 20 per cent this year.

Gloria Tigolo lives on the street 
where the shooting occurred and said she heard a single gunshot. She 
went downstairs but didn't go outside because it was raining. 'It was 
just one big shot,' she said. 'I am amazed that one gunshot could kill 
two people.'

Investigators said earlier that several shots were fired at the couple.

Ms Tigolo said the area is peaceful 
and this is the first shooting she can recall since she moved to the 
neighbourhood three years ago.
