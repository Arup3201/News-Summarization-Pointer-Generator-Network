Energy prices in Britain will rise unless urgent action is taken to prevent Russia holding countries to ransom by cutting off gas supplies, a minister has warned.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin could quickly force up costs for families in the UK.

Energy security will be high on the agenda of a meeting of the G7 meeting in Rome early next month.

A quarter of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, half of which passes through Ukraine which has been the focus of mounting tensions after the Crimea region was annexed by Moscow.

Last week President Putin insisted it was ‘impossible’ for Europe to stop buying gas from Russia.

In Britain there is growing concern about the impact of moves by Russia to use gas supplies to increase its stranglehold on the region.

Ministers from Britain will join counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US to draw up a plan to speed up alternative energy supplies.

The G7 talks on May 5 and 6 will examine how to increase gas storage, find alternative supplies and reopen nuclear power stations which have been closed down.

Mr Davey said: ‘It can’t be right for Russia to hold individual countries to ransom. This is an issue we cannot allow to go off the table.

‘There have been at least two, if not three, occasions in recent times when Russia has sought to use its energy superpower status in quite an aggressive manner,’ he told The Times.

‘If this [the current Ukraine crisis] goes away, who is to say it won’t happen again? Putin wrote his Phd about the possibility of Russia using energy to reassert its political status.’

Tensions have mounted over Russian gas supplies to Ukraine, and the wider impact on the rest of Europe

He insisted that the EU should show ‘solidarity’  with countries at risk from Russian aggression and show ‘we mean business’.

‘If, because of Russian action, EU gas prices go up, that affects consumers and businesses here very quickly. Gas and energy goes around the world, so we are interrelated.

‘We have got to look at everything, from more diversified supplies of gas, whether it’s from the US, from shale, or helping other countries who are demanding a lot of gas now but who needn’t. Maybe Japan will turn on some of its reactors.’

Russian Vladimir Putin

However, President Putin has been dismissive of the idea that countries will reduce their demand for Russian gas.

In an interview last week, he said: ‘Of course, everyone is taking care about supply diversification. There, in Europe, they talk about increasing independence from the Russian supplier... It's just like we begin to talk and take action towards independence from our consumers.'

'We sell gas in European countries which have around 30-35 percent of their gas balance covered by supplies from Russia. Can they stop buying Russian gas? In my opinion it is impossible.'

EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger also opposes cutting back gas ties with Russia.

In an interview with Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Oettinger conceded there is a risk of Russia cutting supplies to Ukraine, an important transit country, over unpaid bills.

But he added: ‘We agree that the gas sector should not be a priority in possible economic sanctions — whether on the European or Russian side.’

He added that he is ‘against reducing or even breaking off gas relations with Russia in the coming years. However, we must pursue our diversification strategy’.
