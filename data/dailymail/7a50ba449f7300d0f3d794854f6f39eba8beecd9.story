Ronny Deila branded Craig Gordon ‘fantastic’ after the Celtic keeper produced a top-drawer display to earn his side a Europa League point in Salzburg.

The Scottish champions twice took the lead in the Red Bull Arena with goals in each half from debutant Wakaso Mubarak and a deflected Scott Brown effort. It took a blistering free-kick from Salzburg’s skipper Jonathan Soriano 12 minutes from time to salvage a 2-2 draw after Brazilian Alan had cancelled out Mubarak’s opener with a wicked deflection off Efe Ambrose.

But the hosts would surely have had all three points but for a sublime Gordon fingertip stop in the first half and a stunning double save in the second.

‘Craig’s performance was just marvellous,’ said Deila, with the Scotland international fast consigning £10million predecessor Fraser Forster to history. ‘I think he has been good all season but he’s progressing all the time and getting better and better.

‘He is a top professional and a fantastic man, a good boy. I am so glad to have him in the group.

‘Before I came to Celtic I had only seen him on TV when he played for Sunderland so I didn’t know all about him.

‘But (goalkeeping coach) Stevie Woods told me he was ready and he is showing he’s such a fantastic goalkeeper. He is back at the level he was at before with Stevie training him so well. He’s done such a fantastic job, too.

‘Together they have got back again – and they will keep on going. Craig has just been a fantastic signing for us. We had a fantastic goalkeeper in Fraser Forster but now we have another one – and a fantastic goalkeeping coach.’

Gordon’s form has been stunning and he is proving the doubters wrong after returning from two years on the sidelines with a knee injury.

Salzburg coach Adi Sutter echoed his opposite number, saying of Gordon’s display: ‘He was fantastic and saved a point for Celtic.’

Celtic were accused of penny pinching after replacing Forster with a free transfer, but Deila believes the former Hearts man is making his point on the pitch.

‘I think so. He is very professional and he knows his body very well. He will work all the time but you never know in football - things can happen tomorrow, but so far he has been fantastic and if we keep him fit he will continue to be that.

‘I think we have improved in the back four. We have to work on the right side because we had some trouble in the second half, but it was a good performance and the central defenders are working well together.

‘Jason Denayer has been a very good signing and Virgil (van Dijk) is improving with every match he plays at a high level. That gives me a good feeling.’

Deila was also delighted with Mubarak’s debut goal and performance and sees signs of improvement in his team after a dismal double exit from the Champions League to Legia Warsaw and Maribor.

‘I love to work in football to create things and I think now we are progressing. We see there is a lot of work to do to get even better.

Ronny Deila praised his goalkeeper Craig Gordon and was pleased with the progress his team are making

‘I want to control the matches more than we do by controlling the ball, but that will take time. We need more fitness and quickness on the ball and that’s what we are going to work on this year so that hopefully we will be more ready for the Champions League.’

Meanwhile, Scott Brown will today make his own way back from Austria - after Celtic were forced to leave their captain behind in Salzburg. 

The closure of the local airport at 11pm local time prompted a Celtic dash for their flight minutes after the 2-2 draw, but goalscorer Brown had been called in for a UEFA drugs test and was unable to produce a urine sample quickly. 

Aleksandar Tonev was also tested and made the plane in time but Brown was less fortunate and will fly home alone ahead of Sunday’s game with Motherwell.
