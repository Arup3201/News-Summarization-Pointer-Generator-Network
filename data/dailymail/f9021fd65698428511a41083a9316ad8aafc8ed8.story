Plasticine superstars Wallace and Gromit may have had their final adventure, according to their Oscar-winning creator.

Nick Park said he was unsure whether to continue the much-loved British comedy without actor Peter Sallis, who has voiced Wallace since 1990 when he accepted the voiceover job for £25, yet is growing increasingly frail at 93.

The voice of the veteran, who starred in Last of the Summer Wine, is inextricably linked with Wensleydale-loving Wallace, – but Sallis is said to be in poor health.

The creator of Wallace and Gromit has said he is unsure whether to continue with the comedy

He suffers from the eye condition macular degeneration and hasn’t voiced the character since the Wallace and Gromit World of Invention series on the BBC four years ago.

Instead, Ben Whitehead, 38, has worked as his stand-in in recent projects such as a live show at the Proms and a computer game.

Park, 55, said of Sallis: ‘He’s not too well. It’s a big question for us – whether to keep going.’

Nick Park first contacted Peter Sallis in 1982 when the stop-motion animator was still at film school working on a Grand Day Out.

He decided the actor, who was starring as Clegg in the BBC comedy Last of the Summer Wine, was perfect to voice Wensleydale-loving Wallace.

Speaking at the 25th anniversary celebrations for Leith School of Art in Edinburgh, Mr Park said: ‘Peter was really my only choice.

‘Surprisingly, he agreed to do it. I offered him 25 quid. He just said yes, and came round. Then it was the way he said ‘cheese’.

Wallace actually didn’t have a wide mouth until Peter said ‘cheese’. It has been lovely to get to know him over the years.’
