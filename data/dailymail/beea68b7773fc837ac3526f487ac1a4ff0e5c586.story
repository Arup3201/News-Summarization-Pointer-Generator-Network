A top female judge whose partner left her for an Oxford graduate 50 years his junior has claimed he is the real victim of the affair - not her.

Anthony Arlidge QC jilted Constance Briscoe, 55, after 12 years together,  and moved in with barrister Heather Lockwood, 25, at his Middle Temple digs.

Despite admitting her heart was broken by the affair, Judge Briscoe, who famously wrote her memoir Ugly based on the neglect 
and cruelty she overcame during her upbringing, said Arlidge and his new lovers are the ones who should be pitied.

Split: Anthony Arlidge QC, right, jilted judge Constance Briscoe, left, 
for 25-year-old barrister Heather Lockwood. However, Judge Briscoe says he is the real victim of the break-up, not her

'I don't ever want anyone to feel sorry for me because I don't feel sorry for myself and I don't think I'm the victim,' she told the Sunday Telegraph.

'I think the victim here is Tony, he's a victim of himself.

'I think she is a victim and that collectively they are the ones we should feel sorry for.'

Revealing her heartbreak at the split in 
Judge Briscoe, Britain's most famous black judge, said in an email to Arlidge that he had 'crushed [her] soul and stole [her] heart.

However, in an remarkable sign of forgiveness, she said that if Mr Arlidge is ever ill or lonely he should call her and that she would 'always be there' for him.

Judge Briscoe is reported to have been amazed when told of the age difference between the barrister and his new lover.

Romance: Mr Arlidge and his new girlfriend are reported to have met at a dinner at Middle Temple, in London, last September

Arlidge, a former Crown Court Recorder whose cases have included 
the prosecution of murderer Jeremy Bamber, is reported to have met Ms Lockwood at a 
dinner at Middle Temple, in London, last September where she was a 
student and he was Master of Entertainments.

A
grandfather of nine, Arlidge remains married to his wife Enid, the 
mother of his four children. 

Their 48th wedding anniversary is next 
week, but they separated nearly three decades ago.

He then lived for 16 years with QC Tracy Ayling and, after that, he romanced Judge Briscoe.

Judge Briscoe, who has two children aged 25 and 22 by solicitor Adam 
Wilson had earlier said: ‘Tony left me saying he had fallen in love with a girl who was 
aged 25.

'To fall for someone just a few years older than my 
own son and daughter — effectively his stepchildren — is just plain 
daft.'

Arlidge’s mid-life bombshell occurred just as Judge Briscoe and he were working out ways to spend his impending retirement including buying a house in the South of France.

Durham-born Miss Lockwood, described as ‘tall and blonde’, was called to the Bar at the Middle 
Temple two years ago.
