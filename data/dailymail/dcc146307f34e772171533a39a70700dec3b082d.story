Former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze insists Angel di Maria is one of the four best players in the world.

The 26-year-old made his £60million move from Real Madrid to United during the summer's transfer window, and has hit the ground running in the Premier League with three goals in five games, including a sublime chip against Leicester.

Heinze, now retired, was in the same Argentina squad as Di Maria for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, and the 36-year-old could not praise Old Trafford's newest star enough.

'Anything I say about Angel Di Maria is not enough. For me, he's one of the four best players in the world,' Heinze said, as reported by Goal.

'He's already reached an amazing level and arrived at an amazing club where they will look after him and he'll perform really well for them. I think everyone needs time to adapt, especially in the English league.

'You need to adapt but the club can help you and Manchester United will make things easier for you.'

Di Maria won't be in action for United until October 20 as the Premier League breaks for international matches.
