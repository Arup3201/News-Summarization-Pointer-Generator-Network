Former nurse Iain Balsillie, pictured, who placed women in a trance so he could grope them, has been caught illegally accessing a hypnotic website

A former nurse who placed women in a trance so he could grope them has been caught illegally accessing a hypnotic website.

Iain Balsillie used the trigger words 'drop for me' in an attempt to make women fall into his arms, before sexually assaulting them.

Balsillie, 44, had breached a Sexual Offences Prevention Order by browsing an online site that carried information on hypnosis, Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard

The order, made by a judge in Manchester in 2008, banned Balsillie from accessing Internet sites displaying erotic or hypnotic material.

It was imposed at Minshull Street Crown Court under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 after he carried out a sex attack on a woman in Manchester and was jailed for 12 months.

He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.

But in August this year, police carrying out regular computer checks at his home in Rosyth, Fife discovered he had been logging on to a website which describes itself as a 'BDSM & fetish community'.

Balsillie pleaded guilty to knowingly visiting a hypnosis portal on the members-only site between August 28 and 30 2012 at his home in Rosyth, without reasonable excuse.

The court heard that he was arrested and taken into custody when officers discovered he had been browsing the site.

Sheriff Ian Abercrombie warned Balsillie that breaching a court order was a 'serious matter' but he noted that he had cooperated with social work reports.

The sheriff placed him on a community payback order, with a six month supervision requirement.

He will be monitored by social workers during that period and will have to notify the police of any change of address.

In 2007, Balsillie was fired from BSkyB's Dunfermline call centre, where he worked as an occupational nurse, after two female workers claimed he tried to put them in a trance before inappropriately touching them.

Following the incidents in Fife, he was convicted of the attack on a woman in Manchester and struck off the nursing register.

Speaking during a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing in 2009, his victims said he would say 'drop for me' in an attempt to make them fall into his arms, after which he would grab them by the breasts and, in one case, lower her head on to his private parts.

The 2009 hearing heard that one of the women had been referred to the Balsillie in September 2007 for recurring back problems, and because she had taken an excessive amount of time off work for high blood pressure.

Balsillie said that he would teach her relaxation techniques to help lower her blood pressure.

After taking a reading, he carried out a standard relaxation technique, before moving on to the hypnosis.

The witness said: 'I had learnt similar relaxation techniques some time before during ante-natal classes and I thought I knew what to expect.

'He told me to close my eyes and imagine myself in a happy place.

'He said to imagine I was standing on a beach with the sun on my face, looking out at the view.'

The woman's blood pressure dropped but Balsillie said that he would carry out the exercise again, moving closer to her and making inappropriate remarks, she said.

The witness said: 'He was sitting right next to me - I could smell the sweat on his body and hear him breathing heavily. It was very uncomfortable.

'He told me that I would become more relaxed when I heard his voice, and that I would become excited when I saw him.

'He also stated that I would not remember anything from the trance, except that his voice would make me calm, and seeing him would make me excited.'

She added that she felt uncomfortable because she had no control over her body and felt like she was under a local anaesthetic, saying: 'I was aware of things going on around me but I could not open my eyes or move my body'.

When she returned to her work station, the patient complained about Balsillie to her line manager.

But later the same day, Balsillie approached her on her way out of work and asked her to sign a GP consent form.

She said that although she didn't want to see him, she went into his office but left the door open.

She said: 'When I put my hand on the doorknob to leave, he placed his hand against the door to stop me, clicked his fingers and said 'drop for me now'.

'My legs just gave way - the next thing I remember is lying on the floor. It happened really quickly.

'As he pulled me to my feet, he placed his arms under my breasts.'

She later learned that a similar complaint had previously been made about Balsillie by another BSkyB employee.

Striking him from the nursing register, Nursing and Midwifery Council chairman Laurence Peterken said that Balsillie had abused the trust placed in him by his patients.

Mr Peterken said: 'He sought to control the patients by way of hypnosis and by way of the use of control words, in particular the phrase "drop for me".'
