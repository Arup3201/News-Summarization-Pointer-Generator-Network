No remorse: Serial Killer Rose West who is serving a life term at Low Newton prison in Durham

Rosemary West is so happy in prison she wants to die there, the Mail can reveal.

Days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Cromwell Street House of Horrors case, a close associate of the 60-year-old serial killer says she has no interest in fighting her ‘life means life’ sentence because she enjoys living behind bars.

West, who was convicted of a total of ten murders in 1995, lives in a top-security prison at a cost of £50,000 a year to the taxpayer.

There the psychopath enjoys listening to The Archers on Radio 4, playing Monopoly, embroidery, cooking and shopping from catalogues. According to well-placed sources, she also loves beauty products from Avon and trinkets from Argos, which she has delivered. Her ‘cell’ at top security Low Newton jail in Durham features a TV, radio, CD player and her own bathroom.

Sex-obsessed West, whose husband killed himself shortly before he was due to stand trial alongside her for 12 murders, has also had a series of lesbian affairs behind bars. She reportedly earns £16 a week as an orderly after being promoted from a cleaner. One of her duties is said to include making tea for the warders.

Her fondness for her life in jail makes a mockery of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, rejected this week by the Court of Appeal, that whole-life tariffs are unlawful.

And it will infuriate relatives of the nine girls and young women who were raped, tortured and murdered by West, with her equally depraved husband Fred, and buried at their terraced home in Gloucester.

After Rose was convicted, some of the victims’ families complained that the murderess would never have to worry about food, heating and accommodation bills in prison.

Next Wednesday, it will be exactly 20 years since police discovered the remains of the Wests’ missing 16-year-old daughter Heather – and another human thigh bone – buried in the back garden at 25 Cromwell Street.

Heather, who disappeared in 1987, was the first of nine girls and young women whose remains were found at the Wests’ home.

A further three victims were found buried elsewhere, including Fred’s eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine who was murdered by Rose at a previous address in 1971, while he was in prison.

Despite the overwhelming prosecution evidence at her trial, Rose has always denied being a killer.

The Mail can also reveal that West’s own lawyer has urged her to come clean about what happened and where other victims may have been buried. Not only has she refused, she has snubbed a letter of forgiveness from one of her victim’s relatives. Marian Partington, whose university student sister Lucy, 21, was abducted and murdered by the Wests in 1973, revealed two years ago that after much soul-searching she had written to West in prison and offered her forgiveness.

The details are contained in her book, If You Sit Very Still, published in 2012. In the letter, which she wrote in 2004 but waited four years to post, she told West: ‘I do not feel any hostility towards you, just a sadness, a deep sadness, that all this has happened, and that your heart could not feel a truth that I wish you could know.’

A few weeks later, she received a letter written on behalf of West from prison, pointedly not accepting her forgiveness and asking Ms Partington to ‘cease all correspondence’.

The Mail has learned that in 2001, West contacted a member of her legal team, who was submitting a new application on her behalf to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, to say she never wanted to come out of jail.

A source said: ‘She made it clear she was happy in prison and wanted to make her life there. She said she didn’t want to appeal against her convictions but she didn’t admit to killing anyone.’

West’s former lawyer Leo Goatley declined to comment on why she had dropped her appeal. But he urged her, for the sake of the victims, to reveal exactly what had happened at Cromwell Street.

He said: ‘It was never established in the investigation what fate precisely fell on the victims.

‘We know they were murdered, dismembered and buried. But there is that void at the centre of the case. People involved in the case could move on if [the facts] could be established.’

Mr Goatley said there is ‘strong evidence’ that schoolgirl Mary Bastholm, 15, who disappeared in 1968, was one of Fred’s early victims.

Mary’s brother Peter Bastholm said he has considered making an appeal to West to finally tell the whole truth.

‘But Rose hasn’t an ounce of compassion, humanity or goodness in her body,’ he said. ‘Rehabilitation and remorse don’t apply to prisoners like her.’

Fred West escaped justice by asphyxiating himself in Winson Green prison, in Birmingham, on New Year’s Day 1995.
