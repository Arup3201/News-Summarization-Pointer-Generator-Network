Many football fans will often adorn their home with pictures of their beloved team.

But Manchester City fans Greg Collier and Rachel Nugent decided to go that little bit further than most.

The dedicated Blues supporters turned their bathroom wall into a shrine to their heroes by building this amazing 2,000 tile mosaic of the club’s crest.

Fans: Greg Collier and Rachel Nugent created this 5ft mosaic of the Manchester City Football Club in their bathroom - with the project even leading to the couple's engagement

And after spending six months working together on the mosaic - Mr Collier decided it would be the perfect backdrop for him to ask his girlfriend for her hand in marriage.

To complete the 5ft dazzling design, Mr Collier, 37, and Miss Nugent, 30, patiently stuck each individual tile chip to the wall.

Miss Nugent, who works as a legal secretary, said: 'We moved into the house a couple of years ago and were doing it up.

'Some tiling was done in the bathroom but there was one wall remaining which looked a bit bare, so I suggested making a colourful mosaic City crest out of the remaining tiles.

'I was a bit of a whacky idea, but everyone understands our love for the team. We’re season ticket holders and never miss a game, so I don’t think anyone would expect anything less.'

Lifelong supporter Mr Collier, who previously installed three stars on his garden footpath in celebration of last year’s Premier League title win, thought it was a cracking idea and sketched out a design.

Mr Collier, who lives in Newall Green, Manchester, with Miss Nugent and her four-year-old son Lewis, said: 'I have always loved drawing and loved the idea of completing a project together.

'We spent about six months in there, determined to get a little bit more done when we could. We used hammers to smash the tiles into minute pieces and even had to round some of them off with a file, to create curved edges.

He said: 'We then had to paint each piece separately and it was very tough at times, making sure everything was symmetrical.

'We spent about 30 minutes on it each night and we encouraged each other to keep going.'

And Mr Collier, who was hoping to pop the question at the Ethihad ground in front of thousands of fans, decided to propose to his girlfriend in the bathroom.

He said: 'I was going to as Rachel to marry me by putting it up on the big advertising screens at the football, but a guy who sits behind us at every game bet me to it.

'I figured, since we were spending so much time in the bathroom working on the mosaic, I thought it would be quite special and memorable.'

And the proposal was totally unexpected for Miss Collier, who had just finished working on the piece that night.

She said: 'It was like we were living in the bathroom and after spending a bit of time on the mosaic, I decided to run myself a lovely bath. I was lying back, relaxing. I closed my eyes for a second and when I opened them, Greg was kneeling next to the bath.

'It was amazing and such a surprise. The mosaic will always remind me of us getting engagement.

She said: 'I’ve been there with him on so many nights chipping away at mosaic tiles.

'We’re both so passionate about the club and I think the mosaic is beautiful - it really has the wow factor.

Thrilled: Although the happy couple are yet to set a date for their wedding, they hope to marry at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium

'When our friends visit, they think we’re pretty mad, but we’re really mad about Man City. Everyone has been impressed with it, especially when you see the full size of it,' she laughed.

And the couple are planning to also have their favourite club featuring at their wedding and although they are yet to set a date for the big day, they hope to bag the Etihad Football Stadium as the venue.

Miss Collier said: 'Most brides would cringe at the thought of inviting their guests to a wedding on a football ground - not me.

'It would be a dream come true and we’ve already checked the venue out - we’d have the function in one of the suites.

'We’ll also have the team’s colours, I can just imagine everybody in light blue and white, it would just look stunning.'
