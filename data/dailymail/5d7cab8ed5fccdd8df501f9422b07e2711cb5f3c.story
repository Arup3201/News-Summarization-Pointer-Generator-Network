A rogue trader was today ordered to spend three years in prison and pay back almost £4billion  following one of the biggest frauds in financial history.

Jerome Kerviel, a 35-year-old unemployed Frenchman, insisted he was innocent of all the crimes carried out when he worked at Societe Generale Bank in Paris.

But, following a four-week trial in June, the French capital's Appeal Court ruled that he was 'solely responsible' for unauthorised deals which sent the bank’s share price into free-fall.

Going to jail: Judges have ordered rogue trader Jerome Kerviel to repay almost £4billion after one of the biggest frauds in financial history. They also upheld a three-year prison sentence that he had been given

Judges upheld an October 2010 
sentence of three years in prison with another two suspended, while 
ordering Kerviel to reimburse Societe Generale for its losses. There was
no indication as to how Kerviel will pay the money back.

Prosecutor
Dominique Gaillardot branded Kerviel a ‘perverse manipulator’ and had 
called for a maximum five-year term as ‘an example and a deterrent’ to 
others.

Kerviel was charged with breach of trust, forgery and entering false data into computers to disguise the stock market deals.

He had remained free, pending the result of his appeal, but is now set to begin his sentence.

David
Koubbi, Kerviel’s lawyer, branded the confirmed punishment a 
‘lamentable injustice’, saying that his client was a ‘scapegoat’ for a 
greedy banking system.

Kerviel did not profit personally from his 50billion euros worth of uncovered bets on futures markets.

He claimed Societe Generale turned a blind eye to his bets in late 2007 and early 2008, as long as they were making money.

Kerviel said the bank also used losses to mask the threat posed by the US subprime mortgage market.

Mr Koubbi, who accused the bank of 
doctoring secret recordings so as not to incriminate senior staff, said 
he was now considering another appeal, but this could take up to a year.

But Societe Generale lawyer Jean Veil said today’s verdict was ‘cause of great satisfaction.’

Despite attempts to reinforce internal safeguards, there have been a number of similar trading scandals since the Kerviel’s.

Last year, London-based trader Kweku Adoboli was charged with fraud after losing Swiss bank UBS more than a billion pounds.

And in July, US bank JPMorgan blamed losses of more than 4 billion pounds on one of its London trading units.
