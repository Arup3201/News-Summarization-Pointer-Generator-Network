An horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard.

Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. 

The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital.

Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' 

The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12

Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell

Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.'

He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.'

The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'.

Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.'

The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy.

He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights.

Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'.

Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.'

He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss.

Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.'

CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week.

Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.'

She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.'

Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father.

The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had 'meant the world' to her

'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.'

When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife.

Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone.

On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account.

He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'.

Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home.

He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. 

The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him.

He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms.

Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him.

When the fire crew arrived it appeared Jack had bravely tried to get out of the loft as he was found by the bottom of the ladder.

Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'.

A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze.

Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs.

One of his letters to HSBC Bank said: 'I won't be paying the mortgage any more because I won't be alive.'

Det Sgt Hall said numerous statements taken by the police showed he was at a 'particularly low point' in his life over visiting rights to his sons and took the view he would have less access.

Specialist fire investigator Michael Mason said the carpet and furniture downstairs were well alight when firefighters arrived.

'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' he said.

Two bodies were found in the loft - that of Mr Sykes and his son Paul - and Mr Sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital.

Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames.

Mr Mason said: 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. It was a natural reaction to try and get out.'

It emerged that it was Jack who opened the hatch and he was rescued conscious by firefighters but died five days later in hospital from his burns. Mr Sykes and Paul died from inhaling noxious fumes. 

In her statement, the boys' mother said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.'

When asked by the coroner if there was anything she would like to add, she replied: 'There is nothing further I can add other than the guilt I that I carry for what has happened to them.' 

The coroner recorded a verdict on Monday that Mr Sykes committed suicide. Yesterday the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing.

Coroner Dorries said: 'This fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by Mr Sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets.'
