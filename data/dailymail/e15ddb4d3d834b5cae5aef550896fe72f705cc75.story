An Ohio cheerleading coach died Monday from head injuries she sustained during a stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair, and it wasn't clear if she had undergone the organ donation surgery family members had planned while she was in a coma.

Meagan Toothman, 24, was confirmed as the seventh person to die from the August 13 stage collapse, according to a statement from the Marion County coroner's office released last night.

She had been scheduled to undergo the
 organ donation surgery Monday afternoon, but the statement didn't say 
if that had happened.

Seventh victim: Meagan Toothman, 24, a cheerleading coach, died last night from head injuries sustained in the Indiana State Fair stage collapse

Toothman's family said earlier in a 
Web journal that organ donation surgery 'will provide gifts of sight, 
health, and life to dozens who are in need'. Doctors put Toothman into a
 coma August 15 to try to ease the bruising and swelling on her brain.

'Late last night it became apparent 
that our Meagan was no longer with us,' the family wrote yesterday. 'The
 decision was made to allow to her to be at peace.'

Gift of life: Toothman's parents say their daughter's organs are being donated

Authorities erroneously reported that
 she had died late Sunday, but Marion County coroner's office 
spokeswoman Marchele Hall said Toothman remained in a coma at the time. 
Toothman was the head cheerleading coach at Turpin High School in 
Cincinnati.

'The outpouring of love and hope was 
an inspiration to all of us to keep her fighting,' her family said. 'We 
hope that she will continue to touch more lives in the same way through 
her passing.'

Toothman graduated from Wittenberg 
University in 2009 and a statement by Doctor Sarah M. Kelly, Dean of 
Students at the institution, read: 'All of us in the Wittenberg family 
are deeply saddened to learn that Meagan is no longer with us.

'Meagan represented the best of Wittenberg as both a scholar-athlete, beloved sister in her sorority and a friend to many.

'Meagan found her calling in 
supporting others. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and 
friends during this difficult time.'

Strong winds toppled a stage onto a crowd of fans as they waited for country band Sugarland to perform.

Three fans and a security guard died 
at the scene, while a fourth fan and a stagehand later died of their 
injuries. Some four dozen people were hurt, many seriously.

It was not known yesterday how many of those injured in the stage collapse remained hospitalised.

Horror: The moment strong winds caused the stage rigging for the outdoor concert to collapse at the fairground in Indianapolis

State police stopped providing 
updates on the injured last week and hospitals have not provided reports
 on the condition of those injured.

Roeland Polet, whose wife and two 
daughters had attended the concert with Toothman, told The Associated 
Press that Toothman's death would be yet another tragedy for their 
family.

His wife, Jill Polet, and their older
 daughter, Jaymie Polet, were both injured in the collapse and remain 
hospitalised but their younger daughter, Jordan, escaped injury.

'It's horrible. It is devastating for
 my family. For my daughter, she was like a big sister. They were 
extremely close,' Polet said of his daughter Jaymie and Toothman.

He said both Jill and Jaymie, who are in separate hospitals in Indianapolis, are 'in very rough shape.'

He said it's unclear when they will be released and both suffered multiple fractures.

Jaymie had been a cheerleader at 
Turpin High School and had planned to try out for cheerleader at Indiana
 University, where she's enrolled for this fall. Polet said IU officials
 came to the hospital Sunday with T-shirts and banners for her.

The horrifying moment when the stage collapsed during a storm at the Indiana State Fair was captured on video.

Fans screamed hysterically after strong winds caused the stage rigging for the outdoor concert to collapse on top of them shortly before 9pm as a country music band were about to perform.

Emergency
 crews were called to the scene to tend to those trapped beneath the 
stage and workers set up a command centre to treat to those who were 
injured.

Children were among 45 people who were badly hurt.

Thousands
 of concert-goers had to be evacuated to a nearby building because of 
high winds of up to 60mph when the rigging for the stage fell onto the 
track where some were seated.

'It
 was like it was in slow motion,' concert-goer Amy Weathers told the 
Indianapolis Star. 'You couldn't believe it was actually happening.'

Those
 who were injured were being moved to a tunnel below the stage, the Star
 reported. A hole was being dug to try to reach those trapped beneath 
the rigging.

One of those killed was stagehand Nate Byrd, 51, who was on the rigging to run the show's spotlight.

Mr Byrd was crushed after he fell to the ground with the stage and died on Sunday at Methodist Hospital.

Also killed on the scene were Tammy 
Vandam, 42, of Wanatah, Indiana; Glenn Goodrich, 49, of Indianapolis; 
Alina BigJohny, 23 of Fort Wayne and Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago,
 according to the Marion County Coroner's office.

Alina, a 23-year-old teacher, can be seen in pictures happily smiling for the camera before the accident claimed her young life.

Other shots show Christina Santiago, 29, who also died in the accident.

Jennifer Haskell, a senior at Ball State University 22-year-old college student is the sixth person.
