Reading have completed the signing of former Everton and Middlesbrough striker Yakubu on a short-term deal.

Now 32, the ex-Nigeria international had been plying his trade in Qatar with Al Rayyan, but was available to Reading boss Steve Clarke as a free agent.

Upon signing, the new Reading forward commented: 'The Yak arrives in Reading, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to give everything, come on the Yak, we're ready to go.'

Yakubu first came to England on loan to Portsmouth from Maccabi Haifa, before joining the club on a permanent deal in 2003. 

From there, he had spells at Middlesbrough and Everton, where he scored 25 goals at each, before securing a move to Blackburn in 2011.

He left England two years ago to continue his career at Guangzhou in China, but has now returned to play in the Championship.

Yakubu becomes Reading's third arrival in the January window, following the loan signing of Chelsea starlet Nathaniel Chalobah and Slovenian left-back Jure Travner.
