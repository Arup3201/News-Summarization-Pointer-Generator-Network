It's not top of most people's weekly shopping list.

But Jackie Winston-Jones set off to do her regular shop at Tesco three weeks ago - and came back with a horse.

Since then, Jackie, 50, has gone on to rescue nine ponies from the butchers' knives, bidding directly against the buyer from Red Lion Abattoir near Nantwich, Cheshire.

The mother-of-four has transformed the lounge at her Cheshire farm into a stable for her latest pony, Jaz, 12, who she paid just £150 for.

Jackie, who runs a kennel, is now planning to start a horse sanctuary with the help of Hillside Animal Sanctuary, which blew the whistle on the mistreatment at Red Lion Abattoir last month.

Jackie first saved a Welsh Bay Cob at Beeston Market near Chester for £200.

She said: 'My husband Laurie couldn't believe his eyes when I turned up with my first horse, Maid. I'd set out to Tesco to do the weekly shop but then suddenly remembered it was Beeston Auction Mart where the horses go under the hammer for next to nothing.

'I turned around and headed straight there, saw Maid on Death Row - the area where the meat horses wait outside in the car park for auction - and went in and haggled for her with a dealer against the abattoir man. He wasn't pleased.

'A friend at the sale loaned me her horse box and I took her home. When my husband Laurie saw what I'd done he just said I was crazy.'

Last Wednesday, Jackie went back to Beeston with £200 in her pocket. She expected to buy one or two ponies - and came back with eight ponies.

They included Jaz, a former top riding school pony with a sackful of rosettes for wins over her 12-year life. Another was a pregnant foal with another foal alongside her.

'I couldn't just stand by and watch them sold and carted off to Red Lion Abattoir to be slaughtered for the meat market. I didn't have enough cash but my son Matthew who was with me dashed to the cash point and drew out what he could.

'I paid for one by credit card, and there was a friend there who said she would buy a horse if I looked after it. I got money off another friend there and a lady who came forward and said she'd have one. Somehow I got enough together for the lot.

'I outbid the abattoir man. I was determined they weren't going through those gates at the abattoir. He wasn't happy, but I guess he'll have his day another time in another place.'

The horse lover said she had the horses checked over by a vet when she got them home. Luckily, they were all given a clean bill of health.

She now plans to set up a charity which will own the horses and loan them to carers who have been fully vetted.

'I can't look after them all on just two to three acres but this way we can monitor the horses at their new homes and because the charity owns them we can make sure they are well kept. Only trusted keepers will be allowed to have them. The idea is to set up lifetime homes for them.

'Now, we're desperately trying to re-home them through our Facebook page.'

'It's already growing through word of mouth with well wishers arriving with feed and horse blankets and odd bits of kit. But the loose box I've got is too small for eight so Jazz has to bed down in the lounge until we sort out more space. I don't mind, it's worth it just to see her happy.

'We're determined the cruelty and the horse meat trade has to stop, I won't rest until Red Lion and places like it are closed down for good.

'It is such a shame these horses are cast off like this. There wasn't really a bad one among them.

'Yes they were scruffy, but with a bit of TLC, good food and water they can be brought back. To think by now, they would all be killed and into the food process is appalling.

'It's taken over my whole life, but I will not rest while these lovely animals face a dreadful fate. Through the internet, and Facebook, we can reach out to those who care.'
