A new low-cost air carrier has unveiled a ‘hipster-chic’ uniform for cabin crew in a bid to ensure that their service appeals to younger travelers.

Air Canada unveiled the uniform for its new discount international airline Air Canada Rouge on Monday, which includes fedoras and cardigans.

Since the service is aimed at a younger market than the more traditional service run by Air Canada's main brand, it has decided to take a somewhat unorthodox approach to cabin wear to help foster a ‘fresh, comfortable, and vacation-like environment.’

Too cool for the skies? Air Canada Rouge has unveiled its hipster-inspired uniform

Hat's the way I like it: Despite critics claims that Air Canada Rouge are a 'tad late'  in issuing fedoras to cabin crew, the company claims the look is 'fashion-forward'

The airline, which launches on July 1, claims the look is ‘fashion forward’ and plans to keep the uniforms in service for the next five to seven years.

Critics however have been quick to pounce on the airline’s attempt to give the uniform a ‘hipster makeover,’ claiming that the airline is ‘a tad late on the “cool hat” bandwagon’.

Rather than evoking the trendy New York neighborhood of Williamsburg, the uniform makes the cabin crew look more like extras from ‘Glee’.

Commentators have also questioned how the 'young look' will work on real hostesses and older workers.

As well as the offending fedoras, the uniforms also include scarfs, trousers, and gray and red Fluevog brand shoes for female staff

As well as the offending fedoras, the uniforms also include cardigans, trousers, and gray and red Fluevog brand shoes.

The criticism doesn't seem to bothering Air Canada Rouge in the slightest.

‘Our personality, which is fresh and youthful, seems to be the impression that’s coming through,’ Renee Smith-Valade, vice president of customer experience, told Bloomberg Businessweek.

‘The terms being used so far all have a youthful, on-trend context so that’s a success in our books.’

Cool uniform: Air Canada claims to have received more than 5,000 résumés for flight attendant positions

Air Canada Rouge flight attendants have also been receiving customer service training at the Disney Institute in Florida.

The airline also received flak after it emerged that Rouge staff have to pay $2,000 towards the training. The staff will repay Air Canada $49 a month for the 
next three years to cover their training and if they leave the job before then, they’ll
still owe the money.

That hasn’t stopped people flocking to apply to work for the airline.

Since announcing the new carrier last year, Air Canada claims to have received more than 5,000 résumés for flight attendant positions.

Critics claims that cabin crew on Air Canada Rouge resemble extras from Glee rather than hipsters from the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg
