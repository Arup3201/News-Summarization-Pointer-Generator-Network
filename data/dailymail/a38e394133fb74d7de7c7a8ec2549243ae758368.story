Six out of ten Brits regularly wake up in a bad mood, research revealed yesterday.

A study found that on average, at least two mornings a week are blighted by black moods.

That equates to 6,292 strops over the course of a lifetime.

Factors: The biggest cause for grumpiness is a bad night's sleep, followed by a heavy workload to face when we get to the office

The biggest cause for grumpiness is a bad night's sleep, followed by a heavy workload to face when we get to the office.

One in ten admitted they were 'shattered' when they woke up, while another 10 per cent said work issues made them stroppy in the mornings.

One in four of those polled by Triton Showers said they automatically woke up in a grumpy mood, often for no reason.

Triton spokesman Tina Simpson said: 'Waking up in a foul mood is something we can all relate to, but over 6,000 mornings of our lives ruined by a shocking mood does sound rather high.

'Many families will be able to relate to all the grumbles that are in this list, such as queuing to get in the bathroom, having no milk for a hot drink and waking up to bad weather.

'However it’s interesting to see that, 
rather than breakfast, a refreshing shower, hot drink and spell of good 
weather are the top three things we need to lift our mood and sets us up
 for the day ahead.'

But it's not all doom and gloom, with nearly half of the 2,000 adults polled saying their first tea or coffee of the day makes them feel automatically better.

Water wake up: A hot shower lifts a third of people from their misery

A hot shower also lifts a third of us from our dark mood, but  21 per cent say a colder, refreshing shower is more likely to do the trick.

Other grumbles which are likely to worsen our mood before we leave the house are quarrelling with family members or someone taking too long in the shower.

Seeing bad weather when opening the curtains, stubbing toes and having no milk for a morning cuppa are other contributory factors.

Of those polled 44 per cent said they had a strict morning routine they stick to and if they had to forgo their morning shower or coffee 49 per cent said it would ruin their day.

Other morning mishaps that are likely to put Brits in a bad mood were the car not starting and missing the bus or train.

Of
 the 2,000 adults polled 14 per cent said bathroom politics was a 
problem in their household and 16 per cent said there was always a race 
to the bathroom.

Nearly half of those surveyed said they took their bad mood out on their partner, although one in four said their kids bore the brunt of it.

A brave one in ten said they always took out their bad mood on their boss.

But the black mood doesn’t last long with most people saying their frostiness had thawed by 8.15am.

Three in ten said a bright sunny morning automatically lifted their spirits.

And surprisingly 26 per cent of people said their mood improved once they got to work.
