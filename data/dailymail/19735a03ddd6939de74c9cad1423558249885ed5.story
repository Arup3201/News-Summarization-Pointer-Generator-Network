Trial: Ray Teret (pictured last month), 73, faces historical sexual allegations from 17 women

Jimmy Savile once lived in a black-painted room in a derelict property that was ‘like a haunted house’, a former DJ accused of helping him rape a girl told a court yesterday.

Ray Teret, who the jury heard has a separate conviction for having sex with an underage girl, is accused of raping the 15-year-old moments after she had been attacked by Savile in the early 1960s.

Giving evidence in his defence, the 73-year-old former Radio Caroline presenter recalled how Savile – who had taught him how to DJ – lived alone in just one room in an otherwise tumbledown house at the time. ‘It was a big old rambling Victorian square building,’ he said. 

‘A house of three floors, totally detached. It was like a haunted house.

‘It was a joke really. It was derelict. There were no lights in the corridor. There was just one room at the front. When he moved into it all the plaster had come off the walls. He got a doorman he knew to fill it all in matt black. He didn’t have a television. He didn’t have a kettle.’

Teret,  of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, faces historical sexual allegations from 17 women who say he sexually abused them in various decades from the 1960s to the 1990s.

One of the alleged victims says she was raped aged 15 by Teret almost immediately after she was raped by Savile in a flat when the defendant had driven her from a disco.

Ex-Radio Caroline DJ Teret, 73, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child.

Before he went into the witness box at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to give evidence in his defence the jury was told that Teret was convicted in March 1999 of having unlawful intercourse with a girl under 16. He had pleaded not guilty at Manchester Crown Court to the offence committed in February 1998.

Outlining his personal background, Teret told his barrister, Nicholas Johnson, how he first met Savile in the late 1950s when the then Mecca dancehall manager presented him with £5 for winning a singing contest at The Plaza ballroom in Oxford Street, Manchester.

Teret said: ‘He was not known as Jimmy Savile then. It was Mr Savile. Black shirt, straight hair. He gave me the money. He didn't know who I was.’

He was later given a job there as a cleaner in return for his sixpence entry, he said. Teret went on to become a waiter at The Ritz ballroom in Manchester city centre and it was there that he met Savile again who remembered him as ‘the singer’.

Mr Johnson asked him: ‘Did he offer you a job?’ The defendant replied: ‘He said he had now left Mecca and said he was going to open a club in Broughton.

‘He said he was going to run it. Salford Council had offered him this building to see if he could make some business. Saturday night was empty and would he like to set up a disco for over-16s.

‘He wanted me to be a trainee disc jockey. That I would learn how to do it properly, how to do the presentation, how to make people dance and not stop.

‘The fact that Mr Savile had two decks himself and he was in this hall on the stage that was quite high, I was quite excited to be in that environment.’

He said that initially Savile wanted him to come down to what became Jimmy Savile's Disc Club and observe from the back of the hall.

‘I had to sit there for the whole four hours and at the end of it Mr Savile would say "see you next week",’ he told the jury. ‘That was it for four weeks.’

At the end of the fourth week he told him to come in at 7am the next week, he said.

Teret said: ‘He explained how to count the beats on the record, the tempo. How to project to the back of the hall rather than shouting, things like that.

‘He told me to do the first hour which was nerve-wracking. I was learning to be a disc jockey. He said to me if I came every week he would give me five shillings for my bus fare.’

Mr Johnson asked him if there were rules at the club about fraternising with customers.

He replied: ‘When I first came in my job was to walk around and say good evening to everyone but we could not fraternise as in boyfriend/girlfriend ways.’

Savile lived in a Victorian house in Great Clowes Street, Higher Broughton, near to the club, the jury has heard. 

Mr Johnson said the woman who complained she had been raped by Teret and Savile said she had met Teret earlier on a Friday night in the 1960s at the Rialto premises in Higher Broughton.

Teret said that was not possible as he did not work Fridays.

The alleged victim said Teret chatted her up on the dancefloor stage before he drove her in a green bubble car to a nearby property where Savile was.

Teret said club rules prohibited anyone from sitting on stage and would lead to ejection. He said he had never driven a green bubble car.

Mr Johnson asked him: ‘Did you ever take anyone back to a premises where Jimmy Savile was and both have sex with them?’

Teret replied: ‘I have never had sex with anyone in the same room and certainly not with Mr Savile.’

The complainant told the jury that her grandmother later went down to the Rialto to confront Teret about what the complainant said had happened.

Teret denied that had taken place. He said: ‘No-one has ever approached me about anything like that at any time in my life.’

Another complainant recalled Teret driving her in a pale blue bubble car to meet Savile after they had previously kissed at Jimmy Savile's Disc Club night at the Rialto.

Teret said: ‘I know nothing of that. The rules of kissing in the club were that you could only kiss someone on the hand. That's it.’

Mr Johnson asked: ‘Did you ever leave the disco while it was going on with a customer?’

The defendant said: ‘When I was not playing records, I was handing his (Savile's) records on the stage. I was not allowed to go to the loo. There was only two of us.’

His barrister went on: ‘Were you allowed to drive Mr Savile's bubble car?’

Teret replied: ‘I didn't have a licence. He would not insure his vehicle for anybody else.’

Mr Johnson said: ‘Did you ever take any girl or woman to see Mr Savile in a premises in or near Great Clowes Street (where Savile lived)?’

Teret replied: ‘No, Mr Savile did not have a phone in that building. I could not phone to make an appointment. The only appointment I had with him was “I will see you next week” and that was it.’

Two other men are on trial with Teret. Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, an indecent assault and one count of indecency with a child.

A third defendant, William Harper, 65, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape.
