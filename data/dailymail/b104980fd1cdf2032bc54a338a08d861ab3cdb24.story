Living in a tiny converted yellow water tank on Britain's loneliest outpost, this married father has certainly found himself a location away from the crowds for a two-month summer holiday.

Nick Hancock, 39, of Ratho, Edinburgh, is living in the ‘RockPod’ for 60 days on Rockall - an eroded volcano which lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, and is just 100ft wide and 70ft high.

But the chartered surveyor is enduring 30mph winds as his quest continues to raise money for Help for Heroes, and he is learning to play the harmonica to pass time as he makes it 27 days there today.

Charity adventure: Nick Hancock, 39, of Ratho, Edinburgh, is living in the 'RockPod' for 60 days on Rockall

Remote: The eroded volcano lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, and is just 100ft wide and 70ft high

Mr Hancock said: ‘I retreated to the RockPod and the wind continued to build through the day until it was up past 30mph by evening. It's just not sensible to be out and about in those conditions.

‘[That is] even with a harness and life line, especially when the rock is wet and slippery, so I was pod-bound for the rest of the morning and all of the rest of the day.

‘This meant more reading: I finished Jay-Z's 'Decoded' and started Steven (Aerosmith) Tyler's autobiography, before completing some more harmonica lessons. 

‘The basic tunes I'm on at the moment sound to me like they're supposed to, and there's some basic technique work at this stage too, which seems to be going well.’

Mr Hancock also recorded an interview for NBC via Skype with fellow adventurer Ben Fogle, who shot to fame living on Taransay in the Outer Hebrides for a year during BBC series Castaway in 2000.

Pulling up the pod: Mr Hancock hopes to spend 60 days on the rock after landing on it last month on June 5

Current home: The father - who has a son Freddie, two, with his wife Pamela, 41 - has taken all food and water with him and plans to live in his shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record

Mr Hancock hopes to spend 60 days on the rock after landing on it on June 5. Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11ft by 4ft.

FOOD AND DRINK: He is eating army-type rations, split into 24-hour ration
packs, which are spread over two days. Each pack has 4,500 calories – with the
average man for a normal day needing about 2,000. Drinks are a combination of straight water, tea, coffee, hot
chocolate, and isotonic powder in water - all of which come in the ration packs. He is boiling water and heating the rations on a gas-fired
camping stove, but says that he misses pizza.

The father - who has a son Freddie, two, with his wife Pamela, 41 - has taken all food and water with him and plans to live in his shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record.

Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of more than 95ft were recorded there in 2000 - higher than Rockall itself.

Being in such an isolated location, less than 100 people have landed on it - and only five have spent a night, including Mr Hancock. The first long record for time spent on Rockall was 40 days in 1985.

That expedition saw former SAS soldier Tom McClean live on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the islet, which has been disputed by Ireland, Iceland and Denmark.

His occupation record was broken in 
1997 by three Greenpeace activists who stayed there for 42 days in 
protest at North Atlantic oil exploration.

Those countries who lay claim to Rockall have one eye on the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it.

Plan: He hopes to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history

Difficult conditions: Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95ft were recorded there in 2000 - higher than Rockall itself

In 1997, Britain accepted Rockall was a 
rock, with no impact on the UK's maritime territory. The current dispute
 is over the wider Rockall-Hatton basin.

'I've already had winds in excess of 30mph, but only for short periods, so this promises to be the worst weather I've experienced yet'

Ownership is being examined by the United Nations in the light of the competing claims. Mr Hancock hopes to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history.

But he faces his roughest week yet. He said: ‘From Tuesday there are forecast winds in excess of 30mph, gusting up to 50mph, with rain, and remaining that way for several days.

‘I've already had winds in excess of 30mph, but only for short periods, so this promises to be the worst weather I've experienced yet.’
