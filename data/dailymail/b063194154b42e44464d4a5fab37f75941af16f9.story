A Subway shop was turned into a drive-thru after a car smashed through its front doors.

The 4X4 ploughed into the busy cafe in the middle of the afternoon trapping a customer against a wall.

A woman was inside the Subway when the BMW X3 crashed through the shop front just before 3.30pm yesterday. Miraculously, she escaped with only minor injuries.
