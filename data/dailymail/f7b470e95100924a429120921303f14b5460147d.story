The brook is so small it doesn’t even have a name. It is three inches deep, sometimes swelling to six after heavy rain,  and not much longer across.

So where better for the country’s largest water company to install a lifebelt?

Thames Water officials were branded drips by residents yesterday for providing the life-saving equipment following a ‘health and safety review’ at the ditch in Cock Lane in Fetcham, Surrey.

Jonathan Brown, who lives near the stream in Fetcham, Surrey, says there's 'no rhyme or reason' to the ring

Death-trap: Locals say the brook usually measures around two inches deep, or five inches after heavy rain

Resident Jonathan Brown said: ‘The 
stream is like a puddle – like someone left the tap on. There is no 
rhyme nor reason behind this ring.

‘I understand we have to be safe but 
even if someone fell over in the water, throwing a life ring at them 
wouldn’t do any good. It would just hit them on the head.’

Fellow 
resident David Rann said it was ‘health and safety gone mad’, adding: ‘I
am 5ft nothing and it hardly passes my toes. It is also 2ft wide at the
worst of times, so that makes it more ridiculous.

‘There is no logical reason for it whatsoever.

‘If, for argument’s sake, my grandchild did fall in, I could quite easily walk over to him and pick him up,  no bother.’

Mr Rann added: ‘What makes it worse is
that it took a couple of us no less than five or six minutes to 
actually get the lifebelt out of its holder. A child or lady might be 
stood there for ever.’

Thames Water spokesman Sarah Sharpe 
said: ‘The stream is something we call a balancing pond. It takes the 
run-off from the road surface during serious weather conditions so we 
don’t usually see them very full with water.

'The reason for this decision is 
because we had a recent internal health and safety review and we believe
this area was in need of better safety precautions.’

Miss Sharpe added: ‘There is obviously
a recreation ground at the back of the stream and the worry is that 
children may be at risk during severe weather.’

Drowning risk? The water in the brook is two and a half inches deep and barely covers Mr Brown's wellies
