A top U.S. general responsible for shaping the military of the future has revealed that robots could make up a quarter of the army within the next few decades.

General Robert Cone said the hi-tech machines will fight alongside soldiers on the battlefield by 2030 or 2040, in a bid to make the army 'a smaller, more lethal, deployable and agile force'.

Speaking at an Army Aviation symposium, in Arlington, Virginia, the head of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) gave his vision of sci-fi made reality.

Attack force: The army of the future could be made of autonomous robots fighting alongside soldiers, a top U.S. general revealed

He said modern health and safety concerns designed to keeping soldiers safe - adding armour and protection to vehicles and personnel - had caused the army to lose some of its lethal edge.

He hinted that robots could revitalise the U.S. army's killing force.

But he cautioned that the machinery required would demand a major revolution in robotic technology.

General Cone said: 'Iâ€™ve got clear guidance to think about what if you could robotically perform some of the tasks in terms of maneuverability, in terms of the future of the force, 'according to Defense News.

The Army is under pressure to cut the
 number of soldiers, from 540,000 soldiers to about 490,000 by the end 
of 2015, and down to 420,000 by 2019, according to some reports.

One
 of the major factors driving the pursuit of robotic battlefield 
technology is the need to drive down the cost of the conventional army.

In
 2012, 25 per cent of the near $130 billion plus Pentagon budget went on
 serving and retired members of the military, according to Popular Science.

Future today: Robots, such as this one known as PETMAN, are currently in use by the U.S. army

The increased reliance on robots would help slash the huge expense used to train, equip, accommodate, nurse and retire regular troops.

The U.S. Army has had a long-running mission to create autonomous robots - machines capable of making decisions, in real time, on the frontline to changing circumstances.

More than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq allowed the public to see the huge resources already dedicated to unmanned systems; from the high-flying Global Hawk to the lethal Predator drones to hand-launched Raven.

Revolution: Autonomous vehicles and remote controlled aircraft are no longer a thing from science fiction but a battlefield reality - now the next generation of military robots is being designed

But on the ground, thousands of small, remotely operated robots also have proven their value in dealing with roadside bombs, a lethal threat to U.S. troops in both wars.

The army has already been trailing remote controlled vehicles, such as the Black Night Transformer, a specially made truck that comes complete with eight rotors - four on each side - that spring out for take off and then fold in while driving.

The machine was built as part of a U.S. military desire for a 'multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle'.
