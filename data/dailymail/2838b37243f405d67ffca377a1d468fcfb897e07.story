England captain Chris Robshaw led his side on the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday as the Red Rose put the finishing touches to their preparations for the Six Nations finale against France.  

Stuart Lancaster's men face Les Bleus at HQ on Saturday with a chance of clinching the title for the first time since 2011.    

Any one of four teams can win the Six Nations this year - although with three wins each, Wales, Ireland and England are in with a better chance than outsiders France who have two.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster insists only the final stage of the Ryder Cup can compare with Saturday's climactic round of the RBS 6 Nations. 

Lancaster believes the golfing showpiece contested by Europe and the United States every two years is the only sporting occasion that can match the drama created by the Six Nations' refusal to synchronise the last instalment of games.

'I can't think of another situation in sport where you'd go into it with this points differential that can affect the psychology, so it is different from a World Cup,' Lancaster said.

'The only scenario I can think of that is similar is the final day of the Ryder Cup when you're ahead or behind when the singles are coming.

'It's that sort of feeling. It will tell us a lot about the players, but it is a pretty unique situation as well.'

England enter the final day with a points advantage of plus four and it is in the context of how Wales and then Ireland, who travel to Rome and Edinburgh respectively, perform that Lancaster must prepare his team.

England coach Lancaster says England must not try and win the game too early and deal with circumstances as they arise during the match

'I have thought long and hard about the psychology of how you deal with your own players,' Lancaster said.

'There are only so many players who need to be involved in the key decisions. The rest of the players have been given a simple message - you go all-out for the win and you don't stop until 80 minutes is up.

'The key to begin with is not to chase the game too early. We have to go out there to perform and win the game, then we'll deal with whatever circumstances come along as we go.'

Lancaster has made one change to his starting XV after promoting Geoff Parling from the bench at the expense of Dave Attwood.

Parling has called for England to stand up and be counted as they seek to claim a first title since 2011.

'These sort of games are when you probably see a team's character,' Parling said.

'We know there is a lot of pressure on it and we shouldn't hide away from that. We said at the start of the tournament: we have got to win it. We've come second for three years running.

'We messed up a bit in two games again, but we've got a chance here to put things right and win it.

'These are the games you want to play in, the games you want to show your character as a player, as a pack, as a team.'
