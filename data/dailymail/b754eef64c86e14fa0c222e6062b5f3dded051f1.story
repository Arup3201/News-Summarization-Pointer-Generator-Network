Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont is facing a growing leadership crisis amid claims that Jim Murphy is plotting her downfall this week.

At the party's UK conference in Manchester there are strong rumours that Miss Lamont is 'ready' to quit, although this was slapped down by her supporters.

The party is bracing itself for more in-fighting and soul-searching following last week's referendum, and the Scottish Daily Mail revealed yesterday that former Scottish Secretary Mr Murphy is already being lined up as the next leader.

However, sources close to Miss Lamont accused Mr Murphy of trying to undermine her leadership, with rumours that a private meeting of his supporters has been scheduled.

'It's a bit rich that those who refused to stand for the job when the party was in its darkest hour now think they are the answer,' said one insider.

While the party fights among itself, Scotland's future has become one of the main topics in Manchester, with UK leader Ed Miliband today set to use his keynote speech to warn: 'A country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health.'

Mr Miliband yesterday praised Scottish politicians who helped defeat the threat of independence, however he gaffed by failing to thank former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

Although Scots strongly backed the Union in last week's referendum, the Yes campaign triumphed in Labour's heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire – including in Miss Lamont's own seat of Glasgow Pollok.

That has triggered despair within the party, and one source said: 'Nobody now expects Johann to lead the party into 2016.'

However, Miss Lamont told delegates in Manchester: 'I look forward to working with Ed in Number Ten, [and] to lead Scottish Labour to victory in 2016.'

Rumours have emerged that Miss Lamont is on the verge of quitting, something he supporters deny

Miss Lamont was elected leader in the wake of the party's 2011 election drubbing, beating MSP Ken Macintosh and MP Tom Harris.

She has performed capably in Holyrood, often beating Alex Salmond at First Minister's Questions, and launched a controversial full-scale review of the party's policies in a bid to end the country's 'something for nothing culture'. 

She is also well liked by members who are grateful to her for taking on the challenge when the party was at its lowest ebb.

However, she has struggled to create a public profile for herself and observers claim she now looks 'weary', with Labour still trailing far behind the SNP in the polls.

Rumours of her impending resignation came just a day after a Westminster source told the Mail that Jim Murphy is set to be appointed Shadow Scottish Secretary at Ed Miliband's next reshuffle, replacing Margaret Curran. 

Mr Murphy, who represents East Renfrewshire, was a close ally of Mr Miliband's brother David, and he is unlikely to get his dream job of Foreign Secretary if Ed becomes Prime Minister. 

Party sources say Mr Muprhy is therefore being lined up as Scottish leader, standing for the top job while still an MP

Party sources say he is therefore being lined up as Scottish leader, standing for the top job while still an MP – like Alex Salmond did with the SNP in 2004 – and then switching to the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election.

Yesterday, current Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran admitted the party must face up to last week's referendum results in its heartlands.

'We have to be honest when we look at the results and see that some of the people who think that Britain can't work for them are Labour voters,' she told delegates in Manchester.

'They are terrified of Tory governments, they are worried about the future of our public services, and they are looking at their living standards which have been ground down year on year.

'We need to understand why they are angry and what we need to do about it. We need to understand why, in areas like Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Dundee people feel so let down that they want to opt out entirely.'

Today, Mr Miliband will say: 'We will show the people of Scotland over the coming years that they made the right choice, because we are better together.

'But let's face it: our country nearly broke up. A country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health.'

He will tell a story about a cleaner called Josephine he met in Scotland, who was considering voting for independence.

'I don't know how she voted, but I do know the question she was asking: is anything going to make life better for me and my family?' he will say.

'I hear Josephine's question everywhere, not just in Scotland. Can anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain?'

'It wasn't just the referendum question. It is the general election question.'

Mr Miliband yesterday praised Miss Lamont, Mrs Curran, Better Together chairman Alistair Darling and MPs Anas Sarwar, Jim Murphy and Douglas Alexander.

But he failed to mention Gordon Brown, who made a series of high-profile interventions for the No campaign and made one of the best speeches against independence last week.

An aide last night insisted the Labour leader has already highly praised Mr Brown.

'I wanted to add my thanks to all of our colleagues for the incredible job they did in keeping our country together,' Mr Miliband said.

'Johann, I want to thank you for the great job you have done and the leadership you have shown.

'Alistair I want to thank you because you could have had an easier life after 2010 and you didn't. You didn't because you care so much about our country and we will forever be indebted to you for that.'
