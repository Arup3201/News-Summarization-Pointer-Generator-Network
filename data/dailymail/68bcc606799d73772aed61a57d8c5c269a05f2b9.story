As a schoolboy, the captain of Flight MH370 was enigmatic, a bit of a mystery and regarded as a very bright young man.

'He was always on the ball and spent most of his time in the library,' Malaysian Airlines captain Abdul Manaf Hasan told the MailOnline.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is pictured in his science class photograph looking relaxed among a smiling group of young Malaysian students in the late 1970s, reported Metro news.

Enigmatic and bookish: Manaf Hasan, a pilot friend of Flight MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, said he was a bit mysterious and spent most of his time in the library during his college days

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is said to have been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home in an upmarket Kuala Lumpur suburb

His name misspelled as 'Zahari', the future Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 captain wears a pair of long flared pants in a group of Year 11 science students in 1978 at Penang Free School in northern Malaysia.

Zaharie had enrolled in the school - the oldest independent college in South East Asia - after passing the qualifying exam in the same year.

School headmaster, Jalil Saad, who was two years ahead of Zaharie at the school, described him as 'well liked' and 'a book worm' who did not deserve accusations of terrorism in the wake of the disappearance of the plane he piloted.

Zaharie was 'studious,' he said.

The Penang Free School's senior administration assistant Ho Nean Chan said he and Zaharie had studied science alongside each other, and that 'he was a smart student.â€™

Jalil Saad said all the school's 'old boys' were regarded 'as brothers' and had remained in touch with each other.

Following the MH370 incident, the Penang Free School has held prayer meetings.

'We join the nation in grieving for the loss of all on board the jet liner,' Ho Nean Chan said.

Captain Manaf said he did not know Captain Zaharie's 'personal  situation' but that he had been 'impeccable' and the missing pilot's fellow flight captains were dismayed by reports speculating about his potential as a terrorist or suicide bomber.

'None of us believe he has done it,' Capt Manaf said. 'I stand by my friend.'

Ahmad Seth, Shah's youngest son, also came out in support of his father this week, saying he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur 19 days ago.

The 26-year-old said the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead, insisting they will wait for physical evidence, as searches were today suspended when heavy rain, winds and low clouds forced aircraft to return to base.

The 53-year-old pilot had been under suspicion after investigators discovered the simulator at his Kuala Lumpur home. Teams seized the equipment and took it apart piece by piece to look for clues as to what happened to missing flight MH370

'I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation,' he told the New Strait Times.

It comes amid reports that investigators now believe Captain Zaharie is solely responsible for the Malaysian Airline jet's demise and have dismissed the likelihood of mechanical failure or a hijacking.

A high-ranking official told USA Today that Captain Zaharie's family is being scrutinized in the hope of shedding some light on the tragedy.

A friend of the pilot has revealed Captain Zaharie was in 'no state of mind to be flying' and had been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home.

â€˜He's one of the finest pilots around and I'm no medical expert, but with all that was happening in his life Zaharie was probably in no state of mind to be flying,â€™ he told the NZ Herald on the condition of anonymity.

He said his friend's relationships were breaking down, adding it was possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride' in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator.

Aerial sweeps of the southern Indian Ocean for debris were suspended Thursday as adverse weather conditions forced the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to recall 11 search aircraft to Perth.

But five ships will remain in the 78,000-square-kilometre search area and continue to follow a new lead from French satellite images dated March 23 that showed 122 objects floating in the area more than 1,243miles off Australia's west coast.

An aviation meteorologist told the MailOnline that deteriorating weather was expected to make life difficult for military and civilian search personnel, and warned further delays were expected in the coming days.

Aviation meteorologist Martin Babakhan said a front of warm air was moving into the cold search area, causing a thick, wall-like band of low cloud cover.

'When you have those sorts of front mixing in with the cooler temperatures from the ocean, the result is it creates high-level moisture - or 100 per cent humidity,' he told the MailOnline.

'Visibility is completely restricted for those aircraft out there. When these types of weather conditions occur at Sydney Airport, for example, the plane is switched into auto-pilot and GPS is used to land the plane automatically.

'You just can't do that out there over the ocean - it's a completely different environment. Even trying to fly underneath the cloud cover presents a safety risk, that's why they don't do it.'

Mr Babakhan said the visibility issues would linger for approximately 24 hours before conditions begin to improve. He said AMSA would most likely call the ships back later Thursday as the swell becomes more aggressive in the search area.

'The waves will definitely start to get bigger as a result of the front moving through,' he said. 'We're talking about them ranging from three metres up to seven metres.

'It's very unlikely they will be able to find anything in those conditions until at least Saturday or Sunday.'

French satellite images from March 23 have spotted 122 objects floating in a 155-square-mile area

The Malaysian Minister of Defence and acting Transport Minister Dato Seri Hishammuddin Hussein shows the pictures of the possible debris of the flight MH370 at a press conference

The location of potential objects related to the search of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 debris was shown by the Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA)

Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein revealed Wednesday that the news satellite images have dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted across an area measuring just 155 square miles.

Mr Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defense and Space on March 23.

They are the fourth set of satellite images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 1,550 miles south west of Perth.

The objects are believed to be solid and range from three to 75 feet long.
