Probe: Inaki Urdangarin will appear in court over corruption allegation on February 6

The son-in-law of the King of Spain has been ordered to appear in court over corruption allegations claiming he misused public funds.

The Duke of Palma, Inaki Urdangarin, who is son-in-law of King Juan Carlos, will appear before a judge in Palma, Majorca, on February 6.

The Duke, a former Olympic handball player who is married to Princess Cristina, is being investigated over claims he misused public funds given to a foundation he ran.

However, the 43-year-old member of the Spanish royal family has denied any wrongdoing.

State
prosecutors are investigating allegations of fraud at Urdangarin's 
non-profit Noos Institute, which organised events to promote sports, 
tourism and development.

An initial government investigation found evidence of inflated receipts for services at the institute.

Although further details of the 
investigation have not been made public, the Spanish royal family 
reacted to the claims on Wednesday by making its accounts publicly 
available.

While denying any
wrongdoing, the 43-year-old duke has said he regrets the 'damage' 
caused and has made a public apology for the embarrassment his legal 
problems were causing the Spanish royals.

Inaki Urdangarin, son-in-law to King Juan Carlos has been removed from the royal family section of Madrid's Wax museum following news of the corruption allegations

Earlier this month, Madrid's Wax Museum reacted to the news by moving the figure of the Duke out of the royal family display.

A museum spokesman, who revealed there had been a boost in visitor numbers since the move, said: 'He's now situated across from the sports gallery.'

The Duke played handball in the Olympics, and the museum has changed his look too so that he is now wearing sports gear.
