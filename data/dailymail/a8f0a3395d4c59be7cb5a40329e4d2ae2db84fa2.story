So, Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg? That is the question that will be dominating those casting their eyes towards Abu Dhabi for Sunday's Grand Prix.

Hamilton is agonisingly close to clinching the title, though Rosberg is lurking behind the Brit. 

But who do the big names think will win it and why? Sportsmail gather their thoughts...

SIR JACKIE STEWART

Hamilton will almost certainly win the championship. However, there is a chance Valtteri Bottas or Felipe Massa could finish second in the race. If that was to happen and Rosberg wins, that would put Hamilton in third and he would lose the title. Any mechanical failure would have an enormous effect, too.

I think Hamilton will win the championship. He shouldn’t have anything to worry about if he’s prepared, as he is better than Rosberg.

MARTIN KEOWN

I hope it’s Hamilton but the way the script is written it could be Rosberg. Talk of a new contract could be a distraction for Lewis, and the double points system makes things so different. We all want Lewis but I think there will be a final twist in the tail...

Hamilton should win the championship. I’m pretty sure he’ll want to take it with a big win to underline his talent and achievement, even though he only has to coast to second in a dominant car. Rosberg’s win in Brazil, however, ensures that with significant contact or mechanical issues for Hamilton, the double points handout would clinch the title for him.

JAMIE REDKNAPP

Obviously I want Hamilton to win but it should be an amazing last race. It reminds me of 1989 when Liverpool played Arsenal in that title decider. As for double points, I think a lot of managers at the bottom of the league would like that at the end of the season! The pressure’s on Lewis but hopefully he’ll do it.

JOHN WATSON

Lewis is the favourite because he has more wins and points. The only way it could go wrong is a reliability gremlin or if the pair get silly on the track like in Bahrain and Belgium. Rosberg has called for a clean, fair race and I hope he gets it.

NATALIE PINKHAM (SKY F1)

Nico is a very talented racer but Lewis, despite three DNFs and two starts from the back, has secured 10 wins this season — double Nico’s tally — and has been on the podium for every race he has finished.
