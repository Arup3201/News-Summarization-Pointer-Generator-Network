A beautician and her mother have died within weeks of each other after both losing their fight against cancer.

Zoe Phokeerdoss, 38, passed away at the end of June after breast cancer spread to her lungs, pancreas and liver. Her mother, Doreen Bullock, 58, had died just weeks earlier of ovarian cancer in May.

They both carried the faulty BRCA-1 gene which put them at a far higher risk of cancer than the rest of the population.

Mrs Phokeerdoss, a mother-of-four, had already beat the disease in 2009, only for it return in February this year.

Ms Bullock, from Birches Head in Staffordshire, died of ovarian cancer on May 20.

Tragically Mrs Phokeerdoss was too ill with cancer to attend her mother’s funeral.

Just weeks later, on June 30, she then succumbed to the disease.

A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous.

Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations.

They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells.Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer.

But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer.

Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'.

The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime.

Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries).

Her husband Dean Phokeerdoss,
42, from Sneyd Green, also in Stafforshire, said: 'Zoe was such a 
fighter. Even in the last month we managed to venture out for little 
trips.

'Her one big regret was that she couldn’t get to her mum’s funeral, because she was too ill.

'But in the end, when Zoe went it was so peaceful.

'Zoe had time for everyone. She was the life and soul of the party. If she believed in something she was so passionate.

'I remember driving home and we saw four or five down-and-outs drinking near the Sneyd Arms. She told me to stop the car and went over to talk to them.

'There was one in particular that she used to help a lot after that, she helped to get him clean - she did that four or five times for different people.

Zoe also left behind daughters Jordan, 20, and seven-year-old Evan, as well as sons Kyran, 14, and Corey, 13.

When Zoe wasn't a busy mother-of-three she spent a lot of time at the local church helping with the soup kitchen, giving meals to the homeless.

'She had recently started sending packages to an orphanage in South Africa,' added Mr Phokeerdoss.

'If
the cancer hadn’t taken her, I think in two to three years’ time we 
would have been living in South Africa, she wanted to help in the 
orphanage and then set up one of her own - that was her calling.'
