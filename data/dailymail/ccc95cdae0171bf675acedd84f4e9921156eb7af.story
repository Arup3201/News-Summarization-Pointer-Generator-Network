 

A series of striking photographs have shown the haunting beauty of abandoned places around the world.

Many are in various states of disrepair and poor condition, but even here there can be found some eerie splendour. 

The likes of Lynch, Kentucky, was built as a company town in 1917 by US Coal and Coke, a subsidiary of US Steel. It was at the time the largest coal camp in the world, and was built to house the many workers mining the coal to be used by US Steel.

Even though the population peaked to around 10,000 it has since diminished to roughly 747 according to a 2010 census. The plant now sits abandoned with only rusting machinery showing that anything ever existed there. 

Naval Station Subic Bay used to be one of the largest US military bases outside the American mainland. It was partly damaged during the eruption of Mount Pinatubo forcing American troops from the more severely damaged Clark Air Base to relocate at Subic. 

It was closed in 1992 after the Philippine Senate voted not to extend the lease on the facility and concrete structures called "Quonset huts" now lie crumbling there.

Meanwhile in the Loftus Tram Shed in Sydney, an old, dilapated tram still stands. Trams were a key part of life here after the network was installed in 1879, with 1,600 cars in service during the height of its popularity. The service was eventually shut down in 1961.

The derelict town of Epecuen, Argentina, was once home to 1,500 residents, but they were forced to leave in 1985 when heavy rains made the nearby lake overrun its banks and submerged the town beneath almost 30 feet of water. The town was never rebuilt as the water started to recede and only the odd desolate sign of civilisation remains.

Simacem village in North Sumatra Indonesia shared the same fate. it was left for dead after its people were evacuated following the eruption of the volcano there. Sinabung, among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia, has sporadically erupted since 2010 after being dormant for 400 years. 

More than 22,000 people were evacuated from the area around the 2,600-meter (8,530-foot) volcano after the eruptions earlier this year that killed at least 16 people. Most have returned home, but about 4,700 remain in evacuation centres.
