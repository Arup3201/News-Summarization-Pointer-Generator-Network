A brother and sister searching for scrap metal on the train tracks on Chicago’s West Side were struck and killed by a Metra train Thursday.

According to the victims’ relatives, Barry Huddleston, 57, who was visually impaired, and his 54-year-old sister, Margaret, likely did not see the approaching BNSF Line locomotive in time.

The family believe that the woman died trying to push her sibling out of the way.

Double tragedy: This BNSF Line Metra train in Chicago struck and killed Barry and Margaret Huddleston, a brother and sister in their 50s, on Chicago's West Side

Dangerous job: The unemployed siblings were walking the tacks looking for scrap metal when the inbound train surprised Mr Huddleston, who was partially blind

‘He couldn't see, he was partially blind, and he stood on the track and he didn't see the train and Margaret ran over there to help him,’ said Gloria Huddleston, victims' younger sister.

The deadly accident took place at around 4.45pm Thursday when an inbound BNSF train traveling to Chicago's Union Station struck the Huddlestons.

Meg Reile, a spokeswoman for the Metra commuter rail service, said the incident occurred after the train running on the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe line left the La Grange station and was a mile west of the Western Ave. station. The tracks at that point are elevated.

‘We were on the train, and everyone thought that something broke off the train on the bottom,’ Metra passenger Anthony Lozaro told ABC 7 Chicago.

Traffic on the BNSF line, Metra's busiest, was suspended for three hours in both directions, affecting about 25,000 commuters.

On Friday, the medical examiner performed an autopsy on the victims, which determined that the Huddlestons died from multiple injuries caused on impact.

Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, the siblings' relatives said Margaret and Barry have been inseparable since childhood and looked out for one another growing up in the Lawndale section of Chicago.

When Mr Huddleston lost his vision in one eye due to glaucoma a few years ago, his protective sister stepped in serving as his guide.

Both Huddlestons were unemployed and relied on scrap metal collection to scratch out a meager living.

Speaking of her aunt and uncle's dangerous occupation, Tracy Huddleston said the two would walk the streets and scour vacant lots in search of morsels of aluminum and metal.

Margaret Huddleston was remembered as a small woman with a big heart who spent her days caring for her four children and eight grandchildren, as well as for her elderly mother.

When on Thursday evening the Huddleston clan heard the news that someone had been struck by a train nearby, they feared the worst knowing the siblings' tendency to wander the tracks.

The Gloria Huddleston, who was at the scene, saw a passerby carrying a dirty blue Nike sneaker and knew at once her brother Barry was dead.

Larry Jackson, Margaret Huddleston’s boyfriend, dropped down to his knees and sobbed watching work crews covering the bodies of his girlfriend and her brother with tarp sheets.
