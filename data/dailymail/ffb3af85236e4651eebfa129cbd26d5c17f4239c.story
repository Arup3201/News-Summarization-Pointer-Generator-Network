Unexpected twist: A whale watching trip went awry when the whale breached near the boat and slapped a woman, Chelsea, in the head with its tail

At one point the whale's tail careens out of the water and slaps the boat, hitting the woman who looks visibly shocked.

Jordyn Rivet, who uploaded the video to LiveLeak, wrote that Chelsea was unharmed.

Baja California, which is on the Pacific coast of Mexico, is a famously good site for whale watching. Visitors to the area can see sperm whales, fin whales, elusive Peruvian beaked whales, humpback whales, friendly grey whales, as well as the giant blue whales.

The region has a 3,000 kilometre shoreline and there are not many whale watching boats in the region, so visitors can get close to the beautiful marine life.
