Gwen Trickett, a  no-nonsense 77-year-old great-grandmother with a Yorkshire accent as thick as porridge, is musing on the shortcomings of society. ‘The young ones now, they’re not like our generation, are they?’ she says.

‘People have too much money. They won’t get things mended. They’d sooner throw ’em away and get a new one.’

Chucking stuff is not Gwen’s style.

A real sucker: Vince tests out the 56-year-old Hoover as Gwen looks on

I hope she won’t mind me saying, but I’ve not really come to her house — a semi with a neat front garden on the outskirts of Barnsley — to meet her. I’m here to look at one of Gwen’s household appliances: her 56-year-old Hoover.

Her vacuum cleaner is a bit of a celebrity. Gwen’s local paper ran a piece about someone who has a 38-year-old freezer. The newspaper asked whether any other readers could boast of a longer-lived household appliance.

Well, Gwen could and she got in touch. She bought her Hoover Junior in 1957. And five decades on it is still in full active service, week in, week out, on her blue and red floral carpets (which are, I can report, spotless).

So what is her Hoover like? As she ushers me in through her front door, it’s on the carpet facing me — standing bolt upright, like a soldier on parade. 

Old faithful: Gwen did get a new vacuum ten years ago but doesn't use it as she prefers her Hoover

True, it is scratched and scuffed — wouldn’t you be if you’d been shoved under the couch and the sideboard thousands of times? But the only parts that have ever been replaced are the wire flex (once), cloth dustbag (once) and belt (a handful of times).

To get some idea of her Hoover’s longevity, you need to transport yourself back to April 1957.

Lonnie Donegan, Elvis Presley and Tommy Steele were dominating the hit parade; Peter Cushing as Young Frankenstein was at the cinema; and prime minister Harold Macmillan was a few weeks away from announcing that we’d ‘never had it so good’.

And Gwen — along with her husband Derek, now 84, whom she’d married a month earlier — had gone shopping for a vacuum cleaner in Barnsley town centre.

‘Back then, if you got married before the start of the tax year, you’d get a rebate from the taxman. I can’t remember how much money we got, but it felt like a lot. We decided we’d spend the money on a vacuum cleaner.’

In the late Fifties, there were rival models by Goblin and Electrolux, but in that era Hoover dominated the market and she knew that’s what she’d end up with.

Stood the test of time: It might be a little battered but the Hoover still works

Little realising at the time the future significance of her purchase, Gwen remembers very little about the shopping trip. She’s sure she bought the Hoover in Barnsley, but is not clear whether she went to Curry’s (which started as a bicycle business in 1884) or a local store. And she doesn’t remember how much she paid.

Luckily, the company — now known as Hoover-Candy, since the British branch of the American firm was bought by an Italian company in the Nineties — is able to help out.

A spokeswoman says Gwen’s Hoover Junior sold for around £20 in 1957. That’s the equivalent of nearly £420 in today’s money, four times the price of a basic Hoover model now.

I do a quick calculation. Gwen says she has used her Hoover two or three times a week. If each session lasted, say, 20 minutes that equates to 2,400 hours of use. That’s 100 solid days and nights of continuous Hoovering. With one Hoover.

That’s pretty incredible, I tell Gwen. Have your other domestic appliances held out as well?

She shakes her head. During her married life, she’s been through five ovens, four washing machines, as many toasters and up to 20 kettles. ‘They don’t last long, do they?’ she says.

It’s time to put the beast into service. Can I have a go with your Hoover, I ask. 

Value for money: The appliance cost £20 when it was bought in 1957 after Gwen got married

Gwen happily consents. After all, husband Derek — who normally does the vacuuming these days — is sitting with his feet up in the conservatory, enjoying an afternoon snooze. (Incidentally, Gwen says Derek isn’t enjoying all this fuss about their Hoover.)

So how do I use it? ‘It’s got one button. On and off. That’s enough for me.’

I press it. The big cloth dustbag puffs itself up like an over-proud set of bagpipes at Hogmanay. And, as with bagpipes, a din envelopes the room.

This old technology may be reliable, but it’s certainly noisier than its modern equivalent.

There’s no question, however, that the suction is every bit as good as my Miele vacuum cleaner at home.

And the Hoover is surprisingly nimble. Moving it back and forth over Gwen’s short-pile carpet, I find it light to manoeuvre and easy to swivel into corners (though, to be fair, I should add that its strong suction makes it rather less easy to use on Gwen’s big, fluffy rug).

Then Gwen reveals a surprising secret. Hers is not a one-vacuum household.

Tucked away upstairs is a second cleaner, one she sheepishly refers to as the ‘new one’.

In fact, it’s not new at all: it’s ten years old. It’s a plastic thing that doesn’t suck up the dirt nearly as well as her 1957 Hoover Junior. They never use it.

Why did they get a second vacuum cleaner?

‘It was my husband who decided to buy it,’ says Gwen. ‘He got it because we’d had our other one so long he thought we should have a new one.

‘But the new one simply doesn’t do what I want it to do. It doesn’t pick up the same as my old one.’Aha! A rogue purchase by a rogue of a husband. She points towards the conservatory, where Derek is still snoozing.

With a conspiratorial wink, she smiles: ‘Normally he’s frightened of spending money. But not this time he wasn’t — and he made a mistake.

‘Now you know why he’s stuck in there, don’t you?’
