Kate Silverton, 43, has welcomed a son into the world.

The newsreader gave birth to baby Wilbur, her second child with husband Mike Heron, on June 26.

Her agent told MailOnline: 'Kate gave birth to a healthy baby boy - Wilbur Silverton-Heron - on June 26 at 02.53 and is naturally absolutely delighted and enjoying family time at present with her husband Mike, baby Wilbur and her daughter Clemency.'

The BBC 
journalist had openly admitted her struggle to conceive a second child 
with IVF, but recently admitted to Lorraine Kelly that she fell pregnant
 naturally after 'moving on' from accepting that she may not fall 
pregnant.

Delighted: Kate Silverton, 43, gave birth to a healthy baby boy - Wilbur Silverton-Heron - on 26th June

She
 appeared on ITV with husband Mike Heron and said: ‘After Clemency, I 
said to Mike: “I’d love to go through that experience again.” I did 
become pregnant, but sadly miscarried at six weeks. Then a few months 
later I fell pregnant again.’

When she fell pregnant, the
 newsreader told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re absolutely thrilled. It came as a
 complete surprise. Nobody else could believe it either. We feel really,
 really blessed. I’m still getting my head round it.’

When 
Clemency was born in November 2011, Miss Silverton - who lost an ovary 
during an operation to remove a cyst when she was 29 - had already been 
through four rounds of IVF treatment and had resigned herself to the 
fact she was unlikely to become a mother.

But within months of stopping the treatment she conceived naturally and later described the pregnancy as a ‘miracle’.

Announcing the news: Kate took to Twitter to introduce her new baby, writing: 'Gorgeous morning all - Introducing #Wilbur our little ray of sunshine x'

The
 BBC presenter was happy to reveal her new baby was also conceived 
naturally, saying: ‘I had no wish to go down the IVF route again after 
all those years. It was an utterly gruelling process. I was resigned to 
thinking ‘what will be, will be’.

‘My husband and I had pretty much given up the idea of me falling pregnant again after Clemency.

‘We
 knew how extremely lucky we were to have had her and we had come to 
terms with that being our family. I think probably I had a tiny, tiny 
glimmer of hope that it would happen.

‘So many doctors have told me “It isn’t going to happen, you have less than a two per cent chance of conceiving”.’

Birth: Kate, pictured pregnant with her daughter, now two, and husband Michael Heron, said she had no wish to go down the IVF route again after all those years

'I’m a 43-year-old woman who has one ovary, and who has very, very few eggs. The odds were stacked against me.’

Miss
 Silverton said she is still unsure how she has managed to conceive 
again, but said experts had told her the fact she stayed ‘happy, healthy
 and positive’ - in part through several months of visiting an 
acupuncturist - may have helped.
