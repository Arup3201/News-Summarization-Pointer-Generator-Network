Andy Murray is facing rising star Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon today, and while the two tennis titans clash on court, their respective other halves were expected to be cheering them on in the stands.

But while devoted Kim Sears arrived at SW19 looking chic and relatively cheerful ahead of what is sure to be a nail-biting game, there was no sign of Maria Sharapova, who yesterday crashed out of the competition in a humiliating match against Angelique Kerber.

While demure Kim has been a constant 
presence at Wimbledon this year - as ever, immaculately blow-dried - Maria has yet to be seen in the stands.

Devoted Kim arrived at Wimbledon alone today, while Dimitrov's girlfriend Maria Sharapova was a no-show

Kim put on her own 'game face' as she strode into the stadium to watch the quarter final in a bold pink sleeved dress

Sticking to a well-established formula Kim, 25, wore a knee-length bright pink scoop necked dress by Goat, £440, and the same Burberry wedges she has been seen in every day of the competition so far.

And of course she carried her loved Aspinal Marylebone tote bag - which costs an eye-watering £1395 - as she walked into the stadium.

While Kim kept up her unwavering support for her partner, Maria Sharapova was noticeably absent.

Until now the Russian has naturally been more concerned with her own game than supporting boyfriend Dimitrov, whom she has been dating since 2012.

But yesterday saw the 27-year-old suffer a humiliating shock defeat to German ninth seed Angelique Kerber, ending her dreams of a Wimbledon title, and she was expected to show support to Dimitrov at the match today.

Kim has been a rock to Murray, supporting him from the stands - and reportedly cooking him dinner each evening

While leaving the competition is no doubt a huge blow to the ambitious blonde, it has freed her up to watch boyfriend Dimitrov in action.

The pair began dating in 2012, but only confirmed their relationship in 2013 after the Madrid Open, and while she is known for a will of iron, she may find her hands are full with the 23-year-old Bulgarian.

His talent and good looks have seen Dimitrov make something of a name for himself as a ladies' man.

He has previously dated Sharapova’s on-court enemy, Serena Williams - at 32 another older woman - and the relationship had a famously acrimonious end.

Serena, who was defeated by Sharapova in the 2004 Wimbledon final, has spoken out about Dimitrov, giving an interview to a US magazine in which she described Sharapova as ‘boring’ and accused Dimitrov of having a ‘black heart’.

Nevertheless, Sharapova seems smitten with the buff Bulgarian and responded by pointing out that Williams was believed to be dating her married coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

The 6ft 2in blonde, who has previously said that she feels Dimitrov's tennis is of a better standard than her own, was spotted supporting him in the stands as he won the French Open last month.

While it's unlikely Maria follows Kim’s example and cooks for her man each evening of the tournament - being too busy working on her own game - Dimitrov has credited his other half with helping his performance, saying: ‘She’s just been unbelievable supporting me throughout the year.’

Now that she's got a bit of spare time, the 27-year-old plans to visit Sugarpova, the pop-up sweet shop she has opened down the road from the All England Club.

‘I love going there, my favourite sweet is a liquorice with a marshmallow middle and strawberry flavour,’ she gushed.

It appears that when it comes to style Kim Sears is taking inspiration from the Royal Box.

Andy Murrey's doting girlfriend arrived for Wimbledon today in a pink knee-length dress that looked strangely familiar.

The dress bore an uncanny resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge's frock that she wore to her visit to a primary school in Highbury and Islington, North London, yesterday.

Both dresses come from luxury brand Goat, the label that began as the go-to cashmere range for the fashion connoisseurs over ten years ago.   

But the similarities didn't end there. Both dresses have a conservative shape, tucking neatly in at the waist and finishing just below the knee.

Kim even opted for identical colours with both dresses coming in an eye-catching hot-pink colour.

Both Kim and Kate's dresses were finished with buckle detailing at the waist, but Kim kept to a slightly shorter sleeve for the hot summer weather.

It appears that when it comes to the Kate Effect nobody is immune!
