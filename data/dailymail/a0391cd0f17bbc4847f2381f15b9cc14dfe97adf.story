Thousands of EU migrants who are still on the dole after a lengthy stay in Britain could have their benefits taken away under a crackdown to be unveiled today.

Up to 4,000 Europeans living here for a year or more will be assessed on whether they have the genuine prospect of finding work.

Those who fail will lose their right to Jobseeker’s Allowance.

The measures are in addition to David Cameron’s detailed plans to ban EU migrants from claiming benefits including lucrative tax credits until they have worked in this country for four years.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister’s prospects of securing agreement for the package of changes were given a boost by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said the proposals needed to be discussed ‘in detail’.

Her comments were seen as an indication she will not try to block the main thrust of Mr Cameron’s proposal.

Mrs Merkel told a press conference she was ‘pleased’ that Mr Cameron had not attempted to undermine the principle of free movement.

‘We are pleased that this was not put into question by the British prime minister,’ she said.

‘The proposals that were presented now need to be discussed in detail,’ she added, saying that Germany and the European Commission would have a close look at Cameron’s propositions.

However, the Polish government made clear it would veto the proposals unless they are watered down. Many of the beneficiaries of Britain’s generous benefits system are Polish.

This week it emerged that Britain now has almost as many Poles as live in Krakow.

The country’s Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski said protecting the EU’s principle of free movement was an ‘absolute red line’ for Poland in any negotiation on a new deal for Britain.

Ministers are understood to be due to announce the new crackdown on long-term unemployed migrants today.

They believe it can be implemented without EU approval, as it falls within existing law.

Living rough: refugees in Calais

A new hostel for migrants hoping to cross the Channel into Britain is to be opened in Calais.

The ‘cold weather emergency centre’ will be used once temperatures fall below -5C (23F) in the French port – and could be ready to open within days.

Located in a 40,000 sq ft warehouse, it is fitted with beds and hot showers and will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the area.

It will be the first large-scale shelter for Calais migrants since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees during its six years of operation.

Local government official Denis Robin said the new centre, two miles from the ferry port, would be available for use within the ‘coming days’.

He added: ‘The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall.

‘We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.’ The town is also opening a separate day centre to offer hot food and showers to the most vulnerable migrants, such as women with children and the elderly.

The British government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to travel to Calais – hoping to stow away aboard ferries to Dover.

But Mr Robin insisted the new shelters were ‘humanitarian gestures’, adding: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels.’

Tensions have been mounting in the French town due to the influx of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East. Mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during July and August.

In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais, after 250 migrants stormed the ferry terminal trying to reach Britain.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ benefits system for the problems.

From January this year EU migrants were given a maximum of six months of JSA claims during which they could look for work. In July, Mr Cameron announced this would be cut to three months.

But the rules were not retrospective, meaning some 4,000 EU migrants who have been here since before January do not fall under the six months maximum.

Whitehall sources said anyone claiming before the new rules came into force will have their JSA withdrawn unless they have ‘very clear job prospects’.

A single market town in the foothills of the Pennines has taken more asylum seekers than all of South East England.

New figures show Rochdale houses 680 – one in 41 of all those in Britain.

Yet the entire South East region, among the UK’s most affluent, has received just 441.

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said his seat had become a ‘magnet for the dispossessed’.

A genuine prospect of work test, applied to their benefit claims, will attempt to work out whether or not they are likely to get a job in the near future.

Currently, Jobseeker’s Allowance is paid out at £72.40 a week for over 25s and £57.35 a week for under 25s. Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Tory MPs will attempt to embarrass Mr Cameron today with a new demand to seize back powers from Europe over borders and immigration.

Twelve backbenchers have signed up to a proposal that would hand Parliament an override on all diktats from Brussels – and allow Britain to overrule rulings from European judges.

The Bill would provide for an effective veto of any law coming out of the European Union with a majority vote in both Houses of Parliament. Bill Cash, the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, will publish the UK Parliament (Sovereignty and Jurisdiction over Borders) Bill in Parliament today.

The timing will annoy the party leadership, who are focused on Chancellor George Osborne’s crunch Autumn Statement.

The Bill will not be debated in the House of Commons but could distract from the focus on the economy. Mr Cash said: ‘This is absolutely essential, it is needed, it is in the national interest.’

‘The voters’ right to govern themselves through Parliament has served us over the past generations and it is now absolutely essential to reassert that.

‘We either accept what the EU is doing or we take a stand.’
