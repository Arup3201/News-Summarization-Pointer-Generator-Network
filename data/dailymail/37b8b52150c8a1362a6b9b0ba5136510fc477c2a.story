Police have since revealed she lost her unborn baby as a result of the crash.

The driver of her car, a 39-year-old man, along with two children - a 10-year-old boy and 18-month-old girl - were taken to Logan Hospital with minor injuries.

The driver of the Commodore, a 32-year-old man, suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries and was treated in Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the moments before the incident to contact authorities.

In particular, they are eager to speak to the driver of a white sedan seen travelling eastbound on Browns Plains Road about the time of the crash.
