Cleared: Andrew Constantine won a fight to clear his name after being accused of speeding

A taxi driver has overturned a fine for doing 50mph in a 30mph zone by using speed camera images to prove he was actually going at only 18mph.

But Andrew Constantine must still pay hundreds of pounds in costs, despite winning his long legal battle.

Mr Constantine had been shocked to receive the fixed-penalty notice as he remembered at the time he had been carrying a passenger in her 80s and was driving with extra care.

Determined to clear his name, he appealed against the £60 fine which was imposed after he was ‘caught’ by a fixed-speed camera in Drayton, Norfolk, in February last year.

The father of two, from Norwich, hired a specialist motoring offences lawyer. His battle dragged on for 11 months, until earlier this week the case was dropped moments before a court hearing was due to start.

Using simple maths, two pictures taken by the Gatso speed camera showed Mr Constantine had been well under the speed limit.

The images were taken about half a second apart over a distance of four metres marked by white lines on the road – proving his speed was 17.8mph.

Mr Constantine’s case was due to be heard at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Monday but was dropped when the prosecution looked at the photographic evidence and agreed there had been a mistake.

But Mr Constantine is entitled to claim only about three-quarters of the £1,600 he spent on his solicitor, due to a cap on hourly legal fees that may be claimed in motorists’ cases.

When lawyers charge more than the hourly rate, the client has to make up the shortfall.

The cap on rates was lowered from October 1, after Mr Constantine set his appeal process in motion. But Mr Constantine, 47, refused to let the expense take the edge off his victory.

Faulty: This speed camera in Drayton, Norfolk, overstated the speed Mr Constantine was driving by 32mph

He said yesterday: ‘Some other people may have just taken the medicine and accepted it, but I  was innocent.

‘It was nice to walk into court innocent, leave court innocent and be completely vindicated.’

Matthew Miller, of Motoring Offence 
Lawyers, which represented Mr Constantine, said: ‘Nobody knows if there 
was a fault with this camera.

‘We have speculated that it might have
 taken a reading from another vehicle or another object. I have seen 
similar errors in the past but never one as bad as this.’

Last year it emerged the number of 
active fixed speed camera sites in England had increased from 2,188 to 
2,331 in a 12-month period.

The number is set to increase, due to plans 
in a Department for Transport report earlier this month.

The vast majority are Gatso cameras, a Dutch brand.

A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said 
cameras were calibrated annually by the manufacturer and data and images
 were checked by Criminal Justice Unit staff before fixed-penalty 
notices were issued.

She said: ‘In this case a fixed penalty notice was issued in error.

‘However, we were not notified this ticket was being challenged until Monday morning.

‘The file was then reviewed and we supported the withdrawal of this case.’
