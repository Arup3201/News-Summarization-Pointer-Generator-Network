Double-edged sword: Stress sets off eczema, so it is doubly cruel that Bronagh works in an industry that demands perfect looks

Stripping off for an intimate scene in a TV show that will be watched by millions would be nerve-racking for any actress.

But for Bronagh Waugh, star of the recent BBC drama The Fall, showing some skin was nothing less than 'mortifying' - because she suffers from severe eczema all over her body.

'It was a nightmare because I felt so self-conscious, and we were outside, so my hay fever was set off, too,' says Bronagh. 'But we just laughed about it and I'm so pleased I did it now.'

Thanks to expert make-up both on and off screen, you'd never guess that Bronagh suffers with eczema, a condition causing patches of itchy, red, dry and cracked skin.

But the 30-year-old actress, best known for starring in soap opera Hollyoaks, has had it all her life. 'When I was born I came out covered in eczema,' she says. 'My mum and dad had it, but theirs was less serious.

'My earliest memories are of having long baths in emollient and wearing mittens all the time to stop me scratching. The itchiness drove me crazy. I still scratch myself in my sleep, sometimes so much that it bleeds.'

Throughout her teens, Bronagh was highly self-conscious about her eczema, and despite laughing about it good-naturedly at school, she would weep to her mother at night. So she sometimes finds it hard to believe she grew up to be an actress, confident enough to bare all for the cameras.

One in five children and one in 12 adults lives with eczema, a condition triggered by inflammation, says Dr Tabi Leslie, a leading dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation.

'There are various forms, but the most common is atopic eczema, which is inherited through genes that carry eczema, hay fever and asthma. So it may be that one or both parents have one of these conditions but they produce a child with eczema.'

The condition is caused when the immune system over-reacts to harmless allergens, setting up a process of inflammation which causes the distinctive red, itchy patches of skin, often on the insides of elbows and knees.

Experts agree that eczema is probably caused by a combination of an inherited predisposition and environmental triggers. Worryingly, the number of cases in the UK has increased dramatically.

'Eczema has become hugely prevalent - there's been about a threefold rise in the past 40 years,' says Margaret Cox, chief executive of the National Eczema Society.

'Genes don't change that fast so we suspect the culprit is modern living - we wash a lot more than we used to and use more products, and we central heat our homes and air condition our buildings. Soap and temperature variations seem to be common triggers.'

Indeed, when Bronagh's family moved to Thailand when she was 11, after her mother got a job there, her eczema all but disappeared as she wasn't living in such a changeable climate. But it returned when she came back to the UK at 16.

'Unfortunately, it was around then I really started getting into acting and dancing and I felt so self-conscious wearing leotards.

'I remember being in a play where there was lots of holding hands, and no one wanted to touch me. The boys would say they didn't want to lift me. I felt like an ogre. I was so embarrassed.'

Stigma is a huge issue for eczema sufferers, says Margaret Cox, who has the condition herself. 'We hear of people going to the shops and people refusing to serve them.'

Bronagh knew she was entering an industry where looks mean everything - and cruelly, stress can exacerbate eczema, so she often suffered flare-ups just before acting jobs and auditions.

'I remember going to see a GP when I was 21. I'd had a terrible break-out and had a big audition coming up. She said: “I think you should think about changing your job.”

'I was so upset as I wasn't getting much acting work at the time. It was definitely my lowest point and I did think: “What am I doing?” But luckily my mum was great and told me not to listen to her.'

The turning point came in 2008 when, at the age of 25, Bronagh was offered the part of Cheryl Brady in Channel 4's Hollyoaks. 'That helped massively,' she says.

Bronagh sat down with the head of make-up and explained her condition, including the products and ingredients she used and avoided.

'I've used emollients and steroid creams all my life; they do help, but I try to use the steroids sparingly because they have the side-effect of thinning your skin. My hands already look older than my years.'

All eczema sufferers are advised to minimise the amount of product they put on their skin - besides their treatments. But Bronagh has to be especially careful because, like a third of people with eczema, she also has food allergies, including an allergy to nuts.

Food allergies are disproportionately high among eczema sufferers because the conditions share the mechanism of an exaggerated immune response, says dermatologist Dr Leslie.

'The new thinking is if eczema occurs before a baby is six months old they are likely to have a food allergy, whereas if it starts later the risk goes down.'

Bronagh not only has to watch what she eats, she also has to check the labels of every product she puts on her skin.

'Only two years ago I was recommended a face cream, which was supposed to be good for eczema. I put it all over my face and my skin felt like it was on fire.

That's nuts: Bronagh, like a third of people with eczema, has a food allergy - to nuts

'I couldn't breathe and my lips swelled up like sausages - my top lip was touching my nose and my bottom lip was touching my chin. My boyfriend Googled the face cream straight away and found that it contained peanut oil.'

Bronagh had gone into anaphylactic shock, a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction where the release of histamine can cause dangerous swelling in the airways.

Her boyfriend took her straight to A&E where  she was treated with antihistamine and adrenaline.

Thankfully, with the experts at Hollyoaks, Bronagh has developed a regimen both to treat her eczema and, where needed, conceal it.

She says: 'The problem is, so much of what's out there for eczema is medical, but the fact is young people, and especially girls, want a cover-up, too. Doctors tell you just to let the skin breathe, but when you're 15 and going to school it's not that simple.'

Bronagh feels confident enough to talk publicly about her eczema for the first time. 'Lots of actors and models have it, but no one wants to talk about it because they feel they need to keep up this perfect ideal.

'I want to get rid of the stigma because I remember what it was like to be a teenager with eczema.

'People think it's contagious and it's gross. The more people understand what eczema is, the less of a big deal it is.'

 After years of trial and error, Bronagh has got living with eczema down to a fine art. Here are her tips:
