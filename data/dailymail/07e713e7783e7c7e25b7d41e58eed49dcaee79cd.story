Three men believed to have been held as ‘slaves’ were rescued in police raids yesterday.

Officers stormed three traveller sites, a business unit and two homes as part of an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking.

Three alleged victims – one in his 30s, one in his 40s and one in his 50s – were taken  to safety. Their identities have not yet  been revealed.

Two people were arrested on suspicion 
of having committed slavery offences, and five others were held on 
suspicion of crimes including cannabis production, money laundering and 
handling stolen goods.

Police
 said a ‘significant quantity’ of cash was found at one address, and a 
suspected stolen trailer and cannabis plants were seized from a farm.

Chief
 Superintendent Julian Moss, head of CID at Avon and Somerset Police, 
which launched an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking
 five weeks ago, said: ‘This is an ongoing and dynamic inquiry – our 
primary aim is to safeguard and protect vulnerable victims.

Chief Superintendent Julian Moss, head of CID at Avon and Somerset Police, said the force launched Operation Wanderer five weeks ago

‘Victims in such cases are often forced to live and work in poor and unsanitary conditions, sometimes with little or no pay.

‘Some
 will not view themselves as victims and, even if they do, may have been
 unable to speak to the police or any other authorities for a variety of
 reasons.’

Mr Moss added: 
‘To the outside world, the fear and intimidation faced by victims of 
forced labour on a daily basis are difficult to comprehend. Today’s 
operation is a very visible statement of our intent to protect people 
from this type  of exploitation.’

Last
 December, William and Mary Connors and three members of their family 
were jailed at Bristol Crown Court for keeping 19 slaves at a caravan 
site in Staverton, Gloucestershire, to carry out building work. The 
traveller family, who made hundreds of thousands from the enforced 
labour, got sentences ranging from two to six years.

Yesterday’s
 raids took place in south Gloucestershire and Bristol. They were 
planned with organisations including the National Crime Agency, the 
anti-trafficking charity Unseen, the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.

Arrangements have been made to help the alleged victims with  medical treatment, accommodation and employment.

Mr
 Moss said: ‘It’s important to recognise that the actions of a small 
minority of people are not reflective of the wider travelling community.

'Similar investigations in other parts of the country show the issue of 
forced labour, domestic servitude and human trafficking is prevalent in 
many areas of society.’

'Some of those affected will not view 
themselves as victims and, even if they do, may have been unable to 
speak to the police or any other authorities for a variety of reasons.'To the outside world the fear and intimidation faced by victims of forced labour on a daily basis are difficult to comprehend'

Amanda
 Deeks, chief executive of South Gloucestershire Council, said the 
authority had worked closely with police through the investigation.

‘Our focus is to ensure that the victims will be given the help they need now that they are in a place of safety,’ she added.

Kate
 Garbers, co-founder of Unseen, said the Bristol-based charity had been 
approached by the police and asked to help with the operation.

‘The
 police had intelligence and wanted to act on it. Unseen were able to 
use their involvement in previous operations, along with their 
experience of working with survivors, to help develop that response,’ 
she said.

‘It’s encouraging to see such a proactive approach from the police and to be involved in a multi-agency approach.

‘From
 working with the police, I commend their in-depth approach to planning,
 and it’s clear that they appreciate the seriousness of these crimes and
 are taking action.’

Avon 
and Somerset’s police and crime commissioner, Sue Mountstevens, said the
 operation ‘clearly highlights the unacceptable and illegal crime of 
human trafficking’.
