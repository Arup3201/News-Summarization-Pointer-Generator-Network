Some 15 passengers were injured today when a single-decker bus crashed through railings and ploughed through 30 graves in a cemetery.

The driver has been interviewed by police after his bus hit a stationary vehicle in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, crashed through railings and careered down a hill, coming to rest on a gravestone.

Operator Go North East said one person needed hospital treatment and others were helped at the scene, although Northumbria Police said nobody was badly injured.

Lesley Robson, 47, of Gateshead, said:
 ‘I got a phone call from my husband saying there'd been an accident and
 a bus had come through the railings of the cemetery.

'Thankfully, my parent's grave wasn't damaged - it's hit the next row down. You can imagine the relief that we felt... It felt like we'd lost her all over again, it's been so traumatic. You think once they're in the cemetery, they're safe'

‘We
 didn't think anything of it, because we thought our mam was too far 
down to be affected, but because we were passing, we thought we'd call 
round and have a look.

‘We 
realised where the bus was and started to panic - went running up and 
although we're sorry for everyone else, thankfully, my parent's grave 
wasn't damaged - it's hit the next row down.

‘You
 can imagine the relief that we felt... It felt like we'd lost her all 
over again, it's been so traumatic. You think once they're in the 
cemetery, they're safe.’

Local resident Martin Taylor, 23, said: ‘It's unbelievable, I can't quite believe it's happened.

‘I certainly can't understand how it's happened anyway, how a driver of a bus who learns health and safety has managed to crash into a cemetery and take all these tombstones out.’

One onlooker estimated the bus had finally come to a stop - with a front wheel resting on a gravestone - around 55 yards into Saltwell Cemetery.

It was thought around 30 gravestones were damaged in the crash, as the bus ran off the road and down the steep slope.

‘The front of the bus is all smashed up,’ said the onlooker, who did not see the crash itself. ‘There's loads of police here and council workers.’

Go North East operates a fleet of nearly 700 buses and coaches and employs more than 2,100 people in the North East. Its service area stretches from Blyth in the north to Darlington in the south.
