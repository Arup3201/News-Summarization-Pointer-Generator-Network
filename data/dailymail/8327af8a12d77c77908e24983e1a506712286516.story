A British grandmother facing execution for smuggling drugs into Bali has criticised the Government for failing to help her legal fight to escape the firing squad.

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was sentenced to death in January after being caught carrying 10.6lb of cocaine worth £1.6million into the holiday island from Bangkok in May last year.

A Just Giving online fund set up by supporters has raised only a third of the £8,000 she needs to take her case to Indonesia’s Supreme Court after a lower court rejected her appeal.

The Government has refused to fund her fight to avoid the firing squad and will today contest a second High Court bid by the anti-death penalty campaign group Reprieve to make it foot the legal bill.

In an open letter written from her cell, Sandiford admits she has been ‘stupid’ and says she has ‘humiliated’ Britain and herself.

She writes: ‘I have been told the Government’s position when it comes to British citizens in my position (is) that I or my supporters must raise the funds for my defence, and that the longer I am on death row the more time I have in which to do this.’

Sandiford says foreign minister Alistair Burt, who rejected her plea for financial help, is ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’.

She adds: ‘My family has done all they possibly can to support me and nobody could ask anyone to do more. I myself am knitting a jumper that I will try to auction to raise money, but that’s not going to go far.’

While she accepts she was to blame for her plight, she says prisoners on trial in Britain at least have a legal aid system to help them.

She says she had been ‘touched and humbled by the kindness of so many members of the British public, who have reached into their own pockets in difficult times to help me pay for a lawyer, when the British government wouldn’t help me’.

However, Sandiford may not be able to lodge her appeal with the Supreme Court before Thursday’s deadline if she is unable to raise the £8,000 needed to pay her legal costs.

She adds: ‘The last appeal cost about £2,600. This time, in the Supreme Court, it will be about £8,000. If I really were a rich drug dealer, it would be no big deal. But I’m not, and you might as well ask me to pay ten million dollars.

‘I know there are some people who think I should die here in this prison cell. If I should die – and I hope I don’t, but I fear I may – then I hope my execution will prompt the British Government to do more for others.’

Sandiford co-operated with police after she was held at Bali airport in a sting operation that led to the arrest of four other suspects, including Britons Julian Ponder, Paul Beales and Rachel Dougall.

However, while Sandiford was sentenced to the death penalty, the other suspects – believed by police to be higher up in the drug smuggling syndicate – had charges of trafficking dropped and were given jail terms of between one and six years.

The Foreign Office, while refusing to fund Sandiford’s appeal, gave a written submission to her appeal hearing arguing that the death penalty she received was excessive and unjust.

Former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald said the discrepancy in sentencing was ‘bizarre and unfathomable’.
