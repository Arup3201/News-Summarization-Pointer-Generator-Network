How well do you know your man? All it took was a simple check on Facebook for a woman to discover her husband had already said his vows with another woman - three other women, in fact.

The woman from South Carolina, whose identity has been been protected by the Newberry County Sheriff's Office, filed a complaint with investigators after she saw wedding photos of her husband, 49-year-old Darnell Pixley, with another woman on Facebook.

After looking online she found that her husband was already married to at least three other women and had divorced another.

Bit of a player! A simple check on Facebook led a woman down a deep rabbit hole of discovery that ended with the revelation that her husband was already married to at least three other women and had divorced another

Newberry County Sheriff Lee Foster said 49-year-old Darnell Pixley was charged on a single count and surrendered to deputies Wednesday

A little more snooping around and she uncovered a marriage license from the November 2013 ceremony.

'Then she decided that she wanted to follow through with it. As absurd as it sounds, and as kind of bizarre that it might be that a man would have multiple wives, it is illegal,' said Sheriff Lee Foster to KLTV.

Pixley was arrested Wednesday and charged with bigamy.

'He was not in to wanting to talk to us about it,' said Foster. 'He had made just a few comments regarding that he thought maybe it was a misunderstanding, but past that, he didn't have anything else to say.'

Didn't have a clue: Darnell Pixley married this lady in November, but it was only after looking him up on Facebook she found out about his polygamist habits!

Sheriff Lee Foster said Pixley married a woman in Edgefield County in 1988. He also married a woman in Richland County in 2008, a woman in Sumter County in 2011 and a woman in Newberry County last November

On Pixley's Facebook profile he shows a photo of himself last November with a caption reading in part, 'on my honeymoon,' to some apparent surprise from his friends.

'You got married?' one asked.

'Yes he married,' replied another.

The investigators found two other women to whom Pixley was married. The marriages date back to 1988.Pixley has married four women in four different cities and counties. His most recent was last November.

He knows all about the ta-tas! The investigation into the marriages of Darnell Pixley began in June when one of his wives saw a November Facebook post saying he was on his honeymoon, a surprise since she wasn't with him

The woman filed a complaint, Foster said. And as deputies probed further, they found out that Pixley had married four women - one each in the South Carolina counties of Aiken, Newberry, Richland and Saluda - starting in 1988

The story gets evern stranger as it was revealed that online court records show Pixley was granted a $2,500 personal recognizance bond with an order to have no contact with any of his alleged wives.

'It didn't appear that they were completely shocked, but they didn't have any clue, I don't think, of what was going on,' said Foster, however his most recent bride seems to be supportive.

Pixley will have to go to criminal and family court and could face jail time.

Complicated past: Pixley - who entered North Augusta as his home on his MySpace page and Florence on his MeetMe page but has no location on Facebook - was released on a $2,500 personal-recognizance bond and has an October 24 court date
