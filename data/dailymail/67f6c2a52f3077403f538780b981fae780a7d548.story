Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped at the age of 14 from her bedroom at knife-point and held captive for nine months, was married in Hawaii on Saturday.

The ceremony had been due to take place in the summer, but due to media attention Ms Smart, 24, and her fiancé Matthew Gilmour decided on the 'spur of the moment' to bring the wedding forward, according to the bride's father.

'It's everything you can imagine with planning a wedding, only it's compressed into a few days,' Elizabeth said of her decision to push the date forward several months.

The couple, who are both Mormons, married at the LDS Laie Hawaii Temple, but plan to settle in Salt Lake City, Utah.

'Elizabeth's desire was for what most
 women want — to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family
 and close friends,' said family spokesman Chris Thomas.

'After
 the story broke about her engagement and the media became increasingly 
invasive, Elizabeth recognized it was going to be impossible to have a 
traditional wedding devoid of distractions and unusual challenges 
outside of her control.

'She is positively radiant, and Matthew couldn't be happier.'

'She decided, about a week ago, the best way to avoid significant distraction was to change her wedding plans and to get married in an unscheduled ceremony outside of Utah.'

Ms Smart's father Ed, who described the wedding as 'kind of a spur of the moment thing', said: 'We're just thrilled she's married.'

The couple will now take an extended honeymoon in a secret location.

Because of the shortened planning time, the bride-to-be had to overlook some traditional wedding inclusions, like the collection of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.

'Are you kidding?' she told People magazine. 'There's been no time!'

Venue: The couple married at the Laie Hawaii Temple, the first Mormon temple outside the U.S. mainland

Secret: The Hawaii wedding was planned just a week in advance thanks to intense media attention

The
 pretty blonde hit headlines after she disappeared from her 
bedroom in 2002. Despite a nationwide search for the teen, she was not 
found for nine months.

It 
was only when an alert biker who had heard about her case on America's 
Most Wanted spotted her at a diner about 18 miles from her home.

In
 the nine months she was held captive by one-time itinerant street 
preacher Brian David Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee, she was 
continuously raped and was even married to Mitchell in a bizarre 
ceremony.

He was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to serve life in prison in May 2011.

Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping of the girl.

It was revealed last month that Ms Smart had become engaged to 22-year-old Mr Gilmour, from Aberdeen in Scotland.

The pair met last year when they were both serving as Mormon missionaries in the south of France.

Never forgotten: Miss Smart, now a 24-year-old university student, wiped tears from her eyes as she recounted the details of how Mitchell 'married' then raped her

In December she spoke for the first 
time publicly about what she suffered at the hands of Mitchell, 
revealing horrific details about her ordeal, including how he dragged 
her from her bedroom to a camp in the woods where he performed the 
marriage and then raped her.

She said: 'He went straight from marrying me to 
raping me. And after that moment I couldn't feel more worthless and more
 degraded. It was the worse feeling I could have ever felt.'

'I kept begging him to let me go - and he wouldn't listen to me,' she told ABC.

'All I could do was scream ''No". He said, ''If you ever scream like that again, I will kill you.'

Ordeal: Elizabeth Smart was abducted at knifepoint from her Salt Lake City home on June 5, 2002. She was held captive for nine months

Guilty: Brian David Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and raping Elizabeth Smart after she was found alive on March 3, 2003

Accomplice: Wanda Barzee was charged with the  kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart and sentenced to 15 years in jail

Although Miss Smart has published a 
book on her terrifying ordeal and spoken at the trial of Mitchell last 
year, this was the first time she was heard in public recounting the 
terrible details.

She had been invited to speak to members of the Salt Lake City Rotary Club to help promote her charity the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. It works in schools across the country with a programme radKIDS to educate children on how to protect themselves from danger.

The senior at Brigham Young University recalled being tied down with a cable on her first night and the deep sense of hopelessness that surrounded her.

She was held captive for nine months during which time she was raped daily by Mitchell, sometimes up to three or four times a day.

Miss Smart had testified at Mitchell's trial in 2010 in excruciating detail about waking up in the early hours of June 5, 2002, to the feel of a cold, jagged knife at her throat and being whisked away by the religious fanatic.

Within hours of the kidnapping, she 
testified, she was stripped of her favourite red pajamas, draped in 
white, religious robes and forced into a polygamous marriage with 
Mitchell.

She was tethered to a metal cable 
strung between two trees and subjected to near-daily rapes while being 
forced to use alcohol and drugs.

She described the horrific events as her 'nine months of hell.'

She recalled being forced to live 
homeless, dress in disguises and stay quiet or lie about her identity if
 ever approached by strangers or police.

Daily, her life and those of her family members were threatened by Mitchell, she said at the trial.
