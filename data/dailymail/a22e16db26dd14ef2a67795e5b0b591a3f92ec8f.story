Parts of a plane’s engine fell from 15,000ft onto a Heretfordshire village as it made its ascent from Heathrow, according to an investigation.

The debris came from a Boeing 777 bound for Dubai which had 256 passengers and 12 crew on board.

The 56-year-old pilot of the Royal Brunei Airlines jet decided to return to the airport as a precaution, where engineers found part of the engine was missing.

It was later discovered that parts had fallen on the village of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.

The main part of the broken engine had fallen on a building in the village, the report from the Department for Transport’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said.

Now the engine’s manufacturers have launched an investigation into how the right-hand engine’s thrust reverser assembly became damaged.

The report said : 'This was the fifteenth similar occurrence known to the manufacturer.

Landing: The parts fell onto a building in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. When the aircraft landed, engineers noticed the missing parts

'The aircraft manufacturer has advised that replacement of the thrust reverser inner wall will be required and may be mandated for all affected aircraft.

'A considerable amount of the missing composite structure was recovered later that day from a property in Broxbourne.'

No passengers or crew were hurt in the incident and it is believed that no one in the village was injured.
