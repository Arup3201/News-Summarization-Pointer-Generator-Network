A couple in New York wandered into a reporter's live shot from Wednesday night's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting then thought it would be funny to re-enact the final moments of Eric Garner's life.

The outrageous prank is made all the more shocking by the fact that WPIX reporter Allison Kaden was on the scene to report on the protest at the ceremony. 

As she described the night's peaceful demonstration, a man in a suit and a woman noticed they were on camera.

Shocking: Allison Kaden of WPIX in New York was covering the protests of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting ceremony when the couple pictured behind her used the opportunity to mock Eric Garner, it appears

Threw her hands up: The man in the suit first noticed the camera, but the woman threw her hands in the air, as Eric garner did just before his death, after it dawned on her what her companion was doing

The man grabbed the woman around the neck and then, as it dawned on the woman what her friend was doing, she played along and put her hands up.

They both then laughed and walked off camera.

Kaden finished her segment non-the-wiser. The in-studio anchors didn't seem to notice, either.

However, the folks at Deadspin picked up on the sick joke and the angry comments were sure to follow.

With good reason. Garner died following his altercation with police due, at least in part, to the chokehold put on him by Officer Daniel Pantaleo.

The tree lighting ceremony came just hours after a grand jury decided not to indict a Pantaleo in Garner's  videotaped chokehold death.

Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his scheduled appearance to meet with elected officials and activists on Staten Island as citywide protests started to gather steam.

Police presence was heavy as hundreds of protesters stood behind rows of police barricades jamming the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue within sight of the holiday revelers. A block away on Sixth Avenue, police in riot gear faced off with protesters behind metal barricades.

But the annual tradition went on as planned.
