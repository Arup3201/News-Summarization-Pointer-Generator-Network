The National Trust in England charges its members almost 50 per cent more to join compared with its sister body in Scotland – and almost six times the fee payable in some other countries.

Yet, in a glaring loophole, members from other heritage bodies from Zimbabwe to Bermuda are still allowed free entrance to historic NT landmarks in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The NT is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds under the reciprocal arrangement – as its own members pay a premium to enjoy unlimited admission to stately homes and castles compared to visiting tourists.

An estimated 80,000 people who live in England belong to the Scottish trust. But if each one became a full member of the NT in England instead, it would boost the charity’s income by £1.52million a year

Last night it emerged that the NT has been fully aware of the loophole for years, and MPs called for it to be closed.

And The Mail on Sunday has discovered that some cunning residents of England and Wales are even taking advantage of the loophole themselves to download the membership forms for foreign organisations and sign up on the cheap.

An estimated 80,000 people who live in England belong to the Scottish trust. But if each one became a full member of the NT in England instead, it would boost the charity’s income by £1.52million a year.

Coming just weeks after the referendum for Scottish independence, it is another example of how the English pay more than their Scottish neighbours across the border.

Adult membership of the NT costs £58 a year in England but people who join the equivalent heritage body over the border pay as little as £39, meaning the English pay a 49 per cent premium for very similar benefits.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he was surprised the loophole had not been closed already. ‘This is quite a serious amount of money we’re talking about and if so many people from England and Wales are joining the Scottish organisation, I’m surprised the National Trust hasn’t done something about this.

‘They do a very good job in general and I would have thought they’d want to keep this money in their coffers and put it to good use, but ultimately it’s a matter for them.’

Even meaner culture-lovers are joining heritage trusts in Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Malta, Jersey and Guernsey where membership costs even less.

‘It’s deeply disappointing. The more people who do this, the less money we have to look after these special places,’ said an NT spokesman.

Any UK resident joining the national trust in Bermuda pays less than £14 a year; in Malta the fee is £15.80

The NT also offers free entrance to members of heritage trusts in Zimbabwe who pay £10 a year, Guernsey £20, Canada £22, Jersey £25, Isle of Man £30, New Zealand £32, Italy £31 and Australia £36.

The NT admits there is a problem but believes that only ‘a few thousand’ deliberately exploit the loophole.

It says heritage trusts in Zimbabwe, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man have strict membership rules and would not allow anyone living full-time in Britain to join their organisations to exploit the free entrance perk at NT properties.

The Trust added: ‘We have been aware for some time that people in the UK have joined overseas conservation organisations to access Trust sites at a lower cost.

‘But we still get extra income from the money they spend in shops and cafes and they have to pay parking.’
