Champion jockey Frankie Dettori has put his 15-acre family home on the market for Â£2.75million.

The Grade II listed estate - complete with stables, paddocks, a swimming pool and an extra cottage - has been home to the sportsman and his wife Catherine since their wedding night 16 years ago.

The couple raised their five children in the sprawling grounds near Newmarket, Suffolk, which they affectionately named White Horse Stables.

Widely regarded as one of the best jockeys of his time, Lanfranco 'Frankie' Dettori has spent the peak years of his career training on these grounds.

Equestrian features include a 
traditional formal stable yard with seven stables, a wash off box, feed rooms and 14 fenced paddocks.

Boasting a sauna, gym, games room and five bedrooms, demand for the property is already high.

Two pairs of electric security gates 
lead to a carriage driveway that provides parking for several cars.

Demand is already soaring for the luxurious home, which has an indoor pool that opens out into a gym, sauna, and a room specially designed to hold shoes

The future owner will inherit four reception rooms, a games room, five bedrooms, and a gym

The sprawling interior has skylights and a marble-topped kitchen. It is where the couple raised their five children

Regularly termed 'the party house', Mr Dettori and family have had the facilities to entertain many over the years

Terraces adjoin the rear of the house with wall heaters and wall mounted
 speakers.

The garden 
has a tree house, a summer house, a floodlit riding school and a two-bedroom cottage with bathrooms and living rooms.

The future owner will inherit a 20-square-foot reception hall, four reception rooms, and a 'boot room' for their shoes.

Built in 1905, White Horse Stables was designed by Charles Voysey, one of the pioneers of modern architecture.

In the silver and blue-themed living room, a giant disco ball hangs over blue velvet sofas with silver legs and a silver chest

Voysey was commissioned by the third Earl of Ellesmere - a peer, author and racehorse enthusiast.

Riding at Newmarket last Wednesday Mr Dettori said: 'We are having a house built at Hare Park Stud at Six Mile Bottom where Catherine's family live.'

Ed Russell, of estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'Because of the Dettori name, we expect a great amount of local, national and international interest in the property.

'However this is an impressive superbly presented house in its own right which has not been on the open market for several decades.'
