Much-loved entertainer Max Bygraves sits on his favourite bench at his former home in Bournemouth, Dorset

A tree in the garden of much-loved entertainer Max Bygraves’ former home split in half and landed on his favourite bench at the time of his death.

In a spooky coincidence, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the trunk of the mature pine as the 89-year-old died from Alzheimer's disease in Australia last weekend.

The 26ft tall tree split in two, sending part of its trunk and a huge branch tumbling down on the wooden garden bench where Max used to sit for hours with his late wife Blossom.

The entertainer, who died on 
September 1, lived at the £2 million clifftop home for 30 years before 
emigrating to Australia in 2003.

Isabelle and Johann Edward, the new 
owners of the property in Bournemouth, Dorset, arrived back from holiday
to find the fallen tree, that had stood for more than 50 years.

Mrs Edward, a 43-year-old company 
director, said: 'We came back from a 10 day holiday in Spain on Monday 
and saw the tree had fallen.

'I have tradesmen doing work upstairs
in the house so I asked one of the men and he told me he didn’t notice 
anything on the Saturday morning.

'It must have fallen down some time between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning.

'We saw the news of Max’s death whilst we were away, which is sad, and then I saw an old picture of him sitting on the bench.

She
added: 'It is a huge piece of tree and landed on that very bench, and I
am told by my gardener, who used to work for Max, that he loved sitting
on it as he could look out across the bay.

Part of the trunk and a large branch of the 26ft tree crashed down into the garden of the entertainer's old home

'This is such a coincidence and I am sure someone would think there is some kind of fate involved in this.

'I’m
not superstitious but it is a bit spooky. That tree had been there all 
through the time that Max lived here and it must be well over 50 years 
old.

'I have no idea why it fell down when it 
did. It could be because of the vibrations cause by the air festival 
last weekend but we really do not know.

'This is one of only a few of these trees on the road and all the others are okay.'

Bygraves, enjoyed enormous success as a singer, comedian, film star and quiz show host.

He and his wife emigrated to Australia in 2003.
