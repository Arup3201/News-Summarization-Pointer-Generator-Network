Ronaldo, Game of Thrones and digestive biscuits are just some of the things that Theo Walcott likes after braving the hot-seat while on England duty.

The Arsenal forward is currently away in Italy with the national team but still took the time to take part in 'Gone in 60 seconds' quick fire question.

The short video was posted on England's Facebook page, where Walcott revealed he's the fastest player in the squad - ahead of the likes of Andros Townsend, Nathaniel Clyne and Danny Welbeck.

Cristiano Ronaldo may have won the Ballon d'Or but is still second choice behind the original, when Walcott was given the choice.

The Targaryen's and the Stark's make up some of the important character's of his favourite show Game of Thrones, while revealing he likes a digestive biscuit.

The only controversial moment was Walcott's decision to change is mind from 'The Great British Bake Off' to 'Gogglebox' when asked which of the two he preferred.

The winger could start on Tuesday for England when they play Italy in a game which will see Harry Kane start his first game for Roy Hodgson's side.
