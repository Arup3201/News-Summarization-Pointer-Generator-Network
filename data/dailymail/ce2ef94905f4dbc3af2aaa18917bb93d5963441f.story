Spending Christmas on a Caribbean island is not without its problems, it seems.

Take, for instance, the example of one British family who mid-way through preparing their festive feast, realised they had forgotten to pack the all-important cranberry sauce.

Thankfully, after scouring the island in vain to try and find somewhere that sold the condiment, they were able to call on the services of a VIP courier service who immediately dispatched a jar of the sauce from London in time for their Christmas day dinner.

London-based courier company First Luggage delivered a jar of cranberry sauce to the Caribbean after a family who were spending Christmas Day on an island forgot to pack their favourite condiment

It is just one example of the unusual assignments undertaken by First Luggage – a London-based delivery company that prides itself on being able to transport  luggage to its clients in the world’s most unlikely destinations.

From delivering supplies to Mount Everest and football paraphernalia to President Obama in the White House, to sending BBC camera equipment to the remotest parts of Italy, First Luggage say they manage a range of weird and wonderful requests on a daily basis.

Each week, the door-to-door company delivers hundreds of holidaymakers’ bags to destinations around the world. 

Sports personalities, celebrities and VIPs are also among those who rely on their services.

One of the biggest items they were asked to deliver was a circus big top from the UK to Angola in Africa

Celebrating its 10th year in business, First Luggage is now lifting the lid on some of its more unusual deliveries.

Following extensive UK floods in early 2014, two Surrey newlyweds were left without their suitcase which had been lost underwater.

After being rushed to the airport by boat, local police retrieved the case after it was seen floating past the police station.

When the couple were informed, they immediately contacted First Luggage, who, with permission from the couple, dried out the contents, including a wedding dress, and then delivered it to them on their honeymoon.

Supplies and climbing equipment were also shipped to Everest base camp in 2013, where two British climbers were attempting to scale the summit of the world’s highest mountain
