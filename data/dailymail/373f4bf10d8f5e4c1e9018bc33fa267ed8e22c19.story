The late Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously declared that football was more important than life and death.

So if he were around today he would no doubt be disappointed by a study which shows men care five times more about their wives than their teams.

Newcastle United fans had their stress levels measured when cutting up pictures of their team and their partners.

The eternal question: Researchers at the University of Bristol have tasked themselves with finding out who football fans love more - their wives or their team

Cutting things down to size: The Newcastle United football fans were asked to cut up photos of their wives and their team to see which affected them the most

Despite the fans telling scientists that they had as much affection for their team as their wives, results showed that they were far more stressed when destroying a picture of their partner.

They also had to choose between sticking needles into voodoo dolls of their favourite player and injuring him for the next game or their partner and making them ill for a week.

Some fans had no problem laying their wife up in bed for a week if it meant their team’s star player would miss a crunch game.

Marcus Munafr, professor of Biological Psychology at Bristol University, said: 'The data that we collected seemed to quite strongly support the idea that actually when it comes down to it they feel more strongly about their partners than their football tam.

Football fanatics: The fans all claimed that they loved their partners and their team equally

The wives win: Results showed that the fans were far more stressed when destroying a picture of their partner compared to a picture of their football team

Tearing up the team: The men weren't as affected by cutting up pictures of Newscastle United as they thought

'Men in the UK and around the world are undoubtedly passionate about the beautiful game.

'What we set out to do was measure it in a scientific way and particularly focus on using techniques which allowed us to find out what they, the fans, were secretly thinking even when their actions may have been telling a different story.'

Roger Harrison, from Puma, who commissioned the research said: 'As football fans we often hear about fans who suggest their team is more important than their girlfriend or spouse, so we decided to have some fun and put it to the test.

'Amongst the Newcastle United participants, who are known for being some of the most loyal and passionate fans in the world, it was clear to see supporters chose their wives over the team.

'In a game of two halves it seems it’s the other half that wins.'

Putting the game first: One participant is then shown two dolls - one representing his wife and the other representing his team's star player. When asked to stick in a pin which one he would rather get ill for a week - he opts for his wife

Sticking the pin in: Another decides he would rather see his team's star player ill for a week over seeing his wife unwell
