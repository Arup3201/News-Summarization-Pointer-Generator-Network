A property developer has managed to found a tiny gap in the market on exclusive Sandbanks by building two tiny detached houses just 10 inches apart.

At 16ft wide, the narrow homes have been squeezed onto a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre, and have replaced a single home that stood on the same site.

Despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought-after community in Poole, Dorset, developers have managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into each of the 840sq ft properties, which also have their own driveways.

Gap in the market: A property developer has managed to find a tiny gap in the market on exclusive Sandbanks by building two tiny detached houses just 10 inches apart

Mind the gap: Due to the overhang of the cladding they appear to be just 10 inches apart from the front view, but from the back garden, they are separated by 2.6 feet, as demonstrated by journalist Frankie Carey

Although the distance between the two is just 25cm they are being marketed as two detached houses in the area, often dubbed Millionaire’s Row, or Britain's Palm Beach, where homes often go for around £4million.

The properties, named Tom and Jerry, were designed and built by Seven Developments, owned by former AFC Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell, and have gone up for sale with an asking price of £745,000 each.

It is the first time such a narrow pair of properties have been built on a small plot on Sandbanks, but they could pave the way for similar developments in the future.

Narrow: Although the distance between the two is just 25cm they are being marketed as two detached houses in the area, often dubbed Millionaire's Row, or Britain's Palm Beach, where homes often go for around £4million

Space saving: Each of the two properties, which cover 840sq ft, boast an open plan kitchen, storage basement and compact spiral staircases to maximise space

Located on a small peninsula 
stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is 
known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property.

By
 area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford 
Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boasts the fourth highest land
 value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive 
properties outside London.

Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to 
its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few 
minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views 
over the harbour or out to the English Channel.

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it  
was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - 
measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, 
turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions.

The property market on the peninsula has 
shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being 
demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand.

In
 July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the
 peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of 
nearly £10,000 per square metre.

And earlier this month a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a 
century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday 
home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase
 in value.

Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be
 worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for
 an eye-watering £2.25million.

In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for 
£3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was 
knocked down.

Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow.

Notable
 residents include a number of well-known names in football such as 
Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme 
Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. 
Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there.

Mr Mitchell said the houses were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that wasn’t a flat.

'The size of the properties is an illusion, they are both the size of four bedroom family houses,' he said.

'We have built the properties up and front to back instead of from side to side and they are quite big and can comfortably take two children and a husband and wife.

'Not everybody wants to live in a large house and that’s why they choose to live in a flat or a town house.

'I think this is a new way to look at 
developments, there are no restrictions when building up, especially 
when there is a shortage of homes.'

Roomy: Despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought-after community, developers have managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into them

Comparison: Developer Eddie Mitchell said the properties were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that wasn't a flat, and said their size was an 'illusion' as they are the size of four bedroom family houses

The properties have courtyard back gardens, their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout, as well as compact spiral staircases to maximise the living space.

In 2013, a property in Sandbanks sold for the equivalent of £1,725  per square foot but the two new properties work out to a cheaper £620 per square foot.

Gary Berendt, senior sales consultant at Arlington and Hall estate agents, said: 'These properties are very controversial.

'Even though one is close to the other
 they are still detached houses and the people looking at them will 
probably be doing so as an alternative to a flat.

'In comparison to flats, the houses have their own off road parking and private gardens.

All mod cons: As well as this luxury bathroom, the properties boast private courtyard back gardens, their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout, plus a driveway providing off road parking

Striking a bargain? In 2013, a property in Sandbanks, home to football figures such as Tony Pulis and Harry Redknapp, sold for the equivalent of £1,725 per square foot but the two new properties work out as a cheaper £620 per square foot

Outside space: Both of the houses have a private patio garden at the rear, although those needing a little extra outdoor space will not have to walk far to find the nearest beach

'I think they will appeal to people living in London or the home counties who are looking for a second home.

'For someone who is looking for a family home, this is probably a bit too small.

'These are the first properties to be built on small plots of land by Mr Mitchell, but I know that he has plans for several more across the area.'

Over the last two decades Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour, has become a millionaire’s playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions.

The sandy peninsula is home to QPR manager Harry Redknapp and Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis.and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there.
