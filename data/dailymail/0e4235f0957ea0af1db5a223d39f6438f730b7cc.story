Police were called to a gift shop on a seaside pier after a complaint that the postcards on sale were 'damaging the image of the town'.

Shop owner Ian Donald was stunned when an officer turned up at his store in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and accused him of selling pornography next to buckets and spades.

The cheeky postcards, featuring women on the beach displaying their bottoms or breasts, shocked Ashley Steinschauer, an assistant minister at the local church, but the complaint has left some bemused.

Police called for postcards: Shop owner Ian Donald was stunned when an officer turned up at his gift shop after a complaint was made about 'saucy' postcards he sold

Mr Donald has owned his shop on Eastbourne Pier for 25 years and said the light-hearted postcards are popular with all ages and were just part of the ‘seaside tradition’.

He said: ‘People would see worse than these postcards if they just walked along the beach.

‘They are not obscene they are just cheeky humour.

‘I couldn’t believe it, I was really shocked.

‘The police officer saw the funny side of it though when I showed him the postcards.’

But
Mr Steinschauer from Elim Family Church was not laughing when he made his complaint to the 
local council, arguing that the postcards were 'damaging' the
town's image.

'Obscene': Ashley Steinschauer, an assistant minister at a local church, complained about some of the postcards Mr Donald sold (including this one) saying they damaged the town's image, 'making it look sleazy'

See the funny side: Mr Donald said that the postcards are just 'cheeky humour' and that the police officer saw the funny side of it when he saw the postcards

He told a local paper: ‘I was shocked to see the postcard on sale right outside the shop.

‘It’s damaging the image of the town and making it look sleazy.

‘I think it shows a real shift in morality and it’s got to stop.’

"My only concern was that postcards were being sold 'outside' the shop at an eye level of very young children. I also did not contact the police"

The complaint made to the council was passed on to Trading Standards who told police that obscene images were on sale on the pier.

In response to the incident some took to micro-blogging site Twitter.

One posted: ‘Charge the complainant with wasting police time.’

Very popular: Mr Donald has owned the gift shop on Eastbourne Pier for 25 years and says the postcards in question are popular 'with all ages'. He sells some 600 a year

On the website of local paper The Argus, readers also commented on the police visit.

One wrote: 'Some people do really need to get a life and a sense of humour.'

Another posted: ‘So the country is going down the toilet, Police are being murdered and there is a sense of general dissatisfaction but some person has taken the time to call the Police about a postcard at a seaside stall? Grief.’

Mr Donald, who sells other postcards including scenic shots, said: ‘I sell 600 of these every year and I’m not going to stop now.

‘We get loads of elderly people buying them, although they do tend to turn them face down when they come to the counter because they are a bit embarrassed.’

Neil Stanley, the council’s lead member for tourism, said: ‘Visitors to Eastbourne expect wholesome good fun and the saucy postcard is a vital part of our seaside heritage.’ 

A Sussex Police spokesman said they could not find any record of a complaint being made to them about ‘saucy postcards’.
