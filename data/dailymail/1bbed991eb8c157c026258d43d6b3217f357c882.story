Fat cat: Barclays executive Rich Ricci scooped £68,340 in prize money at Cheltenham yesterday

Barclays executive Rich Ricci, who was given a £6million bonus last month, got even richer yesterday after his horse Champagne Fever won the first race of the Cheltenham Festival.

The multi-millionaire banker scooped £68,340 prize money after his horse romped home in the William Hill Supreme Novices’ Hurdle ahead of favourite My Tent or Yours.

Champagne Fever is one of 11 horses the Barclays head of investment banking has competing in the festival, including the even more provocatively named Fatcatinthehat.

The name is believed to be a mocking reference to a 2011 newspaper article about Mr Ricci headlined ‘Who’s the fat cat in the hat? The rich world of Rich Ricci.’

Mr Ricci, who was not at Cheltenham yesterday but is expected later in the week, is a hugely divisive figure who helped run the Barclays investment bank while traders bragged about manipulating Libor interest rates, which led to the bank being fined £290 million.

Critics see him as the epitome of the aggressive ‘casino’ culture under former Barclays boss Bob Diamond.

Labour MP John Mann denounced the banker’s appearance at the Cheltenham Festival as an ‘insult’ to every taxpayer and small business in the country.

He added: 'It shows just how out of touch these bankers are.’

US born Mr Ricci is worth £57m according to The Sunday Times rich list.

He cashed in £9.7million of shares bonuses last year, earned £44million of pay and perks in 2010 and is set to pocket up to £6million in deferred shares bonuses this year.

With his 49-year-old English wife, Susannah, he owns 30 horses with Ireland’s champion trainer Willie Mullins.Their thoroughbreds have won £588,125 in prize money this season.

Last month, it emerged that Mr Ricci and four other bosses at Barclays would share a jackpot worth up to £17million despite being tainted by a string of scandals.

The awards were dubbed ‘unjustifiable’ and poorly-timed, as Barclays tries to rebuild its reputation in the wake of the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal.

Last December Mr Ricci spearheaded a review of ethics and operations at Barclays aimed at regaining trust after its reputation after the Libor PR catastrophe.

As part of it, he imposed what he called a ‘tabloid test’ and wants to outlaw activities that would look bad if they appeared in the newspapers.

But there will no doubt be widespread sympathy for Mr Ricci after another of his horses, Arvika Ligeonniere, lost the festival’s Racing Post Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase meaning he left without the race’s £85,425 prize money.
