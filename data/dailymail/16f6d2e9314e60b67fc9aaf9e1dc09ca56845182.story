She might be celebrating her 33rd birthday but it appears Prince Harry has more to celebrate than the Duchess of Cambridge.

The 30-year-old prince has been named the UK's favourite royal, with the Duchess languishing in second place.

In third place was the Queen, while Prince William took fourth spot and the Prince of Wales fifth place.

The findings are the result of a new poll that spoke to 2,000 adults. In addition to favourites, the study also looked at the impact of the royals and public perception.

Those results give the Duchess more to be pleased about, with a third of Britons saying she is a fantastic ambassador for the UK and another 30 per cent saying she has reinvigorated public perception of the royals.

Admirable qualities include her down-to-earth nature, which was liked by 40 per cent, her dedication to her family and her charity work.

The Duchess was also deemed an excellent role model, with 20 per cent of those questioned saying she was a good person for girls to look up to.

Despite her popularity, it was Prince Harry who came out on top thanks to his championing of injured servicemen and women via the Invictus Games and his cheeky personality.

Harry's successful year also included a trip to Brazil, during which he was pictured hugging a crack addict during a visit to a Sao Paulo favela, and a visit to Lesotho on behalf of his AIDS charity, Sentebale.

The Queen, meanwhile, ended 2014 on a high note following a series of successful visits, among them trips to Paris and Belfast.

Despite the antics of Prince Andrew and the allegations currently hanging over his head, the Queen remains an essential part of British life and is much-loved in Britain and abroad.

Prince Charles, meanwhile, has suffered a bumpy start to 2015 thanks to the storm surrounding postponed BBC documentary, The Reinvention of the Royals.

Nevertheless, his dedication to duty, which saw him undertake 445 engagements in the UK last year and 95 abroad, have won him legions of admirers.

His public image has also softened, with Charles showing his gentler side during October's visit to Colombia.

There, he was pictured looking absolutely delighted as a little girl from the village of La Macarena in northern Colombia planted a kiss on his cheek.

Earlier the same year, he was seen enjoying the Highland Games with the Duchess of Cornwall's grandchildren - and was pictured with one of the little boys clinging to his leg. 

The study was commissioned by Parragon Books to mark the launch of Glitterbelle, a series for girls about a kindhearted princess.

This research proves the growing popularity of the Duchess of Cambridge, whose grace, charm and down-to-earth nature makes her a worthy role model for budding princesses across the UK,' said Rachel Lawrence, Head of Children’s Publishing.

'We’re delighted to launch our very own princess Glitterbelle, a fun, glittery and relatable princess starring in a range of creative story and activity books for children.' 

Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen, Prince William and Prince Charles might make up the top five, but other royals have also proved popular.

Among them are Princess Anne in sixth place, the Duke of Edinburgh in seventh and Zara Tindall in eighth.

1. Prince Harry (31 per cent)
