Kirsty Walters, 29, was released from prison five months early because of a 'clerical error' by staff

Police are trying to find a female burglar who was released from prison five months early because of administrative blunders by officials. 

Kirsty Walters was locked up for 876 days after she broke into a string of properties in Darwen in Lancashire.

But she was released five months early in October from New Hall Prison in Wakefield because of what police have described as a 'clerical error.' 

The Ministry of Justice has been accused of 'incompetency' in allowing the 29-year-old to be released before the end of her sentence. 

She was due to be released in March 2015.

Walters, of no fixed address, is described as being white, 5ft 1ins tall, of medium build, with long blonde or dyed red hair and green eyes. 

She has pierced ears and bellybutton and spoke with a gruff local accent.

Graham Jones, MP for Hyndburn, said: 'This shows incompetency from the Ministry of Justice in signing off this release.

'It is also a rather bizarre story and I would take the view that having committed the crime, Walters must complete her sentence.'

A police spokesman said Walters 'was released due to a clerical error.' 

He said she has previous convictions for burglary and has been recalled to prison where she targeted insecure properties in Darwen.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'Releases in error are very rare but regrettable occurrences. 

'The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10 but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.

'We are formally investigating this incident and it is now a matter for the police.'

Walters was not due to be released from New Hall prison in Wakefield until March but left prison in October  

Last year figures released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a number of parliamentary questions revealed 148 inmates had been released in error since May 2010 from jails in England and Wales.

At the time Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Victims will be insulted that criminals are allowed to waltz out of jail so easily, and continue to live their lives scot free.'
