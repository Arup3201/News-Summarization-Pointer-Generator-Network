New details are coming out about the sexy Aussie fan who flirted with the New York Yankees' highest-paid benchwarmer Alex Rodriguez at the game on Saturday night.

Kyna Treacy, the 33-year-old model who caught A-Rod's eye as she watched the game right behind the Yankees dugout, had previously pursued a career modeling for a New York strip club, Scores, in Chelsea.

Treacy had applied in September to pose for an advertisement for a rumored $2,000, shortly after she first landed in New York.

Treacy emailed an agent, charged with finding the right girl for the sexy spot, and expressed her interest, in addition to sending a headshot of herself, according to the New York Post.

The job description said it wanted 'sexy models ... who are comfortable in lingerie or a bikini [and] natural, curvy and very pretty ... dancers/pole dancer types a plus!'

It is unknown if her face caught the attention of the strip club.

Treacy has become the object of ire 
after it was revealed that the brunette beauty flirted with the Yankees 
star at at time Rodriguez should have been more focused on baseball.

The third baseman, who has been 
called out numerous times over the years for failing to hit when it 
matters the most, traded his terrible batting average for another set of
 digits on Saturday night.

Rodriguez reportedly got her phone number before the Yankees fell to the Detroit Tigers in the first game of the American League Championship Series.

Ms Treacy, who lives in New York, also owns her own bikini line - Kini Bikini.

In 2009, she donned a striped two-piece in a commercial for Air Pacific.

The free-swinging slugger tried to chat up the women after he was pulled 
from Saturday’s game against the Detroit Tigers in the eighth inning 
with the Yankees down 4-0.

And
 while Ms Treacy appears charmed by A-Rod, she may be alone, as fans, 
the New York media and Yankees manager Joe Girardi have had enough.

The three-time American League MVP was benched for last night's loss to the Tigers.

His failure to produce at the plate has been exacerbated by his recent loverboy antics and cavalier attitude.

Even mouthy real estate mogul Donald 
Trump couldn’t resist taking a few jabs, posting Twitter musings that 
called A-Rod a ‘$30m/yr rip off’ and that 'it was only drugs that made 
him great.'

He was referring to Rodriguez's 2009 admission that he took performance-enhancing drugs while he played with the Texas Rangers.

A-Rod, who has two children with ex-wife Cynthia, has dated Kate Hudson, Madonna, Cameron Diaz and WWE wrestler Torrie Wilson.

Rodriguez
 didn’t talk to reporters as we he walked onto the field for pregame 
warm-ups last night, but wore a big smile on his face as he laughed and 
joked around with teammates.

In the dugout, A-Rod smirked, waved and mouthed 'hi mom' when TV cameras were fixed on him.

It’s clear that Rodriguez, 37, is not the dangerous hitter he once was, and with another five years and $114million left on his contract, the Yankees may be suffering from buyer’s remorse.
