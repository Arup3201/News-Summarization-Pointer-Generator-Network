Barrier: Some Christians now claim their religious beliefs are preventing them from getting the top jobs because they are seen as 'potential trouble'

Christians are less likely than atheists to be promoted to top jobs, official figures show.

Nearly a quarter of people with no religious belief live in homes headed by someone with a senior executive position or a job in one of the professions.

However, well under a fifth of Christians work in the best-paid and most influential jobs or are married to someone who does.

The figures also show high levels of senior and professional employment among the Jewish and Hindu communities.

The breakdown of employment and religious belief, produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from the 2011 census, comes as campaigners claim it is becoming harder for Christians to get to the top.

Barrister Andrea Minichiello Williams, a member of the Church of England’s General Synod, said: ‘If you hold views that are contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy you are seen as potential trouble.

‘This is a real phenomenon. Christianity is now a bar to appointment or promotion.’

But others believe the Christian majority are being out-paced by more ambitious religious groups.

Economist Ruth Lea, of the Arbuthnot Banking Group, said: ‘Jews and Hindus are proportionately so much more successful than Christians. The driven people tend to come from minorities.

'Christians are the majority group, and they do not seem so ambitious and hard working.’

Miss Lea, who is an Anglican, added: ‘There doesn’t seem to be any discrimination here. What these figures say is that if you are determined you can make it.’

The number of people claiming to be Christian in England and Wales fell by 4million in the decade to 2011 to 33million.

Of these, two thirds only go to church for weddings, baptisms or funerals. However, those with no religion rose 45 per cent to 14million.
