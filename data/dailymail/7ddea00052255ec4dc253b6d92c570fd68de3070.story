Eight months after falling foul of UEFA's FPP rules, Manchester City are flexing their financial muscles once again with a £30million move for Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony.

In footballing terms, it's a no-brainer. Manuel Pellegrini has to fight for trophies on three fronts – Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup – but currently has only one available forward, Stevan Jovetic, with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko injured, and six others including Alvaro Negredo out on loan.

But getting the figures to stack up if Bony comes in on £200,000-a-week will be harder. City want success on the pitch of course but at the same time daren't upset the authorities again by spending beyond the means allowed by the governing body.

Bony's potential arrival at City would have implications on their reduced Champions League squad

If Bony comes in, someone like Jesus Navas will have to be sacrificed from City's reduced Champions League squad.

The club are only allowed to name 21 players for Europe as a UEFA sanction and Joe Hart, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner need to be included to meet the quota on association-trained players.

Given that goalkeeper Willie Caballero is also required as back-up for Hart, Bony's inclusion in City's next European squad would mean one of their overseas big-hitters missing out.

You would assume Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero are automatic selections, so one of the following would miss out: Bacary Sagna, Martin Demichelis, Aleksandar Kolarov, Eliqauim Mangala, Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas, Samir Nasri, Edin Dzeko, Fernando or Fernandinho.

In addition, someone else may have to be sold to help balance the books with the club keen to cash in on Matija Nastasic or Scott Sinclair if they can be persuaded.

Someone may also have to accept a smaller pay packet in the next round of contract negotiations to help pay for Bony's wages. Milner, Demichelis, Micah Richards and John Guidetti all have deals that expire in the summer.

A brief recap is needed. Financial fair play regulations were introduced by UEFA to stop the boom-and-bust mentality that threatened to destroy clubs across Europe, with Portsmouth and Leeds United the best examples in England of ownership gone wrong.

The initial spending spree at City following the 2008 takeover from the Abu Dhabi ruling family saw the club run up annual losses, rising to £195m in 2011 alone.

Of course Sheikh Mansour could personally afford it but UEFA said they wanted to avoid any situation where a club's future was put at risk by an owner over-spending and then withdrawing support.

In May, City accepted their punishment for breaking FPP rules. They were hit with a conditional £49m fine, a limit of £49m net spending in the summer transfer window, a reduced Champions League squad from 25 to 21 and had to agree to cap spending on wages in 2015 and limit overall losses to £7.8m.

It should be pointed out they weren't the only club who broke FPP rules. Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain were in the same boat and UEFA are also investigating a number of other clubs.

The sanctions affected Pellegrini's plans for the season. He couldn't afford to be in the market for Angel di Maria or Falcao who both ended up at Manchester United and £16m Negredo was sent on loan to Valencia because there wasn't room for him in the Champions League squad.

'It all starts from the restrictions due to the money we spent,' said the City manager at the time, though Negredo was happy to return to Spain as well.

The repercussions became clear when leading scorer Aguero suffered a knee injury at the start of December and joined Jovetic and Dzeko on the treatment table.

Although City have continued to win games with Milner up front and Aguero is expected to return against Everton on Saturday, Pellegrini has realised his squad is too light with defining matches against Chelsea and Barcelona coming up – hence the interest in Bony, an Ivory Coast powerhouse who is already proven in English football.

For their part, City are reluctant to explain at this stage how they are going to sign Bony and stay within FPP rules – understandable as the deal to sign the 26-year-old is still ongoing. If and when it is completed, they will be asked again.

Even moving for Bony is a sign of their growing confidence that they have the spending-revenue ratio under control as demanded by UEFA.

Their latest set of financial figures in December saw annual losses reduced to £7m after the fine to UEFA had been taken into account. The main reason is the increased revenue the Premier League champions are now bringing in. Their turnover is at an all-time high £346.5m, with plenty of sponsorship deals in place with companies from Gulf and elsewhere.

Bony will be an eye-catching signing for City, both on and off the field.
