The Open at men-only Muirfield in 2013 was perhaps the most bruising week in the history of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club.

'Never again' became the mantra after the event was overshadowed by political and media condemnation of the club's exclusionary membership policy. Accordingly, the R&A put their own house in order, sweeping away more than 250 years of tradition with a vote last year that will see the club accept its first women members.

That intent to avoid another Muirfield surely lies behind Tuesday's announcement that men-only Royal Troon, who will host next year's Open, are undertaking a 'comprehensive' review of their membership policy. They also agreed to share responsibility for hosting the event with Troon Ladies.

Of the three men-only clubs on the Open rota — Royal St George's in Kent is the other — Troon had been the most aloof following the R&A vote. They hid behind the line that members of a separate club, Troon Ladies, can play the Open layout. 

'We are a single-gender club but feel it is unfair to be compared to some other clubs,' said secretary David Brown.

Then Scottish girls champion and Troon ladies member Connie Jaffrey revealed she was not even allowed to use the practice putting green. Imagine that being regurgitated during The Open? 

Hence the Troon press release announcing the review. Muirfield and Royal St George's are not due to host again until the 2020s but both are also undertaking reviews.
