Ever since the shaky launch of the Obamacare website, people have been wondering about the identity of the woman whose picture was used on HealthCare.gov's homepage.

Now we may never know who she is since her picture was taken down from the site this weekend.

In her place is a new graphic that explains the four ways people can sign up to get coverage.

Where did she go? The mysterious woman who became the face of HealthCare.gov, has had her photo taken down from the home page

Despite the number of technical glitches the Obamacare website has been experiencing, stock photo girl keeps on smiling

Before she was taken down, the anonymous model had become the face of the malfunctioning website and screen grabs of the homepage were used in news broadcasts across the country.

The satirical website The Onion published a story on Tuesday called 'People In Healthcare.gov Stock Photos Now Visibly Panicking'.

Even 'stock photo girl' looks alarmed by the glitches on the website judging by her eyebrows.

And then Conservative blogger David Burge tweeted: 'Congrats, vapidly smiling Healthcare.gov splash page stock photo girl! You're now the most despised face on planet Earth.'

The question on everyone's lips is - who is this woman? And does she mind being dubbed the most hated woman in the U.S.?

But in this satirical version of the website on The Onion, even stock photo girl looks like she is beginning to worry

Jeanne Moos, from CNN, said: 'A small 
company that originally worked on the homepage told CNN she was 
originally part of the mock-up from the design folks.

'We checked stock photo files but couldn't find her.'

Even President Barack Obama's supporters have been critical of the website's performance which has been plagued with problems from the start.

Obama said this week there 'is no excuse' for the glitches.

Conservative blogger David Burge didn't hold back when he tweeted that stock-photo girl is the most despised face 'on the planet'

He said despite the problems, the insurance enrollment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. 

But those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the October 1 roll-out. 

In last week's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that HealthCare.gov 'hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work'.

However, the White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since October 1.
