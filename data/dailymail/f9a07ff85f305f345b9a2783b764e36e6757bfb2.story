Kentucky Senator Rand Paul sent a signal on Wednesday that he won't pull punches about his political party's public-perception problems during a 2016 presidential run, candidly confessing that 'the Republican Party brand sucks.'

Appearing at a Michigan GOP field office in a predominantly black section of metropolitan Detroit, the eye-surgeon-turned-politician lamented Republicans' reputation of unfriendliness toward minorities, conceding that nonwhite voters are miles away from abandoning Democrats.

'Remember Domino’s Pizza?' he asked. 'They admitted, "Hey, our pizza crust sucks." The Republican Party brand sucks and so people don’t want to be a Republican.'

'And for 80 years African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans,' he continued. 'Why? Because of a perception. The problem is the perception is that no one in the Republican Party cares.'

'The Republican Party brand sucks': GOP Senator Rand Paul hasn't pulled punches about his party's problem connecting with millennials and minorities

Paul, an eye surgeon-turned-privacy hawk, has ventured into neighborhoods and spoken to audiences where Republicans have historically feared to tread

'We’re also fighting 40 years of us doing a crappy job, of Republicans not trying at all for 40 years, so it’s a lot of overcoming,' the senator said. 

'You got to show up, you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that we’re trying to do something different.' 

Paul has conducted an outreach offensive since last year, speaking to black audiences at the NAACP, the historically black Howard University, and other venues where Republicans are typically treated with hostility and distrust.

Those speeches have brimmed with projections about policies that he says would help minorities more than what the party of Barack Obama has managed.

'Republicans face a daunting task,' he told the Howard University audience in Washington, D.C. in April 2013. 'Several generations of black voters have never voted Republican and are not very open to even considering the option.'

'Democrats still promise unlimited federal assistance and Republicans promise free markets, low taxes and less regulations that we believe will create more jobs.'

He also promised to work toward reforms of a federal justice system that often sentences minor drug offenders – overwhelmingly minority offenders – to lengthy prison sentences.

In an interview last year with MailOnline in New Hampshire, Paul said the net effect is 'generations of young black kids who don't have father figures around, and that's how the cycle of poverty keeps going. That's how the cycle of crime and despair keeps going.'

On Wednesday, The Hill reported, he put in in stark terms of racial unfairness – a political taboo for most Republicans.

'We look at incarceration and we see a disproportionate number of people of color in jail,' Paul said, 'and then when we see statistics on drug use, it seems to be about equal among all the different races.' 

'Blacks and Hispanics seem to populate our jails more.' 

During another of his listening-tour appearances, he spoke at the University of California Berkeley, a traditionally hostile Democratic enclave.

That audience, however, hooted and hollered in support of his civil-libertarian positions on electronic privacy.

He also debuted his pizza-as-politics observation there.

'Remember Domino’s finally admitted they had bad crust?' he told the students in March. 'Think Republican party. Admit it, okay. Bad crust; we need a different kind of party.'
