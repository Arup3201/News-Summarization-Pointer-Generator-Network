Kyle Edmund received a useful education but little in the way of glory as his first Grand Slam appearance on merit ended in a straight sets defeat.

The 20 year-old from Yorkshire, who came through three qualifying matches, went down 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and ten minutes to powerful American Steve Johnson, failing to make up a ranking deficit of more than 150 places.

With Heather Watson bowing out it was left to James Ward to try and join Andy Murray in the singles second round of the Australian Open as he took on Spain's Fernando Verdasco.

Playing on a remote outside court in the shadow of the giant MCG, Edmund did not disgrace himself against the much improved Californian, who in the past twelve months has cut his ranking from 157 to 38.

The big-serving Johnson was sometimes troubled by Edmund's potent forehand but managed to break once each in the first two sets, with the qualifier unable to take his one break point created as the American tried to serve it out in the opener.

Edmund stayed with him admirably until halfway through the second, but the gap in experience and quality began to tell and there was no way back from the early break in the third.

The British player, who has appeared at Wimbledon but only with the help of a wildcard, peppered the Johnson backhand but could never quite break it down. He went down with a second break of serve in the third set but is bound to have gleaned a lot from his Melbourne experience.

He now heads for a Challenger level event in Hong Kong next week away from the bright lights of the Grand Slams.

Edmund faces competing against a tough generation of contemporaries – as demonstrated by the likes of Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios here – and admitted he needs to keep improving.

'To qualify here through three matches was a good experience, but I need to keep working on my return to get into the rallies. You learn more from your losses. The more matches you play at this level the more comfortable it becomes.

'I'm in a strong generation, there are quite a few coming through but I have to focus on what I'm doing and bring my game to the court. I haven't faced many players with that kind of serve I faced today.'
