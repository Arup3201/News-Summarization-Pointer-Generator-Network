Australian correspondent for Al Jazeera, Peter Greste, has been jailed for seven years in Egypt. He listens to his verdict from the defendants cage during the trial

The Federal Government is set to formally request Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's intervention in the case of Australian journalist Peter Greste.

Greste - along with his two other Al Jazeera English colleagues - was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found guilty of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's political situation, aligning himself with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.

The trio - including Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohammed - were arrested on December 29 after a raid on their Cairo hotel they were using as an office and denied the accusations, saying they were just doing their job.

The verdict has sparked international outcry and condemnation of the north African country.

But late on Tuesday the Egyptian president dashed hopes of a prompt resolution, declaring local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'.

A government official said Mr Sisi cannot legally pardon Greste until a final ruling from the appeal court.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott understood the president's position but added the Egyptian was a reasonable man.

'This is someone who does get it when it comes to the ordinary norms of justice and decency,' Mr Abbott told Sky News.

He said it is important that Australia not resort to outrage when dealing with Egypt on the matter.

'I don't believe that loose language or emotive language is necessarily going to get us the right result for Peter Greste,' Mr Abbott said.

Dialogue between the two countries over the court verdict started in Canberra on Tuesday.

With Egypt's ambassador to Australia currently in Cairo, his deputy - charge d'affaires Sherif Abdelaziz Bedeir Hussein - was summoned to a meeting with senior diplomats who expressed Australia's dismay at the sentences handed to Greste and his colleagues.

Greste's parents, Juris and Lois Greste, vowed never to give up fighting for their son's release, indicating a pardon from the head of Egypt's government is 'probably the very first thing' they would consider.

But Mr Sisi's more recent statement means the family might have to wait until the lengthy appeal court process has been exhausted before a pardon will be considered.

'My vocabulary fails to convey just how shattered we are,' Mr Greste told AAP.

Mr Greste said his son had been jailed for upholding the principles of free speech, and that fight must never end.

'To us, it is not just affecting the Greste family. It is also a slap in the face and a kick in the groin to Australia, as well as all fair-minded people around the world,' he said.

Shortly after the verdict was handed down on Monday, Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said she was 'deeply dismayed and appalled' by the severity of the sentence. Ms Bishop also added Greste was a well-respected Australian journalist.

'I have spoken at length with Peter Greste's parents. We understand that Egypt has been through some very difficult times and there has been some turmoil,' she said.

'This verdict does nothing to support Egypt's claim it's on a transition to democracy.

'Freedom and freedom of the press is fundamental to democracy. We are deeply concerned this verdict is a part of a broader attempt to muzzle the media freedom that upholds democracy around the world.'

Greste's brothers Andrew and Mike were in the court and were stunned by the unexpected verdict and sentence.

'I haven't seen anything yet which outlines the reasoning,' Andrew Greste told the ABC.

'It's very difficult to prepare for that. I don't know how you prepare for that.

'Regardless of whether you prepare yourself, the emotions are just devastated, I'm gutted. It's unbelievable.'

Andrew said he and Mike were not able to see their brother amid the chaotic scenes as he was whisked away from the mesh cage in which he was locked in the courtroom, but will visit him on Tuesday.

'We're not going to give up the fight to get Peter released because we believe he's completely innocent, he's done nothing wrong. It's just going to be a matter of looking at all the options.'

On top of seven years' imprisonment, Greste's colleagues Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohammed received an extra three years on separate charges.

Greste raised his fists in the air while Fahmy angrily shouted 'I swear they will pay for this', from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced.

'They just ruined a family,' Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session, said.

He said they would appeal the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system.

'Everything is corrupt,' Adel said.

Twitter exploded with messages of disgust and outrage for the jailed Australian journalist as soon as the news broke.

Not long after the sentence was delivered, the hashtags #FreeAJStaff, #Greste and #AJTrial were trending on the social media site.

Greste and his colleagues have been in custody in Cairo for six months.

The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and tried in absentia.

Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood.

The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them.

The three and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs as journalists, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi's ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president.

The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison.

The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood.

THE ARREST

Peter Greste and two Al-Jazeera English colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, detained in December in a raid on their Cairo hotel room, used as an office to cover protests by supporters of ousted Islamist president.

THE CHARGES

Accused of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood and faced terrorism related charges including 'spreading false news' to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war.

THE DEFENCE

They pleaded innocent, saying they were simply doing their jobs as journalists.

THE EVIDENCE

Prosecution evidence included seemingly unrelated videos of trotting horses, a song by Australian singer Gotye, and a BBC documentary from Somalia. It also included other video footage found in their possession, including a report on a veterinary hospital in Cairo, Christian life and old footage of Greste from previous assignments elsewhere in Africa.

THE VERDICT

Found guilty and sentenced to seven years prison in a Cairo court on Monday.
