A Connecticut Senator is reportedly in a coma after suffering a nasty fall early Monday morning at his home in Stonington.

Sen. Andrew Maynard is believed to have tumbled off the balcony of an outside staircase about 2.40am, landing on the hard concrete sidewalk below.

The 52-year-old suffered serious head injuries and was transported to Westerly Hospital in Rhode Island unconcious.

Friends have told The Courant he remains in a coma.

Scene: Sen. Maynard is said to have fallen from this landing onto the concrete below

Fall: The accident occurred at his home in Stonington, Connecticut, about 2.40am Monday

'It sounded like he'd taken an enormous blow to the head,'Â  State Representative Diana Urban told the publication.

'And it sounded to me like it was not a medically induced coma.

'Andy and I are really good friends, not just colleagues.'

Sources have told WFSB that Maynard was moving furniture at the time of an accident.

A neighbor was with him and called police.

'Family members are with him now, at an area hospital, and are caring for him,' Senate President Donald Williams and Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney said in a joint statement Monday morning.

'His family is asking for privacy while he convalesces.'

Maynard represents the 18th District covering eight towns in the southeastern corner of Connecticut.

He has served in the Senate since 2007 and is now a deputy Senate majority leader and co-chair of the legislature's Transportation Committee.
