If you have ever wanted to own your own port, your ship could be about to come in.

For £4.4 million, you can buy  a working piece of maritime  history, complete with two beaches, tall ships and an ice cream parlour.

Unfortunately, Cornwall's Charlestown Harbour does not come with a house to live in.

Charlestown harbour in Cornwall - complete with two beaches and its own ice cream parlour - has gone up for sale for £4.4m

Its owner, Robin Davies, has turned the Grade II listed port into a successful business in its own right, with the quaint quayside becoming a popular setting for film and TV crews

As well as the shipyard business which makes and restores vessels and offers seamanship training, there is huge revenue potential in movie location fees and hiring out the Tall ships

The port was used for the scene in Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland where the heroine (played by Mia Wasikowska, above) sets sail for China

Instead, you can own the waterfront, a car park and roads for offers in the region of £1.5 million.

Another £1.4 million buys a marine training and charter business, including two square-rigged tall ships, and a further £1.5 million will secure two acres of land suitable for commercial or residential development, although it does not yet have planning consent.

The small port has been in private ownership for nearly 20 years, although members of the public are allowed access on foot or by boat.

There is also income in the lease on the restaurant and ice cream parlour, mooring fees and car park charges

The harbour is a popular tourist destination and was visited by Tony and Cherie Blair in 2001

The port was built in the late 18th century by local landowner Charles Rashleigh. It developed around the fishing village of West Polmear

The quaint Grade II-listed quayside has become a popular setting for film crews. Scenes from The Eagle Has Landed, Treasure Island, The Three Musketeers and Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland have been filmed there, and it featured in an episode of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith – The Curse Of The Black Spot.

The port was built in the late 18th century by local landowner Charles Rashleigh.

The site was developed around the fishing village of West Polmear.

Initially, it capitalised on the China clay trade and fishing - but as these businesses declined, use of the harbour almost ground to a halt.

In 1994, Square Sail bought the port and beaches - and it soon housed three square-rigged sailing ships.

Owner Robin Davies, 69, is nearing 
retirement and has placed the 3.5-acre piece of land and water  up for 
sale in the hope that a new owner will take over his business, which 
employs 18 people, including a harbour master, engineers and deckhands.

As well as the shipyard business, 
which makes and restores vessels and offers seamanship training, there 
is potential revenue in film location fees and hiring out the tall 
ships.

There is also income from the lease on the restaurant and ice 
cream parlour, mooring fees and car park charges.

Mr Davies said: 'We bought the harbour
to keep ships in and have the facilities to repair boats, but a lot of 
our business is now focused on film sets.

'It is a vibrant little village and a 
spectacular place to live, and we think this is a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity for someone.'

A spokesman for commercial agents 
First Peninsula, which is handling the sale, said: 'Charlestown Harbour 
is one of the few remaining British ports still in private ownership. It
offers a wealth of opportunity to its purchaser.'

Mr Davies said: 'The harbour used to be used to export china clay and when we came here the place was covered in this white dust'
