General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff, has warned ministers any further cuts to defence spending would jeopardise the success of the service's reform programme

The head of the Army has warned against further defence cuts as he stressed the military needed to be prepared to deal with any new threat which might emerge.

General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff, warned ministers any further cuts to spending would jeopardise the success of the service's reform programme.

Gen Wall said while there was currently little appetite among politicians for fresh military engagement overseas, he warned Britain should pay 'special attention' to the 'rapidly shifting environment in which we may well have to operate sooner than some would have us think'.

He said they would need all their current allocation if they were to deliver a 'well-trained, well-equipped and fully funded' force capable of defending the national interest.

His comments come after the former chief of the defence staff, General Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, warned last night the armed forces were not in a fit state to deal with the current threats facing the country, most notably terrorism, and would deteriorate further if spending did not increase.

Earlier this month, the National Audit Office warned of 'significant risks' to the Army reform programme, known as Army 2020.

The reforms plans will see the regular Army cut by 20,000 to 82,000 while the number of part-time reservists will be increased from 19,000 to 30,000.

Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference in London, Gen Wall said any further cuts in next year’s strategic defence and security review could leave them unable to honour commitments made by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

Gen Wall said they would need all their current allocation if they were to deliver a 'well-trained, well-equipped and fully funded' force capable of defending the national interest. Picture shows British forces in Afghanistan in 2009

He said: 'This is primarily about resources. The complexity of our change programme and its dependencies is significant - with plenty of risk.

'We will need all of our current resource allocation - and the freedom to reinvest savings in equipment support - if we are to deliver Army 2020 in a balanced manner and realise Mr Hammond’s commitment to a firm foundation of men and materiel, well trained, well equipped and fully funded to operate in the nation’s interests.

'In particular, any pressure on our equipment programme is likely to lead to an unbalanced force.'

With operations winding down in Afghanistan, Gen Wall acknowledged that there was currently little appetite among politicians for fresh military engagements overseas.

'Boots on the ground may be out of vogue in the run up to a UK election - certainly in a combat context,' he said.

However he stressed that it was vital that the Army was prepared to deal with any new threat which might emerge.

'We must pay special attention to understanding the rapidly shifting environment in which we may well have to operate sooner than some would have us think,' he said.

'Demand for land power may well be low at this point in the cycle - more from public reticence than because the world lacks security challenges - but that could soon change.'
