Britain faces another five years of ultra-low interest rates in a blow to millions of savers, the Bank of England hinted yesterday.

Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, said officials are in ‘no rush’ to raise rates having pegged them at a record low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of the recession in March 2009.

He said that when rates do start to rise – which investors do not think will happen until mid-2016 – it could be by just half a percentage point a year ‘for several years’.

Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, said there is 'no rush' to raise interest rates, adding that the new norm will be '2 or 4 per cent' compared to 5 per cent pre-recession

This means interest rates may not reach 2.5 per cent until early 2020 – half the average of 5 per cent seen in the decade before the financial crisis.

The eurozone is caught in a debt trap that could lead to another ‘lost decade’ for the region’s economy, Mark Carney warned last night. 

The Governor of the Bank of England said ‘now is not the time for half measures’ as he accused leaders in the currency bloc of being too ‘timid’ when dealing with the region’s problems. 

He called on the eurozone to ease austerity and urged fiscal union to transfer taxes from rich to poor countries. 

‘We are in no rush to raise rates, the recovery is taking hold nicely, the last thing we want to do is knock the stuffing out of that,’ said Mr Haldane. 

The ‘new normal’ for rates in the coming years will be around 2 to 4 per cent, he added.

More cautious projections by investors suggest interest rates will not even reach 1.5 per cent before 2020.

This would prolong the misery of low returns for Britain’s savers, but would be welcomed by over-stretched borrowers struggling with mortgage repayments. 

Bank of England governor Mark Carney admitted last week that low interest rates help borrowers ‘at the expense of savers’.

For much of last year, it was predicted that rates would rise to 0.75 per cent by early 2015 as the economy recovered. Further hikes were then expected.

But record low inflation – dragged down by the falling price of food and fuel – and signs of further trouble in the eurozone mean they are now expected to remain fixed until July next year.

Economist predict that interest rates could still be as low as 1.5 per cent by 2020, causing pain for the nation's savers, but proving a boost to borrowers 

Speaking to the Welsh newspaper Daily Post, Mr Haldane said interest rates will be unlikely to return to the sort of levels seen before the financial crisis in the near future. 

‘People might be fearful that we could go back to the sorts of levels we saw in the 80s or 90s which were 4, 5, 6 or 7 per cent rates,’ he said.

‘We are clear that even when we are through this adjustment and rates are starting to rise, we don’t really see rates getting back to those levels.’
