AC Milan is the right move for Torres

Fernando Torres has described his two-year loan move to AC Milan as a 'new adventure' as he completed his medical on Sunday.

Torres arrived at Milan Linate Airport on Saturday to be greeted by 200 fans ahead of his switch from Chelsea to the Serie A club.

And the 30-year-old Spaniard is now looking forward to working under manager Filippo Inzaghi after passing his medical.

Torres told the Milan Channel: 'I cannot wait to start this new adventure. I spoke to the coach yesterday and I am really pleased to work with a coach like him.

'He was a great goal-scorer and definitely understands what the role of a striker is. I am sure that he can teach me and help me a lot in this adventure.'

Torres revealed how he almost once joined Milan from Atletico Madrid before eventually moving to Liverpool in 2007.

He said: 'I was close to joining Milan when I was at Atletico Madrid, but we’re talking about many years ago, a long time has since passed.

'I’ve now finally arrived at Milan. Playing for Milan isn’t easy. It’s an honour and a privilege to wear this shirt. I want to give my best and help the side have a great season.'

Torres will wear the number 9 shirt at Milan, as worn by Inzaghi and Dutch legend Marco van Basten.

'It would be a privilege to wear the number 9 jersey and to play at the level that everybody expects from me. I thank the fans for the welcome.

'I am sure that it will all go well. I can promise that I will give 100% and that with their help this experience will be fantastic and for many years I hope.'
