An Illinois Congressman was escorted off the floor of the US House after he wore a hoodie as he gave a speech condemning the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

Rep Bobby Rush, a Chicago Democrat, is the latest high-profile figure to don a hooded sweatshirt to protest racial profiling and discrimination.

The garment, which the Florida 17-year-old was wearing when he was killed last month, has become a political statement for protestors, who believe Trayvon was targeted for being a young black man wearing a hoodie.

Protest: Illinois Rep Bobby Rush removed his suit jack to reveal a hoody underneath and put the hood over his head as a symbolic show of support for Trayvon Martin

Out of order: Rush was quickly escorted away from the podium and as the acting speaker slammed down his gavel

The Congressman's protest comes as it was revealed Trayvon's girlfriend, 17, had to be hospitalized when she learned that she was the last person to talk to him before his death, according to Radar Online, citing an anonymous source.

Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on the phone as he walked back to his father's home after picking up Skittles and a iced tea.

Days after the shooting, following Trayvon's wake, his family's lawyer spokes with the girl to get information about what she heard. When he informed her she was last person to speak to him alive, she became 'absolutely inconsolable and had trouble breathing so her mother took her to a nearby hospital emergency room,' the source told Radar Online.

In Washington, Rush took the podium wearing a suit coat. Halfway through his speech Wednesday morning, he took off the jack, revealing a gray sweatshirt underneath, and put the hood over his head.

Political statement: Hoodies have become symbols of racial profiling and discrimination, protestors say, after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed while wearing one

Justified? George Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon in self defense after being attacked by the teen

'Just because someone wears a hoodie, does not make them a hoodlum,' he said.

The
 acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, began 
bagining his gavel and ruled Rush out of order almost immediately.

Rush was escorted away by staffers. The US House has a longstanding policy against wearing hats on the floor.

'I
 applaud the young people all across the land who are making a statement
 about hoodie, about the real hoodlums in this national, especially 
those who tread on our law wearing official or quasi-official cloaks,' 
he said, according to the Washington Post.

Rush, who represents a district on the south side of the Chicago that is 65 percent black, is no stranger to high-profile symbolic gestures.

In 2004 he was arrested, along with other Congressmen, for trespassing at the Sudanese embassy during a protest of the Darfur genocide.

He was a civil rights leader throughout the 1960s and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers.

In 2008, he warned Senators that refusing to seat Rolland Burris, who was appointed by scandal-plagued Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich, was tantamount of lynching.

In 2009, he sponsored a bill that would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic rifles to register for federal firearms licenses, one of the strictest gun control proposals in recent years.

Hoodies are standard attire for the 
thousands of people who have marched in cities across the country 
demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman.

New York state senators wore hooded sweatshirts at the state legislature earlier this week as a shot of support for the protestors.

The hoodie escalated as a political symbol when Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera said: 'I’ll bet you money that if he didn’t have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn’t have responded in that violent and aggressive way.'

He later added to the fury by saying: 'If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word.'

The comments sparked outrage and helped fuel the anger of protestors, who turned them into a symbol of support for Trayvon.

Chaka Kahn produced a music video 
with actor Boris Kodjoe called 'Fear Kills, Love Heals,' which was is a 
tribute to Trayvon. It features several celebrities including Angela 
Bassett, Eva Marcille, and Garcelle Beauvais wearing hoodies and singing
 a remake of 'Super Life.'

Zimmerman,
 a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, has not been arrested for 
killing the unarmed teenage February 26 in a gated community in Sanford,
 Florida, because he claimed the shooting was self-defense.

However,
 it was revealed Tuesday that the lead homicide detective wanted to 
charge Zimmerman with manslaughter in the teen's death after questioning
 him for several hours at the police station.

The local state attorney's office stopped the arrested, saying they didn't believe they could win a conviction because of Florida's Stand Your Ground law.

Zimmerman claimed to police Trayvon punched approached him and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. He said the teen then climb on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times.

Zimmerman said he feared for his life when he pulled out his Kel-Tec semi-automatic 9mm pistol, which he was licensed to carry, and shot the teen in the chest at very close range.

Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday

Under state law, a gun owner can open fire if he has a reasonable fear of being killed or severely injured by an attacker.

A local grand jury, a the Florida State Attorney's Office and several federal agencies are all investigating the case to see whether the killing was, indeed, lawful.

The federal agencies are also looking into whether the case is a hate crime after a 911 call surfaced with Zimmerman muttering a word that was possibly a racial epithet.

The information about Zimmerman's possible arrest comes as new information about Trayvon has begun to paint a different picture of the teen.

School records from the Miami Herald reveal he was suspended from high school three times -- once for truancy; once after he was caught carving graffiti and a school administrator discovered he had a 'burglary tool' and bag full of women's jewelry; and a third time when he was caught with a marijuana pipe and an empty baggy with drug residue.

The conservative news site the Daily Caller dug up a Twitter account that it claims belonged to Trayvon.

On the site reveals a message from his cousin implying that Trayvon might have attacked a bus driver. It also makes references to doing drugs.

Trayvon's family maintains none of the new information is relevant to the shooting case and that it is an attempt the smear their son's name and harm their credibility.
