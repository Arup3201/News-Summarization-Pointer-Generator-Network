Gay marriage was the topic of table conversation when Prime Minister Julia Gillard, an opponent of  same sex-marriage, hosted a dinner for three gay couples at her official residence.

An Australian activist group won a charity auction and the guests used the three-course meal in the national capital of Canberra to lobby the prime minister to allow gay marriage.

Although Gillard’s Labor Party lifted its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage in December, she remains against changing the law.

The activist group GetUp! paid 31,000 
Australian dollars ($33,270, £21,024) for the dinner when they won a bidding war 
against a Christian lobby group at the Press Gallery of Australia annual
charity ball in June last year.

The 12-year-old son of one of the women, Matthew Miller, presented Gillard with flowers and two letters explaining why he and his brother Dylan, aged 9, would like their biological mother Sandy Miller, 40, to marry her partner Louise Bucke, 36.

'Since they’re not allowed to get married, they’re basically being called not normal and we’re not known as a proper family,' Matthew Miller said at a function at Parliament House before the dinner.

Other guests are Brisbane academic Sharon Dane, 54, who married her wife Elaine Crump, 53, in Canada in a ceremony that is not recognised in Australia.

Gay couple Steve Russell, 51, and John Dini, 29, decided against marrying overseas because it would carry no weight in Australia.

While they could have a civil union 
recognized under state law in their hometown of Melbourne, they do not 
view that as an equivalent to marriage.

Last
week GetUp! in partnership with the Australian Marriage Equality, asked
followers to send roses to their favourite MPs to remind them to review
same-sex marriage.

'What 
better way to remind our political representatives of where we stand on 
Valentine’s Day than to spread some love, and show them that in matters 
of the heart, we’re united for equality?'

The
group sent the roses as a 'reminder that Australians believe that two 
people who want to make a lifelong commitment deserve full and equal 
recognition before their family, friends and the law.'

At
Parliament House, 3000 roses arrived in Canberra and Prime Minister 
Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abott received 500 each.

Just a week after she backed the the Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Finance Minister Penny Wong, announced that her partner Sophie Allouache had given birth to a baby girl.

Gillard’s
Labor Party in December lifted its long-standing opposition to gay 
marriage, and three separate bills have been introduced to Parliament 
that would change the law which states that only a man and woman can 
marry.

The decision to change the party platform to support same-sex marriage has been hailed as a victory by gay rights campaigners.

'Never doubt how persistent the campaign for equality is,' said Finance Minister Penny Wong, who is in a same-sex relationship.

Just a week after she backed the the 
Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Ms Wong announced that her partner Sophie Allouache had given birth to a baby girl.

She said that she had text Gillard and the Prime Minister had offered her congratulations.

But Gillard remains opposed to gay marriage, and it is unclear whether any bill would attract sufficient support to enable same-sex couples to marry.

No date has been set for a vote in Parliament on gay marriage.

Polls show that most Australians support gay marriage, but the conservative opposition coalition and many government lawmakers remain opposed.

The issue of gay rights led to the resignation from the party of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's sister.

Miss Loree Rudd said she could not work for a party that endorsed homosexuals marrying.

While her brother had introduced laws when he was Prime Minister so gay people were not discriminated against, she said that 'to make that huge leap from their rights to breaking a commandment of Moses, to say homosexuals' relations is marriage, is utter nonsense.'
