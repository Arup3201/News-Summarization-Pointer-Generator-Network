A day after passengers restrained 'deranged' pilot Clayton Osbon and averted mid-air disaster on JetBlue Flight 191, some are wondering if the airline plans on retiring the flight number.

Historically, 191 has proved to be a tragic flight number, a blogger at the Wall Street Journal points out.

In 1985 Delta Air Lines Flight 191 killed 137 people when wind shear caused the L-1011 to crash just before landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

The air line subsequently retired the flight number.

Six years earlier, American Airlines retired the same flight number after one of its DC-10s crashed shortly after take-off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, killing 271 aboard and two people on the ground.

Until the September 11 terrorist attacks, it was the deadliest air disaster in U.S. aviation history and led to the grounding of all DC-10s until technical problems were resolved.

Despite the misfortune with the number 191, and the superstition that permeates the aviation industry, JetBlue says it has no intention of retiring flight 191, at least for now, according to the Huffington Post.
