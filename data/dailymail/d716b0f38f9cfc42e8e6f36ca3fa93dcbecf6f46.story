The names of the three men who were killed when their small plane came down in Fort Lauderdale yesterday have been named.

Wallis “Wally” Watson, 66, of Boca Raton; his son Kevin Watson, 30, of Pompano Beach; and the pilot Steven Waller, 65, of Deerfield Beach, took off from Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport in a twin-engine Piper airplane at about 4 p.m. yesterday, but experienced trouble soon after.

The Piper tried to turn back to the airport, but didn’t make it instead crashing into several unoccupied cars and a boat. No one on the ground was injured.

Serious damage: A small plane crashed into a warehouse and landed in the parking lot killing all three passengers

Fatal: The plane first crashed into a warehouse and then landed in the parking lot but the flames were seen for miles

Rubble: The crash occurred in Fort Lauderdale around 4.30pm on Friday and it took a while for firemen to control the flames

The plane, a two-engine turboprop, can carry a crew of two and four to six passengers.

Incredibly, there were no reported casualties on the ground.

Federal officials say the plane suffered a mechanical problem and lost power shortly after takeoff.

Witnesses saw the Piper Cheyenne turboprop make a steep right turn in an apparent attempt to return to the airport before plunging into an impound parking lot, bursting into flames, setting numerous cars and a boat on fire.

Although a mechanical malfunction appears to be the focus of their investigation, federal air safety investigators on Saturday said they will probe every aspect of the flight, including the pilot’s experience and the plane’s maintenance history. They also will listen to tapes of the pilot’s emergency call to the control tower just before the crash, about 4:15 p.m. on Friday.

Dangerous: Police kept a large area surrounding the fire blocked off as emergency workers determined what was the best way to approach the wreckage of the small passenger jet

Ignition: The crash sparked an even bigger fire in the parking lot

On Saturday, investigators sifted through the mangled wreckage, looking for clues.

The plane’s fuselage was completely destroyed and parts, including the propellers, were strewn around the parking lot. A recovery truck was brought in to lift burned cars away from the impact area.

The wreckage is expected to be trucked to a nearby hangar for further inspection.

The NTSB plans to release a preliminary accident report in about a week, a more detailed report in six to eight months and make a final “probable cause” ruling in about 18 months.

'Our focus so far today has been documenting the aircraft on scene to the point where we can get it recovered off-site to look at it further,' Luke Schiada, a senior air safety investigator with the NTSB, said at the crash site Saturday. 'We will continue to do that the rest of the day. We will also be gathering information on the pilot, his experience, his type of experience, medical certification, things like that.'

What remains: The crash and fire seems to have left the structure of the plane in a heap of burning ash as only the burnt rubble of the 12 damaged cars remain

Small: The plane that crashed was a a Piper Navajo (like the one pictured) which can hold up to six people but there were only three passengers on board at the time of the crash

Yesterday, those who were nearby were telling of their experiences: 'The whole building shook. It (felt) 
like somebody crashed into the building,' said Chris Jewett who was 
working in an office building across the street from the point of 
impact.

'Three of four (parked vehicles) actually blew up, the rest caught on fire,' he told CNN.

Television
images showed about eight cars in a corner that were burned out shells,
a smoldering heap covered in foam spread by firefighters on the scene.

A storage facility and an indoor go-kart track are among the businesses listed nearby.

The airport serves smaller planes rather than the larger commercial flights at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

The crash happened at the start of rush hour alongside Interstate 95, the major north-south route along Florida's Atlantic coast.
