The young adults and teens as young as 14, all from a church group, set out in the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena on Sunday morning and were expected back by 6pm that evening. They were reported missing at 9:30pm.

A medic was lowered from the LA County Sheriff's department helicopter to assist the group, but no injuries have been reported.

The group are said to have planned to gone canyoneering in an area that closed two months ago. 

Local officials said the hikers range from 14 to 36 years old and have gone out as a group on three-mile treks before.

Reports suggest they had climbing gear, including ropes and harnesses with them and planned to rappel down waterfalls in the canyon. 

However Sheriff’s Deputy Daniel Paige said they did not have the supplies and equipment needed for an overnight trip.

He told KTLA 5: 'We’re not sure why they stopped hiking. We’re presuming maybe someone became injured, we’re really not sure. But for some reason they were unable to continue their trip, where they were going to hike in the canyon near where the waterfall is then hike out.'

Descent: The group, said to be experienced hikers, were planning to rappel down waterfalls similar to this one in the canyon 

Wenderlyn Ortiz who has been hiking with the same group before initially said she was confident they would be found and assumes 'someone got tired and stopped'. 

She told the station: 'It’s a big group and not everybody has the same physical capability of walking for a long time.'

The search was delayed on Monday morning because of cloudy conditions in the area. It's has not been confirmed whether any of those missing have been injured.
