A detailed search for Indian Ocean rubbish on the south west coast of Tasmania might have indicated that the hunt for missing flight MH370 is in the wrong place.

Volunteers have scoured beaches, rocks and shallow waters along a 60-mile stretch of coast in the lower corner of the island state, located to the south of the Australian continent, picking up no less than 80,000 pieces of rubbish.

Some of the debris has drifted 6,000 miles across the Indian Ocean from as far away as Madagascar and South Africa but there has been nothing that appears to be from the Malaysia Airlines jet.

Yet the official search area for the aircraft, some 1200 miles south west of Perth in Western Australia, lies virtually in the path that the rubbish from the other side of the ocean has drifted along.

If nothing more, the discovery of rubbish from Madagascar and South Africa confirms that the ocean tides will carry debris many thousands of miles, passing close to the MH370 search area, to the shores of Australia - and perhaps onwards into the Pacific Ocean.

There have been numerous suggestions that despite complex mathematical calculations the search for the aircraft, which vanished more than a year ago on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, is in the wrong area.

And while the rubbish clean-up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of Tasmania was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft, the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west.

If there was anything in southern Tasmania from the jet, the team would have found it, for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported today that 27 people spent eight nights at sea in a fleet of fishing boats, travelling from Low Rocky Point to the mouth of Port Davey in an annual effort to clean the beaches of rubbish floating in from the vast ocean.

In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. Pictured is a screen at the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur airport

No-one reported finding anything that suggested discovered debris was from the jet - but they uncover a great deal of other items that could be traced back to boats and even to Madagascar and the African continent.

‘We found a roll of tape from Madagascar that’s from a vanilla bean manufacturer,’ said expedition leader Matt Dell.

‘We found a bit of stuff from Africa washing around. We found a drift card from Durban (South Africa) that’s like a fish tag - oh, and a set of dolls’ plastic shoes.’

Mr Dell said the volunteers had been visiting the beaches for a number of years ‘and we’re slowly willowing out that big stuff and now all that’s left is the big stuff what washed up between our visits and the small stuff below the sand.’

Most of the rubbish has come from commercial fishing boats such as ropes, floats and pieces of net, but Mr Dell told the ABC that more and more plastic items like drink bottles had been washed up.

But so far, nothing from MH370.

It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months.
