Vice President Joe Biden appears to be taking a break from the ladies, a day after he was called out for an awkward interaction with the wife of Ashton Carter at the new defense secretary's swearing in.

On Wednesday, Biden traveled to South Carolina for a three-day trip to promote a $500billion Obama Administration infrastructure bill. 

During the afternoon, he spoke at Owen Steel in Columbia about the dire need to update America's aging roadways. 

'The United States of America ranks 28th in the world in modern infrastructure. We shouldn't rank 28th in the world in anything that needs to be done for our country,' Biden said during a speech at the facility.

During his tour, Biden steered clear from women for the photo ops - though there didn't seem to be too many ladies anyway at the facility or at a port in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. 

While Biden is famous for his friendliness, he was heavily criticized Tuesday for rubbing the shoulders of Defense Secretary Ashton Carter's wife Stephanie,  and whispering into her ear during her husband's wearing in ceremony.

Conservative commentators jumped at the opportunity to criticize the second most important Democrat, calling back all the previous times he's cozied up to women in Washington - even in front of the cameras.

'Just once, I'd like to see a husband in this situation knock Joe Biden out,' wrote Brad Thor, an author who makes frequent appearances on Fox News.

He then added; 'If Joe Biden did this to my wife, SHE'D knock him out. I'd have to take a number and wait my turn...'

Finally, he said; 'ISIS? Ashton Carter can't even fight off Joe Biden...'

Radio personality Mark Simone said; 'Creepy Joe Biden strikes again, hanging onto Ashton Carter's wife (and whispering things) at Carter's swearing-in.'

'Not sure why a creep like @VP is not shunned by civil society,' said Daily beast columnist Stuart Stevens.

Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was far more brief, labeling him an 'a**clown.'

Biden found himself in the same situation back in January, when many felt he got to close to 12-year-old Maggie Coons during her father's swearing in ceremony.

Delaware Senator Chris Coons then had to explain that his daughter did not find the Vice President 'creepy,' and that he had known her for years. 

There was also the time Biden got close to a lady while hanging with a group of bikers in Ohio in September 2012, with the men in the group exchanging glances as Biden gave the woman what appeared to be a shoulder massage. 

Biden is also not afraid to get close to political leaders either, having been seen whispering into nthe ears of women like Hillary Clinton, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, and President Mary McAleese of Ireland. 

The vice president’s office declined to comment about Tuesday's whisper.
