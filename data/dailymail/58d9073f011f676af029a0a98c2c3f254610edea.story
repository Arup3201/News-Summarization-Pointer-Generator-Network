A young woman with Asperger’s syndrome has beaten the bullies to bag a place as a UK finalist for the Miss Universe beauty crown.

Lauren Lovejoy, 24, faced daily taunts that she was 'ugly and weird' - and was even pushed to suicidal thoughts.

But now she is one of 38 women competing to become the Great Britain representative for the Miss Universe title.

Lauren said: 'I never thought I’d make it - there was a point when I believed every bad word the bullies threw at me.

'They broke my nose and shattered my confidence. In my lowest moments I thought I wanted to end my life.

'I thought that I really was as ugly and bad as they said.'

Lauren, from Nottingham, entered the Miss Universe competition last year after seeing an advert online.

Following an interview she was over the moon to discover she had been selected as a finalist.

She said: 'The new opportunities I have been given through Miss Universe have opened my eyes - now I feel fantastic.

The symptoms of Lauren's Asperger's syndrome made her a target for bullies at school (left, age 9, right,10)

'When I’m on stage it’s like I take on a different role and I am this confident and sassy young woman.

'I love to joke and laugh and I wanted that side of me to show.

'So when I was selected I really felt a sense of achievement that they picked me because they must have really liked me.'

Model Lauren struggles to work in a conventional role due to Asperger’s syndrome, which causes difficulties in social interaction and obsessive behaviour.

But finds the unstructured nature of modelling and singing a creative release from her symptoms of anxiety and stress.

Lauren said: 'I am very sensitive to sound and some smells too.

'I can take things that people say the wrong way too and that can make me very distressed.

'I like to have the right people around me who understand my needs and who I trust.

Lauren is now focusing all her efforts on preparing for the GB heat of Miss Universe later this month

'I’ve had jobs before but they’ve been a disaster. I never last very long.

'But Miss Universe have been so supportive of my needs and I feel my confidence building all the time.'

Lauren lives with her partner Phil Brown, 43, in the flat they share in Gamston, Nottingham.

He said: 'I’m so proud of everything that Lauren has achieved so far.

'She has a lot of people behind her and I really believe she’s going places.

'We want to properly launch her music career soon too.'

Lauren is now focusing all her efforts on preparing for the GB heat of Miss Universe later this month in Cardiff.

She is also an ambassador for the children’s charity, Strong Bones.

She said: 'I want to help other children to achieve as much as they can after the finish school.

'I want them to see me doing well after suffering terrible bullying and be inspired.'

Paula Abbandonato, National Director of Miss Universe GB, said: 'Lauren’s been a fantastic part of the line-up this year.

'She is a real character and we’ve really enjoyed having her involved.

'The work she does to raise awareness for Asperger’s sufferers is a great thing

'She encourages other girls not to let their insecurities or conditions define them. She’s a real inspiration.'
