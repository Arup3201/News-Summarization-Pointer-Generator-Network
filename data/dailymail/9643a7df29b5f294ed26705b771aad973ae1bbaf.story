The businessman suspected of masterminding his brother’s killing in the Alps was cleared by British police of any involvement yesterday.

Zaid al-Hilli was told by Surrey Police there was not enough evidence to charge him.

But hours later French investigators said they were considering applying for an international arrest warrant for the 54-year-old, as they still consider him a prime suspect.

Zaid al-Hilli leaves Guildford Police Station. The brother of British engineer Saad al-Hilli who was shot dead in the French Alps has been released from police bail

Al-Hilli has had his bail cancelled. He was arrested in June last year on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder but has been released due to a lack of evidence'

In October, Zaid al-Hilli, from Chessington in Surrey, publicly protested his innocence and offered to take a lie-detector test to verify his own account

The bodies of Saad and Ikbal Al-Hilli from Claygate, Surrey, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, were found near French cyclist Sylvain Mollier on a remote forest road in Chevaline, near Annecy, southern France

His brother Saad, 50, from Claygate, 
Surrey, was shot alongside his wife Ikbal, 47 and mother-in-law Suhaila 
al-Allaf, 74, on a remote road near Annecy in 2012.

The couple’s daughters, Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack. A French cyclist was also shot dead.

Annecy
 prosecutor Eric Maillaud said Zaid al-Hilli had ‘not responded clearly 
and precisely on several fundamental issues’.

His family said he was not
 willing to travel to France to face questioning. Asked how he felt 
yesterday, Mr al-Hilli, from Chessington, Surrey, said: ‘Really just 
relieved, that is all.’

Zaid
 al-Hilli, who had fought with his brother over a £1million inheritance 
from their father, was arrested last June on suspicion of conspiracy to 
murder.

Police later discounted claims he made calls to Romania to hire a
 hitman.

In October, Zaid al-Hilli, from 
Chessington in Surrey, publicly protested his innocence and offered to 
take a lie-detector test to verify his own account.

Speaking to the BBC’s Panorama programme, he accused French investigators of a cover-up.

He
 said: 'They are covering up for someone in France in that region and 
they know it. Sylvain Mollier was involved in family disputes and was an
 outsider to (his) rich family. There is something more to it locally - 
most crime has local roots.'

Today detectives said there was 'insufficient evidence' to charge Zaid Al-Hilli with any criminal offence.

The
 bodies were found near French cyclist Sylvain Mollier on a remote 
forest road in Chevaline, near Annecy, southern France, on September 5, 
2012.

Mollier’s body was found in a forest layby near Lake Annecy in eastern France on September 5, 2012.

Close by, in a BMW estate car, Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife , 47, and her mother, 74, lay dead.

Each had been shot three times, all at least once in the head. Their two daughters, Zeena, then 4, and Zainab, then 7, survived.

The
 horrific scene was discovered by cyclist Brett Martin, who found 
Iraqi-born Mr Al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old dentist wife and her elderly
 mother blasted to death in their BMW.

The
 al-Hilli’s first-born daughter Zainab was shot in the shoulder and 
beaten, but survived. Her four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under 
her mother’s body and was only discovered eight hours after the murders.

The following month French investigators said they were looking for a mystery motorcyclist who was seen near the crime scene.

One lead in tracing the man was that he was wearing an unusual helmet, only a few thousand of which had been made.

Officers have cancelled the bail of Mr Al-Hilli of  Chessington, Surrey, and no further police action was being taken.

Detectives
 from Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team continue to work closely with 
the French authorities, who are leading the probe.

A
 spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'A man arrested by detectives 
investigating the deaths of four people near Annecy, southern France in 
September 2012 has today had his bail cancelled.

'The
 54-year-old man, from Chessington, was arrested on 24 June 2013 on 
suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and interviewed as part of the 
on-going investigation.

'At 
this stage there is insufficient evidence to charge him with any 
criminal offence and no further police action is being taken at this 
time.

'Saad and Ikbal 
Al-Hilli from Claygate, Surrey and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, who 
lived in Sweden, were found shot dead along with French cyclist Sylvain 
Mollier on a remote forest road in Chevaline on September 5 2012.

'This
 remains a French-led investigation and officers from the Surrey and 
Sussex Major Crime Team continue to work closely with the French 
authorities.

'We have carried out exhaustive enquiries in the UK on a 
number of active lines of enquiry under the terms of the Joint 
Investigation Team (JIT).'
