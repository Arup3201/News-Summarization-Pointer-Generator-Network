Authorities are searching for suspects whose hoax calls triggered the evacuation of several buildings at Harvard University and a futile search for an armed man and bombs on campus.

Cambridge police spokesman Jeremy Warnick says police received four calls reporting bombs planted on campus and a man carrying an assault rifle at the Ivy League school on Saturday morning.

Harvard University's police department says in a community advisory that it immediately ordered evacuation of buildings identified by the caller.

They received several reports of suspicious packages on campus this morning, said Warnick.

Police responded to information that packages were located at Prescott St, the Harvard Science Center and Harvard Yard.

The agency also notified colleagues at the Cambridge police and fire department, and their joint search of the locations failed to yield bombs or an armed man.

Officials are still investigating what appeared to be a non-threatening package at Prescott St, reports Boston.com.

They swept the area and no armed man was found.

No arrests have been made as yet.

Warnick says police will work with FBI agents to identify two people who claimed responsibility on Twitter.

The police have given the all-clear and campus buildings have been reopened.
