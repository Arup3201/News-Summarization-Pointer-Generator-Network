Clearly enjoying life in New York, Princess Eugenie beamed as she enjoyed a trip out with her mother last night ahead of Mother’s Day on Sunday.

The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson and her daughter attended the Gavel & Grand Benefit Auction at the glamourous Bowery Hotel which helped to raise funds for numerous charitable organisations.

The mother daughter duo kept things simple in black and grey dresses respectively, paired with black heels.

Fergie wore a button-down dress with crystal buttons for a touch of glamour but she kept her make-up to a minimal and with her loose.

The 24-year-old princess upped dressed up her grey long-sleeved skater dress with two chain necklaces and a sweep of red lipstick.

The two looked understandably delighted to be reunited, as Eugenie continues her position with New York based auction house, Paddle8, which keeps the two on opposite sides of the Atlantic. 

Though it is not known how long the Duchess will remain in New York, it is possible she plans to spend the weekend in the city, allowing her to spend Mother's Day on Sunday with Eugenie.

As well as visiting her youngest daughter, Fergie was in New York to attend the benefit (which saw appraisals being conducted by auctioneers dressed in rather odd red wigs, sunglasses, and with handkerchiefs across their faces) as she had donated one of the prizes.

Lucky guests could bid on various experiences, one of which was the chance to attend the Children in Crisis Gala hosted by the Duchess of York as part of a luxury weekend in London, and have a photo taken with her.

All proceeds from The Bucket List Auction, which brings together extraordinary experiences to benefit a selection of the world's leading philanthropic organisations will benefit amfAR, Children in Crisis, Gabrielle's Angel Foundation for Cancer Research, The Hamptons International Film Festival, Tuesday's Children and Virgin Unite. 

Eugenie's new bosses at Paddle8, Osman Khan and Alexander Gilkes, also attended the event and looked to be getting on well with their royal employee's mother as they chatted and posed for pictures together.
