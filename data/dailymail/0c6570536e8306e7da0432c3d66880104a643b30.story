The 'secret' teenage daughter of a late mining baron who successfully fought for $25 million from her father's estate is now set to have her multi-million dollar inheritance challenged by her half sisters.

Olivia Jacqueline Mead was left $3 million in a trust fund when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012.

The 19-year-old, who is the third and youngest of Mr Wright's daughters, challenged his will in the West Australian Supreme Court in January claiming the amount left to her from her father's estimated worth of $1 billion was insufficient.

Olivia Jacqueline Mead may have her multi million dollar inheritance challenged after she successfully fought for $25 million in the West Australian Supreme Court from her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright's estate

The court ruled last month that Ms Mead, the product of Mr Wright's relationship with Elizabeth Anne Mead after he divorced three women, should be handed $25 million from his estate.

But the matter is due to return to court this week after the Wright family signalled their intent to challenge the ruling.

The $25 million was to be paid in a lump sum within 60 days of the February 26 judgement, but the Wright family has since sought clarity from the court about the drafting of orders - there's a 21-day appeal period after those orders are drafted.

The battle over Mr Wright's estate made headlines earlier this year when lawyers pressed Ms Mead for details about why the $3 million sum was insufficient and what she expected she would need for the rest of her life.

Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 in 2012. He was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock

Ms Mead told the court she needed a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot.  

Her initial list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. 

In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead also claimed to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate in the bequeath to be held in trust until she was 30. 

Her wish list amounted to about $20 million but Supreme Court Master Craig Sanderson ruled Ms Mead was 'in no sense... spoilt by her father' and deserved far more than she had been left.

'The deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty,' Master Sanderson said.

Many in Perth had little idea Mr Wright had a fourth child until Ms Mead's case went to trial.

Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father.

The teenager's half-sisters Leonie Baldock and Alexandra Burt, who both work within the family business, had  been bequeathed $400 million.

While Ms Mead had been included in his trust it was subject to onerous conditions, which meant that she might have received very little

She would have been deemed exempt from the funds if she 'had any association or involvement whatsoever to illegal drugs' was convicted of any felony within the 10 years prior to his death, of if she had 'converted to Buddhism or Islam'. 

The matter will return to court this week.
