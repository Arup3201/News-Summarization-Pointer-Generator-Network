A sports fanatic died from a heart attack at the Olympics moments after watching a thrilling win by Team GB.

Chartered accountant Conrad Readman, 49, had booked two weeks off work to visit  dozens of events at London 2012.

He had tickets for every day of the fortnight-long spectacle and was cramming in visits to up to three venues a day.

Mr Readman suffered a suspected heart attack about the same time Victoria Pendleton (left) was winning gold for Great Britain in the Keirin. He had just witnesses Sir Chris Hoy win gold in the men's Team Sprint track cycling final

On Friday he went to the cycling where, in an electric atmosphere, a dominant Team GB was trouncing the opposition.

Mr Readman was found collapsed in the 
toilets just after 6pm – a few minutes after he had watched the men’s 
pursuit team power their way to gold in a world record time.

The chartered accountant, who lived with and cared for his mother Joan, watched up to three sports each day since the start of the Olympics on July 27 and had seen Tom Daley, Rebecca Adlington and Michael Phelps in action.

He was at the canoe slalom when Etienne Stott and Tim Baillie won gold for Great Britain.

His mother Joan said: 'He had been looking forward to it ever since it was announced.

'There was never a day he was not excited about it and he got tickets for the whole fortnight.

'He was coming home every night so excited and telling me about everything he had done.

'He was as good as gold and never any trouble. He would help anybody. He loved watching a lot of sport and I am so very proud of him.'

He had scoured ticket websites around the world in order to attend every day of the London Olympics, including this visit to the Handball

On Friday night officers from the Metropolitan Police broke the tragic news to her about her 49-year-old son.

She said: 'My neighbour came and held my hand and they told me he had a heart attack at the Olympics.

'He had never had a problem with his heart and had not been to a doctor in 15 years.

'he died doing something he loved so I am happy he was where he was but I can't watch any of it now.

'I had it all on all day but I can't bear it now and don't want to see anymore. I have turned the television off and cancelled all the papers.'

Mr Readman, who had bought tickets from websites all around the world to build-up his Olympic diary, had seen 16 different sports as well as the Opening Ceremony.

His father Dennis died 19 years ago, leaving him to look after his mum.

Employer and friend Tim Peyton said: 'I have worked with him since 1982 and am shocked.

'He was a lynchpin for us. Clients and staff liked him. He will be sorely missed by all of us.'

Mr Readman had tweeted prodigiously about his experiences during the Games. His profile describes him as a Tottenham Hotspur fan, a movie buff and a music fan of almost all genres.

He had tweeted that it was a privilege to see Michael Phelps make Olympic history by winning an 18th gold medal and admitted to blubbing when Stott and Baillie won gold in the canoe slalom.

On Friday - which he described as an 'epic day' - Mr Readman said 'there will be tears' when Pendleton and the team sprinters win gold.

But he died before Pendleton won her race.

A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said: 'At 6.13pm on Friday August 3, the London Ambulance Service was called to the Olympic Park at Stratford to a man who had collapsed.

'Extensive efforts were made to resuscitate the patient both at the scene and on the way to hospital.'The man later died in hospital.'

LOCOG have declined to comment on the death and a Met Police spokeswoman said the incident was not being treated as suspicious
