The BBC’s director general admitted yesterday the corporation had ‘lost the plot’ over pay deals and ‘got bedevilled by zeroes on people’s salaries’.

Tony Hall made the dramatic confession to MPs yesterday as they accused the corporation’s top staff of a ‘snouts in the trough’ culture.

Tory MP Richard Bacon said a ‘super-stratum’ of senior managers had been ‘gouging the licence fee payer’.

Pressure: BBC Trust Lord Patten was grilled over why the corporation's governing body did not know that payments were being beyond what was contractually required

And on a humiliating day, the BBC’s 
director of human resources, Lucy Adams – who signed off contentious 
deals to get staff ‘out of the door’ – was accused of presiding over 
‘corporate fraud and cronyism’.

Lord Hall was grilled by the public 
accounts committee over the findings of last week’s devastating report 
by the public spending watchdog into lucrative severance payments.

The National Audit Office found that 
the BBC handed out £369million over eight years, in many cases paying 
staff hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they were contractually 
owed and in some instances even paying them twice.

The BBC Trust’s chairman Lord Patten 
was also quizzed by MPs, who accused the governing body of ‘failing to 
meet its obligations’ by cracking down on severance payments years ago.

He admitted the Audit Office report had caused him ‘shock and dismay’ 
but said there would be ‘no legal effort’ to force staff to repay the 
money.

Yesterday a former BBC governor for 
Wales said chairman Lord Patten should stand down over the debacle. Sir 
Roger Jones said: ‘I don’t think he’s done a good job, there have been 
several serious questions about his judgment.’

In a dramatic day:

In an extraordinary exchange with MPs,
Lord Hall – who started as director general in April – admitted the BBC
overpaid its staff and should accept the ‘onus of responsibility’.

He 
added: ‘Culturally . . . I think we’ve lost the plot, we’ve lost our 
way, we’ve got bedevilled by zeroes on people’s salaries.

Attack: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, told Trustees they had 'failed' in their duty to protect licence fee money

'I think one 
of the issues was there was not enough grip at the centre of the 
organisation, by the non-execs, by the executives.’

According to the Audit Office, the top
ten severance payments – to figures including former deputy director 
general Mark Byford and marketing chief Sharon Baylay – accounted for 20
per cent of the BBC’s total spend.

Mr Bacon said: ‘This culture appears 
to be one of mates, cronyism, slapping each other on the shoulder, 
arranging for huge payoffs – “snouts in the trough are us”, basically.

‘Most BBC employees are not like this. They work very hard and they don’t get big amounts of money.

‘There’s this little super-stratum at 
the top . . . they are a small number of people who have been gouging 
the licence fee payer for quite a long time, and it’s a very big 
problem.’

Out: Payments to ten top managers, including former director general George Entwistle (pictured) and chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, totalled £4.9million

Mr Fry, who chairs the BBC Trust’s 
finance committee, insisted he had ‘no power to intervene’ in the issue 
under the rules of the BBC charter.

But the committee’s chairman, Labour 
MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘I think, with the deepest regret, Mr Fry, you 
failed. You failed.’

It emerged the BBC Trust had been told
about two of the biggest payments, to Mr Byford (£949,000) and Mrs 
Baylay (£394,638), in a letter from Mr Thompson on October 7, 2010.

Lord
Patten insisted the Trust was not informed the payments were far in 
excess of what the duo were entitled to, adding: ‘If you call in due 
course the previous director general of the BBC, I will be as interested
as you are in finding out why we didn’t know.’

Mr Fry also appeared to lay the blame 
at the door of Mr Thompson, who left to become chief executive of the 
New York Times and is expected to give evidence before the committee 
‘before Christmas’.

Asked whether Mr Thompson had lied to 
him, he said: ‘All I can say is on the basis of the information provided
in the letter to the Trust on October 7, and the terms of that letter, 
and what emerged subsequently, there is some disconnect.’

Mr Fry said he had ‘particularly 
unpleasant discussions’ with members of the BBC executive when the 
payments were made, adding: ‘I thought they were completely out to lunch
in regards to what they thought was acceptable pay in a public body.’

Despite pressure from MPs to recoup 
some of the money handed out to staff, Lord Patten said lawyers had 
advised him it would be ‘impossible to claw it back’.

Miss Adams, who signed off Mr Byford’s
deal, said she felt ‘uncomfortable’ with the generous sums, but added: 
‘I just wanted to get him out of the door.’

Accusing her of ‘spouting HR
flim-flam’, Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘This is corporate fraud and
cronyism that you presided over.’
