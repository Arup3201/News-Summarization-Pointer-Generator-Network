Law enforcement officials have said for the first time that they believe Ayla Reynolds, the Maine toddler who went missing in the days leading up to Christmas, is no longer alive.

Officials pressing for more information about Ayla whereabouts also announced at a news conference that a $30,000 reward for information on the case will expire on June 30.

They appealed for anyone with information leading to her whereabouts to contact police.

Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing in December by her father 
Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed 
the previous night

John Nale, a lawyer who led the effort to raise the reward money from local residents and businesses said: 'To the person or persons responsible for her disappearance, we ask that you now come forward, accept responsibility for what you have done, show us that you are human and relieve yourself, Ayla's family and this community of this burden.'

Ayla was 20 months old when she was reported missing December 17 from her father's home in Waterville.

The toddler had last been seen wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them. She had a cast on her broken left arm.

Steve McCausland, spokesman for the 
Maine Department of Public Safety, said investigators remain determined 
to solve the mystery of Ayla's disappearance.

Grim discovery: Ayla's blood was found in DiPietro's home during a police investigation, but no one has been charged in the case

Mr McCausland said: 'It has been 166 days since she was reported missing from her home in Waterville, and the work and the investigation goes on.'

He added: 'There will be more searches, more dives and more interviews. And we are in this for the long haul. This case will never close until Ayla is found.'

Before the news conference, detectives called Ayla's parents to deliver the somber news that they no longer believe she'll be found alive.

Asked if police believe a crime was committed, Mr McCausland said: 'We believe foul play has been involved ... this is a criminal investigation.'

In Portland, Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, and her father and mother, burst into tears while watching the news conference.

'Everybody broke down. I'm still crying. I'm still hurting now,' said Ronald Reynolds, Ayla's grandfather, in Portland.

'Why Ayla? She never bothered anybody. She never hurt anybody. Why hurt Ayla?'

'My worst nightmare has come true,' said Trista Reynolds on video captured from her father's home.

Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, told police he was thankful for the information, Mr McCausland said, adding, 'His reaction was no reaction.'

Mr DiPietro has said he thinks Ayla was abducted, but police say there's no evidence of that. No arrests have been made in the case.

State police confirmed that Ayla's blood was found in Mr DiPietro's house and said he, his girlfriend and his sister - who were there the night Ayla disappeared - know more than they're telling police.

Police repeated that assertion on Thursday when asked about the father. 'We believe he knows more than he's told us,' Mr McCausland said.

pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

Neither Mr DiPietro nor a lawyer hired by members of his family returned a call. There was no answer when a reporter knocked on DiPietro's door.

After Ayla was reported missing, dozens of game wardens, FBI agents and local and state police officers participated in the search in this central Maine city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state capital, Augusta.

Police checked trash bins and FBI agents knocked on doors. Officials even went so far as to drain a stream so wardens could get a better look.

Denial: Mr DiPietro, 24, says that he is not involved in his daughter Ayla's disappearance, but police believe he's not telling them the full story

Recently, divers searched the Kennebec River and retrieved some items. Investigators declined to comment on those items Thursday.

Investigators said that they have received more than 1,100 tips and that people shouldn't expect it to be solved overnight, Mr McCausland said.

'This isn't 'CSI' where everything is solved in 60 minutes,' he said.
