ITV has been ordered to treat Ukip as a ‘major party’ in the run-up to the European  Parliament elections in May.

In a landmark ruling, broadcasting regulator Ofcom last night said the anti-EU party’s success in previous Euro elections meant it should be put on a par with the other main parties.

ITV and Channel 5, which are regulated by Ofcom, were ordered to grant Ukip ‘major party status’ in the run-up to May’s elections, guaranteeing it increased coverage.

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said the success of Nigel Farage's party in previous Euro elections meant it should be put on a par with the other main parties

The decision means Ukip will be granted the same number of party election broadcasts as Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, and can expect to have its views given ‘due weight’ in news programmes.

A BBC source last night said Ukip could expect to receive ‘the same level of coverage as the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems’.

Ofcom’s ruling – which fell short of Ukip’s demands to be treated as a major party on a permanent basis – will also fuel the debate about how the broadcasters treat Ukip during next year’s General Election, including the question of whether party leader Nigel Farage should be included in any televised leaders’ debates.

Ofcom's ruling will prompt the questionof whether party leader Nigel Farage should be included in any televised leaders' debates, such as this one in 2010 which featured Nick Clegg, David Cameron and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown

It came as a major new poll revealed that Ukip voters are more likely to be factory workers in the Midlands than tweedy Tories in the Home Counties.

The Populus survey of more than 14,000 people suggests that Ukip’s support is drawn disproportionately from working-class and lower-middle class voters, with those in the top three social groups accounting for only 45 per cent of its vote.

By contrast, the Tories and Lib Dems both draw 63 per cent of their support from the top three social groups, while Labour is on 53 per cent.

The poll suggests Ukip voters are also
 less likely to have gone to university, with 76 per cent saying they 
gained their highest qualification at secondary school, compared to a 
national average of 60 per cent.

The
 findings suggest that Mr Farage’s appeal has reached far beyond its 
original base among disaffected Tory voters in the South. They reinforce
 recent byelection results suggesting that Ukip is gaining ground among 
working-class voters in the Midlands and the North.

But
 the results also show that Ukip’s supporters are disproportionately 
male and older. Some 63 per cent of the party’s voters are male, and 59 
per cent are aged over 65, with just 9 per cent of Ukip’s support coming
 from the under-35s.

Laurence Stellings, associate director at Populus, said the findings suggested it will not be straightforward for the Conservatives to claw back disaffected voters.

‘If you look beyond the headlines you can quickly dispel the casual stereotypes about Ukip supporters,’ he said. ‘They are not just grumpy shire Tories as some suggest. In fact, your typical Ukip supporter is a working-class male from the Midlands. Perhaps the most striking feature of Ukip’s support is just how male it is.

‘You don’t win back voters like this by simple positioning on immigration and Europe. The challenge for David Cameron and others is a lot more difficult than that. He has to find some way to show that he is genuinely on their side.’

The poll put Labour in the lead on 37 per cent, followed by the Conservatives on 33, Ukip on 14 and the Lib Dems on 10.

It also revealed that Ukip  voters have the lowest average incomes, while Tory supporters have the highest.

Ukip voters are overwhelmingly male compared to the other parties, who are more evenly split between men and women

Ukip voters are much more likely to be over 65, with Labour having the highest proportion of 18-34-year-olds

The Lib Dems take most of their support from the south, while Labour's appeal is more evenly spread

The average Ukip voter has an income 
of £25,410 – £1,500 below the UK average of £26,980. By comparison, the 
average Tory voter is on £29,720, while Lib Dem voters earn £28,730 and 
Labour voters receive £26,460.

The
 poll suggests the Tories remain the party of home ownership, with 81 
per cent of supporters owning their own property, compared to just 57 
per cent of Labour voters.

Labour has three times as many non-white voters as the Conservatives.

The survey also revealed that David Cameron’s ‘problem’ with women voters is easing.

Downing
 Street has become sensitive to charges of sexism in recent years, but 
the Populus poll suggests Tory support among women voters is broadly 
similar to the other parties. Some 46 per cent of Conservative voters 
are women, compared to 47 per cent of Labour voters, 48 per cent of Lib 
Dems and 37 per cent of Ukip supporters.
