One tenth of Britain's total expat population claim up to £23,318 in employment benefits each year from Germany.

Official figures show more than 10,000 British citizens living in the country receive the benefits subsidised by the German government.

Nine in ten of them have been deemed fit to work.

This weekend, the Sunday Times interviewed British expats living in Germany who are on the dole.

They found many were happy with how 'pleasant' the unemployment centres were, and how little they questioned them. Many admitted they do not speak the language.

Some, who had travelled to Germany in search of work or lost their jobs upon arriving, said they are untroubled by 'hassle' they get from UK job centres who try to 'force' them back to work.

One claimant said he was asked to take a job as a cleaner by a 'patronising' British official.

Jobless Britons praise the ease with which they can claim regular unemployment benefits in Germany.

They say the lower cost of living also means the generous handouts are worth even more over there.

A young British couple living in Berlin who earn more than £1,500 a month from working in bars admit they claim benefits to supplement their fund for going travelling.

In contrast there are only 1,680 Germans claiming jobseeker’s allowance in Britain, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

A new study by the European Commission found in most EU countries, citizens from other member states use welfare benefits no more intensively than the host country's nationals.
