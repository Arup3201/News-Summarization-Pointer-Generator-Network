John Kerry, the American Secretary of State, is in Afghanistan to try to broker a deal between the two candidates in last month’s runoff election where both are claiming victory.

The dispute between the two men - former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai – is becoming ever more bitter.

Preliminary results put the former World Bank economist Ashraf Ghani in the lead with 56.4 per cent of the vote. However, Mr Abdullah has rejected the count.

Secretary Kerry (with Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs chief of protocol Ambassador Hamid Siddiq) has flown into Kabul to try to stop the two men in the runoff election declaring victory or trying to form an administration

Mr Kerry arrived in Kabul pre-dawn to meet today the two contenders plus the current leader, President Hamid Karzai.

The American politician will try to stop either man claiming victory or trying to form an administration until the United Nations has had a chance to investigate the allegations of massive voter fraud.

The crisis is a major problem for the United States which is trying to leave Afghanistan in a stable state after more than ten years. It has threatened to withdraw financial help if either candidate tries to seize power.  

How long Secretary Kerry will be in Kabul is unknown as he meets President Karzai and the two candidates to take over his job Adbullah Abdullah and the former World Bank economist Ashraf Ghani

Reports from the country appear to say that Mr Abdullah welcomes the involvement of Secretary Kerry while Mr Ghani is reluctant to accept his help.
