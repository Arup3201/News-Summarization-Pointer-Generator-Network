A Chicago man creatively popped the question to his girlfriend by using a personalized flipbook. 

Rodney Nelson surprised his future wife Alexa Wenning with an adorable animated proposal after commissioning a local artist known as The Flippist to design and assemble cartoon images featuring details from their relationship for the customized book. 

Alexa, who shared their story with the proposal website HowHeAsked.com, revealed that Rodney had taken her to the Lincoln Park Zoo to see the Christmas lights festival and presented her with the flipbook before getting down on one knee.

Thoughtful engagement: Rodney Nelson from Chicago hired a local artist to create a personalized flipbook, which he used to propose to his girlfriend Alexa Wenning 

The flipbook shows animated versions of Rodney and Alexa playing fetch with their dog. 

When Alexa's character throws a ball across the park, the dog returns with a gray box, which she opens to find a ring. 

The last few pages read: 'Will you... Marry Me.'

After Alexa finished flipping through the book, Rodney reached into his pocket, pulled out her real diamond engagement ring and asked for her hand.

'Of course, I started bawling,' she told the website. 'I almost got frostbite afterwards because I refused to put my gloves back on!' 

The couple's first meeting was nearly as sweet as their engagement. 

After college, Alexa accepted a job in Chicago and moved on a whim.

Within days of arriving in the Midwestern city, Alexa reconnected with an old acquaintance from school who invited her to a happy hour with her co-workers.

It was there that she met Rodney - her future husband.

Following their engagement, Alexa and Rodney returned to the Chicago park to have their engagement pictures taken.   

The couple's romantic proposal is just one of the many that have turned into Internet sensations.

Last month, singer Michael Franti proposed to longtime love Sara Agah with a touching engagement video featuring intimate moments from their everyday lives set to his 2013 song Life Is Better With You - which he had written for her 

Michael spent three years collecting the footage of Sarah before he popped the question in Bali.
