She's only a year old, yet Signhild Nystrom has mastered flying, can wield a sword like a ninja, and even do a spot of DIY.

Yet Signhild's prodigious skills are actually the result of the lengths her father went to to make his little girl smile.

Swedish photographer Emil Nystrom and his partner Isabelle, both 25, wanted a family album with a difference.

With a little help from Photoshop, their daughter looks capable beyond her years.

Signhild Nystrom was only five months old when this was taken, looking as though she was tackling her parents' decorating with ease. Thanks to Photoshop, her mother Isabelle was taken out of the picture so it looked like Signhild was standing up by herself

Photographer Emil Nystrom also transformed his daughter into a mechanic for a fun family album

Some photos were taken before Signhild could even crawl or hold her own head up, so she needed a helping hand from an adult - who was then removed from the picture with digital software.

Mr Nystrom said: 'It's just so much fun. There is nothing serious about these pictures and that shows when we take them.

'The only thing that usually is in my mind when I take them is to get as funny face as possible from the baby.

'When Isabelle was pregnant with our baby I came up with many ideas that I wanted to do once the baby arrived. 

He added: 'In Sweden we have some really
funny commercials and I always wanted to do something like that, but 
with babies instead of grown-ups.

Watch out mum, Signhild's about to cause a splash

'Sometimes the ideas just come when I'm doing something completely different and sometimes I just sit down and try to come up with ideas.'

Mr Nystrom and his partner are expecting another child, so soon Signhild will have a younger sibling, which could lead to more photographic fun.

He said: 'I'm all about the baby's expressions. I just love to find a face that fits with the environment they are in. 

'They make me happy when I look at them, and if other people do, I guess I've succeeded.'

This snap makes it look like Signhild decided to hang out in the living room

She's not just a decorator and mechanic - Signhild is clearly a enthusiastic baker, too
