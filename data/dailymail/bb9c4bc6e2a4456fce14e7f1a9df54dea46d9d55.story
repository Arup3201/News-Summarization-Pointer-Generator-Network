An Indian woman was forced into modern-day slavery by two women who locked her indoors and forced her to work 16-hour days.

The victim was also raped by the women's accomplice, 54-year-old butcher Enkarta Balapovi.

At a sentencing of three people today, the court heard he subjected the 39-year-old to four months of sexual abuse behind his wife's back while forcing his victim to sleep on the floor of his single room flat. 

He forced the woman to cook and clean for him, and threatened to burn her passport unless she stripped naked and performed sex acts.

When the married victim resisted his advances, Balapovi threatened to throw her on to the streets without any identity documents if she did not sleep with him. 

The illiterate woman had been lured to the UK with the promise of work as a nanny, hoping to earn money for her poverty-stricken family in India. 

But she found herself locked indoors and forced to work 16-hour days during a four-year ordeal at the hands of Balapovi and co-accused women Shamina Yousuf, a secretary, and optician Shashi Obhrai.

The mother-of-four was burned with an iron, threatened with hypodermic needles and had a knife held to her throat by Obhrai, 54, when she tried to escape. 

Her passport was seized by Yousuf, 33, as soon as she arrived, and the woman was passed between three families as a 'dogsbody', earning just £2,300 for year's of gruelling work.

Despite dubbing Obhrai as 'wicked', Judge Shani Barnes spared her a jail sentence because she is the primary carer for her terminally ill millionaire husband Balram Obhrai, 59.

Mr Obhrai had been accused of trafficking and making threats to kill but the prosecution offered no evidence against him because he has a brain tumour and is on his death bed at home.

Yousuf, 33, had first recruited the woman when she came to the UK in 2005 to earn money for her poverty-stricken family in Hyderabad, India. 

After nearly three years as a 'servant' for Yousuf's family and friends, the woman confronted her.

Yousuf, whose marriage was breaking up, threw a mug at the woman's foot which left a two-inch gash.

Rapist: Butcher Balapovi was found guilty of five counts of rape

Obhrai employed the victim from October 2007 and forced her to work from 6am to 11pm.

During
her time there, she was burned with an iron, threatened with a 
hypodermic needle and hit over the head with a rolling pin after a row 
about chapatti recipes.

Balapovi, Yousuf, and Obhrai appeared in the dock together at Croydon Crown Court today to be sentenced. 

Balapovi
was jailed for 11 years, while Yousuf was sentenced to 40 hours 
community service and Obhrai was given a 20 month suspended jail 
sentence. 

Prosecutor 
Caroline Haughey said the uneducated victim was 'one of the most 
vulnerable members of society' who had been targeted because she was 
unaware of her basic human rights. 

'She has been bullied physically, psychologically, she has been sexually assaulted, she has been raped,' she said. 

'She
was clearly viewed as a belonging by the defendants in this case, each 
one of them separately contributing to the violation of her right.

'Her
naivety, her innocence, her lack of education, has been exploited with 
threats and physical violence preying on her lack of understanding of 
western norms.'

In a statement to the court, the 
victim, who has been given compassionate leave to stay in the UK for 
five years, said: 'They have made my life hell. I have suffered with 
depression and sleepless nights for a very long time. 

'I
have to take medication so that I can get some sleep. They have treated
me so badly that I worry at night that they will come for me. 

'These
people are dangerous they have ruined my life and kept me away from my 
children. Each should be punished for their wrongdoings.' 

During
a six-week trial, the court heard how Yousuf had forced the woman into 
servitude at her home in London by taking away her 
passport and promising to help her get a UK visa. 

But
she refused to return the passport and the victim found herself trapped
for three years before she was passed on to Balapovi, a butcher living 
in north London.

He
downed alcohol and repeatedly forced himself on her when she spurned 
his advances, grabbing her hair, kissing her so violently he cut her 
lips, and promising her a visa for her if she had sex with him.

The woman said: 'When Salim [Balapovi] used to have sex with me, my whole body used to ache. I can't move on - he raped me.' 

When
passed to Obhrai's house in also in north London the woman was beaten 
with high heel shoes, jabbed in the head with a comb and pushed her down
the stairs. 

Of one incident, the woman said: 'Shashi Obhrai put a hot iron on my arm when I asked her for my earnings to be paid.

'She
told me that she would do it. I told her that the iron was on and she 
said, "Have a look, is it hot or not?", and put the iron on me.'

Threats: Obhrai used this knife to threaten the Indian victim who she kept as a slave

She was also forced to survive on out-of-date food and the spat-out leftovers of Obhrai's children. When she was sick from tiredness, Obhrai made her clean up the vomit with her own clothes.

The woman managed to escape from Obhrai's clutches to a crisis centre, but her tormentor found her and threatened to kill her with a knife if she did not return.

She eventually escaped again and contacted refuge charities and the police.

In May last year, officers charged the trio with a variety of abuse offences.

Obhrai was convicted after trial of making a threat to kill and ABH after a trial.

She was given 18-months in prison for ABH and 20 months in prison for making threats to kill, with both sentences running concurrently and suspended for 20 months. 

Yousuf was convicted of ABH, and order to carry out 40 hours unpaid work. 

Her husband, supermarket manager, Aleemuddin Mohammed, 35, was cleared of sexual assault at the trial.

Butcher Balapovi's wife Shanaz Begum, 57, was found not guilty of people trafficking offences on the direction of the judge.
