California blue whales, the
largest animals on Earth once driven to near extinction by
whaling, have made a remarkable comeback to near historic,
19th-century levels, according to a University of Washington
study released on Friday.

The recovery makes California blue whales - which study
authors say now number about 2,200, or 97 per cent of historical
levels - the only population of blue whales known to have
recovered from whaling.

'The recovery of California blue whales from whaling
demonstrates the ability of blue whale populations to rebuild
under careful management and conservation measures,' said Cole
Monnahan, a University of Washington doctoral student and lead
author of the study.

California blue whales, the largest animals on Earth once driven to near extinction by whaling, have made a comeback to near historic, 19th-century levels

Despite the comeback, the whales - which as adults can reach
nearly 100 feet in length and weigh 190 tons, twice as much as the largest known dinosaur - are still
being struck by ships off the California coast at numbers above
allowable U.S. limits, according to the study's authors

Conservation groups say at least 11 blue whales are struck
each year along the U.S. West Coast, nearly four times the
'potential biological removal' level of 3.1 permitted under the
U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act.

'Even accepting our results that the current level of ship
strikes is not going to cause overall population declines, there
is still going to be ongoing concern that we don't want these
whales killed by ships,' University of Washington assistant
professor of aquatic and fishery sciences Tim Branch said.

Though their numbers have replenished, whales are still being struck by ships off the California coast at numbers above allowable U.S. limits

According to the University of Washington paper and a
separate paper published earlier this year, some 3,400 blue
whales were caught between 1905 and 1971, a number determined in
part by examining once-secret Russian whaling archives.

The study's authors say that the population of California
blue whales is now growing more slowly, partly due to ship
strikes and also because numbers are reaching the habitat limit.

California blue whales are now the only population of blue whales known to have recovered from whaling

'Our findings aren't meant to deprive California blue whales
of protections that they need going forward,' Monnahan said.

'California blue whales are recovering because we took
actions to stop catches and start monitoring. If we hadn't, the
population might have been pushed to near extinction - an
unfortunate fate suffered by other blue whale populations,' he
said. 'It's a conservation success story.'
