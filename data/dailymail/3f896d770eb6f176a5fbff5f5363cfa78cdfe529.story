It is uplifting news for the millions of women. Big busts are out of fashion.

Research shows that both sexes prefer the athletic lines of the likes of Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill over the cartoon curves of glamour models.

Elegant silhouettes are also more popular than the fuller figure Mad Men’s Christina Hendricks.

Plastic surgeons said that fewer patients now think that big is best – and for many they key is for others not to realise they have had surgery.

The trend was revealed by implant manufacturer GC Aesthetics, which commissioned a survey of more than 2,000 Britons.

Seventy two per cent of the women spoken to said that if they had a breast enlargement, they’d like to go up just one cup size.

Miss Ennis-Hill, who won gold in the heptathlon at London 2012, and actress Helen Mirren were among the celebrities whose figures were most envied.

Some 22 per cent of the women surveyed felt a two-size increase would be enough and 3 per cent said they’d like to be three cup sizes larger.

Just one per cent said they’d like to go up four cup sizes.

Surprisingly, the men questioned were of a similar opinion.  

When asked which celebrity’s body they would like their wife or girlfriend to have, they plumped for Miss Ennis-Hill over glamour model Katie Price.  

They also chose former Countdown host Carol Vorderman over Mad Men’s Christina Hendricks.  

However, they hadn’t completely fallen out of love with curvaceous women – as Kelly Brook’s hourglass figure also hit the mark.  

Ayse Kocak, chief executive of GC Aesthetics, which is holding a live web chat today, said results echo sales data, which show a preference for modest increases in size.

She added: ‘Today’s women – and even men – seem to prefer a streamlined silhouette and understand that breast augmentation is about gaining confidence, not seeking attention.’   

Douglas McGeorge, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said that when plastic surgery was the preserve of the rich and famous, large breast implants were a status symbol.  

Today, modesty and choosing implants proportionate to a woman’s frame are key.  

Mr McGeorge, a consultant plastic surgeon in Cheshire, said: ‘The days of trying to squeeze in massive implants and hope that everything is OK are gone.

‘Aesthetic surgery is no longer done by just a minority.  It is done by a lot of people and they don’t necessarily want the world to know what they have done.

‘Some women will always want big breasts but most patients I see just want to look elegant.’

Breast enlargements, which cost around £5,500, are at a record high.

Figures from BAAPS show the op to the most popular type of cosmetic surgery, with 11,000 carried out a year.

Its members only do around a third of operations, so the true figure is likely to be around 30,000.
