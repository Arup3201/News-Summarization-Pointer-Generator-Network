A British Muslim reported to have been killed in Syria ‘came back from the dead’ yesterday when he appeared in a London court charged with training to be a terrorist with an extremist Islamic group.

Just days after he supposedly died in the war-torn country, Imran Khawaja, 26, was appearing before magistrates accused of spending up to six months training with a group of British Jihadis affiliated to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), whose fighters are currently sweeping through Iraq.

Only last week, keen body-builder Khawaja, of Southall, west London, was reported to have been killed when the terrorist group Rayat al-Tawheed falsely announced his death.

But yesterday he appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court alongside his cousin Tahir Bhatti who is accused of helping Khawaja to buy an AK47 assault rifle and then driving him back from Bulgaria.

The pair were arrested by counter terrorism officers at Dover on Tuesday.

According to their charge sheets Khawaja is alleged to have ‘engaged in physical training’, bought flight tickets to Kurdistan and released cash from his bank account all with the intention of committing acts of terrorism. The preparation is said to have taken place in January this year.

The second charge Khawaja faces is of receiving ‘instruction or training’ in how to use firearms between January and June this year. He is also charged with spending the six-month period at a terrorist training camp.

Father-of-seven Bhatti, 44, of Watford, Herts, is accused of driving to Bulgaria to collect Khawaja, among a string of other offences relating to aiding and abetting the alleged terrorist.

According to the charge sheet, he allegedly helped Khawaja raise enough money to buy a ‘klash’ - thought to mean a Kalashnikov Ak-47 - and agreed to provide a replacement phone for him.

He is also accused of agreeing to help arrange delivery of the phone to Khawaja and helped him to return to the UK by communicating in coded messages.

Bhatti, the owner of a taxi firm, is alleged to have bought a P&O ferry ticket from Dover to Calais before hiring a car to collect Khawaja from the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, taking with him a change of clothes and a mobile phone.

London-born Khawaja appeared in the dock wearing a white t-shirt and sporting a goatee beard and a neck tattoo, while bald and bespectacled Bhatti also wore a white t-shirt.

Flanked by four heavily built security men in suits, both defendants spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses.

Both men were remanded in custody until a hearing at the Old Bailey on June 27.

In February this year this year senior security officials warned that around 250 British jihadis have returned from fighting in Syria, and are now suspected of wanting to carry out attacks here.

The figure is five times higher than previously thought and includes several ‘veterans’ who have fought in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

MI5 and police have already intercepted an alleged serious plot by jihadis returning from the war torn region last Autumn.

They were said to be planning a Mumbai-style gun attack on civilians in a crowded place, possibly London.

Around 2,000 Europeans are thought to be fighting in Syria, including at least 200 known to the British security services.

The man, who was thought to have been killed in Syria, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today along with accomplice Tahir Bhatti, 44. Khawaja is charged with two counts of preparing terrorists acts and Bhatti is accused of helping his cousin and agreeing to fund a rifle

It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad.

Last week the Government announced that Britons fighting in Syria face being charged with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg said they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers.

The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences occurred on British soil. 

The government warned Syria is now a ‘breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11.

Tackling the problem has become a top priority for MI5, MI6 and counter-terror police.
