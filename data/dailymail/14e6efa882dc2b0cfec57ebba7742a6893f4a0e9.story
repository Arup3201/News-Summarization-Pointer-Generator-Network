Disgraced pervert Jonathan King today said serial predatory rapist Jimmy Savile was innocent.

The 69-year-old former music mogul branded the dead DJ's victims his 'accusers', in an outburst that will appall those abused Savile.

King, who was jailed for seven years in 2001 for sexually assaulting five teenage boys, made the shocking statement in his column for the prison newspaper Inside Time.

He still refuses to admit to his crimes, but was released from prison in 2005.

Appalling outburst: Disgraced pervert Jonathan King (left) today said serial predatory rapist Jimmy Savile (right) is innocent. Writing in his Inside Time column, the 69-year-old said: 'He was an innocent man'

The pervert, who still protests his innocence, said Savile is an 'innocent man' in the eyes of the law.

King, who discovered the band Genesis and fronted the BPI Awards - now the BRITS - in 1987, said Savile was not a 'serial rapist', despite hundreds of complaints of abuse by the presenter.

Writing his monthly column, King lambasted the media for calling Savile a rapist, adding: 'He (Savile) wasn’t.

'He was an innocent
 man unless, of course, (newspapers) agree with the current legal 
premise that an accused person is guilty until or unless he or she can 
prove themselves innocent.

'That applies dead or alive, doesn’t it, unless we must believe the media always carries the truth.'

Guilty: King, 69, was jailed in 2001 for seven years after being found guilty of sexually abusing five teenage boys. He protests his innocence in his monthly column while claiming that those abused by Savile should be referred to as 'accusers' rather than his victims because the pervert DJ never appeared in court

He claimed Savile's hundreds of victims should be referred to as 'accusers', due to the fact Savile never appeared in court.

Addressing his own crimes, the 69-year-old, said he has been provoked by the recent aquittal of celebrities including Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell and Bill Roache.

He said juries in those cases did not believe the crimes had taken place, and were 'at worst fiction, at best exaggeration'.

King claims the jury in his case should have come to the same conclusion.

He adds: 'The crimes never happened. At least miscarriages of justice in cases of murder have bodies to show that crimes did take place. If I’d been tried now, instead of 14 
years ago, when the ages of consent had only just been equalised thanks 
to the EU and to the fury of homophobes, I would certainly have been 
found innocent.'

Report: Dame Janet Smith, a former court appeal judge, is compiling a report on the Savile scandal investigating whether the BBC 'turned a blind eye' to the former DJ's offending, allowing him to rape and sexually assult hundreds of victims

King became known to millions of TV viewers after fronting BBC2’s Entertainment USA show in the 1980s

A report being compiled by Dame Janet Smith, a former court of appeal judge, into the Savile scandal is investigating whether the BBC ‘turned a blind eye’ to the former DJ’s offending, allowing him to rape and sexually assault hundreds of victims over five decades.
