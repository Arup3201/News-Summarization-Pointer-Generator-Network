These are the horrifying injuries suffered by a teenager who was beaten up by two youths in an unprovoked attack.

Chris Hopkinson, 18, released the images after his attackers Reece Hardy and Jordon Humphrey were locked up after admitting two counts of assault and one of causing grievous bodily harm.

The photographs show how the student - who is now scarred for life - was punched beyond recognition in Creswell, Derbyshire, as his face was transformed into a swollen, bloody pulp.

Horrific injuries: Chris Hopkinson - who is now scarred for life - was punched beyond recognition in Creswell, Derbyshire, as his face was transformed into a swollen, bloody pulp

The vicious assault, which left Mr Hopkinson unconscious, happened on May 1 last year as he and a few friends from nearby Staveley attended a birthday party in the neighbouring village.

Derby Crown Court heard last week how Hardy, 18, and Humphrey, 19, from Creswell, were spoiling for a fight as they attacked two other teenagers.

One was punched inside the party at Creswell Social Centre, and another was hit in the face outside the club, before they turned on Mr Hopkinson.

Mark Knowles, prosecuting, told how Mr Hopkinson was knocked to the ground and kicked while he was unconscious.

Mr Knowles said: ‘He was kicked by both defendants and a witness said it was like the volleying of a football and involved a stamping on the head.’

Speaking after the case, Mr Hopkinson said: ‘There was so much blood. It was unreal.

‘My t-shirt and jeans were covered. I had
 my head on this girl’s lap while I was coming round afterwards and her 
legs were covered in blood too.

‘I had cuts on my face, swelling to my
 left check but my right eyebrow was the worst - it was nearly coming 
off. I had to hold it on so it didn’t peel away with all the blood 
running down my face.

‘A few people from the area told me it looked like there had been a murder because there was so much blood in the road.

‘I came round and thought I 
was alright, I told the police officer I was going to go home and he 
said you’re not going anywhere. He showed me a picture of my injuries 
and I was so shocked.’

Mr 
Hopkinson, who was treated at Chesterfield Royal Hospital and wants to 
be a traffic police officer, explained Hardy and Humphrey attacked his 
friends before turning on him.

The
 teenager struggled through his A-Level exams just two days after the 
bloodbath with dizziness and headaches - and has been forced to re-do 
his studies to get better grades.

Mr Hopkinson said: ‘After it happened I 
woke and it hurt and I couldn’t open my eyes because of the swelling. I 
was attacked on a Friday and my exams started on the Monday.

Sentenced: Reece Hardy (left), 18, and Jordon Humphrey (right), 19, admitted two counts of assault and one of causing grievous bodily harm. Hardy was locked up for 22 months and Humphrey was given 20 months

‘But every time I looked at the exam paper I got dizzy. Now I’m going to still be at school while all my friends go off to university.

‘I didn’t feel comfortable going out by myself or going to parties - and when I got back to playing cricket for Staveley Miners’ Welfare, I wasn’t at my best.

'What you (Reece Hardy and Jordon Humphrey) did was terrible. All you have to do is look at the photographs of this young man - look at the scarring'

Judge John Burgess

‘But I am pleased these two have been dealt with, and now they have been sentenced I want to put it all behind me and get on with my life.’

Sarah Brown, defending Hardy, who was locked up for 22 months, said in court that it was a combination of immaturity and alcohol, adding that he was ashamed and acted out of character.

Will Bennett, defending Humphrey, who was given a 20-month sentence, said he was drunk and was sickened by what he had done. Neither had previous convictions.

Judge John Burgess said: ‘What you (Hardy and Humphrey) did was terrible. All you have to do is look at the photographs of this young man - look at the scarring.

‘He will have to endure comments. People ask him what happened and he feels people who don’t know him question whether he is trouble.’
