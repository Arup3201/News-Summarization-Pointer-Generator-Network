A furious mother is suing a nursery after her three-year-old daughter's thumb was ripped off when she got it trapped in a door.

Kacie Lumsden got her fingers wedged between a door and a wall while playing at a day nursery.

The tip of her right thumb was ripped off in the incident before frantic staff packed it in ice and surgeons were able to reattach it.

Kacie's distraught family are now suing Glengarry Children's Daycare Nursery in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, after bosses admitted liability for the child's injuries.

After the incident, which happened in November last year, Kacie was rushed to New Cross Wolverhampton Hospital before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the tip of her thumb.

An Ofsted investigation has severely criticised the nursery and re-adjusted it's rating to 'inadequate'.

As a result, it lost funding from Wolverhampton City Council and closed on June 28 with the company in administration.

Kacie's mother Tanya James, 30, said the traumatic experience had transformed her daughter from a confident girl to a shy, withdrawn child.

The mother-of-three, who is herself a qualified nursery nurse, said: 'Kacie is now completely different.

'She clings to me all the time and is very nervous when I am not around.

'My trust in what should have been a very secure and safe place for young children has been completely shattered.

'I have worked in nurseries for eight years and this is by far the worst incident I have experienced or heard about.

'It's not something that should ever happen in a nursery.'

The ordeal left Kacie, who is due to see a psychologist, suffering from sleep disorders and frequent bed-wetting.

Miss James, from Wolverhampton, has now approached law FBC Manby Bowdler LLP who are pursuing a compensation claim against the nursery.

Personal injury solicitor Wendy Turner, who is representing the family, said: 'Both Kacie and Tanya have suffered as result of the nursery's incompetence and are entitled to compensation.

'We are still waiting to hear from independent medical experts, with a view to negotiating a settlement.

'However,
our main priority is in ensuring that Kacie makes a recovery to the 
point where she is able to live with her injury, particularly when she 
becomes more self-conscious in her teenage years.'

Remarkably,
a damning Ofsted inspection report carried out in January 2013 found 
the nursery had failed to ensure that a similar accident couldn't happen
again.

The report 
said: 'Managers have failed to meet the Safeguarding and Welfare 
requirements of the revised Early Years Foundation Stage.

'My trust in what should have been a very secure and safe place for young children has been completely shattered'

'Prompt
action has not been taken to fully minimise the identified risk which 
the doors pose to fingers following a recent serious incident when a 
child trapped their finger in a door.

'As a result of the incident existing faulty finger guards have been replaced and some additional guards fitted to doors.

'However, the action taken is not fully effective, as some doors remain unguarded and many of the guards fitted are only fitted part way up the door and some are ill-fitted.

'Consequently, reasonable steps have not been taken to minimise or remove this hazard and children are at risk.'

Doctors initially feared Kacie's thumb reattachment may have been unsuccessful but are now optimistic it will continue to grow normally.

She is now attending a public sector nursery school before starting primary school in September.
