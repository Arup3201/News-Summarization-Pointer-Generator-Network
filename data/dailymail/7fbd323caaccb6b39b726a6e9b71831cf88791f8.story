A train station in suburbia might not be the most romantic scene for a proposal in most women's book.

But romantic Samuel Goetsch was certain that the platform at Surbiton, Surrey, would be just perfect for him to pop the question to Harry Potter-mad girlfriend Stephanie Dodd.

The station features in a pivotal scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Unfortunately, the 24-year-old from Houston, Texas, hadn't reckoned on the temperamental timings of the British rail network. 

After flying his girlfriend 5,000 miles across the world to his father's house in Ashford, Surrey, he realised trains to the station were not running because of weekend cancellations by South West Trains.

Mr Goetsch, 24, had flown with Miss Dodd, 25, from Houston, Texas to propose in the station, backdrop to a poignant scene about new beginnings.

In the film Dumbledore encounters Harry at platform three of Surbiton station and spirits him away from the mundane world of muggles to Budleigh Babberton.

When realised the trains weren't running he had to think of a reason to get the bus to the station or risk his carefully planned surprise falling apart.

His father Stephen, who lives in Ashtead , Surrey, was at the proposal.

He said: 'My son wanted to ask Stephanie to marry him there because the scene in the movie is all about new beginnings.

'I don't think he thought it would be a problem getting to the station but it didn't go as smoothly as he thought.

'Stephanie had no idea so my son had to do some quick thinking working up a reason to get her to the station.

'He had to pretend he had some business in Surbiton and convince her to go with him.'

The couple met while they were both studying abroad in Japan in 2011 and headed back to Texas the day after the proposal.

Thankfully, he was able to take a bus to the station after developing an elaborate back story - and Miss Dodd was so impressed she said yes

Mr Goetsch said: 'They were actually in Japan at the time of the huge earthquake so I guess there are quite a few times in their relationship when things haven't gone as smoothly as possible.

'This was Stephanie's first visit to England and it's great that it's definitely one she will remember.'

Mr Goetsch brought a copy of the Harry Potter book with him to present to his fiancé along with the engagement ring.

Caroline Landu, who was working at the station, said: 'It's not something you see every day so I got them to pose for a photo with the book.

'I found out they were big Harry Potter fans so it is a romantic thing to do.'
