A New York City councilman has been arrested on corruption charges after investigators found that he has allegedly been misusing tens of thousands of dollars of public funds.

Ruben Wills and his relative Jelani Mills were taken into custody in Queens on Wednesday morning and has being charged with grand larceny and other theft charges.

The arrests come after an investigation that started in 2012 when it was reported by The New York Daily News that a $33,000 grant that had been awarded to a charity Wills was involved with went unaccounted for.

In custody: Ruben Wills was arrested on Wednesday morning and will be charged with grand larceny and crimes related to the theft of about $30,000 in public and federal funds

Under scrutiny: The investigation into the missing funds was launched in 2011 and now the state comptroller's office and the office of the attorney general have charged Wills and a relative for their role in the scheme

Before being elected as a city councilman, Wills worked as the chief of staff for state Senator Shirley Huntley, who was convicted in connection to the theft of $88,000 from a different not-for-profit.

The New York Post reports that before that arrest, Huntley directed tens of thousands of dollars-worth of legislative grants to NY4Life, a group founded by Wills in 2006 which was supposed to help single parents.

He has served on the board of the group- which does not have it's own website- since he founded the charity in 2006 and has been the chairman since 2009.

Questions started being raised in 2011- a year after he was elected to the City Council- when the Office of Children & Family Services inquired about how the $33,000 grant was being spent but they never got a response.

According to state records, the $33,000 in question was earmarked by Will's former boss in 2008.

Dealings: Investigators claim Wills' former boss directed funds to a fake not-for-profit that Wills launched in 2006 and Wills has repeatedly refused to hand over forms accounting for where the money went

When the OCFS never got a response or the specific accounting of how the money was spent that they had asked for, so they referred the case to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office.

That same year, Wills pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief in an unrelated incident that happened more than a decade earlier. He admitted that he stole and damaged property in relation to a business dispute in 1998, and was ordered to pay restitution and do community service for three days.

Schneiderman's office teamed up with the State Comptroller's office and issued a subpoena in February 2012 after another letter demanding the funds be accounted for or repaid went ignored again.

Wills met with investigators from the attorney general's office that February and brought no such documentation.

The Daily News cites court papers that say he only brought one undated invoice for $980 but it was unclear when that money was even spent.

The New York Post claims that the Democrat used his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid speaking for fear of self-incrimination during a 2013 meeting with investigators.

Punishment: Both Wills (left) and his relative Jelani Mills (right) face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail if they are found guilty on their most serious charge- grand larceny

The nature of the relationship between Wills and Jelani Mills remains unclear, but Mills is being called Willsâ€™ relative and is charged with conspiring with him on the grand larceny scheme.

If convicted of grand larceny, both men face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail.

In a joint release from the attorney general and the comptroller's office, officials said that Wills and Mills have been indicted for allegedly pocketing about $30,000 in both grant money and public campaign funds.

It goes on to specify that the New York City Campaign Finance Board handed his staff $11,500 in funds that matched the amount he raised through public campaigning.

He claimed that the money was paid to Micro Targeting, a campaign literature translation and distribution service, but the investigators assert that it is simply a shell company.

From there, Mills allegedly transferred the funds to NY4Life and Wills withdrew cash from those accounts, which he then used to buy personal items like a $750 Louis Vuitton bag.

'The crimes Mr. Wills is accused of committing represent a shameful breach of the trust his constituents placed in him,' Attorney General Schneiderman said in the statement.

'New Yorkers are repeatedly asked to have faith in our leaders, and it appears that faith has been shattered once again. Every time my office arrests a corrupt public official, it sends the message that elected office does not come with a blank check or a license to break the law.'
