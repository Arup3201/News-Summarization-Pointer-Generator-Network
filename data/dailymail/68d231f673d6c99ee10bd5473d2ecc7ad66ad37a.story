They were reduced to tears when a somewhat harsh letter arrived from Santa notifying them about their inclusion on his naughty list.

But after being given 13 sleeps to turn their behaviour around or risk a Christmas morning with no presents, brother and sister Tyler and Freya Cole awoke to find themselves in his good books.

They were left ecstatic as they dashed out of their bedrooms and found that Santa had stuck to his word and rewarded their remarkable turnaround.

After receiving a letter from 'Santa' saying they had to improve their behaviour if they wanted Christmas presents, Freya, 4, and Tyler Cole, 8, stopped squabbling

The pair, following a plan devised by their mother Laura, put their differences aside and were overjoyed to recieve presents on Christmas morning

The squabbling siblings put their differences aside having been warned in the missive from Lapland that Santa is ‘always watching’.

Yet they did not realise that the letter was actually part of a ploy devised by their mother Laura to try and improve their behaviour in the weeks leading up to Christmas.

The 32-year-old filmed the children’s tearful reaction as they opened the letter in which Santa described his disapproval of their naughty behaviour.

Despite feeling guilty about the unusual approach and acknowledging that some people will brand her a ‘terrible mother’, Mrs Cole said the plan was a resounding success.

Aside from a few minor blips, Tyler, eight, and Freya, four, managed to ‘work out their differences’ and even calmed each other down when normally chaotic situations began to unfold.

The turnaround was obviously noticed by Santa, as Freya found herself the lucky recipient of an Elsa doll from Disney’s hit movie Frozen, the year’s most sought-after present.

But Tyler was a picture of happiness this morning as he unwrapped a new Lego set left under the family's tree

Tyler was also left euphoric after opening his Lego ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ set, while both children were delighted by the array of gifts in their personalised stockings.

And Santa himself even left his own letter this time in which he congratulated the children for making it on to his ‘nice list’ and urged them to continue being kind to each other.

Mrs Cole, who works for ski tour operator Crystal, said that the magical Christmas morning after a visit from Santa was ‘really well deserved’ after a fortnight of hard work by her children.

‘They ran out of their room this morning and were so happy to see the presents,’ she said.

‘They weren’t overly naughty kids but they did fight a lot and this has really helped to work towards something together.

‘They have been getting so much better. When they were having their baths on Christmas Eve Tyler turned to Freya and said ‘He’s coming’ as he knew they had been good.’

Despite being criticised for penning the fake letter after she posted a video online of Tyler sobbing as he read it aloud, Mrs Cole said it was never meant to be cruel.

Mrs Cole, who also lives with husband Dennis and one-year-old son Logan in Epsom, Surrey, said: ‘We didn’t want them to be sad or for this to be a negative thing.

‘It helps them appreciate the presents they got, rather than just assuming they are going to be there under the tree no matter what.’

‘So we kept telling them about how good their behaviour had become over the last couple of weeks.’

But on the few occasions when the pair began to fight with each other, Miss Cole pointed to the letter which was kept on the mantelpiece and told the children that Santa was watching.

‘On some occasions, Tyler would even turn around to Freya and tell her off as he said Santa could see everything,’ Mrs Cole added.

The video shows Tyler quivering as he reads out the message, which says that Santa is ‘certain’ they will be on his naughty list.

Dear Tyler and Freya,

I have been watching you for the last few weeks and I am certain that you will both be on my naughty list. You have not been good children.

I can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well. This has made me feel extremely disappointed.

I am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do Freya and the attitude you have at the moment Tyler.

You have 13 sleeps to change this. I will be watching you both very very closely in a hope I can change you to the nice list.

If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both.

Remember only good children are on the nice list. I hope to see you on Christmas Eve.

‘If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both,’ it warns.

After reading the letter, a sobbing Tyler looks at his mother and cries: ‘What are you looking at us like that for? It makes me upset.’

When she responds by reminding him that he has 13 days to turn things around, the dispirited schoolboy says: ‘I know, but [Freya] keeps annoying me.’

The husband and wife have also decided to treat the children to a trip to Walt Disney World in February.

With no threat from Santa over their heads, Miss Cole hopes they can use the holiday to keep working on the children’s sometime ill-discipline.

She believes, however, that her successful fake letter ploy will lead to long-term harmony between the pair.

She said: ‘They are a brother and sister who fight quite a lot, which is to be expected, and aren’t overly naughty. But in the last couple of weeks they seem to have worked out their differences.’
