The man accused of stabbing Sydney man Morgan Huxley more than 20 times has been found guilty of his murder.

It took the jury just under three hours to find Daniel Jack Kelsall guilty of indecently assaulting the 31-year-old and murdering him in the early hours of September 8, 2013.

Mr Huxley's family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down.

Speaking outside court on Wednesday Mr Huxley's ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall said his 'life had been stolen by a worthless psychopath'.

Kelsall remained expressionless in the dock as his mother Lynne and father Mark, who had sat near him throughout the trial, looked on.

In a statement on behalf of Huxley's family, Ms Hall said her former boyfriend was 'an inspiring, generous and loving young man'.

'Morgan was beginning to make his way in the world,' she said outside court.

'He had hopes and dreams that he will never be able to realise.

'He will never get married and never be able to run around a park with his children. We love you Morgan.' 

It has also emerged that the killer stalked two other men in Neutral Bay, one just a week after he murdered Mr Huxley in his bedroom.

One young man told police that just a week after the murder and just streets away, a man he identified as Kelsall — and wearing the same cook’s uniform — stalked him down Ben Boyd Rd almost to his front door. The young man said he confronted Kelsall, who ran off, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Another man also told police he was having a cigarette outside a block of units in Spruson St several months before the murder when a man, who he later identified as Kelsall, jumped out from behind a bush.

Over the course of two week trial, the jury in the NSW Supreme Court heard how Mr Huxley had been discovered by his flatmate lying in a pool of blood in the doorway of his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore.

The crown relied on a string of circumstantial evidence, which crown prosecutor Peter McGrath SC told the jury would leave them to infer only one thing - Kelsall was the killer.

The first was CCTV footage which shows an intoxicated and barefoot Mr Huxley leaving the nearby Oaks Hotel around 1.30am with Kelsall breaking into a jog behind him.

Kelsall tracked him into his home, indecently assaulted him as he lay on his bed, and then stabbed him at least 20 times, the crown said.

His DNA had been found on Mr Huxley's penis and a single print matching his ring finger was on the businessman's bedroom door.

Mr Huxley's blood was also found on the shoulder bag Kelsall was carrying that night - which the 22-year-old had tried to clean in an 'amateurish' attempt.

But the key to all of this was Kelsall's 2012 confessions that he had intrusive thoughts about killing 'a random' with a knife.

The truth, Mr McGrath said, was awful but simple - Kelsall killed Mr Huxley for no reason.

'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said yesterday.

Looking directly at the jury, the crown prosecutor on Tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22-year-old, that, he said, would leave them to infer only one thing.

'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' he said. 

Urging the jury not to be distracted by 'red herrings', Mr McGrath said the crown case against the former junior chef was straight forward and added up.

It was not Kelsall, he said, that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but Mr Huxley.

'Chillingly he just happens to be someone who has expressed intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts about killing someone with a knife on the way home from work. A total stranger. Some random.'

But Kelsall had a different story.

Taking the stand, Kelsall quietly described how he had struck up a spontaneous conversation with Mr Huxley while the pair were walking home.

Kelsall, who pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore.

He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 

'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, 'Do you want to talk about it?'.

'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, 'Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to'.' 

Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury.

During the sexual encounter that followed, an intruder or intruders burst in and assaulted the pair, causing him to flee.

He then wove a string of lies in a bid to 'disassociate' himself from an event which had terrified him. 

With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis.

'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said. 

'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran.

'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' 

He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder.

'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. 

Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment

Citing personal accounts of Kelsall as a caring and bookish boy, his barrister Christopher Watson reminded the jury how the junior chef had left liquorice treats out for his mother on the night of the murder.

'It doesn't sit with a calculated killer,' Mr Watson had said.

Mr Huxley's family who all wore yellow roses - signifying his favourite colour - thanked the crown, the jury and the detectives for their dedication to justice. 

Kelsall's parents said nothing when they left the court.
