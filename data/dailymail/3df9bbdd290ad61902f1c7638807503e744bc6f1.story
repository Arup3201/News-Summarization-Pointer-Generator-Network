New polling numbers paint a dismal picture of the Obama presidency as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) gains influence in the Middle East and threatens to mount an attack on the U.S. homeland.

Just 42 per cent of Americans now see the president as a 'strong leader,' according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday - despite bullish talk from the White House that Obama will be able to carry out his strategy against ISIS without asking Congress.

Even as the U.S. leader languished in the new poll - consistent with seven others asking Americans to rate the president's performance.

Tanking: President Obama's rating as a 'strong leader' is at an all-time low atas he prepares to outline a strategy to defeat the ISIS terror network before it can mount an attack on America

 

Nearly two-thirds – 65 per cent – say the U.S. should ramp up airstrikes against ISIS and expand them into Syria, where the terror group has its largest strongholds and have so far been protected by a largely invisible national border.

And 70 per cent think ISIS is already positioned inside the United States with the resources and ability to mount an attack.  

The development came as Obama prepared to deliver a prime-time address on Wednesday outlining  his plans for an expanded military and political effort to combat militants in Syria and Iraq.

Obama is expected to urge Congress to quickly give him authority to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces fighting President Bashar Assad.

But, though he will ask, administration officials say Obama will press forward with other elements of his plan even without Congressional say-so.

That could include further airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq and possibly in Syria. Other elements of Obama's plan include increased support for Iraqi security forces, as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. 

A whopping 54 per cent now say they disapprove of Obama's work in the Oval Office, according to the average published by Real Clear Politics. Slightly more, 55 per cent, told ABC pollsters that Obama is not a strong leader.

RCP's presidential approval average peaked at 65.5 per cent approval shortly after Obama's first inauguration in 2009, and stood at 54 per cent after his second election – the same number who now say they disapprove.

His current 42 per cent rating has been worse – notably after the disastrous launch of Healthcare.gov – but Americans have never had a lower estimation of the president's leadership strength.

A separate poll released Monday by CNN and ORC International found that 71 percent of Americans think ISIS terrorists are already positioned in the United States with the resources they need to mount an attack.

About 87 per cent said they were concerned about the threat ISIS poses to America's national security.

Obama is set to deliver a critical speech Wednesday night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, in which he's expected to outline a comprehensive strategy to 'degrade and destroy' the Islamist group.

Observers in both Congress and the White House expect that any effective plan will stretch well into the next presidency.

House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders will meet with the president Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. to hear a preview of the speech.

'What I’m hoping to hear from the president today is a strategy that goes after ISIS, and destroys them,' Boehner said in a statement.

'I’ve been calling for a strategy to deal with the growing terrorist threat since January, when ISIS came across the border in western Iraq. We have a very serious problem, and what we need is a strategy. ... I am looking for a strategy from the president that takes on this terrorist threat and defeats it.'

The president has been criticized for emphasizing political solutions – encouraging Iraq to build an 'inclusive' government that no longer marginalizes religious minority groups – instead of being more aggressive militarily.

Middle East or Arizona Desert? A strong majority of Americans think ISIS is already positioned in the US for attacks to be mounted later

The Department of Defense reported on Monday that U.S. Central Command has presided over 148 airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. But a Pentagon insider told MailOnline that more than 500 targets have been hit.

Still, ISIS poses a continuing threat because it could retreat into Syria, and maintains its largest strongholds in the eastern part of that country.

Obama is said to be weighing options to attack there, despite objections from Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Pentagon has already conducted numerous flyovers with surveillance drones to assess ISIS's capabilities and identify potential airstrike targets.

Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said Tuesday that 'as we wait for the president to outline his long overdue strategy, ISIS is a growing danger to our national security, to our allies, and to innocent people across the Middle East.'

Any strategy Obama articulates is likely to lean heavily on the involvement of a coalition of nations, rather than engaging ISIS alone.

The CNN/ORC poll found that 61 per cent of Americans oppose sending American ground troops into Iraq to fight ISIS. But 6 in 10 also said they would support new military action if other countries shared the burden.
