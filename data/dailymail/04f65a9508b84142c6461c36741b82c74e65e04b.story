Brendan Rodgers spoke slowly and quietly to add weight to his words. Mario Balotelli’s name had just been brought into the conversation and Liverpool’s manager had a message to broadcast.

‘I think in terms of goals, he needs to improve,’ Rodgers said. ‘It is as simple as that. Any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes. At this moment, he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.’

During a day when he had to confront a number of issues, from Daniel Sturridge’s fitness to Liverpool’s soft underbelly, nothing resonated louder in the aftermath of a potentially fatal defeat to Basle than the words that were reserved for the £16million man who arrived from AC Milan.

Whatever honeymoon Balotelli had been enjoying at Liverpool is over after his wretched personal performance in St Jakob-Park, where he barely looked interested and rarely threatened to break into anything more taxing than a canter. One goal so far is not a sufficient return.

It would be unfair to dump all that is currently wrong at Liverpool at Balotelli’s door — their problems run deeper than a misfiring centre forward — but his static, stuttering displays are exacerbating the situation and, five weeks into his Liverpool career, he has a decision to make.

Is he prepared to put in the hard yards? Is he going to do what Rodgers expects of all his strikers, to hassle and harass defenders to the point of distraction? Will he become the focal point of Liverpool’s team and lead their charge, ramping up the intensity with his runs into channels?

None of that looked likely in Basle. Flouncing off the pitch at the final whistle without acknowledging the travelling supporters, he was the only member of Liverpool’s squad to be escorted back to the team coach and the only one to have something else on aside from an official club tracksuit.

Aside from a glistening diamond in each ear, Balotelli was wearing an oversized baseball cap, an image that ensured he grabbed attention, but the time has come for him to realise that he has to start making statements on the pitch rather than off it.

If Balotelli looks around Liverpool’s dressing room, he will see professionals who live a quiet life, get on with their business conservatively and push themselves to maximise their talent. He has a stage to make a name for himself but, so far, the penny has not fully dropped.

‘In terms of his behaviour since he came into here the boy is consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game that we would demand,’ said Rodgers. 

‘In terms of the intensity and that work-rate. And over the course of the team that is the same.

‘We need to return to being a team. That has brought us success over the last 18 months. When confidence is a little bit low in the team, it can become more about the individual, but that is not what we are about. We are a team and when we work to that principle we are at our best.’

If that is the case, why did Rodgers sign a player who, as Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher observed, does not have a history of making sacrifices for the team? How have Liverpool slipped so far when the memory of what Luis Suarez was inspiring last season is still fresh?

‘I always said it was about availability and affordability of players,’ Rodgers explained. ‘Mario was the one right at the very end who was available for that. I said when he came in there was a calculated risk and it’s something I have to work on to try to make it work for the team. 

‘There are very few players who can replace Suarez. Actually, there are no players who can replace Suarez. When you look at the availability of other players during the summer it was something that was difficult for us.’

Rodgers looked at a number of options when Suarez left for Barcelona, including Loic Remy, Radamel Falcao and Karim Benzema, and believes Liverpool did sign a world-class forward in the last window, but the spotlight is now shining to see whether Balotelli prove he is worthy of that description.

‘It’s no good now, I know, but we took a player in Divock Origi who we believe will be world-class,’ said Rodgers. ‘We will get him (back from Lille, where he is on loan) next summer. Now he is a top player. He has everything — the speed, the profile and so on.

‘But we couldn’t bring him in now and that was unfortunate because he can run in behind, he can keep the ball, press and run but that was part of the deal. There were very few top-class forwards who were available. Mario was a calculated gamble we had to try and work with.’

If it doesn’t pay off, miserable nights such as the one in Basle could become a recurring theme.
