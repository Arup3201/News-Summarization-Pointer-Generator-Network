Islamic State is kidnapping thousands of women and young girls to be traded in open markets as sex slaves for as little as £16 each, it was revealed today.

A shocking report by Amnesty International lays bare for the first time the true depth of depravity with which IS fighters are treating their female captives, tearing them from their families and subjecting them to sustained and violent rape and domestic enslavement.

Puberty is not requisite to be an IS sex slave, with girls as young as 12 and their mothers being dragged by their hair  onto cattle trucks and herded to a 'sorting office' where they are classified by age, education and marital status, The Times reported.

After being abducted from their homes, they are sold as playthings to the highest bidder, usually IS commanders, or gifted to the 'bravest' fighters as rewards for their services to jihad.

What happens to them thereafter is up to their new owners who are free to abuse, torture, rape or just share them between their friends.

These are not isolated examples of individual cruelty but an institutionalized policy of wholesale enslavement based on a brutal interpretation of Sharia law.

Horrific details of the barbarity with which  IS treats its captives are only now beginning to trickle out thanks to the bravery of a minority of girls who escaped their captors and fled to safety to tell their stories.

Those stories have now been published in Amnesty's report, Torture, sexual slavery in Islamic State captivity in Iraq.

Activists are desperately trying to shine a light on the plight of these slaves who hail primarily from Iraq's minority Yazidi population.

And they say the IS slave drivers include Islamic converts from the West.

'I have a case of one escapee who was one of a group of girls bought and raped by two Australian brothers from Isis,' Amena Saeed, a Yazidi former MP, told The Times. 'These were not Australians of Islamic origin - these are white-skinned, blond-haired Australians: converts.'

The Times spoke to a number of escapees who all told stories of gang rape and horror.

They include a 19-year-old Yazidi woman who recalled the moment she and her sisters were seized from the town of Sinjar, northern Iraq, prized from their mother's grasp and sold to a man they knew  from their village.

'My mother started screaming and begging for mercy as the Daesh (Isis) fighters told my sister and me to join the group of younger women specially selected,' Girl B, as she has been named to protect her identity, said. 'But they tore us from her grasp. I saw other women in the building being dragged to waiting lorries by their hair.'

Girl B and her 14-year-old sister were captured on the first Sunday of August as they fled up Sinjar mountain to escape the advancing IS horde. But before they could reach the safety of the hills they were intercepted and driven to a government building in Sinjar where the selection process began. 

Of the men who captured her, her mother, sister and  six siblings, the youngest of whom is 11 years old, she said: 'They were local Sunni fighters, some of whom we recognised. A local mechanic was among them.'

She said she and her 14-year-old sister were ordered to join a group of both married and unmarried young women.

'When my mother realised (what was happening0 she began screaming,' she said. Her mother managed to hold on to her 11-year-old daughter but could not prevent Girl B and her sister being taken away. 

Girl B said they were piled onto lorries 'like cattle' and taken to Mosul where they were held in another sorting centre, named Galaxy Hall.

Over the following two weeks, they went though another two selection processes before they ended up with about 100 other girls in a house in the town of Baaj owned by an influential IS sheik. They were also forced to convert to Islam.

They were inspected once more before she was sold to another man she knew called Abu Ghuffram, a small-time crook in her hometown who fitted gold teeth to clients including, once, one of her older sisters. 

She and her sister were then taken to his home in Rambussi where they would serve - both sexually and domestically - him and two of his captains.

'Sometimes he would call me by name and talk reasonably,' she said 'At other times the men would insult our Yazidi faith and curse us. If Abu Ghuffram was angry, he would strike of kick me. Once he put his hands around my throat and tried to choke me.'

That was all she could bring herself to tell The Times before she broke down under the strain of her trauma.

It was then that a Yazidi care worker told the newspaper's reporter that the girls had been repeatedly raped over a long period by Ghouffram and his underlings.

They managed to escape in November - three months after their initial capture - by sneaking past a sleeping guard at night and climbing over a wall. They walked through the night through the desert and into the Sinjar mountains where they were found by Yazidi fighters who evacuated them to Dohuk by helicopter. 

Islamic State have long denied using sex slaves to services its fighters. But, in October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'.

It went on: 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia.' 

And earlier this month, in its 'Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and Slaves', Isis said: 'It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse.' 

Activists say some 2,500 girls and women have been captured as sex slaves in the past five months. so far, about 430 have escaped. About 2,000 Yazidi men are also unaccounted for, believed to have been executed.

Khider Domle, a Yazidi activist helping refugees in Dohuk said: 'We have raped and pregnant cases; children who have escaped without parents; parents without children. We have cases of women who have been raped by just one Daesh fighter, and cases of women who have been multiply raped and sold several times among Isis fighters. We have found women sold for $25 (£16), for $100 (£64), for $1,000 (£640). We have it all.'

Girl B has not seen her mother or father since that August day when they were torn apart by Isis fighters.
