A three-year-old girl has died in a house fire exactly a year ago to the day her baby brother died suddenly from suspected cot death.

Angel Jade Smith died after a fire broke out at her family home in Carmarthen, Wales at around 6.15pm on Sunday.

Her mother, Alice Smith, 24, remains in a serious condition in hospital following the blaze, which is being investigated by police.

The pair were taken to Glangwili Hospital, along with the youngster’s father, after the fire broke out at the terraced house in the Bryn Gorwel area, where the average property price is £100,000.

It took more than eight firefighters 
nearly four hours to get the blaze under control and thick, black smoke 
could be seen billowing from the property at the height of the fire.

Due to her injuries, the 
toddler was later transferred to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she died the following day.

It comes exactly a year to the day that her baby brother Jake died suddenly from suspected cot death.

Shortly after Jake’s death at their former home in Llanelli, Wales last year, the family moved to the Carmarthen.

Friends in Llanelli had raised more than £300 towards a headstone for Jake last year, and described Miss Smith as ‘a great mum’.

Lisa Naether, who lives in the town, said news of the fire had come as a shock.

She said: ‘It was a total shock to hear, especially as it was the anniversary of her baby’s death.’

Tributes have been flooding in for the youngster and several of flowers and cards have been left outside the family home.

Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service confirmed fire chiefs had investigated the cause of the blaze but said no further comment could be made until police inquiries had finished.

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman confirmed the force’s investigation was continuing and said: ‘A woman in her twenties remains in hospital in a serious condition.

‘Tragically, her three-year-old daughter has now passed away in the Heath hospital, Cardiff.

‘Next of kin are being kept fully informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

‘Inquiries are continuing to establish the cause of the fire.’

An inquest into the toddler’s death is expected to be opened and adjourned today.
