A YouTube user fed up with midday boozy antics on his Manhattan street is on a mission to expose a bottomless brunch cocktail hotspot as a cesspool of drunken depravity.

ProblematicPranna has shared with the world video of the aftermath of bottomless mimosa and bloody mary brunch hotspot Pranna, where rowdy crowds of young drunk student types trip over themselves and into the Manhatta streets on weekend afternoons.

'For 30 minutes to an hour and a half, at times there are over 100 people on 28th street still partying, peeing, dancing, drinking, vomiting and bumping into people,' writes the fed up neighbor. 'It appears as though many people are too drunk.

The brunch spot is indeed known, if Yelp reviews are to be believed, as a sort of 'midday party.'

'Midday party --which YES, because why not!!!' wrote Yelper Juliette J. 'Good for releasing your secret inner ratch!...reckless crew required for maximum GREAT times!'

Photos from the inside of Pranna show a dance club-like atmosphere as daylight streams inside.

ProblematicPranna's video shows that the party doesn't seem to stop as revelers exit into the streets.

'Midday party --which YES, because why not!!!' wrote Yelper Juliette J about Pranna. 'Good for releasing your secret inner ratch!...reckless crew required for maximum GREAT times!'

This isn't the YouTube user's first foray into using incriminating video, reports New York Magazine, to shame Pranna into cutting diners off before they become too intoxicated.

Late last June, video taken by ProblematicPranna caught an NYU student named Gerry Shalam, who appeared quite drunk, claiming to be the son of a Manhattan real estate baron.

'My dad owns half of f***ing Manhattan,' he told the camera in a video that subsequently went viral.

Shalam's friends, meanwhile, stumble to the point of tipping over onto the pavement in the background as he demands the cameraman

According to the cameraman, Shalam and his friends had been eating at Pranna.
