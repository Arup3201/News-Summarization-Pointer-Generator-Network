Teenage girls who commit serious crimes will no longer be jailed under controversial plans to cut costs.

The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is axing all prison places for girls and will instead house them in secure training centres.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the move showed 'a deep lack of seriousness' in the Government's approach to tackling youth offending.

Soft justice? Teenage girls who commit serious crimes will be sent to secure training centres instead of jail under Government plans to save money

He told The Daily Telegraph: 'The Government are trumpeting their changes to youth justice as a toughening of the system. It is obvious that is far from it.

'We should not be closing down capacity, if anything we should be sentencing more seriously and maybe even opening more.'

A total of 41 places for girls will be closed at three prisons: Downview in Surrey, Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire and New Hall in west Yorkshire.

More than 300 places for young men at two prisons - Wetherby, west Yorkshire and Hindley, Greater Manchester - will also scrapped.

Phil Copple, the acting chief executive of the National Offender Management Service which runs prisons in England and Wales, said: 'The YJB make the decisions about which accommodation they need and have had to make difficult choices in the face of falling demand for places for young offenders and the need to reduce costs.'

He said a redundancy scheme was being set up for staff who were losing their jobs.

A National Offender Management Service spokesman said: 'The fall in the youth population has led to the Youth Justice Board’s decision to reduce the number of commissioned places for young offenders.

'The move of the remaining girls in the prison estate to secure training centres does not mean that they are being punished less severely.

'They will still be held securely, but will be held at the centres with a strong emphasis on their rehabilitation.'

The changes come after the Ministry of Justice announced plans in January to build Britain’s biggest prison while closing five older ones in a bid to save millions of pounds.

In addition to the new prison, which will hold 2,000 inmates, four so-called mini-jails will be opened, holding 250 inmates each.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – who has adopted a tough stance on law and order – insists that, overall, not a single jail place will be lost.

Mr Grayling’s predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, never recovered from allegations he was ‘soft on crime’ after closing prisons and reforming sentencing guidelines to reduce the number of people jailed.

During his two years at the Ministry of Justice, Mr Clarke closed six prisons in order to save money.
