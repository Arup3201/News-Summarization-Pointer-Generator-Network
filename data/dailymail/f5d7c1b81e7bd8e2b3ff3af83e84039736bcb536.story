An elderly husband and wife have been charged with murdering their spouses and two children and hiding the bodies more than 30 years ago - and then marrying each other and moving 1,100 miles away.

Officials said Monday that 71-year-old Gerald Uden and 74-year-old Alice
Louise Uden, who live in Chadwick, Missouri, face first-degree-murder charges in 
Wyoming - where their spouses disappeared.

The arrests indicate that investigators believe they have solved four decades-old murders in Wyoming - including the haunting disappearance of Gerald Uden's wife and his two adopted children in 1980.

Vanished: Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 12, right, disappeared in 1980 and have never been seen again. Now, their adoptive father is charged with murdering them

The crack in the case came when authorities recently found the body of Alice Louise Uden's ex-husband, Ronald Holtz, in an abandoned Wyoming mine.

Holtz, 25, was last seen in December 1974 in Sheridan, Wyoming.

The boys' mother, Virginia Uden, is also believed to have been killed by Gerald, according to authorities

Six years later, in September 1980, the wife of Gerald Uden disappeared from Lander, Wyoming, along with her two sons, age 10 and 12.

Uden had adopted the two boys but was not the biological father, according to ForTheLost.org, a website devoted to missing persons cases.

Virginia Uden and boys Reagan and Richard were last seen at Virginia's mother's house. They had left after a visited and were meeting Gerald to go hunting.

A few days later, Virginia's car was found vandalized and soaking with blood. It had been covered in pine boughs in an attempts to hide it.

Gerald and Alice Uden are in custody in Missouri while Wyoming authorities attempt to extradite them.

Authorities in Wyoming were not available on Monday to discuss the case. 

It is unknown how Holtz's body was found, nor how the discovery of his body led investigators to Alice Uden.

It is also unclear what linked Holtz's death to the disappearance of Virginia Uden and her sons six years later.
