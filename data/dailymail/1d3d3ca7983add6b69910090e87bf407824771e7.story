British drivers would have the cheapest petrol in western Europe if tax was not added by the Treasury, official figures reveal.

Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are lower than anywhere in the EU except Estonia, but when fuel duty and VAT are added the cost at the pump is among the highest.

With just weeks until the Budget, the revelation will pile pressure for fuel duty cuts on Chancellor George Osborne who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices.

Official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol in the UK has fallen to just 32.4p per litre, the second lowest in all of the EU

Tax adds another 76p per litre, making it the fifth highest behind the Netherlands, Italy, Malta and Greece

Total petrol prices have begun rising in recent weeks, after falling dramatically from £1.30 to £1.06 in the year to February.

Ministers including Mr Osborne and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander have repeatedly said the price on forecourts must fall to reflect the cheaper wholesale costs for fuel firms.

But official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol has fallen to just 32.4p per litre, the second lowest in all of the EU.

But tax adds another 76p per litre, making it the fifth highest behind the Netherlands, Italy, Malta and Greece.

It means tax makes up 70 per cent of the total price of a litre of fuel, the joint highest with the Netherlands.

By contrast, tax accounts for only 51 per cent in Bulgaria and 57 per cent in Hungary, Luxembourg and Lithuania.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'These numbers tell a revealing story. For all the Chancellor's calls on oil companies to cut the cost of petrol and diesel the person who has the biggest influence over pump prices is Mr Osborne himself.

'Despite recent freezes in fuel duty, more than two-thirds of what we pay on the forecourts goes to the Treasury.

'We agree with the Chancellor that the cost of fuel is a big burden for the nation's 37 million motorists but if he really wants to ease that burden then he could do so overnight by reducing fuel tax.'

Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK Campaign, said: 'For decades the highest fuel duty in Europe has held back the beneficial affects of having the lowest pre tax pump prices. 

'Since 2011, FairFuelUK has prevented £30bn of tax hikes that Labour had planned if they had been in Government. 

'Our haversack of empirical evidence endorsed by The Treasury shows that cutting duty will increase GDP, generate new jobs and lower inflation. 

'It's no coincidence that five years of frozen duty and recent historic falls in oil prices have given rise to UK's blossoming economy. 

'It's time that all parties recognise that lower pump prices are good for the hard pressed 32m motorists and businesses by generating other positive growth taxes through lower fuel duty levies. It's about motivating consumers not stifling the with crippling but essential costs. 

'FairFuelUK continues to call for a 3p duty cut in the Budget so the UK drops down Europe's League table of this punitive tax.'

The Treasury insisted that since 2011, the Government has scrapped the fuel duty escalator that would have increased fuel duty by 1 penny per litre above inflation every year.

Ministers claim that pump prices will be 18p per litre lower by the end of the parliament, compared to the Labour government's fuel duty plans.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have frozen fuel duty for the remainder of this parliament, resulting in the longest duty freeze in over 20 years. 

'Due to the Government's action on fuel duty since 2011, by the end of the parliament pump prices will be nearly 18 pence per litre lower than they would have been under previous fuel duty plans.

'This represents a saving of £10 for the typical motorist each time they fill up their tank.'
