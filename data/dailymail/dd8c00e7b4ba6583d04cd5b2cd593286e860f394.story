Scientists used to believe that Mercury permanently turned 'one face' towards the Sun - with one side scorchingly hot and the other cold. A Mercury 'day' was believed to be the same as the planet's year.

But radar scans of the planet revealed that this wasn't the case - the planet wobbles round three times for every two circuits it makes round the sun.

Why the planet had escaped the 'tidal locking' of the Sun's gravitational pull - the same force that makes our moon face one way towards the Earth - had been a puzzle. Now scientists have fingered a likely culprit - a huge asteroid.

Mercury, as seen from Mariner 10: Now scientists believe that the tiny planet's wobbly orbit could be due to impact with an asteroid big enough to leave a 'basin' in its surface

The tiny planet is so close to the sun that it should be tidally locked to the sun - such orbits are 'highly stable', say scientists.

Now scientists believe an asteroid impact may have 'pushed' the planet into its current wobbly orbit.

The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, says that the planet's unusual orbit could have been caused by an asteroid impact so huge that it left a basin in the planet's surface.

The scientists, led by Alexandre Correia, speculate that the wobble could be caused by 'large, basin-forming impact event' - potentially, the planet's odd orbit could be explained by hollows detected in its surface.

Mercury is the innermost planet in the solar system - and it would make sense for the tiny planet to be 'tidally locked' to the sun, with one 'day' being the same as the planet's 'year'. But it isn't - and scientists have been puzzled as to why

Nasa's messenger spacecraft is currently in orbit around the planet, and has already provided far 'fuller' scans of the surface, than the last visitor, Mariner 10, which flew past in 1975.

Mariner 10 only captured partial views of the surface.

Correia and her colleagues are hopeful that Messenger, which continues to orbit the planet, will unearth a likely crater that could explain why the planet orbits as it does.

The Messenger probe captured the first 'full day' image of Mercury's surface earlier this year - could one of the impact craters shown be the reason the planet 'wobbles' round the sun?
