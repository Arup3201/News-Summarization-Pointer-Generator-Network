Ahead of the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles this weekend, Ed Ashcroft takes a trip down memory lane to look back at 10 memorable contests staged on European soil.

Celtic Manor, Newport, Wales, 2010

Europe win 14 ½ - 13 ½ 

In what proved to be one of the most hotly contested Ryder Cups in recent memory, Europe claimed a dramatic triumph on the immortalised 'Magic Monday' – with drama only to be matched by the 'Miracle at Medinah' two years later. 

With the competition stretching beyond its usual three days due to the incessant Welsh rain, Graeme McDowell's 20ft birdie putt on the 16th, which led to a 3 and 1 triumph over Hunter Mahan, set up wild celebrations across the home continent.

K Club, County Kildare, Ireland, 2006

Europe win 18 ½ - 9 ½

While the emphatic European victory will live long in the record books, the 2006 K Club Ryder Cup will more likely be remembered for the emotional reception received by Darren Clarke.

His wife, Heather, had recently died of cancer and following an extended break from the game and a late Captain's pick – which fulfilled his dying wife's wish that he play in the Ryder Cup – he walked to the first tee on day one with most of the crowd in tears.

A 300-yard drive on the first set up a birdie which would lead to a one-up victory for himself and Lee Westwood over Chris DiMarco and Phil Mickelson, laying the foundation for a convincing European victory.

The win was greeted in much the same style with which Darren Clarke approached most aspects of his career – with a pint of Guinness (on the K Club balcony no less) and a smile. Even so, there was a tinge of disappointment for him on Monday morning. 

He said: 'I'm probably the most sober I've felt on a Monday after the Ryder Cup. I don't know why. It certainly wasn't for the lack of trying.'

Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, 2002

Europe win 15 ½ - 12 ½

The rescheduled 2002 tournament, which was suspended for a year after the 9/11 attacks in the previous September, returned once more to Belfry – for the fourth time since its debut in 1985 – and it once again proved a happy hunting ground for the home side. 

With the scores all tied going into the final day, Captain Sam Torrance's decision to place most of his key performers first, as opposed to opposite number Curtis Strange's tactics to delay them, proved decisive, swinging the momentum towards Europe early in the day and leading to a 15 ½ - 12 ½ triumph.

Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, 1989

Tied 14-14. Retained by Europe

With the USA looking to overcome two straight losses suffered in 1987 and 1985, the tensions were palpable. From the off Raymond Floyd, the US captain, declared his golfers 'the 12 greatest players in the world.' 

Pre-match sparring was then transferred to on-course conflict, as the notorious Azinger-Ballesteros feud was ignited for the first time at a Ryder Cup, beginning with Paul Azinger challenging Seve Ballesteros' attempts to replace a scuffed ball, and culminating with Ballesteros challenging Azinger's drop on the 18th.

Europe wins 16 ½ - 11 ½

Sam Torrance's stout putt on the 18th green, after Andy North had driven into the water with his second shot, confirmed European victory and brought to an end 28 years of Ryder Cup hurt as American supremacy over the tournament was finally broken.

Walton Heath, Surrey, England, 1981

USA win 18 ½ - 9 ½

Although this was the first match on European soil to include continental Europe, it was less than a triumph for the home team. 

Facing a US side with 36 majors between them – 36 more than the European team had mustered – the thunderstorms on day one were to be an ominous sign for the Europeans, as they were washed away by the largest margin ever on British soil, 18 ½ - 9 ½.

Royal Birkdale, Southport, England, 1969

Tied 16-16. Retained by the USA

Following disastrous 23 ½ - 8 ½, 19 ½ - 12 ½ and 23 – 9 losses in the previous three Ryder Cups, 1969 at Royal Birkdale was welcomingly competitive – as well as memorable.

Going down to the last hole, Jack Nicklaus sunk a four foot putt, leaving Tony Jacklin to putt for a tie. Yet in a remarkable demonstration of sporting spirit, Nicklaus gave Jacklin the putt, saying 'I don't think you would have missed that Tony, but I didn't want to give you the chance.'

Royal Lytham and St. Annes, Lancashire, England, 1961

USA win 14 ½ - 9 ½

In this Ryder Cup, the first to be played on an Open Championship golf course, 10 of the matches went to the 18th green providing an exhibition of intense golf for the eager 35,000 on-lookers enjoying the October sun at the Royal Lytham and St Annes course. 

Yet it was to prove more significant as a landmark, as it became the final Ryder Cup to be played out in a two-day format, before the rule changes were introduced.

Southport and Ainsdale, Southport, England, 1933

Great Britain and Ireland win 5 ½ - 6 ½

The moment when Syd Easterbrook overcame Denny Shute in dramatic fashion on the 18th green – two-putting from 30ft to Shute's three-putt – was to live rather longer than expected in the British golfing memory. 

Although unbelievable at the time, Great Britain and Ireland would not win again until Lindrick in 1957, marking the longest era of American golfing supremacy in the Ryder Cup.

Wentworth, Surrey, England, 1926 – First unofficial Ryder Cup

Great Britain and Ireland win 13 – 1

The match played out between a rag-tag American team and their professional counterparts in 1926 was to initiate a sporting tradition that would extend to the present day. 

As early as September 1920, Golf Illustrated had requested that the PGA of America send 12 golfers to play their British counterparts at Gleneagles as a warm up before the British Open. 

Although an international amateur competition between the two nations was established after the Gleneagles tournament in 1922, it was not until Wentworth in 1926 that the idea of a Professional American-British tournament began to gather pace.

While called the 'Ryder Cup' in the media due to Samuel Ryder's contribution of a £250 trophy, however, the decision was quickly made that this could not count as an official competition. For starters, the scrappy organisation had put America at a disadvantage, and the team had been put together by Walter Hagan rather than the American PGA.

Nevertheless, Samuel Ryder's desire to 'do this again' following the 13-1 British victory was to be fulfilled in triumphant style, starting with the first official, and formally organized, Ryder Cup at the Worcester Country Club in 1927. With that, a sporting classic was born.
