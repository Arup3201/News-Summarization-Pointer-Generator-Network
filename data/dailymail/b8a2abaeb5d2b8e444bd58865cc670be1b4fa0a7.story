Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez has been granted permission to transfer to a jail closer to Boston for easier access to his lawyers, a judge ruled Monday.

The accused triple murderer was allowed the move to provide him with easier access to his lawyers as he awaits multiple murder trials.

Hernandez smiled while in court for the hearing, which addressed mostly procedural issues, and also mouthed messages to his family as he arrived.

His mother and brother were among those in court, as were family members of Odin Lloyd, the 27-year-old Boston semi-professional football player Hernandez is accused of killing in June 2013.

Hernandez is also charged in Boston in the 2012 killings of two men. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.

Prosecutors did not object to moving Hernandez from the Bristol County House of Correction in Dartmouth, which is about an hour and 20 minutes' drive south of Boston, but they shot down defense lawyers' claims that the former tight end's privacy and due process rights were violated by the jail administrator.

Judge Susan Garsh ordered the move without addressing his privacy concerns.

It is not clear when Hernandez will be moved or where he will be going. Garsh did not specify a jail when she approved the request, other than saying it should be closer to Boston, such as in Suffolk County.

Hernandez would be moved back to Bristol County if the Lloyd case goes to trial, she added.

Garsh also said she was concerned that a tentative trial date of Oct. 6 was not realistic given the amount of evidence and additional motions she anticipates will be filed.

One of Hernandez's lawyers, James Sultan, told her he anticipated that it was possible they would file for a change of venue.

'We're not prepared to do that now,' he said. 'That may well be coming.'

When asked outside court for his thoughts on a possible venue change, District Attorney Sam Sutter would say only that it would be debated, and it did not sound as if that was something the judge was considering.

Garsh asked both sides to get back to her with their thoughts on whether Oct. 6 is a realistic trial date. She set the next hearing for Aug. 11.
