The six maids of honour who flanked Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her Coronation on 2 June 1953 became notorious in their own right when their names were announced as the women selected to  follow the princess down Westminster Abbey to be crowned the new Queen of England.

Now, 60 years on the ladies in waiting have spoken about the historic day, with five of the women reuniting to share their memories of the spectacular event.

Lady Rosemary Muir, Lady Anne Glenconner, Lady Moyra Campbell, Lady Mary Russell, Lady Jane Rayne and Baroness Willoughby de Eresby were intensely scrutinised by the young women and Press of the day.

Such was the attention lavished upon the women Lady Glenconner even claimed they were seen as the Spice Girls of their time.

Lady Anne, then aged just 20, recalls the pressures upon the women on the day in the forthcoming radio programme The Reunion, presented by Sue McGregor and set to be broadcast this Sunday on Radio 4.

Lady Anne will be joined by all of her fellow maids of honour with the exception of Baroness Willoughby de Eresby.

Lady Anne also cheekily recalls how, in the recess in the ceremony, which was attended by no fewer than 8,251 people, the Archbishop of Canterbury brought out a hip flask and asked if they wanted a sip of brandy.

Lady Glenconner divulges how the Queen, then aged 27, was assisted in getting dressed by Lord Cholmondeley who was the Lord Great Chamberlain at the time.

She recalls how she felt it was 'awful' for the Queen to have been dressed by the Marquess of Cholmondeley, with what she said were his 'heavy fingers going down her spine'.

The programme is full of fascinating memories by the women, the oldest of whom was only 23 when they undertook the mammoth responsibility of taking part in the Coronation.

The ceremony was attended by over 8,000 people and last 3 hours, prompting the maids of honour to be given smelling salts to hide in their gloves in case they felt faint

The Coronation is incredibly rich in ceremonial and historical significance and being part of it was a huge responsibility for the six young women, the youngest of whom was just 19, and the eldest only 23

All five recall how, just before they entered the Abbey for their slow process to the alter, the Queen, then aged 25, paused and, in recognition of the life changing event, simply asked them: ‘Ready girls?’

Lady Moyra Campbell tells how Prince Charles was extremely proud he had been allowed to use his father’s hair lotion - and asked the ladies to smell his hair.

The prince created history when, aged just four, he became the first child to witness his mother's coronation as Sovereign.

All the women had a small vial of smelling salts concealed in their gloves in case they felt faint during the ceremony and Lady Jane Rayne, who was then Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 20, recalls how she was forced to use hers to prevent Lady Anne from keeling over.

Lady Rosemary Muir, who was 23 on the day, was not so lucky, revealing how when the Archbishop shook her hand to greet her, he accidently crushed the vial, releasing ‘the most terrible smell of ammonia’ from her hand.

The youngest maid of honour was Lady Mary Russell who was 19 on 2 June 1953, she recalls: ‘It was an incredible moment, but all I could think about was how heavy the embroidery felt.’ 

The young women were responsible for carefully lifting and unfolding the princess's’ 21 foot train as she alighted from the magnificent Gold State Coach.

Following the tradition set by Queen 
Victoria, Elizabeth chose to have ladies in waiting rather than page 
boys to carry her train in the ceremony 

Made
 of heavy embroidered velvet with a fur trim, the stunning train was by 
no means light, and had to be held using six specially designed silk 
handles discreetly sewn into the underside of the train.
