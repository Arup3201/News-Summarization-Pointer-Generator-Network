A prosthetic technology company has created a hand which is so advanced it can be controlled using a smartphone app.

Touch Bionics’ i-limb ultra revolution prosthetic hand also features a rotating thumb, five individually powered fingers, a rotatable wrist and aluminium chassis.

The company claims that this is the most dextrous prosthetic hand ever made.

A prosthetic technology company called Touch Bionics has created a hand which is so advanced it can be controlled using a smartphone app, pictured

The hand can be controlled using an app but it can also pick up on muscle signals

The wearer of the hand can use an app to choose one of 24 different grips.

Alternatively, the hand can be controlled by muscle signals.

Electrodes in the wrist pick up electrical impulses created by contracting muscles and these are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand.

The computer then moves the hand into any of a series of pre-set patterns.

It is also the first upper limb prosthesis to be created which can be controlled using an app.

It comes with an iOS app that allows the user to control the hand’s grip using their smartphone.

The app means that the wearer can choose from 24 different grips at the touch of a button.

The app can also offers training on how to best use the device and can diagnose problems with it.

However, it is not only controllable using an app – it also uses muscle signals to shift into a series of pre-set patterns.

It achieves this by using electrodes in the wrist to pick up electrical impulses created by contracting muscles, which are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand.

Each of the fingers bends at the joints and can be adapted to fit around any shape of object that the owner wants to grasp.

It can also be used for everything from typing to tying shoe laces.

It comes in black or neutral, can automatically return to a natural position after a period of inactivity and is powered by a battery.

The device is so technical that users have to undergo rigorous training to get the most out of it.

The Touch Bionics hand, pictured, grips and ties shoe laces. The Livingston-based firm said it has seen a surge in sales recently as the technology becomes more affordable and mainstream. The price of the hand varies depending on the size and requirements
