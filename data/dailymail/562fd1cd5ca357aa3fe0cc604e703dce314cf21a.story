Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England  

True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce

Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016

If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich then he’s a bottle job.

Ozil seems to have achieved the impossible by joining a top club, winning a World Cup, then seeing his market value slide dramatically. That’s a hell of an effort.

Is it all his fault? Probably not, although he has done nothing to address how lightweight he is. He is quite literally a pushover in the Premier League. Not all small players are so easily shoved aside – look at Lionel Messi.

But others don’t help him.

The apologists among the Arsenal fans who talk about secondary assists, and Ozil’s so-called brilliant pass earlier in the move – these people are making stuff up to try to make him look better than he is. 

Just tell the truth chaps – he’s been a massive disappointment. He’s a big player who should be having a direct impact on games.

Mesut Ozil has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich after just over a year at Arsenal 

Ozil, brought to his knees against Chelsea, has been accused of being too lightweight for the Premier League 

Arsene Wenger says you need to watch him for 90 minutes in the flesh to properly make a judgement. Well I have done – on more than one occasion this season – and he’s still lightweight with minimal contribution. 

I also saw a manager who refused to substitute a player who was having little or no impact on the game. Stubbornness or stupidity? You decide.

And then we come to how Wenger uses Ozil. He puts him out wide. Most Arsenal fans will tell you his best position is in the No 10 role behind Danny Welbeck. 

They don’t get paid £8m a year so how come he can’t see it, and when he has played the Germany man there how come it doesn’t work as effectively and regularly as it should?

Arsene Wenger says you need to watch Ozil for 90 minutes to see his full contribution - and it's still not great 

Lionel Messi, in action against Rayo Vallecano, is a small player but is not considered a push-over, unlike Ozil

It’s easy for opponents to bully Ozil. There is no Patrick Vieira or Gilberto Silva at Arsenal these days – nobody to protect a player like him. That's a massive oversight from Wenger, whose squad-building powers are at their weakest right now.

But at the end of the analysis and debate about Ozil you have to look at the player himself. Has he done enough? Has he made himself ready for the Premier League?

Has he adapted to the pace and power of the game? Has he shown any signs of addressing why he has such little direct impact on games?

Gilberto Silva and Patrick Vieira would have been able to protect Ozil when they were playing

The Xbox managers will throw in their stats about assists here, but I’m talking about coming away from a game and thinking: ‘Ozil was head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch, that’s why he cost £42.5m.’ 

How many times have you done that?

Blame Wenger, blame the apologists, blame his team-mates – blame whoever. Ultimately the player has got to look at himself. 

If he slips off to Bayern Munich for a cut-price fee can he honestly look at himself in the mirror and say he did his best for Arsenal? Of course not.
