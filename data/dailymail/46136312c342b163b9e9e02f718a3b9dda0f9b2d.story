Crook: Jonathan Hicks, 48, stole almost £28,000 while his 71-year-old father, Leonard, was recovering from having his leg amputated

An elderly man who spent six months in hospital after having his leg amputated was discharged to find his son had spent 50 years' worth of his life savings.

Jonathan Hicks, 48, from Newquay, Cornwall, stole almost £28,000 while his Swansea-based 71-year-old father, Leonard, was recovering from losing his leg.

He spent the cash on shopping sprees and a holiday to Egypt, only stopping when the cash ran out - leaving the elder Mr Hicks overdrawn for the first time in his life.

A court heard the pensioner almost had a heart attack when he discovered his savings had been plundered.

Hicks, who was first arrested in December 2013 but initially tried to escape justice by fleeing to Cyprus, was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting theft.

It took him just six months to blow the nest egg his father had saved up over more than 50 years - taking out the cash in 177 secret withdrawals.

Prosecutor Frank Phillips told the court that Mr Hicks's right leg was amputated in January 2013 and the pensioner was kept in hospital until July due to complications.

His son secretly moved into his home in Swansea, South Wales, while he was in hospital, the court heard.

'The pensioner mentioned his bank card PIN number while he was quite agitated during a visit by his son,' Mr Phillips was quoted as telling the court by Wales News Service. 'Hicks then began siphoning off the cash, having located his father's bank card.

'He told his brothers he had withdrawn around £27,000 and said that the social services would take the money and sell his house to pay for care home costs.'

After Mr Hicks' release from hospital, his other son Michael took him in a wheelchair to a local branch of Lloyds TSB - where he found he was £300 in the red.

Mr Phillips said: 'When he was told that he was overdrawn his son Michael described him as being in a hell of a state.

'He was so upset his son thought that he was going to have a heart attack.'

Police were called in to find the younger Hicks had moved back to Newquay, Cornwall. Swansea Crown Court heard he initially tried to blame his brothers and a sister for stealing the cash.

But police discovered cash was spent on a holiday to Egypt - with £1,000 changed up for spending money along with car expenses.

Hicks was arrested in December 2013. He was released on police bail and fled abroad to Cyprus, but was arrested again when he returned to Britain for the funeral of his step-son.

Andrew Evans, defending, said Hicks would 'turn back the clock' if he could.

'The defendant acknowledges that his actions between January and July 2013 were deplorable to say the least,' Mr Evans told the court.

'This was a significant gross breach of trust against a person who, he has to concede, was particularly vulnerable at the time.'

Judge Keith Thomas heard Hicks had a history of dishonesty including a conviction in 2007 for money laundering and attempting to obtain money by deception.

Sending Hicks to prison, the judge said: 'You plundered your father's bank account at the time when he was extremely vulnerable.

'He was in need of care rather than the dishonest actions that you indulged in.'
