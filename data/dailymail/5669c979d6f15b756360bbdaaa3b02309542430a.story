Gordon Banks has hailed the performances of goalkeepers at this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Banks, who was in goal for England's 1966 triumph, is enjoying the recognition that his peers are getting in South America.

The 76-year-old cited the improvements made by goalkeepers at this World Cup in comparison to four years ago in South Africa when many stuggled to deal with the much-maligned Jubulani football.

Safe hands: Tim Howard gained many plaudits for his goalkeeping performances for the USA in Brazil

Beaten away: Tim Krul proved Holland's quarter-final shootout hero against Costa Rica saving two penalties

‘It has been a great World Cup for goalkeepers and it’s nice to see so many get recognition this year,' the Football Pools ambassador said.

'I don’t think the balls are moving round as much as they have done in recent tournaments so the keepers can save shots properly rather than just having to parry them.

'There have been some wonderful displays, Tim Howard who I have always rated highly, made over a dozen good saves versus Germany and there was the Mexican keeper [Guillermo] Ochoa who made a handful of saves against Brazil including one which was compared to my effort against Pele back in 1970.'

Banks, who won 73 international caps for the Three Lions, also higlighted the performances of Julio Cesar and Tim Krul who have caught his eye.

Cesar has started every game for Brazil despite falling behind club team-mate Rob Green in the QPR pecking order, while Krul proved Holland's hero in their quarter-final penalty shootout win against Costa Rica - coming on as an extra-time substitute before saving two spot-kicks.

'Brazil’s Julio Cesar, who is not even first choice for QPR has been playing very well and helped beat Chile on penalties in the last sixteen,' he added.

'Then there was Tim Krul’s performance for Holland versus Costa Rica. I have never seen anything like that – a keeper coming on for the shootout - but it clearly worked and whether it was mind games for the players when the substitution was made or when he was shouting at the penalty players before they took their kick, it worked!'

All smiles: Julio Cesar has been one of Brazil's star performers in their run to the semi-finals of the World Cup
