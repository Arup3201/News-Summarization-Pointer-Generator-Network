NBA star Chris Paul has criticized one of the league's two female referees after she slapped him with a technical foul following an on-pitch dispute.

The Clippers All-Star guard was pulled up by Lauren Holtkamp while attempting to inbound the ball quickly following a Cleveland free throw in his side's 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers on Thursday night.

But he challenged the referee to explain her move after he was given a technical foul - one of five given to Los Angeles during the game.

 After the game Paul said: 'The tech I got was ridiculous. That's terrible. There's no way that can be a technical. We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court.

'When we did that, she said, "Uh-uh"' I said, "Why uh-uh?" and she gave me a technical. That's ridiculous. If that's the case, this might not be for her.'

The technical foul came in the third quarter from Holtkamp, who worked with officials Ken Mauer and Eric Lewis. Los Angeles was given five technicals in total during the game — four in the third quarter, three of them in a 52-second span.

Paul got his technical with 10 minutes 17 seconds left in the third. Following a free throw by Cleveland, the Clippers were attempting to inbound the ball quickly when Holtkamp, one of two active female officials in the NBA, stepped in.

Clippers coach Doc Rivers also received a technical and forward Matt Barnes was ejected in the third by Lewis after getting his second 'T.' 

Barnes got tangled up with Cavaliers forward Kevin Love, shoved him and got the technical. He got the second one when he complained about teammate Jamal Crawford getting called for a charging foul and told Lewis, 'Don't give them the game.'

Barnes is tied for the league lead with 11 technicals and has been ejected twice.

'It keeps happening,' Barnes said. 'Some of these I earn, some of them I don't.'
