A bereft mother says she is outraged that a bungling doctor who sent her sick toddler home from hospital three days before he died of dehydration and kidney failure is allowed to carry on working.

Harry Connolly, 19 months, was admitted to hospital in April 2011 with sickness, diarrhoea and lethargy.

But, despite his mother Lucy's concerns about her son's condition, paediatrician Dr Tasnim Arif told Mrs Connolly, 32, she should take her son home.

Three days later, his devastated father Ray, 47, found the youngster lifeless in his cot.

Furious: Ray Connolly, 47, and his wife Lucy, 32, from Northampton, are outraged that the doctor who sent home their sick toddler from hospital three days before he died  has been allowed to carry on working

Tragic: Harry Connolly, 19 months, was found dead in his cot by his father three days after being sent home from Northampton General Hospital. He died of dehydration and kidney failure, caused by an inflamed colon

Yesterday, a tribunal brought by the General Medical Council found Dr Arif guilty of a series of failings, including failing to carry out vital checks before discharging Harry.

But, despite objections from the GMC, the tribunal ruled that Dr Arif was still fit to practise, after clearing her of other charges. They also refused a plea from the GMC to put a warning on Dr Arif's file.

Mrs Connolly, from Delapre, Northampton, today branded Dr Arif a 'danger to other patients' and accused the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service of 'failing to protect the public'.

She told MailOnline: 'I believe Harry would still be alive if the doctor had listened to me. I feel it is nothing short of criminal. The worst part is that these errors, which the hearing found had taken place, killed my son.'

At an inquest that heard evidence from several practitioners involved in Harry's care, Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by staff at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service.

Mrs Pember said that, had Harry remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan, his chances of survival would have been 'enhanced'.

But she said she did not feel there had been a 'gross failure' to provide basic medical attention.

Recording a narrative verdict, she said: 'Windows of opportunity to treat Harry were lost. These were on the first occasion he was discharged from NGH, the second time when he was only seen for a few hours and when he was seen at an out-of-hours service.

'Had Harry remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan, his chances of survival would have been enhanced.'  

The tribunal heard Dr  Arif should have taken more care in assessing  Harry after he was readmitted to hospital

An investigation by the hospital also found that key procedures had not been carried out. After the inquest, the trust apologised to the Connolly family 'for the failings identified by the coroner in the care of their son'. 

But although Mrs Connolly accepted the hospital's apology, she said she is furious about the tribunal's decision.

'Go and get me 100,000 people off the street, tell them Harry's story and ask if they would be happy for this doctor to treat their child,' she said. 

The tribunal said Dr Tasnim Arif's (pictured) fitness to practise was not impaired because it did not amount to misconduct

'I am furious, I can't explain how angry I am. To let her walk away without even a warning is just criminal. God help any child that comes into her care.' 

Dr Arif faced a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester, accused of allowing her care of Harry to fall ‘seriously below’ what was expected.

At the hearing, Dr Arif, who was then a fourth-year specialist trainee paediatric registrar, admitted failing to record the frequency, quantity and volume of Harry’s passage of stool and vomit and to then seek further clarification over these issues. 

The medic also confessed to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged.

But she denied a number of other accusations, including that she had failed to adequately assess Harry's symptoms. 

The hearing had heard how Harry fell ill at his home on April 23, 2011 and was referred to Northampton General Hospital by the family GP three days later.

He was then examined by paediatrician Dr Farhana Shamim, who said he was not dehydrated, but recommended that he be given Dioralyte, a rehydration treatment to boost salt and sugar levels.

The following morning, he was discharged by Dr Ayevbekpen Omorgie, who said the parents could have a ‘48-hour open access’ to the ward, meaning he would not need a referral to be seen again, the hearing was told. 

Then, at around 3.30pm on 28 April, Harry was brought back to hospital by his mother after his parents felt his condition had deteriorated. It was the decisions made on this visit which were the subject of the hearing. 

The GMC had said that Dr Arif should have exercised 'a greater degree of caution when deciding the appropriate course of action' towards Harry and when discharging him.

They argued that the standard of care provided by Dr Arif 'fell seriously below that expected of a registrar'. 

Mrs Connolly said: 'Harry had diarrhoea and had slept around the clock for days, which was so strange because he never slept. It got to the point where he could barely hold his own head up.

'When we saw Dr Arif, my words to her were: "He's got really bad diarrhoea, he cannot sustain this, or he is going to become dehydrated". But she said she was absolutely sure he wasn't dehydrated.'

The panel heard that Dr Arif did not think Harry was dehydrated before she discharged him at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of 28 April.

But the next day Harry’s condition had deteriorated again, to such an extent that his parents described him as ‘lifeless’.

Grandmother Val Faulkner rang the hospital, but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their GP or accident and emergency, the tribunal was told. 

After phoning the GP out-of-hours service, the family spoke to Dr Mary McCracken who said they should bring him in to the out-of-hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration.

At the out-of-hours service, Harry was examined by Dr Aboo Thamby who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted.

As he continued to be unwell, Mr and Mrs Connolly moved Harry's cot into their bedroom.

But in the early hours of May 1, 2011, when Mr Connolly got up to check on his son, he found his son had died. 

The hearing began in August but was adjourned, before being concluded this week. 

It was found that Dr Arif had failed to adequately assess or record whether Harry was ‘well hydrated’ or ‘not well hydrated' and also failed to record that Harry was lethargic when taking his history.

She was also found guilty of failing to arrange for a longer period of observation and assessment of Harry’s hydration status 

But she was cleared of failing to record the right clinical procedures when assessing Harry's hydration, including abnormalities in his respiratory rate and pulse rate.

She was also cleared of failing to arrange for the duty consultant to review Harry's status and carrying out blood tests requested by the duty consultant.   

Despite the 'multiple failings' proved against her, the panel found that Dr Arif's fitness to practise was not impaired because her behaviour did not constitute misconduct. 

The GMC then asked for a warning to be put on her registration, which was also refused, meaning Dr Arif is free to carry on working unrestricted.

The panel said Dr Arif had demonstrated 'genuine insight' into the level of failings and also believed the incident was isolated 'in an otherwise unblemished career'.

It added there were no indicators to suggest the doctor's failings would be repeated.

Last year the tribunal heard she was working on the children's oncology unit at a hospital in Nottingham.

Mrs Connolly said: 'It was not just her decisions that led to my son's death - it was a catalogue of errors. But Dr Arif made some really significant decisions.

'If she was a doctor that had slept with a patient, then she would have been struck off yesterday. I'm not saying doctors should go around sleeping with patients, but what is more serious: that, or a child needlessly dying?'

She added: 'It does not matter if it was an isolated incident. If I knocked someone over in my car tomorrow, I would probably be jailed for it, even if I didn't mean to do it.'

Mrs Connolly said she is determined to keep fighting and has been talking to a company about a private prosecution.

She said: 'I can't change what happened. But I can ensure it does not happen needlessly again. If I don't keep fighting, I'm sure it will happen again - my heart says it will. 

'If there is an avenue to go down, we will go down it. I am not a NHS basher, they do a great job and there are far more good doctors than bad. But, when the bad ones do something wrong, why do we let them get away with it? Why can't we just say when they get it wrong?'
