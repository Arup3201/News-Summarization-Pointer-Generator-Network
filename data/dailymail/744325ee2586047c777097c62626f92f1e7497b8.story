Sunderland have announced the signing of midfielder Jack Rodwell from Manchester City for £10million.

Despite City’s lack of homegrown talent, Rodwell was allowed to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer and has signed a five-year deal. The fee could rise to over £13m with add ons.

Rodwell was at Sunderland's training ground on Monday and has now completed his move.

Rodwell was at one time viewed as one of the brightest young England hopes after making his debut for Everton at the age of 16 in 2007.

He became a regular for Everton, making 109 appearances before joining City for £12m in the summer of 2012 despite missing out on Euro 2012 due to a hamstring injury.

His career at the Etihad stalled however, not helped by further injury problems, and he made only seven Premier League starts during his time at City.

He will not be the first player to leave City in order to attempt to resurrect a career at Sunderland - winger Adam Johnson made the same switch in 2012 with notable success, while Joe Hart's understudy Costel Pantilimon has followed this summer.

However Johnson claimed last season it was almost impossible for players not belonging to the eight leading Premier League clubs to break into Roy Hodgson's England squad ahead of the World Cup.
