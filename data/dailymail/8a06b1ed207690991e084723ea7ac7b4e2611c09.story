Wigan have signed Oriol Riera from Osasuna for Â£2million after the 28-year-old striker agreed a three-year deal.

The 27-year-old, who began his career with Barcelona's B team, is Uwe Rosler's first signing of the summer.

Riera underwent a medical at the DW Stadium on Saturday and will join the Championship side, subject to international clearance.

'He netted the majority of the goals for Osasuna last season and shone out in a difficult season for the club' Rosler told the club's website.

'It was a complicated transfer and the chairman played a crucial role in getting the deal over the line.

'I think our fans will like him. He is very direct and physical, good in the air, a real worker but also has an eye for goal scoring the majority of his goals inside the box.

Pleased: Rosler has praised the club's chairman for getting the Riera deal pushed through

'He has attracted the attention of many clubs and we are delighted he has agreed to join us.

'He is in the prime of his career and is physically and mentally ready to take on the challenge of coming to England. He is definitely the type of player we have been missing in our squad.

'It was a complicated transfer and the chairman played a crucial role in getting the deal over the line.

'He is a proven goalscorer and we have got him at the right price and within our current wage structure in the Championship.'
