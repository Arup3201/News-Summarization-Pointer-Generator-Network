Heartless thieves stole money from a family during a car boot sale that was raising money to help their 18-month-old baby get vital treatment for a spine condition.

Jamie Cummings from Cardiff was recently diagnosed with scoliosis which causes the curvature of the spine.

His family have been busy trying to raise up to £40,000 in case he needs treatment before the recommended age of two-years-old.

Jamie Cummings has been diagnosed with scoliosis at just 18-months-old and his family are aiming to raise £40,000 for surgery. He is pictured here with his father  Matthew Cummings and mother Ellie Griffiths

They organised a stall at a car boot sale at Bessemer Road in Grangetown, Cardiff,  selling items which had been donated to them.

But thieves managed to get into their locked car through a window which was slightly ajar, grabbed the float money and took some of the morning's takings which were in the glove compartment.

Jamie's aunt, Nicola Wheten, 31, said: 'We are absolutely gutted, we're so devastated.' 

'It was probably between £50 and £100. We had about £50 in change which we took ourselves.'

'Everyone has been so supportive. The community we live in is very good.'

They did raise some money after the theft but failed to cover their outgoings.

Ms Wheten said doctors did not initially think the curve in Jamie's back was skeletal but when physiotherapy showed no improvement and the curve got worse the scoliosis diagnosis was made.

'It's sort of all happened within the last month,' said Ms Wheten.

She said that since then the family, including Jamie's father Matthew and mother Ellie Griffiths from Llanrumney, have been fundraising in case they have to pay for treatment.

They had already been to two car boot sales and organised fun days and raffles - raising almost £3,000 so far.

'It's just a lot of hard work and it's just frustrating,' said Ms Wheten.

She said: 'He's actually got his MRI next week and after that we can book the appointment at Great Ormond Street in London to find out what kind of treatment can be offered.' 

Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine to the sides.

It does not usually cause noticeable symptoms in children other than affecting the appearance of the back.

Physical signs of scoliosis may include:

Usually only adults with scoliosis experience back pain.
