Though Yankees player Derek Jeter's love life typically places him in the gossip columns, on Thursday it seemed that the baseball star's personal issues had taken a bizarre twist - thanks to unknown web hackers.

The Facebook page for Jeter's team posted a surprising announcement that the famed shortstop would be benched for the rest of the season because of a sex change operation.

'We regret to inform our fans that Derek Jeter will miss the rest of the season with sexual reassignment surgery,' the post began.

Not on the bench: Derek Jeter was the subject of a Facebook hacking on Thursday

Fictitious announcement: The hacked post was live around 4pm on Thursday on the Yankees official Facebook page

As if the announcement did not immediately ring true to fans, the second line was sure to catch their attention as it alleged that Jeter would honor a Yankee great in doing so.

'He promises to come back stronger than ever in 2013 as Minnie Mantlez,' the post read, referring to the legendary center fielder Mickey Mantle.

The New York Daily News explained that while the team spokesmen have not made any statements about the hacking, they are not the ones responsible for the site.

The official Facebook pages for all professional baseball teams are managed by MLB Advanced Media.

'For a brief moment today, a few MLB Club Facebook accounts were hacked and inappropriate material was briefly on display from those Clubs' pages on Facebook,' the company's statement read.

'MLB Advanced Media oversees these Facebook pages on behalf of the Clubs and regrets this occurrence.'

Political postings: Nine different baseball teams had their Facebook pages hacked, including the President's favorite Chicago White Sox

Picking sides: The White Sox prankster favored Romney (left) over Obama (right)

Jeter was not the only target of the hacker, as the Facebook pages of the San Francisco Giants, Washington Redskins, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Atlanta Braves, and both the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox also had inappropriate postings on Thursday.

For the Chicago teams, hackers turned their attentions to high-profile supporters.

The Cubs page said bluntly 'F*** Bill Murray', a reference to the Holywood star who is one of the perenially struggling team's most famous fans.

The posting on the Sox page turned political, as Deadspin reported that it read 'Everyone knows President Obama is a die hard ChiSox Fan. Unfortunately, we're voting for Romney. #MuslimPresident'.

Offensive: The Padres posting singled out the handicapped fans of the baseball team

Dangerous: The youngsters planning to attend Thursday's Marlins game had hopes dashed that they would be able to take home rescued fighting pitbulls

The Miami Marlins' hacked post promised that children who planned to attend tonight's games would be awarded a 'free rescued fighting Pitbull courtesy of the Dade County Animal Rescue League'.

While the hacking may have shattered the hopes of many children, the posting for the San Diego Padres offended many of their audience members by saying that handicapped individuals were 'STRONGLY DISCOURAGED' from attending their games.

So far, nine teams have announced that their pages were hacked.
