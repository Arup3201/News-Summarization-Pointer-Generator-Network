Support for the UK Independence Party has grown with two opinion polls giving the party record levels of support.

An Opinium poll put Nigel Farage's party on 20 per cent, while a ComRes survey put them on 19 per cent.

The ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday found support for Nigel Farage's party was up four per cent since the last survey a month ago, with Labour down three points to 35 per cent, the Conservatives down one to 29 per cent and the Liberal Democrats were unchanged on eight per cent.

Farage has no need to hold recruitment signs (pic right) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support. He appeared on last Sunday's Andrew Marr in a discussion about an EU referendum and his party's supporters

Despite a week of controversy, in 
which UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Edinburgh and was trapped in a pub
by angry protestors, public backing for the party has never been 
higher.

The UK Independence
Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him were the 
‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda.

However,
poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted 
'racist scumbag' and 'scum' at the leader, who has begun to pose a real 
threat as a major political party.

The Opinium poll for the Observer put Labour on 37 per cent, Tories on 27 per cent and the Lib Dems on seven per cent.

According to the ComRes study 46 per cent of Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a referendum now, compared with 24 per cent who would stay in. But if some powers were returned to the UK from Brussels 43 per cent would vote to remain in the EU, with just 24 per cent determined to see Britain leave.

Farage's popularity was not mirrored in Edinburgh, where he said 'Scottish nationalists are Fascist scum'

Results show that the UKIP leader's image is appealing to the public. Tory council leader Keith Mitchell said Mr Farage 'uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives'

The poll found just 26 per cent said David Cameron was a good prime minister, a record low in ComRes studies, while 31 per cent believed Ed Miliband was performing well as Labour leader, a new high.

The ComRes survey also revealed that 57 per cent of voters believed Mr Cameron's party was more divided over Europe than it was under Sir John Major, with 14 per cent disagreeing.

But there was some comfort for the Prime Minister, with 49 per cent of voters saying the offer of a European referendum would be important to them at the next general election, with 27 per cent disagreeing.

And 32 per cent believed Mr Cameron would make the best prime minister of the party leaders, with 24 per cent opting for Mr Miliband.

Labour former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson today attacked the 'UK isolation party' and the 'provisional wing' of the Conservatives for forcing Mr Cameron into making his referendum promise.

He said leaving the EU would be a 'great setback economically for Britain' and warned that an in/out referendum would be a 'lottery' which could result in the UK severing ties with Brussels.

He told the Andrew Marr Show: 'The UK isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservative Party are operating a Sopranos-style protection racket inside the Conservative Party.'

He added: 'They are saying do what we want, give us what we are demanding or we are going to burn your home down.

'In my view the Prime Minister has got to say enough is enough, you guys have got to clear off, take your tanks off my lawn, I am going to lead this party and govern this country in the way that serves its true economic national interest and I'm going to do so without being bullied around by a bunch of people whose only interest is to be separate from Europe but not to create the prosperity for Britain and the trade and other economic opportunities by staying within Europe and its single market.'

He said Labour was right not to offer an in/out vote 'just for the sake of having a referendum'.

On today’s Sunday Politics on BBC One, Conservative MP Nadine Dorries supports the idea of a Conservative / UKIP electoral deal.

She said: 'Nick Boles suggested we should do this with the Liberal Democrats a year ago and he got promoted to be a minister, so I’m not sure why anybody thinks when I suggest it with UKIP that anything would happen other than that.  I’m looking forward to my promotion.'

Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price told the programme: 'What I want to see is a Conservative majority government. But I think talking about a coalition with anyone is actually self-defeating in attaining that objective.

'We are representing a very proud party with a distinguished history and I find it really quite lily-livered if any Conservative Party should be opening talks about pacts at this stage.'
