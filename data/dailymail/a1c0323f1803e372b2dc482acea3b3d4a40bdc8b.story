Controversial: Almost 60,000 people have urged Sheffield United not to re-sign rapist footballer Ched Evans following his release

Almost 60,000 people have signed a petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign rapist footballer Ched Evans when he is released from prison.

The 25-year-old, who is serving a five-year sentence for rape, is said to have already held talks with the club and is expected to complete a £3million deal after his full release in October. 

The Welsh striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales.

After reports circulated that Sheffield United were planning a return for the disgraced player, an online petition was set up and opponents quickly condemned the proposal.

An extract on the site reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and "welcome him back" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained.'

Campaigners also believe his reinstatement would send the wrong message and could be damaging to the club's reputation.

Director of communications at Rape Crisis England and Wales, Katie Russell, said: 'It is of course any convicted criminal's right to serve their sentence and then go back into employment. We absolutely stand by that.

'But at the same time we would urge Sheffield United to think very carefully about the message that they send when they immediately re-employ someone who's been convicted of such a very serious crime.

'If they choose to do that, which is their right, we urge them to seriously consider the impact that will have on huge numbers of their supporters and we urge them to make a very strong statement condemning sexual violence, condemning violence against women and girls and making it clear that misogyny, sexism, violence and sexual violence in particular won't be tolerated within football.'

She added that if he returns, the convicted rapist will soon be celebrated as a 'talented footballer and goal-scorer'.

'There will be survivors of sexual violence - both male and female - in the crowd if he returns to the pitch. The club need to take some sort of corporate responsibility to show that they do condemn sexual violence,' she added.

Alan Smith, a member of Sheffield United's Supporters Club executive, told Mail Online that someone 'very high up' at the club has assured him Evans will return to the club.

'At the end of the day he has been convicted and has served his time. I do not condone rapists at all, but I want Ched Evans to come back,' he said. 

Sentence: The footballer was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room and is expected to be released in October 

Anger: The petition, addressed to club chairman Kevin McCabe, has attracted strong comments from opponents with some suggesting it would be a 'humiliation' to see him back on the pitch 

'He will get a lot of stick from the away fans when he returns, but the home fans will leave him alone because they want him back.

'I believe that if he was at another club, he would be allowed to play.' 

It is understood that officials from the club, including manager Nigel Clough, have visited him in during his sentence at HM Wymott in Lancashire and have already discussed his future at the League One side.

Evans was found guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court of raping a woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales, in April 2012. 

One of his appeals has already been overturned, but his legal team has now referred his case to the independent Criminal Cases Review Commission in another effort to clear his name. 

Former Port Vale and Walsall defender Clayton McDonald, also admitted having sex with the same woman but was cleared of rape charges. 

A spokesman for the club said they had nothing to add and are yet to confirm Evans's future at the club.
