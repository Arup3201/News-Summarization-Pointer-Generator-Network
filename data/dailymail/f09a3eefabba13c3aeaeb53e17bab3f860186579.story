A California couple thought to be missing for a month during a trip to Peru have been located aboard a boat  - and they didn't even know their families had been looking for them.

Jamie Neal, 25, and Garrett Hand, 27, 
from California’s Bay Area, left for Peru in December for a South America bike trip, and had not been in contact with friends and relatives since late January.

The couple was found on a boat that was traveling along the Navos River.

The Peruvian Travel Ministry told KGO-TV that Miss Neal and Mr Hand had no idea they had been reported missing.

They had been updating friends and family about their trip on their Facebook page, but those messages stopped on January 25, Miss Neal's sister Jennifer Neal told FoxNews.com on Monday.

Jennifer Neal added that Mr Hand's cellphone had been turned off, sparking fears that the two may have been kidnapped.

‘It goes straight to voicemail,’ she told FoxNews.com. 'It's not like them to be out of touch for this long.'

In love: The couple posted many pictures of their trip on Facebook to being with but haven't since January, sparking fears among their families that they were missing

The lapse in communication caused the U.S. State Department to issue a travel warning to any Americans heading to Peru.

The couple disappeared in Peru in an 
area where a criminal gang were believed to have been plotting to kidnap
 tourists, authorities said this week.

The U.S. State Department issued a poster of the couple from San Francisco - who were last seen getting on a bus in the town of Cusco, headed for Lima on January 26 before getting in a cab.

The couple are biking enthusiasts who both work in cycle stores in the Bay Area of San Francisco.

They had customized their bikes especially for the trip which began in December.

They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru.
