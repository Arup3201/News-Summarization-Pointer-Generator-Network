The precise moment when a Boston Red
Sox player realized his wife had gone into labor was broadcast live and nationwide during Wednesday night's game, capturing every amazing second of his frantic reaction.

Called in from the field in the seventh inning against
the New York Yankees in Boston, second baseman Dustin Pedroia first appears
confused with a furrowed brow as he listens to Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine begin to deliver the news.

But once it's received, his reaction is priceless.

Called in: Seen hustling over to his manager, Second baseman Dustin Pedroia appears confused about his call in from the field during the seventh inning

News flash: Once delivered the news about his wife being in labor, Pedroia's face drops before mouthing two silent words in reaction

Race to the hospital: The ballplayer, with hat in hand, raced off the field leaving announcers only able to guess, though correctly, what had just happened to the now second-time dad

With a wad of tobacco stuck beneath his lip, Pedroia's face
drops in total shock while mouthing two silent words in response.

With quick nods and 'OK's, the second basemen runs off the
field looking like a deer caught in headlights to meet his wife, Kelli, who had been in attendance of that night's game
at Fenway Park.

'I just got the word that it was time,' Mr Valentine
recounted to MLB.com. 'I told him, I said, "What do you want to do?"
Actually I told him to leave. I didn't ask him what he wanted to do. I said
"It's time."'

Pedroia left after a
two-hit night.

Not an entirely new experience for Pedroia, he had also missed the 2009 All-Star Game for the birth
of his first child, Dylan.

Happy couple: Mr and Mrs Pedroia are seen in 2008, one year before the birth of their first child that caused him to miss the 2009 All-Star Game

According to Pedroia, who was on the west coast last week
while his wife neared labour, the timing could have been far much worse for them.

As for the game, however, it was far less ideal according to some fans with the Red Sox losing to the Yankees 5-4.

Some, like MSNBC's Willie Geist who was operating the Yankee's Twitter feed on Wednesday night, declared it a save.

'Dustin Pedroia's wife goes into labor! Good luck, Pedroias from Yankee fans...and thanks for missing a critical 9th inning at-bat! - Willie'
