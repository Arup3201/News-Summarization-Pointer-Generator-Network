Normally, getting picked up by the police is no laughing matter.

But when one group of unruly fugitives were tracked down, the arresting officer found himself helpless against their charms. 

PC Mark Wallace was driving home when he stumbled upon a litter of nine runaway puppies in the village of Seend in Wiltshire.

The puppies were running amok on the side of the road before PC Wallace bundled them into his car 

With no owner in sight, the 45-year-old decided to round the animals up and take them to safety. 

But his plans were soon thrown out, as for every dog that he could get in the car, another one jumped from the vehicle. 

Eventually, PC Wallace resorted to depositing the puppies through the car's windows to keep them all rounded up. 

His trouble didn't end there however, with the animals clambering across the dashboard and licking his ear as he drove them to a nearby police station. 

'It was the best day I've ever had in my 24-year career,' said Mr Wallace. 

'In this day in age there is a lot of hard work in policing, but this day, well, I was laughing my head off. 

'It was absolute chaos. It was so funny.'

PC Wallace said it was the best day in his 24-year career as a policeman 

Mr Wallace, who has a Jack Russel, was passing through the village after finishing a job in Worton when he saw the dogs running amok on the side of the road. 

The puppies, a variety of Australian Sheepdogs and Weirmaraners from two different litters, were being chased by another motorist who had stopped to try and catch them. 

'It was quite a fast country road and I came round the bend on to the straight and I saw the car - then the puppies - and thought "what the hell is that?"

'There was a mass of puppies and this poor woman who had spotted them first, trying to herd them. 

'They were wandering all over the road.'

After bundling the dogs' mother, an Australian Sheepdog, into the woman's car, PC Wallace tried to get the others into his vehicle. 

'The puppies were a bit more difficult to round up. 

'As soon as I opened the door to put one in another came out.

'I was having to wind down the window and pop them in one at a time.

'Next thing I knew all the puppies were everywhere - they were on the dash board, on the back window, everywhere.

'I was laughing my head off. They were stepping on the camera buttons and light buttons. It was absolute chaos, but it was so fun.

'I rounded the ones that weren’t sleeping to the back seat and used my letter briefcase to wedge between the seats so that couldn’t come forward.

'But driving back I’ve got one licking my ear, and one trying to climb out of the window.' 

The puppies were taken to Towbridge Police Station where their panicked owner collected them 20 minutes later. 

They had escaped through an open door at the house.  

'They were so cute. If I’d had room at home, I’d have taken them myself,' added Mr Wallace.
