Gone are the days of judging of a man’s character by the depth of his forehead or the position of his eyes.

However, new research suggests that the shape of a man’s face can indicate whether he is likely to be a good sportsman.

The study, carried out at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that Japanese baseball players with short, broad faces are more likely to display acumen on the sports field.

Japanese baseball players with short, broad faces, like Ichiro Suzuki, are more likely to display acumen on the sports field, according to new research

Testosterone is a hormone which is primarily secreted in the testicles of men and the ovaries of women.

It is the principal male sex hormone and plays a key role in the development of male reproductive organs.

It is also responsible for promoting increases in muscle, bone mass and growth of body hair.

On average, adult men have seven to eight times more testosterone in their blood than women do.

It also showed that sportsmen with long faces are less likely to be successful baseball players.

It is believed the explanation could be that having a wider jaw is an indication of having high levels of the hormone testosterone and that this plays a part in determining physical strength and aggression.

The researchers, psychologists Hikaru Tsujimura and Michael Banissy, measured the facial width-to-height ratio of 104 baseball players in Japan’s professional league.

They then followed the players for the 2011 and 2012 seasons and discovered that the players who scored the highest number of home runs also had the highest facial width-to-height ratio.

In a paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the researchers explained that this new data suggests that the findings may apply to people of all nationalities.

The researchers believe that the findings also apply to people of other nationalities so it could apply to sports stars such as Wayne Rooney (left) and Sir Chris Hoy (right)

They wrote that previous research has
uncovered a link between the facial width-to-height ratio and the 
financial success of business leaders – this research suggested that 
CEOs with broader faces are more likely to run successful firms.

This work looked at Caucasian CEOs so the Japanese research implies that testosterone has the same effect on both face shape and success regardless of your nationality.

The study also revealed that younger players tended to have broader faces than older ones.

However, the researchers are currently unable to explain why this might be.

Japanese baseball players with broad faces more likely to hit home runs

Could be because testosterone causes both a wide jaw and strength

Findings are thought to apply to people of all nationalities
