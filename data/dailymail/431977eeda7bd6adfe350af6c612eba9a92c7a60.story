A pygmy possum, who chose the wrong place for a midday nap, would have awoken to the shock of her life when she realised she was more than 90km from home.

The little critter was found quietly hiding in a mail bag last week by surprised mail sorter, Jack May, who had unknowingly driven it from Foul Bay to the Minlaton post office on the southern Yorke Peninsula in South Australia.

After originally assuming it was a mouse, the 16-year-old soon realised that the big-eyed, curly-tailed marsupial he'd found was far more special.

'You hardly ever seen pygmy possums, they're a very secretive animal,' Deborah Furbank from Natural Resources Yorke and North told Daily Mail Australia.

'I've only ever seen them when we've done targeted trapping. You don't see them out in the wild because they hide amongst leaf litter and trees so it was definitely a special occasion.

'Down in the country, we have personal mail bags that get left in front of a property and this bag was left in a sealed drum and obviously the pygmy possum had found its way into the drum and into the bag to have a little bit of a snooze.'

Ms Furbank, who personally travelled to collect the full-grown female in order to have it sent back home, described it as being 'very frisky' and curious' rather than scared.

'She wasn't stressed at all. When I got hold of her to check her sex, she was completely calm,' she said.

'They're quite a docile animal, once they realise you're not a threat to their lives they relax quite quickly.' She said she collected some flowers from the bush for the possum to feed on until it was returned to its home.

Once at the post office (pictured) Deborah Furbank from Natural Resources Yorke and North was called to collect and care for the possum until it could be taken back home 

'Luckily the post office staff made note of the bag it was found in so we were able to identify its territory and a staff member who lives near the property where it was collected, dropped it off on her way home,' Ms Furbank said.

'If you do find an animal, make sure to keep it somewhere dark, quiet and cool and not too look at it too much until you can call for help to get it home.'

Ms Furbank said pygmy possums were similar to ring tail possums only they appear as if they have 'been put in a shrink machine'.

'They fit in the palm of your hand and are a similar size to a mouse, but plumper with larger eyes, large rounded ears and a curly ringed tail.'

The palm-size animal is normally quite secretive and difficult to find, making it a special occasion for mail sorter Jack May, 16
