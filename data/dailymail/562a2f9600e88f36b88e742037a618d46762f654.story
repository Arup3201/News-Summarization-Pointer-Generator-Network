As two towering walls of flame close in around them, a couple speed through the Australian countryside in a desperate race against time to escape wildfires roaring towards their home.

Michael and Senga Green were driving home in Bilpin, New South Wales, when they were confronted by fires that have ravaged the state for days.

But rather than run away, they faced the inferno head on in a bid to outrun its flames before they reached their beloved house.

Scroll down for video.

Hell's highway: Michael and Senga Green were driving home in Bilpin, New South Wales, when they were confronted by fires that have ravaged the Blue Mountains near Sydney for the past five days

Fear: 'Gun it, gun it gun it,' Mr Green can be heard saying in the video as burning branches fell around them. 'Oh my god. Bloody hell'

Near miss: Dramatic footage of their ordeal was captured on a camera mounted on their car's dashboard, filming the moment a water tanker appears suddenly from the smoke-filled darkness, missing them by inches

'Gun it, gun it gun it,' Mr Green can be heard saying in the video as burning branches fall around them. 'Oh my god. Bloody hell.'

Meanwhile in nearby Yellow Rock, fires tore through the bush at such speed that workers became trapped inside their nursery canteen while flames licked the windows outside.

The flames were so intense that some of the terrified staff - who had stayed behind after the school's children were evacuated - called loved ones to say goodbye.

Aleisha Morgan, 25, who recorded the fire on her mobile phone, told 9News: 'You could see the wind was really bad, within the hour it was smoky, then it jumped the dam.'

An unnamed staff member added: 'It got pretty apocalyptic, winds were blowing at 100kms and there was fire everywhere,' they said. 'I was so scared at that point, knowing we were trapped and there was no help coming I thought I was going to die.'

Fortunately everyone inside was brought to safety.

The videos emerged after Australia declared a state of emergency yesterday as the ‘catastrophic’ wall of flame roared towards Sydney.

Firefighters have been given special powers to force people from their homes as hotter and drier weather threatens to intensify bushfires with have been raging in New South Wales since last week.

Officials said more than 200 homes have so far been destroyed amid the most dangerous conditions in 40 years

Fears: Of the 14 fires deemed 'out of control', fears are growing that three, in State Mine, Mount Victoria and Springwood, may unite to descend on Sydney

The Blue Mountains west of Sydney have been the worst-hit region and fears are growing three separate fires will join up and threaten Australia’s biggest city, which is home to 4.6 million.

So far only one man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. 

Hundreds of people have been left homeless and NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said worst was likely to come.

‘There is no doubt that these fires will continue to grow. The only uncertainty is to what extent,’ he said.

In a briefing this morning, Mr Fitzsimmons said that 58 blazes were still burning, with 14 out of control.

He added: 'I don't think I've ever used the word mega-fire.

'But
the reality is that the modelling indicates that there's every 
likelihood that in the forecast weather conditions that these two fires,
particularly up in the back end of the mountains, will merge at some 
point.'

One firefighter lost his own home on duty.

‘I’d been standing watching other people’s houses burn and the emotion from that was bad enough. To be hit with your own house being lost was a shock as well,’ said Tim Boxwell, 24.
