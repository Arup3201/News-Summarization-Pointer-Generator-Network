A Colorado man is under arrest after leading authorities on a high-speed chase for some 163 miles in a stolen car in Wyoming.

The Wyoming Highway Patrol arrested 25-year-old Martin Anderson of Peyton, Colorado, along with a teenage boy on Tuesday.

Officers had to deploy four rounds of stop sticks before they were finally able to stop the 2013 Dodge Charger near Elk Mountain, Wyoming.

The car was reported stolen from Colorado Springs on July 30.

Martin Anderson, 25, allegedly led authorities on a 163-mile pursuit in Wyoming driving this Dodge Charger, which police said was stolen from Colorado Springs

Then on Tuesday, cops in Riverton, Wyoming, spotted the vehicle after a 911 caller reported a gray Dodger Charger appeared to have been involved in a drug deal, according to KTVQ.

At first, Anderson and his passenger, who has not been named, put their hands outside the vehicle in an apparent sign of surrender, according to the station.

But once the officers got close, Anderson allegedly took off, at times reaching speeds of up to 140 mph during the chase.

The pursuit had to be suspended twice, once when Anderson swerved at multiple 
troopers and into oncoming traffic north of Rawlins, Wyoming, and again when he 
entered the city limits, said Wyoming Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. David Wagener

'He apparently knew that law enforcement would not endanger other traffic and that is why we think that's what his motive was,' Capt. Eric Murphy told KTVQ

An unmarked police vehicle continued to follow Anderson and officers retook the chase once he was out on Interstate 80.

'He attempted to run multiple vehicles off the road head on,' Undersheriff Ryan Lee, of the Fremont County Sheriff's office, told County10.

Police found two handguns inside his car, both of which were within Anderson's reach during the chase.

The teenager's relationship to Anderson remains unclear. Cops have not said whether he will be charged with a crime.

No injuries were reported.
