Three dogs seized from the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro, the man charged with holding three women captive and raping them over a decade, will remain in foster care until the women decide if they want to adopt them.

The women may have bonded with the dogs during their captivity, and it's possible the animals could help the women as the acclimate to freedom, said John Baird, chief Cleveland animal control officer.

‘It kind of makes sense, maybe that there were three dogs, three women,’ he told The Associated Press.

The dogs found at Ariel Castro's house included two terrier poodle mixes and a chihuahua

‘They may have bonded with these dogs. and we would like for them to have a shot at them if they want them, just because it was something they could attach themselves to.’

Dogs Unlimited Rescue will care for the dogs until Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight make a decision.

The dogs include a Chihuahua and two terrier-poodle mixes. The rescue group said the animals had matted hair, but otherwise appeared to be in good health. The dogs have since been groomed and spayed and neutered.

‘The animals aren't very shy, so that's usually a sign that they've been cared for at least in some way,’ Baird told local Cleveland station WOIO.

The Chihuahua was found in the car with Castro the night he was arrested for allegedly holding three women captive for a decade, while two terrier poodle mixes were found in his Cleveland home.

Ohio-based reporter Ed Gallek told CNN last week that the animals were apparently in better condition than the women. He said there was 'some talk' among officers that may have been pets for the women.

'I am told that the dogs were in reasonably good health,' he told CNN. He said an 'R.I.P' message found scrawled on the wall of the basement is believed to have referred to a pet.

He added: 'There's some talk in law enforcement circles in recent days about the dogs being pets for the women... That is something that we're still looking into, but that is another possibility.'

Morgan added that perhaps the animals had been used as 'noise shields' for what was going on inside the house.

Since Ariel Castro's arrest the animals have been cared for by Dogs Unlimited Rescue in Cleveland

The animals have now been taken to animal rescue kennels in Cleveland but police are waiting to see if any of the victims want to keep them before they are put up for adoption.

If they do not, the three dogs will be placed in foster homes, Gallek said.

They were seized following Castro's arrest on kidnapping and rape charges. He is accused of chaining the women up in his home and assaulting them for years.

The good health of the dogs came despite the horrendous treatment the three women allegedly endured at the hands of Ariel Castro after they were snatched from the streets.

Michelle Knight was subjected to numerous beatings and treated like 'a punching bag,' a family friend of one of the victims has told CNN.

Her relatives say that she is deaf in 
one ear, and may need facial reconstruction surgery. She was released 
from a hospital on Friday.

Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left.

Michelle told CNN in a statement: 'I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time.'

She told police that her alleged captor repeatedly raped her and caused her to miscarry at least five times over the years by starving her and punching her in the stomach.

It has also emerged that Michelle Berry and Gina DeJesus will require long-term therapy for
injuries such as hearing loss and joint and muscle damage due to the 
severe abuse they were subjected for more than a decade.

Their injuries were compared to those
suffered by prisoners of war and sources said there were chains coming 
from the wall in the basement and dog leashes attached to the ceiling.

The women were restrained with them and duct tape in 'stress positions' 
for long periods that left them with bed sores and other injuries, 
according to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation.

Other reports said that Amanda Berry was saved from the worst of the abuse because she was a favorite of Castro's.

'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one
of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight.

Amanda was photographed 
smiling immediately after the dramatic rescue.

In contrast, DeJesus wore a hooded sweat-shirt covering her head when 
she first went home last week, and Knight was hospitalized for days, and
has stayed out of public view.

The sources said DeJesus and Knight were gaunt and had closely cropped hair when they were freed.
