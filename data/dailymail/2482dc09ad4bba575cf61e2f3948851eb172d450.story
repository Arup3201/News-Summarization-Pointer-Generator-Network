After little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for Liverpool, Jordan Henderson removed the captain’s armband from his left bicep and handed it to Steven Gerrard.

He did so out of respect. He did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second-half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club.

But four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when Gerrard might have felt it appropriate to hand it back.

It was then, 68 minutes into this contest, that Henderson did something that has long been synonymous with Gerrard: he came to Liverpool’s rescue.

If it lacked finesse, and owed more to good fortune, a winning goal that narrowed the gap to Manchester United in the fierce battle for Champions League places owed everything to Henderson’s desire and determination. It was an ugly goal, Jordi Amat’s attempted clearance spinning off Henderson’s shin and flying beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski.

But it was Henderson who made the run in pursuit of Daniel Sturridge’s flick-on and Henderson, after a stuttering first half, who had given Liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break. 

The goal was Henderson's third in the last three Premier League games after his strikes against Manchester City and Burnley

Henderson clattered into Shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but Roger East opted not to even book him.

If Gerrard had an impact, it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed Henderson to get forward. And the fact the goal came so soon after Gerrard’s first appearance in eight games reflected well, once again, on Brendan Rodgers.

Rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results Liverpool are enjoying. It is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at Old Trafford in December and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal, an achievement that equals the club record set by Emlyn Hughes and Co in 1972. Rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side. It has been tactically astute leadership.

But Rodgers also needed players to step out of Gerrard’s shadow and prove they can survive without him. Nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in Henderson now reflecting on three goals in Liverpool’s last three games.

The pressure was on here with Sunday’s game against United at Anfield and a trip to Arsenal to follow.

And against a Swansea side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of Garry Monk, Liverpool struggled in that opening 45 minutes. Monk might have been the managerial apprentice but Rodgers would have recognised how well Swansea’s players had mastered their boss’s instructions. They were excellent, using the pace and power of Bafetimbi Gomis to good effect.

Liverpool, by contrast, were disappointing, with Henderson among those losing possession far too cheaply. Gerrard brought much-needed composure to Liverpool’s midfield.

Given how well Liverpool had been playing, the decision to omit Gerrard from the line-up was understandable. He had been injured, after all.

And Liverpool started with their usual intensity, the pressing game that is designed to dominate their opponents and stop them playing.

But Swansea were managing to attack effectively on the counter, with Gomis accelerating past Emre Can only for Joe Allen to make an important interception. In the end Ki Sung-Yueng had a real chance to score but his header was weak and cleared by the outstanding Martin Skrtel.

Liverpool have kept six straight away clean sheets in the top-flight for the third time in their history, and the first since 1972. The other run came in 1966. 

Skrtel would make another headed clearance to deny Gomis, who had escaped the clutches of the Liverpool back four to meet a cross from Kyle Naughton with a better header.

Swansea were dominating possession and Gomis was proving a proper threat. 

A neat one-two with Routledge and he was through on goal with only Simon Mignolet to beat, but much to Monk’s dismay his shot was scuffed and Liverpool’s goalkeeper made the save.

An effort from Philippe Coutinho aside — it was gathered neatly by Fabianski — Liverpool offered little in response.

Swansea were offering plenty, Mignolet making a hugely impressive diving save to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson before Adam Lallana diverted a powerful strike from Jonjo Shelvey to safety with a courageous header. 

But after the interval Liverpool were better — there was more urgency, more composure, with Henderson very much at the centre of things, even if the arrival of Gerrard from the bench was important.

That gave Henderson freedom to bomb on and in the 68th minute he chased a fine ball forward from Skrtel that was diverted into the Swansea box by Sturridge.

Amat and Henderson gave chase, with Amat winning the race but not the contest.

It was tough on Swansea and Monk. Rodgers would have admired his former student for the way he prepared his team. Until Henderson’s goal, they looked the more likely winners.

But Liverpool, rather like Henderson at that crucial moment, have what teams need come the business end of the season: momentum. So much so that they almost scored again moments before the final whistle, Sturridge sending his shot against a post.
