Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell paid tribute to a ‘special unit’ after his team came from 21-0 down to beat the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Sunday.

Matt Prater kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired to send the Lions to 6-2 with victory in London, and Caldwell was delighted with the comeback.

‘They don’t quit,’ Caldwell said about his team at his post-game press conference.

‘They are not deterred and they play with poise down the stretch. The pressure doesn’t bother them and they find a way to make plays. But they hang together so well and are always talking to each other on the sidelines. It’s a pretty special unit.

‘In the first half we didn’t play well and get the type of start we were looking for. In the second half, it was a bit more like the way we are capable of playing and in the end it worked out for us.

‘It was one of the games where I felt that if we could stop them, we had a chance to come back. To get from the six-yard line down to field-goal range at the end was a heck of a drive.’

The Lions head home from London into their bye week still sitting atop the NFC North. Caldwell thinks his team will be even better after their bye once the likes of Calvin Johnson and Reggie Bush return from injury.

‘It is a great time for the bye week,’ the Lions head coach said. ‘We have a chance to get some guys healthy for the second half of the season.

‘This week was great for us in terms of our preparation I don’t think it could have been any better. The hospitality has been superb and tremendous and it was a great experience. I think our guys enjoyed it.’

Lions quarterback Matt Stafford added: ‘It was a crazy way to end the game and I’m proud of our guys to fight tooth and nail and get the win. We pulled it together and had a fantastic final drive to get into field goal range.

‘In the first half we didn’t play as good as we can and we know that. The second half was more like the defense I have seen all year. They have a lot of pride and to shut out the Falcons in the second half was really impressive.’

Stafford’s 59-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate sparked the Lions into life in the third quarter. That throw was Stafford’s 119th touchdown pass, surpassing Bobby Layne’s previous Lions franchise record of 118.

He said: ‘Hopefully it is not my last touchdown pass for the Lions and there will be more to come, but it is something pretty special.’

Tate also praised the character of the Lions.

‘This team has a lot of heart and it’s incredible to see and be a part of,’ the former Seattle wide receiver said. ‘It’s exciting to be a part of something like this and we are excited for the second half of the season.’

On the 59-yard touchdown reception, Tate added: ‘It was a great play by Matt (Stafford) getting out of the pocket, extending the play and making something happen.

‘They had a great coverage, but I guess the safety got caught flat-footed when he saw Matt about the throw the ball and I jogged past him. Having the arm that he has, Matt can make any throw. I was worried about dropping it because the ball came on to me so quickly.’
