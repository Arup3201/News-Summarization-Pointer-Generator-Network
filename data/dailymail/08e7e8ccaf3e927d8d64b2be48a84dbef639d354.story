Furious: Businesswoman Jean Rasbridge has criticised 'useless' JobCentre staff who directed 100 applicants to her - but none was interested in a job

A businesswoman has criticised ‘useless’ JobCentre staff who directed 100 applicants to her – but none was interested in a job.

Jean Rasbridge said the service was ‘wasting everyone’s time’ after candidates either failed to show up for interviews or even start a job once they were hired.

She claims the Government-run centres were simply helping the unemployed to ‘tick boxes’ so they could keep their benefits.

Mrs Rasbridge, who co-founded a firm that sells electronic cigarettes, was initially pleased to receive almost 100 applications for an £8-per-hour post as a warehouse packer.

But of the seven jobseekers Mrs Rasbridge invited for an interview, only two showed up.

And even the one candidate who was offered the position failed to turn up. Last night she said her firm had stopped using the JobCentre to find staff after their ‘nightmare’ experience.

‘I found the JobCentre completely useless and other people in our industry say the same thing,’ she said.

‘The applicants who applied were obviously just ticking boxes to keep their benefits.

‘It was a complete waste of time for them, the JobCentre and for us.

‘They weren’t interested in working for us, even when we showed an interest in employing them.’

Problems began in August last year when the firm, ecigarettedirect.co.uk, placed an advert with a JobCentre in Gorseinon, Swansea.

After sifting through the candidates – some of whom came from as far as Glasgow and Peterborough – Mrs Rasbridge realised few had any intention of working.

‘By the end of the second day we had getting on for 100 applications from all walks of life – people with PhDs, teachers, lecturers, some of them from quite a distance away,’ she added. 

‘We had one from Glasgow, another from Peterborough, but then it suddenly clicked with me that they were just filling in the forms to retain their benefits.’

Under rules introduced last October, jobseekers can lose their benefits for up to three years if they repeatedly refuse to actively seek or be available for work.

Mr Rasbridge said the Government should make it less attractive for jobseekers to claim handouts.

‘When they’ve got to get up at 8am, catch a bus to work and stay until 5pm, there is not much incentive to do so when they are managing well on various benefits,’ she said. ‘It’s too much like hard work.

‘They would be better off saying: “Look, I don’t want to work, just give me the money”, it would stop everyone wasting their time.

‘When we advertise privately we aren’t inundated with applicants, but they are of a much better quality – they actually turn up for an interview.’

A JobCentre spokesman said advisers work hard to help people off benefits and into a job.

‘It is only right that jobseekers should do everything they can to find work if they want to claim Jobseekers’ Allowance and our advisers will work with them to ensure they apply for jobs which suit their skills and experience,’ he said.
