U.S. soldier Bradley Manning was a traitor with one mission as an intelligence analyst in Iraq: to find and reveal government secrets to a group of anarchists and bask in the glory as a whistleblower, a prosecutor said yesterday during closing arguments.

Major Ashden Fein said Manning betrayed his country's trust and gave classified information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, knowing the material would be seen by Al-Qaeda

Even Osama bin Laden had some of the digital files at his compound in Pakistan when he was killed, the prosecutor said.

Arrival: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is helped out of a security vehicle as he arrives at a courthouse at Fort Meade today

Closing remarks: Lawyers for the U.S. soldier accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the nation's history are due to make their closing remarks in his court-martial today

'WikiLeaks was merely the platform 
which Pfc. Manning used to ensure all the information was available for 
the world, including enemies of the United States,' Fein said.

Manning
is charged with 21 offenses, but the most serious is aiding the enemy, 
which carries a possible sentence of up to life in prison.

Defense attorneys will present their closing arguments today.

Under scrutiny: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is escorted out of a courthouse at Fort Mead, Md, Thursday, July 25, 2013. Manning is charged with indirectly aiding the enemy by sending troves of classified material to WikiLeaks

Betrayed: Maj. Ashden Fein said Manning betrayed his country's trust and gave classified information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, knowing the material would be seen by Al-Qaeda

Accusations: Manning is charged with providing the WikiLeaks website with more than 700,000 classified files, combat videos and diplomatic cables while serving as a junior intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010

Defence: David Coombs, center, civilian attorney for Army Pfc. Bradley Manning. Coombs said supporters on Friday would hear what truth sounds like

Manning, 25, was not the troubled, naive soldier defense attorneys have made him out to be, Fein said.

He displayed a smiling photo of Manning from 2010 when he was visiting relatives while on leave.

Fein said: 'This is a gleeful, grinning Pfc. Manning' who sent battlefield reports to WikiLeaks, accompanied by the message: 'Have a good day.'

Manning has acknowledged giving WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and videos in late 2009 and early 2010.

Even Osama bin Laden had some of the digital files at his compound (pictured) in Pakistan when he was killed in 2011, the prosecutor said.

But he says he didn't believe the information would harm troops in Afghanistan and Iraq or threaten national security.

Claims: Fein said Manning relied on WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange for guidance on what to leak, starting within two weeks of his arrival in Iraq in November 2009

Prosecutors must prove Manning knew Al-Qaeda would see the material to get a conviction on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy.

They presented evidence Manning knew 'the enemy' in general used the Internet, and that leakers with evil intent might use WikiLeaks to spill secrets.Â 

Fein's closing remarks, including calling Manning a traitor, struck a chord with his supporters.

As court recessed for the day, a man said, 'You're a hero, Bradley, as far as I'm concerned.' Several others murmured support for Manning in what became a loud buzz.

The judge angrily shouted, 'Gallery, that's enough!'

Defense attorney David Coombs said supporters on Friday would hear what truth sounds like.

Fein said Manning relied on WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange for guidance on what to leak, starting within two weeks of his arrival in Iraq in November 2009.

Referring to a 'Most Wanted Leaks' list the organization published, Fein said WikiLeaks sought almost exclusively information about the U.S.

Federal authorities also are looking into whether Assange can be prosecuted.

He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex crimes allegations. Manning pleaded guilty earlier this year to reduced versions of some charges.

He faces up to 20 years in prison for those offenses, but prosecutors pressed ahead with the original charges.
