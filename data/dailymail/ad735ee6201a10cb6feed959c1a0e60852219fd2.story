When two performers started bumping and grinding next to railing at the Notting Hill Carnival today, this policeman clearly thought the best thing to do was keep a very watchful eye on them. And no, that middle-distance stare isn't fooling anyone.

Meanwhile, a fellow officer also got in on the action as he put his arms around two more scantily clad revellers. And unlike his colleague, he couldn't resist a huge smile.

Dancers dressed in colourful plumage and bejewelled bikinis made their way through the streets of west London today as hundreds of thousands of people watched the annual festivities.

As the smell of jerk chicken and the 
sound of steel drums filled the air, the capital was treated to day two 
of Europe's biggest street party. And not even the occasional downpour could dampen the spirits of those who came to watch, and take part.

Rows of African food stalls, dance 
stages and sound systems will line the route of the vibrant procession 
with a number of after-parties keeping the carnival fever pumping until 
the early hours.

Although some showers are predicted, forecasters said London will be mainly dry with sunny spells throughout the day.

Yesterday, young performers with huge
 grins, covered in feathers, jewels and waving flags, danced their way 
along the sunny route to the sound of steel drums and calypso music to 
cheers from huge crowds.

GANG members were intercepted by police yesterday as they made their way to Notting Hill Carnival intent on violence.

The mob of 36 men, some of them wearing body armour, were stopped at King's Cross Tube station in central London following a tip-off.

Witnesses say ten police vans and officers with dogs swooped to arrest the suspects who came from North London.

Last night 15 of the men were being detained to prevent a 'potential breach of the peace'.

The huge police operation came after the biggest street party in Europe was again marred by violence.

Last night a man was fighting for his life following a triple stabbing. The 35-year-old was knifed outside a pub in North Kensington in a large brawl on Sunday night that saw two other men receive blade wounds.

Detectives arrested two men aged 22 and 27 at the scene on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and later re-arrested them on suspicion of attempted murder.

A 20-year-old man was knifed in the back and buttocks in the middle of the carnival at 5.50pm on Sunday.

The number of arrests over the three-day weekend stood last night at 147, mainly for drugs, public order offences, robbery and assault.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said the figure was not surprising for an event attended by a 1million people in a single day.

He drafted in an extra 2,000 police officers yesterday, bringing the total on duty at the carnival to 7,000.

 assistant Michaela Popescu, 30, from Ashford, Kent, joined in the fun 
with her friend's twin daughters Victoria and Theadora Trosheva, seven.

'It has been a brilliant day, the music is fantastic - I can feel the rhythm in my heart,' she said.

'The girls have had a lot of fun and been dancing along, it's a totally different culture for them to enjoy.'

Police overseeing the festival were hoping for a peaceful climax to the Notting Hill 
Carnival today, despite at least two stabbings.

Yesterday's
 festivities were largely peaceful but one 20-year-old man was left in a
 serious but stable condition after being stabbed in the back and 
buttocks in Ladbroke Grove.

Metropolitan Police said a 14-year-old boy was slashed with a sharp object in Golborne Gardens.

And a 16-year-old girl was also treated but discharged herself from hospital after sustaining what police described as a superficial leg wound in Wornington Road.

An extra 2,000 police officers will be drafted in to support the event today, bringing the total to 7,000.

Scotland Yard arrested 96 people yesterday, mainly for drug and public order offences as well as robbery and assault.

Officers have been granted stop and 
search powers within the area where the carnival takes place, while the 
force has advised visitors to only use mobile phones when absolutely 
necessary.

Commander Christine Jones said: 'Mobile phones, especially expensive ones, are a glittering prize for thieves.

'Don't give them a head start by 
displaying them openly and only use them if it's absolutely necessary. 
Pick up one of our maps instead and pre-arrange meeting points with 
family and friends.'

Three men were stabbed in a fight in North Pole Road - close by but outside the carnival's footprint.

Scotland Yard said two men were arrested and one was left in a critical condition and confirmed there were 152 arrests yesterday.

A spokesman said: "This is broadly in line with what we expected. To give you an idea, on Bank Holiday Monday last year we made 172 arrests."

A Scotland Yard spokesman later said the number of people stopped by police at Kings Cross underground station this afternoon was 36, not 34.

Of the group - all males - 17 were aged 18 or over and nineteen aged under 18, he said. All were arrested and were being held at an undisclosed location until police were satisfied there was no longer a risk they would commit disorder at the carnival.
