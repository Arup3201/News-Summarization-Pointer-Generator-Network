One 86-year-old Colorado woman says she'll forever be grateful to two police officers who went far beyond their duties to help her when her purse was stolen.

Julia Brecht was shopping at Target in Aurora, Colo., when an unidentified man snatched her purse then fled for the door before she could react.

The purse contained her wallet and car keys.

Officers Craig Hess and Robert Little were praised for going above and beyond to help Julia Brecht after her purse was stolen

But when officers Craig Hess and Robert Little arrived, the day started to turn around.

'They went far beyond what any person like me would expect,' Brecht said.

The stolen purse contained her wallet and car keys

Not content to stop at taking her crime report, they called her credit card companies to report the cards stolen for her then took her shopping and bought everything on her list with their own money.

'They were just absolutely incredible,' the great-grandmother told KMGH. 'We're just very thankful.'
