Three members of the family were 
pronounced dead at the scene on the A18 near Laceby Manor Golf Club, 
Grimsby, Lincolnshire while two died in the nearby Diana Princess of Wales Hospital.

The driver of the lorry is thought to have sustained minor injuries.

Hundreds of people left their 
condolences on the R.I.P Cockburn Family page, which also features 
photographs of the family, including some of Carley and Bethany wearing 
dancing costumes and some of Bethany's daughter Lacie.

Carley and Bethany were members of a dance school in Washington, Tyne and Wear.

Floral tributes were also left outside the family home in Chester-Le-Street, County Durham.

A police spokesman today confirmed that Mrs Cockburn was the fifth person to die in the crash.

'At this time 
formal identification has not been carried out, however from information
obtained by police there is no doubt that the person travelling in the 
vehicle was Angela Cockburn,' he said.

Tragedy: The family's Nissan Primera is covered by fabric following the fatal crash that killed five people

The Grimsby stretch of the A18 featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Most Dangerous Roads, in 2011, which claimed it was 25 times more dangerous than the average British motorway with 20 crashes in the previous three years.

It was also found to be the UK's highest-risk stretch of road for car drivers in a nationwide survey by the Road Safety Foundation in 2010.

Operations Superintendent Tracy Bradley, of Humberside Police, said: 'Our deepest thoughts go out to the family and friends of those who were tragically killed in this collision which happened on the A18 yesterday. We are working closely with relatives of those who lost their lives and are supporting them through what will be a very difficult time.

'Roads policing officers are working 
closely with our collision investigation team to piece together the 
evidence we have gathered in order to try and determine what led to this
tragic incident taking place and took the lives of those travelling in 
the Nissan at the time.

'We have spoken to a number of key 
witnesses already, however, if anyone saw the incident but has not come 
forward I would ask them to do so.'

Tributes: Flowers are left outside the Cockburn family home in Chester-Le-Street, County Durham

Outing: The family were on their way to Butlin's in Skegness to take part in a dance competition

The Facebook tribute page features photographs of the family, including some of Carley and Bethany wearing dancing costumes.

One person left a message which read: 'So so sad xx dancing with the angels now x R.I.P xxx'

Another posted: 'Dance in heaven beautiful angels x'

On a photo of Lacie, who would have turned two next month, one Facebook user wrote: 'Sleep tight lacie a beautiful girl and now a precious angel'.

Many people left anecdotes about the 
family on the page, with one describing Mr Cockburn as 'a gentle kind 
man' who was 'totally devoted to his family'.

A
number of people had also posted tributes on Bethany's personal 
Facebook page, on which she wrote that she was in a relationship with 
Garry Stephenson, a soldier in the Scots Guards, and described daughter 
Lacie as 'Our world!'.
