Film buffs have the chance to own a piece of Hollywood cult history as the luxury home featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for sale.

The 5,300 square foot house in Highland Park, Chicago, Illinois, is on sale priced at $1.5million.

It featured in the iconic 1986 film, starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris, as the home of Bueller's neurotic best friend Cameron Frye.

Classic: In the 1986 movie Ferris and his best friend Cameron watch in horror as Cameron's father's cherished Ferrari crashes to its death through a glass wall and into a ravine

Iconic: Film fans will instantly recognise the glass-fronted garage which was the scene of Bueller's (played by Matthew Broderick, left) neurotic best friend Cameron's (played by Alan Ruck, right) breakdown

That scene: At the end of the film Cameron's father's beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below

The home, part-suspended over a wooded ravine, comprises a main four-bedroom house and a separate pavilion with its own kitchen and bathroom.

The pavilion also has room for four cars.

In a classic scene, Frye has a breakdown in the room after returning his father's beloved Ferrari but discovering that hundreds of miles have been added to its speedometer.

He then kicks the car repeatedly before sending it crashing through the glass walls into the ravine below.

The home is on the market for the second time in two years after the owners failed to sell at $1.65million in 2011.

Modern: The glass pavilion was designed to house a collection of four vintage cars

The owners originally put the home on 
the market for $2.3million in 2009 but it did not sell and has since 
undergone a renovation. 

It was built in 1953 by architect A. James Speyer, who was mentored by pioneering architect Ludwig Mies Van Der Roche.

The glass-enclosed garage, designed by David Haid, was added 20 years later to store a collection of vintage cars.

The four-bedroomed home has only had one family of owners, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The 1986 coming-of-age comedy film follows teen slacker Bueller as he bunks off high school and has a day of fun around Chicago.

Pedigree: The home, which sits on stilts over a ravine, was designed by A. James Speyer, who was mentored by pioneering architect Ludwig Mies Van Der Roche

He encourages his girlfriend, Sloane, played by Mia Sara, and best friend, Cameron, played by Alan Ruck, to join him

It
 was written and directed by the late John Hughes, who was also the man 
behind The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink.

A replica of the Ferrari 250 GT Spyder used in the film is being auctioned next week.

Because the genuine model was so valuable, studio bosses built three replicas for filming.
