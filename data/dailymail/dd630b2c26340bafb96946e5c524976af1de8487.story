Nearly 5,000 years after it was created by a Chinese Emperor, tea remains one of the world’s most popular beverages in the US, with tens of thousands of gallons of different iced varieties being consumed every year.

But beyond the preferred flavors and serving methods enjoyed in the US, there are huge varieties of other tea-based traditions, flavors and styles being served in different cultures around the world which are far more interesting than what you will find at your local Starbucks.

From British tea time to Tibetan Yak Butter Tea, Pulptastic compiled a visual list of teas being served in their native countries. 

Unique flavor: Moroccan mint tea (pictured) is a variation of green tea made with spearmint leaves and sugar 

Super creamy: Hong Kong milk tea (pictured) is black tea that is made with evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk

According to the Tea Association of the USA, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water.

While Americans can choose from varieties of teas, including black, green and white, a majority of the country prefers to drink it chilled.  

Considering the popularity of sweet tea, particularly below the Mason-Dixon line, it is not at all shocking that the Tea Association also reported that 85per cent of the tea consumed in the US is iced.  

In Steel Magnolia's, Dolly Parton's character Truvy called sweet tea the 'house wine of the South' because of its abundant consumption. 

Across the pond, the British drink their tea with milk, but it is also common to have it served black, with lemon or sugar.

The creation of the traditional afternoon tea in the United Kingdom is credited to Anna Marie Russell, Duchess of Bedford, who in 1840 began having tea with a small snack around 4pm to fight off that 'sinking feeling'.

But there would be no such thing as tea time, if it wasn't for the discovery of tea leaves in China. 

According to legend, Chinese Emperor Shen-Nung came across the beverage in 2737 BC after some tea leaves accidentally blew into his pot of boiling water. Tea originated in China as a medicinal drink and is still widely consumed for its health benefits.

The Alishan tea district in Chiayi County, Taiwan is famous for its production and consumption of oolong tea, a partially-oxidized tea made from leaves that are withered in direct sunlight.

Tea is also an important part of Russian culture. While the warming beverage used to be served in the afternoon, Russians now consume it throughout the day - very possibly to stave off the cold. 

In Russia, tea is a two-step brewing process. A large quantity of tea concentrate is first brewed in a teapot to serve several people. For their individual glasses, each person mixes a portion of the concentrate with hot water according to taste, making it stronger or weaker depending on their personal preference.

In Morocco, tea is a sign of hospitality and is often served to guests. Offering tea as a means of welcoming visitors to your home was once somewhat of a ceremonial process because hosts used to elaborately prepare it in front of their guests. 

While tea is now commonly made in the kitchen, the traditional ceremony is still observed for more formal occasions.  

Moroccan mint tea, which is a variation of green tea made with spearmint leaves and sugar, is served throughout the country.

For those who prefer their tea to have a creamier texture, milk teas are popular in Thailand and Hong Kong.  

Thai tea, known as 'cha-yen' is made with brewed Ceylon tea that is mixed with condensed milk and sugar before being served over ice and topped with evaporated milk.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong milk tea is black tea that is made with evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk. It is nicknamed 'pantyhose' or 'silk stocking' tea because it is brewed in a sackcloth bag used to filter the leaves.

It is also used as a base for 'Yuanyang' or 'Yingyong', which is a beloved drink in Hong Kong that combines the creamy tea with coffee for an added treat.

There are also teas that are flavored with salt and even butter. 

Tibetan butter tea is made from tea leaves, yak butter, water and salt. The filling, calorie-rich beverage is customarily consumed throughout the day.

While it may seem strange to put such a fattening substance into your tea, butter coffee is gaining popularity in the US because of claims that it energizes and burns fat in the body all day long. 

Mongolian tea or suutei tsai is known for its distinct salty flavor. It is typically made with water, milk, black or green tea and salt. But instead of steeping fine tea leaves, suutei tsai is made with the coarse part of the plant. Butter, rice and noodles are also commonly added when making the unique tea. 

And in South America, drinking mate tea is somewhat of a bonding experience.

A container, usually a hollow gourd, is filled with dried yerba mate leaves and hot water and served with a filtered straw that is usually made out of silver. It is common for friends to take sips of the beverage, refill it and pass it around.
