The British backpacker who was viciously beaten up in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Saturday night has spoken for the first time about the ordeal and admitted only now does he realise how serious the attack was.

Speaking to MailOnline from his hospital bed, the talented young footballer, who has been traveling around Australia since February, said he suffered a fractured skull and was put in an induced coma after he was allegedly set upon by a 22-year-old local on the Burnett traffic bridge - the same spot where British backpacker Caroline Stuttle was pushed to her death more than 12 years ago. 

North Bundaberg man Braydon Adams has been charged over the alleged attack on Mr Luxton.

Thumbs up: Chris Luxton is in happy spirits since recovering from a 48 hour coma in Royal Brisbane hospital, as seen in this photo snapped by his father Shane for MailOnline. Police have charged a 22-year-old Bundaberg local in relation to the bashing attack which left Luxton fighting for life

Shocking: British amateur footballer Chris Luxton was left fighting for his life after he was allegedly attacked and robbed in Bundaberg on Saturday night

'It was actually my first night in Bundaberg,' Mr Luxton, from Cornwall, southwest England, said.

'I'd turned up to town looking for farm work. I remember getting out of the club, waking up and there were tubes coming out of me.

'It was horrible, there were tubes down the back of my throat and I couldn't breathe...I don't think I realised how serious it was.'

Mr Luxton, who has been working as a bricklayer while in Australia, was unaware he was on the same bridge where fellow British tourist Caroline Stuttle was killed in 2002.

Chris Luxton was also allegedly robbed of his mobile phone, wallet and other items on the Burnett Traffic Bridge in Bundaberg, a city 385km north of Brisbane

On Tuesday, Queensland police arrested 22-year-old Adams and charged him with grievous bodily harm. He appeared in Bundaberg Magistrates Court that same day and was remanded in custody after bail was denied. He will next appear on July 24.

Adams is also accused of stealing Mr Luxton's mobile phone and wallet during the attack.

Major headache: Luxton required 34 stitches to the back of his head following the attack on Saturday night

Mr Luxton was first taken to the local hospital and then flown to Royal Brisbane Hospital for emergency surgery.

'I was in intensive care,' he said.

'For all I know I could have been a cabbage, all mangled up. I can't fly for six weeks, which was kind of a relief because I'm going to stay as long as I can.

'I've never met so many nice people, there's definitely a few twits everywhere though.'

Mr Luxton's parents Shane and Lin were told of the incident by police when UK officers knocked on their door in the middle of the night.

'My wife just started crying straight away,' said Shane Luxton, who flew to Brisbane on the first available flight.

'One of the police officers said "you ought to sit down, Chris has sustained a serious injury and has been flown to Brisbane hospital".'

Mr Luxton said he 'picked up a credit card, threw some things in a bag' and made his way to the airport for what would be a horrific flight.

Fighting for life: Luxton was put in an induced coma while his father Shane raced to Bundaberg from England

Bridge of horror: The bridge Luxton was allegedly attacked on is the same span that British backpacker Caroline Stuttle was pushed to her death from in 2002

'It was unbelievable - the longest 20 hours of my life,' he said.

'Not knowing what state Chris was going to be in when I arrived, or if he would still be around.'

His son was left with 34 stitches in the back of his head after emergency surgery.

'I still feel a bit groggy,' he said.

'I've got a massive headache but I'm starting to feel a lot better.'

Chris Luxton has fallen in love with Australia during his time in the country and said he has seen most of the east coast, gone sky-diving and scuba diving.

He insisted Saturday night's incident would not stop him getting the most out of his 12-month working visa. 

Mr Luxton was on UK football team Plymouth Argyle's books as a youngster and later played at Newquay and Bodmin Town.

Newquay manager Jim Hilton said: 'He's got such a strong personality, a love for life and cheeky with it, and he's an absolutely superb footballer.'

The 21-year-old still needs to go through a number of medical tests and doctors have not said when he will be discharged from hospital.

Tragedy: Stuttle was also holidaying in Bundaberg when she fell to her death in 2002

The incident happened 12 years after  English backpacker Caroline Stuttle was thrown to her death in 2002 from the very same bridge.

Police described her death as a robbery that went wrong.

The 19-year-old Yorkshire backpacker was on her way to the Great Barrier Reef when she was robbed and thrown from the bridge by Ian Douglas Previte. Mr Previte was sentenced to life in prison in 2004.
