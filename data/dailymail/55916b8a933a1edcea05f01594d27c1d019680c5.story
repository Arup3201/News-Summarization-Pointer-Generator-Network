Roberto Martinez is predicting this will be the tightest season in Barclays Premier League’s history - and believes the next two games will show what hand Everton can take in the major issues.

Having opened the campaign with a 2-2 draw at Leicester, Everton now have back-to-back home games against Arsenal and Chelsea and Martinez is adamant that both clashes will show the progress his side have made since finishing fifth last year.

Everton produced one of their finest performances of the modern era when they dismantled Arsenal 3-0 at Goodison Park in April and Martinez also recorded his first win in charge when Steven Naismith’s header saw off Chelsea last September.

Martinez is confident Everton can improve on how they performed in his debut season, in which they finished fifth with 72 points, but he is reluctant to say how far they can go this time, as he believes this will be the most competitive battle there has ever been between the country’s leading sides.

‘I’m delighted we are facing Arsenal and Chelsea before the end of the transfer window,’ said Martinez. ‘I am pleased with the squad and the focus. That is what you need in football – to face this opposition.

‘I thought we were really fluent last week, we just didn’t get the second goal that would have given us that cushion. Until you play against sides like Arsenal and Chelsea, you don’t have the answers on the pitch. Pre-season has been a real success but we won’t know where we are until after these games.

‘I have heard people saying it is between Manchester City and Chelsea but the League is going to be closer than people think. This season will be very small margins proving crucial from week to week.

‘I see five teams with equal chances of winning the title. I think it is going to be small margins, the tightest that we have ever seen. It is a 10 month competition. I wouldn’t go in to discussing where we can be at the end of the season.’

Martinez, meanwhile, is confident key midfielder Ross Barkley will be back before October after ruling out the prospect of him spending five months on the sidelines with medial ligament damage.

‘He is as you would expect,’ said Martinez. ‘Ross is such a strong boy he has recovered quicker than you would expect but there is still some swelling around the knee and we are taking our time.

‘I don’t know where five months came from. He has a partial tear of his medal ligament. It can take time and I’m sure Ross will be quicker than normal in his recovery but it could be seven, eight or nine weeks. You just don’t know with that type of injury.’

Martinez, meanwhile, believes Aidan McGeady – who scored Everton’s first goal of the season with a thumping effort at the Kingpower Stadium – could be ready to step into Barkley’s shoes. The Republic of Ireland midfielder made a slow start after his move from Spartak Moscow in January but is fitter now.

‘I have seen Aidan coming back in a really good shape,’ said Martinez. ‘We are really excited to see what Aidan can do this year. He scored his first goal for the club and I think the fans are in for a treat as Aidan’s qualities are quite unique. I haven’t seen a footballer with them for such a long time.’
