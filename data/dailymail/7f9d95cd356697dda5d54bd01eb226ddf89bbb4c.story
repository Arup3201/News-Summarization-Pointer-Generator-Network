Newsagents  questioned by police over the sale of copies of Charlie Hebdo say they believe officers were given clear orders to seek customers' details. 

Forces across Britain have repeatedly denied ever instructing officers to make such inquiries, instead claiming their visits to stores were to ease community tensions.

After a handful  in Wiltshire and Wales came forward to say they had faced such questions, police repeated their protestations.

But shop owners and readers of the magazine have today slammed their reaction, saying they have been left 'outraged' by having their claims dismissed. 

Newsagents have expressed fury after police denied claims they instructed officers to demand the names of Charlie Hebdo readers. In one case a force categorically rejected the claim such questions had been asked

Among them is Deborah Merrett, a newsagent in Powys who said she was 'angered and upset' police had rejected her account of the story. 

'I think the police officers were told to come and ask, I think it was their mission,' she told MailOnline today. 

'The way that they have denied it and claimed that they wanted to know about the sales for our own protection is rubbish. 

'I haven't seen any police around here at all since. I was working on my own at the time with a shop full of people when they came in. 

'They asked me who I sold the copies to and do they live in the area but as soon as they did I told them I would not be disclosing customers' names. 

'I've since had customers coming in and begging me not to tell anyone they'd bought the magazine. 

'The whole thing has angered the community and left me and my husband upset.' 

The satirical magazine produced a special edition for its first issue after the attack. Millions of extra copies were printed, with enthusiasts queuing outside shops in London (above) and Paris to purchase one

One customer who bought the magazine said she did not see the difference in police requesting her details and those of people who bought Je Suis Charlie badges or marched in support of the victims of the Paris massacre last month (above)

This morning a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys maintained its denial that such questions were asked, saying: 'We can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded.'

In Pontypridd, another newsagent was allegedly contacted by a PCSO over the phone and asked to share the name of a customer who pre-ordered the magazine's special edition. 

He refused, instead sharing the conversation with the reader, David Jones, the following day. 

When contacted by MailOnline this morning, Mr Jones said: 'I didn't think too much of it at first but when I read about the one in Wiltshire I thought something was very strange.

'They'd said the PCSO was overzealous and had acted on her own and I thought "well that's rubbish."

'When I went to collect my copy, the newsagent told me straight away about how he had been phoned the night before and asked the same questions. 

'He didn't give my name so I didn't complain but now it's being said the case in Wiltshire was down to the officer, that's just clearly not the case.' 

Sir Peter Fahy, national police lead for preventing extremism, said officers who demanded the names of people who bought Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks appeared 'overzealous and unneccessary'

South Wales Police's Prevent team said no directive had ever been given to question newsagents or demand the names of customers who had bought the magazine but was investigating the gentleman's claims. 

His comments were in reference to a PCSO in Wiltshire who, it was said yesterday, acted independently when she asked a store for the names of customers who purchased the publication.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and the national head for preventing extremism, said the staff member involved had been 'overzealous'. 

'I understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary. 

'There was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed.'

A customer of the newsagent denied the claim, telling MailOnline today: ‘I certainly wasn't under the impression the officer had gone in there of her own accord. 

'I don’t think she did and she has been absolutely hung out to dry.'

Anne Keat, a pensioner who said she bought the magazine to support freedom of speech added: 'If they’re going to ask for my name for buying the magazine they should be getting the names of all the people who bought Je Suis Charlie badges and turned out to march in Paris. 

'I don't see the difference between them.' 

Freedom of speech campaigners slammed the police's position in the row as 'unacceptable'. 

 'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication,' Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch said.

'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. 

'Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.' 

Last month 11 members of staff at the French magazine's officers were killed by Islamic Extremists, sparking global outcry and support of freedom of speech. 

Millions of issues of its 'survivor issue' were produced, with queues forming outside newsagents selling the magazine across Europe.
