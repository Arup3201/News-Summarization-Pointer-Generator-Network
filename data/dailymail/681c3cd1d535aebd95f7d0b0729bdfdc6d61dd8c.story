Swedish military has called off the search for a 'Russian underwater vessel' thought to have been lurking in the Stockholm archipelago, after admitting that it was 'definitely not' a submarine.

Navy top brass has today been forced to concede that although 'underwater activity' is confirmed, the military has ruled out the possibility that it could have been a Russian sub.

This comes after Moscow blasted the hunt as 'groundless actions by the Swedish military, based on a Cold War-rhetoric'.

The week-long hunt has involved more than 200 troops, stealth ships and helicopters which have been scouring the waters off Stockholm since last Friday.

The Swedish military's search for a 'foreign underwater activity' in the Baltic Sea has been the country's biggest military mobilisation since the Cold War.

At a press conference this morning, the military confirmed that there had been some form of underwater activity, but that a submarine has been ruled out as the water where the activity took place is too shallow.

The military has not been able to prove ‘type of vessel, nationality or activity,’ Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said.

'There has been a suspected underwater action which is completely unacceptable.'

Rear Admiral Grenstad added: 'It is our conclusion that remaining in the archipelago would not give us more information. That would take weeks.'

He added that although underwater action has been confirmed, the vessel has now left Swedish territory, but some troops will remain to observe the area

The military had received what it described as five credible
reports from the general public regarding  activity by foreign submarines or divers using an
underwater vehicle.

Moscow has denied the reports, refuting claims that any Russian vessels have been involved.

'These baseless actions by the Swedish military, based on a Cold War-rhetoric, will only lead to increased tension in the region,' major-general Igor Konasjenkov told local reporters today.

Some observations have been made during the search, but have been deemed of lesser note, something which the military believes may have been due to a delay in taking action. 

'It is partly because we have come in at a late stage,' Jesper Tengroth, military press officer told Aftonbladet when questioned why nothing has been found.

'When we get the information [from the general public], the suspects have already been there.' 

The vessels were unidentified, but during
the 1980s the Swedish navy from time to time hunted suspected
Soviet submarines in its waters

The incident heightened tensions in a region where
governments are increasingly worried about Russian assertiveness
since the Ukraine crisis.

In another incident, NATO and Swedish fighter jets were
scrambled to intercept a Russian intelligence-gathering plane
that briefly entered Estonian airspace on Tuesday. The Estonian
Foreign Ministry formally protested to Russia.
