For the first time in 13 years, the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues, thanks in no small part to British hitmakers.

Three UK acts - Adele, One Direction and Mumford & Sons - who all won at the Brits awards last week, helped boost global music sales by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £10.9billion ($16.5billion).

The figures were released yesterday by the International 
Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents 1,400 record companies worldwide.

The growth may be modest, but for an 
industry which had seen revenues crash more than 40 per cent since its 1999 peak as it battled rampant internet piracy, it was almost cause to break into song.

For the first time in 13 years, the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues - up by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £10.9bn ($16.5bn)

'It is hard to remember a year for the recording industry that has begun with such a palpable buzz in the air,' said Frances Moore, chief executive of the London-based IFPI.

'These are hard-won successes for an industry that has innovated, battled and transformed itself over a decade.

'They show how the music industry has adapted to the internet world, learned how to meet the needs of consumers and monetised the digital marketplace.'

Soul diva Adele's album 21 became the first record to top the global album sales chart 
for a second year running - selling 8.3million units in 2012.

Also in the top ten best-sellers worldwide were One Direction (with Up All Night and Take Me Home in third and fourth place respectively, each with over 4million sales) and Mumford & Sons at number nine, with Babel which shifted 2.3million.

Meanwhile, Rod Stewart's album, Merry Christmas, Baby, came in at number ten, with sales of 2.6million.

The IFPI said paid-for digital music 
downloads from sites such as Apple's iTunes, along with other new 
sources of revenue, had finally grown enough to compensate for the 
decline of CD sales.

Digital revenues grew by 9 per cent in 2012, the organisation said, bringing their share of total industry revenues to 34 per cent.

Across the world, 4.3billion songs and albums were downloaded in 2012.

The IFPI also said subscription-based Internet music services such as Spotify and Rhapsody had leapt 44 per cent last year, giving them 20million users worldwide.

Some subscription services allow users to listen to songs for free with adverts played every few minutes, while others provide advertising-free music for a monthly fee.

But the IFPI admitted that the industry still faces 'major hurdles' in adjusting to the Internet age.

'Our markets remain rigged by illegal free music,' said Moore.

'This is a problem where governments have a critical role to play, in particular by requiring more cooperation from advertisers, search engines, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and other intermediaries.'

The IFPI figures also revealed that Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen topped the global singles chart for 2012 with her single Call Me Maybe, followed by Gotye's Somebody I Used To Know.

South Korean sensation Psy came third with Gangnam Style, which made history in December when it became the first YouTube video to be viewed a billion times.

Downloads, streaming and the ever-present threat of piracy

Mark Mulligan, of U.K.-based MIDiA consulting, warned that the figures did not mean the industry had put its misery years behind it.

'We're probably near the bottom,' he said, 'but it's so marginal we could easily have another year or two where it could get worse.'

The physical music market - everything from vinyl records to DVDs - continues to contract, losing another $500 million in revenue between 2011 and 2012.

The industry group has placed its bets on downloads, streaming, and subscription services to make up for lost ground, but there's still a long way to go.

Downloads and streaming audio now account for most of the music sold in the United States and Scandinavia, but physical music still accounts for the majority of industry revenue worldwide.

Illegal music downloads remain a problem worldwide, particularly in potentially huge markets such as Russia, India, and China.

Moore urged governments to follow the example of the international enforcement action against Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, accused by American prosecutors of facilitating millions of illegal downloads.

Dotcom, who is fighting an attempt to extradite him from New Zealand to the United States, denies the allegations.

The report hailed the action against Megaupload and sites like The Pirate Bay - which has been blocked by several European countries - but it estimated that 32 per cent of all internet users still regularly downloaded pirated music.

'What other industry has to cope with a third of its customers being able to get copies of its products from illegal services?" Moore said.

With growth uneven across various countries and piracy still a stubborn problem, it could take years for the industry to return to its previous health. If it ever does.

Mulligan said he believes some of the lost revenue may never be recovered, with many casual users who used to buy the odd CD turning to free services such as YouTube, television music channels, or Internet radio instead.

'This is a case of managed decline,' he said, predicting 'a sustainable but smaller market built around more engaged music fans.'
