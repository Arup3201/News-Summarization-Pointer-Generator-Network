France's highest court has confirmed that mayors will face prison if they refuse to perform same-sex marriages because of religious or moral objections.

In a ruling which will be studied intently across Europe, the French Constitutional Council rejected an appeal by officials who do not want to take part in gay weddings.

Roman Catholics and Muslims are among the thousands in France who have expressed their opposition to a new bill introduced this year allowing homosexual marriage.

Marriage row: French mayors will face jail if they refuse to perform gay marriages, such as that of Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau who were the first same-sex couple to marry in France

Starting out: Since Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau were married in May there has been a host of other couples applying to follow suite - to the anger of some French officials

The first gay wedding in France took place in May in the southern city of Montpellier, when Vincent Aubin and Bruno Boileau were married in front of cheering family and friends.

Since then there have been hundreds of applications for similar ceremonies.

As officers of state, French mayors have to officiate the wedding ceremonies, and in June a new law was passed confirming that they cannot raise religious or moral objections to doing so.

Today’s ruling reads: ‘This legislation did not violate their freedom of conscience, and the disputed sections conform with the Constitution’.

It is a huge blow to France's anti-gay marriage movement, which blames liberals within France’s Socialist government for forcing the original gay marriage bill through.

Controversy: Although President Francois Hollande has a long-term partner, Valerie Trierweiler, he has never married, prompting criticism that he has undermined the traditional French family

President Francois Hollande has never been married, and many think he and his left-wing ministers have undermined the traditional French family.

Jean-Michel Colo, the Mayor of Arcangues, in south-west France, is among the many officials who have refused to perform a same-sex marriage ceremony.

The outcry has led to Manuel Valls, the country's Interior Minister, threatening ‘significant sanctions’ including up to three years in prison and fines equivalent to around 40,000 pounds.

Claude Binaud, the Mayor of Matha, also in the south west, said he did not find gay marriage ‘normal’. 

He added: ‘We’re touching on something central to society here – the family.

‘Two girls, I might have said yes, if my back was against the wall. But that’s totally different, they can have children.’
