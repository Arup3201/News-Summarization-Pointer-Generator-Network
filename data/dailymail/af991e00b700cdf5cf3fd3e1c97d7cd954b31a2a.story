The England squad bid farewell to their World Cup training base in Rio de Janiero on Monday as they travelled to Belo Horizonte for what is essentially a dead rubber against Costa Rica.

The mood in the camp looked significantly downbeat, which is all that can be expected after England's participance at the tournament was ended by narrow defeats to Italy and Uruguay.

By contrast, Costa Rica have arguably been the surprise package of the tournament after beating both those teams to seal their qualification into the knock out stages.

For the final game, manager Roy Hodgson is expected to give playing time to those who haven't featured in Brazil yet - with former Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard set to captain the team on what could be his last international appearance.

Steven Gerrard will take a place on the bench before reflecting on whether he continues to lead the Three Lions towards the 2016 European Championships.

Meanwhile, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will leave the World Cup without experiencing any playing time after a recurrence of the knee injury that has kept him out thus far, while Leighton Baines has also been ruled out with hamstring injury.
