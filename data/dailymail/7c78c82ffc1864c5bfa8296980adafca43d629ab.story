England has never been a country synonymous with penalty success, but the women's hockey team went some way to making up for years of hurt by winning their shoot-out to reach the Commonwealth Games final.

Bronze medallists in Delhi four years ago, they are guaranteed to go at least one better in Glasgow after edging a tense semi-final with New Zealand to set up a gold medal match with favourites Australia.

It had looked for a long time like teenager Lily Owsley's first-half goal would be the difference for England at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre, only for Katie Glynn to snatch a last-gasp leveller.

Draw: The match was all-square at 1-1 on the whistle but England scraped through and they will face Australia

England were not to be denied, though, with goalkeeper Maddie Hinch performing heroics in the shoot-out, denying three Kiwi penalties to help secure a thrilling 4-1 penalty win.

'I think in hockey we tend to do alright with penalties, so we had a bit of confidence going into it,' said Hinch.

'It is a case of the girls putting the goals in as well, so the fact they took them gave me some help as well.

'I am renowned for being a bit of geek when it comes to these things. I had done a lot of homework before, so I knew what they would probably resort to doing under pressure.

'I felt ready and it was just a case of going out and executing.'

Hinch laughed when it was suggested she could teach the footballers a thing or two and was understandably delighted after the match.

However, the 25-year-old stopper knows there is little time to relax with the final coming up on Saturday evening.

Opponents Australia enter as clear favourites for the crown, having thrashed South Africa 7-1 in their semi-final and beaten England 3-0 in their Pool B encounter.

The Hockeyroos have won three of the four Commonwealth tournaments and head into the match as reigning champions, yet Hinch is confident of causing an upset.

'I think we can win - we have to go into it with that mindset,' she said. 'They are definitely favourites on this occasion but I think that suits us.

'We're there now, we've really got not much to lose and we're just going to go out and give it a real good go.

'I am looking forward to the contest. It was a good pool game before and I think we will give them a good go.

'I absolutely believe we are good enough to beat them.

'We have to limit their opportunities, there's no doubt about that. They are fantastic at putting the ball in the back of the net.

'We did that today and New Zealand are the same, so we know we can do this. If we keep it tight, we have every chance.'
