A Starbucks super fan ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the coffee chain every day for a whole year as part of a challenge. 

Mother-of-two Beautiful Existence splashed out close to $700 (£423) a month dining at the chain every day of 2013.

PhD student Beautiful Existence, of Seattle, Washington, set herself the 365-day challenge at the turn of the year and has documented her daily intake online, which shows her gorging on a variety of treats.

No cinnamon swirl is safe and no Frappucino goes untouched as Beautiful spends morning, noon and night tucking in at the coffee shop.

She committed to eating every meal of the year from the Seattle-launched chain to try something new and spent birthdays, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals there.

Beautiful, who legally changed her name, said: 'I focused on Starbucks as they are a Pacific Northwest brand and this is my home - I am proud of what we produce for the world.

'I am fearless and wanted to explore new things in my life - I love to test the water and each time I challenge myself, I learn a lot.

Hailing from the birthplace of the world famous cafe chain, she has set herself the aim of completing an annual challenge for the next 20 years

She starts her day with a latte, blueberry porridge, fruit and glass of fruit juice before tucking into a hot sandwich at lunch

'During the year there's not been anything I have really hated, with a limited menu you learn not to be a picky eater pretty quick.

'But there's only a few days left before I get to eat what I want again, needless to say I'm very excited.'

Full-time mum Beautiful can spend up to £20 a day at Starbucks and has whittled her way through the entire menu dozens of times over.

Beautiful then enjoys either salads or paninis for her evening meal, all the while downing caffeine drinks along the way.

Beautiful added: 'The first year long challenge I did was so fantastic that it has lead to me map out more than 25 years worth of personal challenges that I am yet to explore'

Despite the easy eating challenge, Beautiful insists as soon as the novelty of eating out wears off she struggles to continue eating something from the same menu

Beautiful added: 'The first year long challenge I did was so fantastic that it has lead to me map out more than 25 years worth of personal challenges that I am yet to explore.

'Everything from politics to pennies, coffee to communities and everything in between.

'I just want to explore what defines our existence and write all about it on my blogs.

'I had no idea that the world would hear about my challenge, let alone be so passionate about it.

'But what all my challenges come down to are the connections I make with my readers.

'The people that all become part of my year and how they help to shape my challenge day-by-day.'

Despite the easy eating challenge, Beautiful insists as soon as the novelty of eating out wears off she struggles to continue eating something from the same menu.

Beautiful added: 'There's only a few more days to go before I can eat somethingdifferent for a change and I can't wait - it'll probably be a favourite meal from my childhood.

'The first few months were extremely easy but as the months ticked by I had to really remain focused on getting to the end.
