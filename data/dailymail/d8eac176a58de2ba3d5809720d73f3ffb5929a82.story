Apple has slumped from second to 14th in a list of Britain’s favourite brands, while Facebook has dropped out of the top 20 completely.

A new measure of the nation’s favourites has seen people turn away from the American tech brands, while British Airways has made it to the top spot for the first time.

BA dropped its famous slogan ‘The World’s Favourite Airline’ in 2011, however it can now be labelled the UK’s favourite based on the evidence of a study published today.

Struggle: Apple's slump from second to 14th in a list of Britain's favourite brands suggests the company has struggled to maintain its momentum since the death of co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs in 2011

The 2014 Superbrands league table is produced from a combination of nominations from a panel of independent experts and the votes of some 2,900 consumers.

The latest results confirm that Apple has struggled to maintain its momentum since the death of co-founder and chief executive Steve Jobs in 2011.

Recent new products have tended to be incremental improvements on previous designs, such as the thinner and lighter iPad Air, rather than revolutionary.

That could change this year with the company and its British design chief, Sir Jonathan Ive, thought to be about to unveil the Apple iWatch and an Apple brand TV.

Facebook has suffered because of concerns that it has moved from a simple social network to a corporate machine, where people’s likes and online exchanges are mined to allow them to be targeted with advertising.

Its growth rates and have stalled and its future appears to be tied to an ability to use its vast wealth to hoover up any smaller companies that might pose a threat.

Just last week, it paid more than £11billion for the smartphone App company, WhatsApp, which offers a cheap alternative to mobile phone text messages.

The trend seems to have affected Microsoft, which has also slipped down the league from third to sixth place, while Google dropped one position to seventh.

Also dropping out of the top 20 this year are Disney, Hilton, BP and Dulux. Surprisingly, Lego, which is the world’s most popular toy and now at the centre of a hugely successful film, is omitted from the top 20, after making 15th place a year ago.

However, there is good news for Gillette, Cadbury, Andrex, Nike and Shell, which find themselves among the elite brands in a survey that has been running since 1995.

Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of The Centre for Brands Analysis and Chairman of the Superbrands Council said: ‘Apple and the other tech giants have suffered, with Apple particularly struggling to meet arguably unrealistic high expectations.

‘It is increasingly clear that in the 
short-term at least Apple is struggling to maintain its enviable 
innovation record in the eyes of consumers, while failing to inspire 
individuals without its hugely influential leader, the late Steve Jobs.

‘Apple’s reputation is taking a hit while, the fall of its US peers suggests a growing lethargy among consumers towards the

American tech giants in general.’

He said BA, which moved from fourth to first, had won people over with its new slogan, ‘To Fly, To Serve’, which was adopted in 2011 and a deliberate policy of highlighting its ‘Britishness’ and history.

Mr Cheliotis said: ‘British Airways has always performed well in the survey but over the last two years its reputation has climbed to new heights, partly through the cementing of its successful ‘To Fly. To Serve ’ positioning and the residual goodwill from its effective 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games association.’

The success of the airline came at the expense of Rolex, which moved down to second after several years in the top spot.
