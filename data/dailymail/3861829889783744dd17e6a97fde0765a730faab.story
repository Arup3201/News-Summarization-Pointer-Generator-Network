Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama at a press conference during the EU-U.S. summit in Brussels where he warned against cutting military budgets

'Freedom isn't free,' warned U.S. President Barack Obama today, as his defence chief claimed that Russia has continued to build up its forces at Ukraine's eastern border.

The Kremlin last week assured the U.S. that it would not send troops into east Ukraine, but Chuck Hagel claimed 'the reality is that they continue to build up their forces.'

'They [the Russians] need to make sure they stay committed to what Minister (Sergei) Shoigu told me,' the Pentagon chief said after meeting his British counterpart, Philip Hammond.

Meanwhile, the cold conflict turned hot in Crimea where Russian assault teams in speedboats and helicopters captured a Ukrainian ship and moved it to a Russian military port.

Mr Hagel's claims of a Russian military build-up came as Barack Obama said he was concerned that some Nato members are cutting spending on weapons and soldiers.

The U.S. president spoke at a news conference with in Brussels after meeting with European Union leaders to discuss the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.

He said that for collective defence to work, everybody has to pitch in and Nato can't just rely on U.S. and British efforts.

'I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending by some of our partners in Nato,' Obama said. 'The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free.'

The President also met today also with Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who says the trans-Atlantic alliance will increase its military cooperation with Ukraine and help the country to modernise its armed forces.

U.S. defence officials claim that there are now more than 20,000 Russian troops, including airborne units, fighter aircraft and armoured vehicles, deployed near the Ukrainian border.

Amid concerns among Nato states in Eastern Europe over Russia's actions in Ukraine, Mr Hammond, Britain's defence secretary, vowed that the alliance was fully committed to defend the sovereignty of its members.

'I don't think any member of NATO has any doubt that all 28 members are prepared to come to the security interests, if that's what's required, to defend the integrity and sovereignty of those member countries,' he said.

The comments came on a dramatic day in Crimea, where shots rang out and explosions rumbled as Russian special forces seized the last Ukrainian ship left on the peninsula.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed to Fox News that the ship is being moved by the tug boat to a Russian military port facility in the Bay of Donuslav.Â

Russia has now seized 51 vessels belonging to the Ukrainian navy, according to information compiled by Dmitry Tymchuk, director of the Center of Military and Political Research in Kyiv - an organisation he has set up to 'counter propaganda lies about the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula'.

Among the Ukrainian vessels reportedly captured by the Russians are submarine Zaporizhia, management ship Slavutych, landing ship Konstantin Olshansky, landing ship Kirovohrad, minesweeper Chernihiv and minesweeper Cherkasy, reported the Kkyiv Post.

Today Russia accused Ukrainian officials of barring Russian commercial airline crews from going outside their planes in Ukrainian airports. Ukraine denied the allegation.

Tensions between Moscow and Kiev have
 been rising since Russian forces occupied the Crimean Peninsula and 
stayed there throughout the referendum earlier this month where votes 
overwhelmingly supported Russia's annexation.

Russian
 authorities previously complained that Ukrainian border guards have 
singled out Russian men at the frontier and blocked their crossing, 
fearing that they may be activists coming to stir up unrest.

Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that Ukrainian border guards have been forcing cabin crews of Aeroflot, the state-controlled Russian airline, to stay inside their planes.

The ministry said the decision violates international law and ultimately 'poses a threat to the safety of civil aviation' because the crews cannot rest properly.

The ministry said that it had sent protest notes twice to the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow.

Oleg Slobodian, spokesman for the Ukrainian border service, denied any policy to keep Aeroflot crews on their planes.

The only time a crew member was prevented from entry was on March 24, he said, when a passport check revealed that the man had a travel ban. In solidarity, the remainder of the crew remained on board with him.

Ukrainian soldiers on Tuesday began their westward journey from Crimea after Ukraine's fledging government ordered the withdrawal of its troops from the Black Sea peninsula.

China's foreign ministry said today 
that international financial bodies ought to be offering aid to Ukraine 
to ensure its economic stability, though it stopped short of saying 
whether Beijing would participate in such efforts.

Ukrainian
 Finance Minister Oleksander Shlapak says he is negotiating with the 
International Monetary Fund for a loan package of $15 billion to $20 
billion because the economy had been severely weakened by months of 
political turmoil and mismanagement.

U.S.
 President Barack Obama has also urged the IMF to reach agreement 
swiftly on a financial support package for Kiev, which would unlock 
additional aid from the European Union and Washington.

Asked
 about aid for Ukraine, China, whose President Xi Jinping discussed 
Ukraine with Obama on Monday, said that the government 'upholds the 
maintaining of Ukraine's financial stability'.
