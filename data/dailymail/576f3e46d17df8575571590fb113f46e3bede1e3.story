Juan Mata and his Manchester United team-mates appeared in high spirits ahead of their clash with Hull City.

The former Chelsea man posted a cheery photo online of himself with Radamel Falcao, Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera, David de Gea and Marouane Fellaini. 

Louis van Gaal's side will host the Tigers on Saturday, hoping to cement their place in the top four after an important win against Arsenal last week.

One player who won't be available, though, is Luke Shaw. The former Southampton man picked up an ankle ligament injury at the Emirates Stadium and is facing a spell on the sidelines.

'So, Luke [Shaw] sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications,' said Van Gaal. 'He will be out for the next few weeks because of this.' 

There was better news for Daley Blind, who missed the victory over the Gunners through injury. The Dutchman will return to training on Monday, according to the United manager.

He said: ‘I gave Daley Blind a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise. He didn’t have so much holiday because of the World Cup. You may remember the Netherlands were there until the end.

‘He will come back on Monday. Then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player.’
