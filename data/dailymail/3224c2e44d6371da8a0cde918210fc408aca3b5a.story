Accused: Gary Glitter has denied committing a string of sex offences against three girls under 13 in the 1970s and 80s

Gary Glitter has denied committing a string of sex offences against three girls under 13 in the 1970s and 80s. 

The 70-year-old former pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, faces ten charges relating to the alleged historic crimes.

He had already been charged with sex attacks on two girls aged under 13 and 14 in the mid 1970s but as he appeared in court today he faced the further charge in relation to the other girl. 

The singer listened to proceedings at south London’s Southwark Crown Court with the assistance of a hearing device and spoke only to confirm his name and enter not guilty pleas to the charges.

Sporting his trademark goatee, he arrived at court wearing a fedora hat, navy blue double-breasted jacket, grey trousers, a white shirt and a silk pink tie, with dark glasses obscuring his face. 

The accessories have become a trademark look for the ageing rocker, who was once known for his outlandish fashion sense. 

Appearing under his real name, he denied administering a drug and having unlawful sexual intercourse and carrying out the four indecent assaults, and also pleaded not guilty to the other charges. 

Gadd, from Marylebone in central London, is accused of one count of attempted rape and another of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in 1975.

In relation to a second complainant, he faces four charges of indecent assault when she was under the age of 13 in 1977.

He is also accused of plying the girl with drink with the intention to 'stupefy or overpower' her to have sex with him between January and May 1977.

And he faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates and relation to the same girl.

In relation to a third complainant who was under the age of 16, he is charged with two counts of indecent assault between October 1979 and December 1980.

None of the alleged victims can be named for legal reasons. 

Charges: The 70-year-old former pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, faces 10 charges relating to the alleged historic crimes

Judge Alistair McCreath told Gadd he would face trial on January 12 in a case which is expected to last three weeks.

The judge told him: 'You can go now on the same bail you have had up until now to return as and when you are required to but you are aware that your trial has been fixed for January 12.'
