Short-haul air passengers who are delayed by more than three hours can expect to be compensated after airlines lost a legal fight in the European court.

A number of airlines, including British Airways and easyJet, had challenged a 2009 ruling that passengers on flights to and from Europe should be compensated if they are delayed for more than three hours.

Today the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg confirmed the 2009 ruling after the airlines had challenged the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) over the matter.

Pay and delay: Airlines will have to compensate delayed passengers after losing their legal challenge

There will still be exceptional circumstances where compensation will not have to be paid, such as industrial action and extreme weather.

But there are a number of compensation cases that have been put on hold since 2009 for which carriers might now have to pay out.

Passengers on flights starting or ending in the 27-country European Union are entitled to between 250 euros (£203) and 600 euros for delayed or cancelled flights under EU rules. They also apply to any flight outside the EU which takes place on an airline company based in the Union

Today's judgment was welcomed by the CAA which said the situation was now clearer for passengers.

CAA regulatory policy director Iain Osborne said: 'Every year around 200million passengers travel on two million flights to and from the UK, with the vast majority experiencing no problems.

'However, when something does go wrong, there are regulations in place to protect travellers, and the CAA is ready to ensure companies abide by them.

'Today's judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union offers much needed clarity for passengers, the airline industry and the CAA about when compensation must be paid following delays.'

Reaction: easyJet said it was 'disappointed' with the decision, while British Airways noted it was 'aware' of today's ruling and will comply

A British Airways spokesman said: 'We are aware of the ruling and will continue to comply with the regulations.'

Travel company Tui, which was involved in the legal challenge, said: 'We note today's ruling by the ECJ.

'We are committed to treating our customers fairly and will continue to work with the European institutions to ensure that the underlying legislation is revised such that it strikes the right balance for passengers and airlines.'

An easyJet spokesman said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome but we are pleased we have final clarification and certainty on this issue. We will do everything we can to ensure our passengers do not have delays. Our priority is to look after our passengers.'

The ECJ was ruling in a case involving German carrier Lufthansa and another involving TUI Travel, British Airways, easyJet and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

In 2009 the ECJ ruled that compensation should be payable by airlines at the same rates as for cancelled flights, but not if the delay was caused by 'extraordinary circumstances', in a case involving Air France.

At the time, it declared: 'There is no 
justification for treating passengers whose flight is delayed any 
differently when they reach their final destination three hours or more 
after the scheduled arrival time.'

The ruling arose from a 2009 case involving Air France. The ECJ found that air travellers delayed for three or more hours should be compensated the same as those whose flights are cancelled

In the Lufthansa case, passengers sued the airline for compensation in a German court after a flight delay of more than 24 hours. Judges subsequently sought advice from the ECJ.

In the second case, IATA, British Airways, easyJet and TUI Travel challenged the UK Civil Aviation Authority after it rejected their request to be exempted from paying for flight delays. British judges then asked the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for guidance.

The compensation will also apply even if passengers are re-routed by the airline on another flight and still arrive three or more hours late.

The ruling arose from cases referred from German and Austrian courts in which passengers claimed compensation after facing delays - but not cancellations - which meant they arrived at their final destinations 25 and 22 hours after the scheduled time.
