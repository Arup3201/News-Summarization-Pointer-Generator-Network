Manchester United target Angel Di Maria is battling with £60million new-signing James Rodriguez for a place in the Real Madrid team. 

AS dedicate their front page to the pair with the headline 'James or Di Maria - the big question'.

The Spanish newspaper say  Argentina midfielder Di Maria  made a claim for a spot at the Bernabeu in their pre-season friendly against Fiorentina, while his Colombian counterpart 'has not found his place yet' and 'doesn't fully look at home', giving food for thought to those at Old Trafford.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed that United manager Louis van Gaal is keen to bring  26-year-old Di Maria to Manchester as part of a £100m package.

Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo report  Barcelona manager Luis Enrique says 'we are ready' for the new La Liga season and that he reckons they have 'reinforced a lot and very well'.

Marca, on the other hand, lead with Real star Cristiano Ronaldo. The Spanish newspaper say he is 'against the wall' while 'Atletico Madrid have only let in one goal in pre-season'.

Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, the controversial striker having signed from Liverpool for £75m, will feature for Barcelona in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Monday night at the Nou Camp against Mexican club Leon, say Sport. 

It gives Suarez a chance to be unveiled for the first time, the day after the 27-year-old sent Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers a text wishing him well for the new Premier League season.

Over to Italy, where La Gazzetta dello Sport say Fiorentina have topped the pre-season table after their 2-1 win over Real. 

In doing so, they've trumped  Italian foes  Napoli, Palermo and Roma.

Corriere dello Sport use the headline 'Europe calls' as they focus on the Champions League qualifying play-off round beginning for Napoli and the Europa League equivalent for Inter Milan.

Napoli face Spanish club Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday, before Inter take on Icelandic outfit Stjarnan on Wednesday.

Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri tells Tuttosport he is seeking 'another two signings - a defender and a forward who can play in a 3-5-2'. The boss insists 'there has never been a problem' with Andrea Pirlo, who was rumoured to be following former manager Antonio Conte to the exit.

Allegri, though, may not be happy that  Arturo Vidal was caught signing a Manchester United shirt earlier in the week.
