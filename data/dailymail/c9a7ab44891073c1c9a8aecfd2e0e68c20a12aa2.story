Ten ambulances treated passengers at 
the scene and London Fire Brigade used hydraulic cutting equipment to 
free at least one person from the wreckage.

The 58-year-old bus driver was among the three seriously injured, with a further 12 people treated for minor injuries.

A
47-year-old man and 34-year-old woman, the occupants of a Citroen car 
left in a crumpled heap of metal following the smash, today remained in 
hospital.

A police spokesman said: 'At this 
early stage it appear the driver of a "New Bus for London" collided with
a line of stationary traffic from the rear. Enquiries continue to 
establish the circumstances of the incident.

Destruction: The collision on Chelsea Bridge Road, London, left twisted wreckage strewn across the carriageway

'London Ambulance Service also attended and 12 people were treated for minor injuries.

'A further three people, two men and 
one woman, were more seriously injured and taken to a central London 
hospital where they remain - none of their injuries are believed to be 
life threatening.'

Mike Weston, Operations Director for London Buses, said: 'We can confirm one of these buses was a New Bus for London vehicle.

'Our first concern is, of course, for the driver, passengers and others involved in this incident and can confirm the emergency services were in attendance. 

'There will be a thorough investigation into this incident as a matter of urgency.'

TfL
have launched an investigation after an apparent witness claimed one of
the buses had been going too fast and ran a red light.

TfL said the bus would usually have travelled down Lower Sloane Street, before turning left into Pimlico Road. But on this occasion the bus carried straight on a the junction into Chelsea Bridge Road.

This new bus is one of 600 TfL hopes to have on London's streets by 2016 at a cost of £212million.

The buses, described by London Mayor Boris Johnson as 'a brilliant feat of British engineering', were first trialled on route 38 — where several continue to operate alongside conventional double-deckers.

Crash: Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene of the crash to help the injured passengers

On
twitter, @ontheriverdave said: 'This was no ordinary bus, I saw a bus 
with what looked like a stuck throttle/no brakes, big impact, 30mph+ 
really nasty!! :('

He later tweeted: 'crash in Chelsea, I witnessed an out of control bus run a red light and then crash, are new buses safe?'

One man, who did not want to be named, said someone had seen a bus speeding past the Rose and Crown pub 
moments before the crash.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I don’t know if the bus was on its way back the depot, or if it 
had been diverted due to the cycle race, but it certainly had no 
business being on that road, it’s not the number 11 route.'

The Met Police have made no arrests.

New arrival: London Mayor Boris Johnson launched the new Routemaster style bus, which cost £354,000 each, to great fanfare
