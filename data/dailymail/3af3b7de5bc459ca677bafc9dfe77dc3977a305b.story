A disgruntled farmer was so frustrated at the recent cold snap that he wrote 'Where is Spring?' in 40ft-high letters on his snow-covered fields.

Beef farmer Nicholas Stokes, 57, used his quad bike to etch out the giant letters on his land in Ellesmere, Shropshire, as temperatures plunged to -4C over the Easter weekend.

Mr Stokes, who has lived on the farm all his life, said: 'This is the worst spell of freezing weather I have ever known and it's coming off the back of months of persistent rain.

Change in the weather? People make their way along the Long Walk near Windsor Castle in Berkshire in the sunshine, despite temperatures staying cold

'When I saw the snow covering my field I
 just thought I wanted to do something to show my frustration at the 
situation in a humorous way. It was just a bit of fun. Everyone keeps 
wondering what on earth happened to spring this year. I thought I would 
spell it out for everyone to see.'

After spending 30 minutes writing the huge message, Mr Stokes, who has 50 cattle, flew on his microlight aircraft to snap his handiwork.

But long-awaited spring weather is finally expected to arrive this weekend with temperatures set to return to normal, following the coldest March in more than 50 years.

Those in the south will see temperatures up to 10C, only just below typical April averages, with sunshine spreading across the UK - but there will also be unsettled weather including flurries of rain.

MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dobson said: ‘There's definitely a change on the way. We'll notice it next week more than anything, with temperatures returning to normal. Saturday looks like a lovely day for the south.

‘Cold but plenty of sunshine around, although there will be a frosty start. By the end of Saturday it could get up to 10C in the south, which is a few degrees warmer than we have seen and just below the average for April.

‘In the north it will still be fairly cold even on Saturday with rain and sleet about. Temperatures are on the up but the weather won't be that nice. It is turning less cold with temperatures returning to normal but with that rise we'll have lots of rain.’

Average temperatures across the UK will reach 7C to 8C on Saturday, rising to 9C on Sunday and could continue to rise during the week, according to the Met Office.

Temperatures will nearly hit 11C, the average maximum temperature for April nationally, but will still be a few degrees away from the London average of 12C.

Dan Williams, of the Met Office, said: ‘What we'll see is temperatures going much closer to the average but we'll see more unsettled weather with it, about with some brighter, drier spells.’

Farmers today called for the right to bury hundreds of sheep and ponies killed by the heavy snow.

European Union rules mean farmers must send the bodies of animals to collection centres for disposal - but reaching the dead is a difficult task when having to content with huge snow drifts.

Their call came as Britain woke up this morning to the news that temperatures are not expected to break into double figures this week and the weather will continue to be sub-zero overnight.

Three-day forecast: While the next few days are expected to be sunny, temperatures will not breach 9C

Farmer Gareth Wyn Jones, of 
Llanfairfechan, North Wales, who is secretary of the local Carneddau 
Pony Society, said: ‘Under EU legislation we are not allowed to bury 
them. It’s ridiculous.

Two German teenagers are stranded in the Highlands after their van became stuck in snow two weeks ago.

Oliver
 Suft, 19, and Julia Kumschier, 19, of Bavaria, were inspired to visit 
Scotland for the first time after watching 007 film Skyfall, which has 
its climax set in the Highlands.

The
 couple travelled to the slopes of Ben Lawers near Loch Tay in 
Perthshire on March 18 and over two weeks later the snow around their 
Volkswagen van has yet to melt.

The
 teenagers have now become part of the community in the village of 
Bridge of Balgie. They are staying at Milton Croft B&B where they 
are doing odd jobs for food and shelter.

Miss
 Kumschier said: 'We thought it was going to be a cool adventure and 
even took photographs next to the warning sign, but didn't think it was 
going to be a problem.’

‘We 
are in a serious disaster. It is like Siberia and a natural disaster for
 upland farmers. It’s been mentally, physically and financially very 
draining for every farmer. We have lost 26 sheep.’

Farmers have to pay up to £20 for each dead animal to be collected by knackers' yards, but the Farmers’ Union of Wales has called for emergency aid and a relaxation of the rules for burying.

‘We
 have a ridiculous situation whereby it is illegal under EU regulations 
to bury animals, and have to pay for them to be removed and disposed,’ 
said president Emyr Jones, who has a farm near Bala.

‘In many areas every building is 
being used to house livestock. Animals which have to be turned out are 
going out onto deep snow and Arctic conditions. The ewe and lamb losses 
are heart-breaking.’

Defra guidance for farmers states 
that the burial or burning of fallen stock in the open is banned 'due to
 the risk of spreading disease through residues in the soil, groundwater
 or air pollution'.

A Defra (Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs) spokesman said: 'British farmers do a fantastic 
job but the bad weather has been a severe blow.

'We’ve relaxed rules on driver 
hours to allow extra time for essential deliveries of animal feed get 
through to farms. We’ve also permitted farmers with 
red diesel in their tractors to help grit and clear snow from public 
roads to help communities during the bad weather.

'We have asked the 
National Fallen Stock Collectors to consider reduced costs for multiple 
collections of stock from the same farm. If exceptionally bad weather makes 
it very difficult for farmers to get carcases to a vehicle, then 
disposal on site will be allowed.'

'Under EU legislation we are not allowed to bury them. It’s ridiculous. We are in a serious disaster'

Gareth Wyn Jones, farmer in Llanfairfechan, North Wales

Wales Natural Resources and Food 
Minister Alun Davies said: ‘I’m very aware of the extreme difficulties 
farmers are experiencing as a result of the extreme weather we have 
witnessed.

'I have 
asked my Chief Veterinary Officer to look urgently at what the Welsh 
Government can do to alleviate the burden on farmers.’

Wales’ chief vet Christianne Glossop said the Government was looking at applying for a law change.

‘We have got to focus on what they can
 do with their dead stock, whether or not it's possible for us to 
introduce a short-term, time-limited derogation (in the law),’ she told 
BBC Radio Wales.

‘That is 
outside of the current legislation and that's why we're working closely 
with lawyers to figure out how we might do that, if we can.’

Farmers are suffering severe hardship as the prolonged cold weather, animal disease and soaring feed prices have combined to create a ‘perfect storm’, industry experts warned today.

Now the Prince's Countryside Fund has pledged an extra £219,000 in disaster relief aid to ease the burden as forecasters predicted no immediate end to the icy weather.

But despite welfare organisations welcoming the extra cash they said the problem was beyond their means and could require an injection of as much as £1million.

They added that livestock farmers already devastated by bovine TB and the Schmallenberg virus now faced escalating bills to feed the cattle driven indoors by the icy blasts.

Ian Bell, director of the Addington Fund, which provides homes for farming families, said the crisis was bigger than the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak as almost every business was now affected.

He said: ‘It is beyond the capabilities of the farming charities, it is too much for us. I am not a doom-monger but having to deal with this on a day-to-day basis, the whole thing is very depressing.’

As
 hill farmers faced one of their biggest crises since the Sixties, 
temperatures in Fort William in the Scottish Highlands dropped to -5C 
overnight and the cold snap continued for Britain.

Tonight is forecast to be dry and cold 
with lengthy clear spells, although Scotland will see some patchy low 
cloud and mist at times, while there will be a very widespread and 
locally-sharp frost.

Tomorrow will be a dry day for most areas with sunny periods and patchy cloud, with the South seeing cloud and a few light showers and the chance of a few wintry showers in eastern Scotland.

Thursday will be rather cloudy over Scotland with a scattering of showers while elsewhere it will be mainly dry with some sunshine, although the far South will be cloudy with a chance of rain.

Friday will be mainly dry with sunny spells and well-broken cloud, but the far north of Scotland will be cloudy with patchy rain or sleet. It will be staying cold throughout with widespread frosts.

The Environment Agency had 15 flood alerts in place this morning, with 11 of them in the South East.
