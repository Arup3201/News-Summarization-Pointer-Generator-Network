A father and son have been found living in the jungle of Vietnam four decades after they went missing during the country's war with the U.S.

Ho Van Thanh and his son Ho Van Lang apparently fled their home village 40 years ago after a bomb killed three members of their family.

They were discovered by locals looking for firewood in deep forest in the Tay Tra district of Quang Ngai province.

Family: Ho Van Lang, left, and Ho Van Thanh, right, moved to the jungle when their relatives were killed by a mine

Yesterday authorities confirmed that the men were Thanh, 82, and 41-year-old Lang.

The older man once lived a normal life with his family in the hamlet of Tra Kem around the time of the Vietnam War.

But one day his wife and two of his sons were killed by a mine explosion, putting him in a state of shock.

He took his two-year-old son and fled into the jungle, thereafter never having any contact with anyone else.

The pair survived by foraging fruit and cassava from the forest and planting corn.

They wore loincloths made out of tree bark, and lived in a timber hut raised five metres above the ground.

When the foragers saw the two 'jungle men' from a distance acting abnormally, they alerted local authorities.

Speechless: Lang, right, does not appear to know more than a few words of any language

Officials set up a team to track them down, and found them yesterday after a five-hour search.

The father could speak a little of the minority Cor language, but the son knew only a few words.

The pair are now undergoing medical check-ups as a first step to being reintegrated into mainstream society.

It began in 1955 and would continue until the fall of Saigon two decades later.

The Vietnam War was a bloody Cold War-era conflict that claimed 
millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by
 what they had endured.

America's involvement in 
the region was triggered by one belief: that Communism was threatening 
to expand across the whole of South-East Asia.

1955: In October, South
 Vietnam declared itself the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), with newly 
elected Ngo Dinh Diem as president. He would be executed in a coup eight
 years later.

1960: An opposing faction, The National Liberation Front (NLF) - also called the Viet Cong - was established there.

The
 NLF, along with and Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in North 
Vietnam - under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh - wanted to impose a 
communist system over the whole nation.

The United States, in an attempt to 
prevent the spread of communism, trained the Army of the Republic of 
Vietnam (ARVN) and provided military advisers to help fight Ho's 
guerillas.

1964: In August, a U.S. warship was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

This
 led Congress to pass the South-East Asia Resolution which allowed 
President Lyndon Johnson to conduct military operations in the region 
without a declaration of war.

1965: On March 2, U.S. aircraft started bombing targets in Vietnam and the first troops arrived.

1968: The North 
Vietnamese and Viet Cong launch the Tet Offensive, 
attacking about 100 South Vietnamese cities and towns.

On March 16, U.S. soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the town of Mai Lai, later known as the Mai Lai Massacre.

By December, America's troops in Vietnam reached 540,000.

1969: In July, President Nixon ordered the first of many U.S. troop withdrawals from Vietnam.

1970: In April, Nixon announced that U.S. troops would attack enemy
 locations in Cambodia. This news sparked nationwide protests, especially
 on college campuses.

Agent Orange: War crimes are said to have been committed by both sides and one of 
the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort was the widespread use of Agent Orange - which still damages crops 
and is said to cause disease in Vietnam today.

America dumped millions of gallons of Agent Orange - which has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities - and other herbicides on South Vietnam between 1962 and 1971

America's military dumped 20million gallons of the dioxin - which has 
been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities - and other 
herbicides on about a quarter of South Vietnam between 1962 and 
1971, decimating about five million acres of forest.

1972: After years of fighting and agonising negotiations, Nixon ordered the Christmas bombings.

That offensive paved the way for Nixon's Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger to negotiate the January 1973 peace accords that called for a 
cease-fire and the release of prisoners, some of whom had been in 
captivity for nearly six years.

1973: U.S. troops are withdrawn.

1974: After a brief period of peace, North Vietnam recommenced hostilities.

1975: North
 Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30, forcing South Vietnam’s 
surrender and reuniting the country with a one-party communist 
government.

Aftermath: The Hanoi government estimate that in 20 years of fighting, 4million civilians were killed across North and South Vietnam and a 
further 1.1million communist fighters died.

U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese 
soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were 
missing in action when the final troops pulled out.

The war itself gathered heavy opposition in the States and soldiers 
have since recalled being told by superiors to remove their uniforms 
before landing back home to avoid being accosted by campaigners.

Vietnam finally normalised relations with the U.S. in 1995.
