The mother of Ronald Goldman is selling her right to the $9 million wrongful death judgment against OJ Simpson, after waiting 17 years for the jailed star to pay.

Sharon Rufo listed the judgment with a starting price of just $1 million on JudgmentMarketplace.com yesterday.

The founder of the website Shawn Porat told the Associated Press the judgment would be worth $24.7 million after interest was taken into account.

But he said that was only if Simpson pays - the winning bidder will take on the risk of collecting the money from the broke former football star.

Bidding for the judgment will continue for 30 days.

Simpson, 67, has been in a Nevada prison since 2008 when he was convicted of robbery and kidnapping.

OJ is appealing his case to the Nevada Supreme Court but he's more hopeful he will be released when he is up for his next parole hearing in 2017.

Two years later he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death suit filed by the Goldman family.

Simpson has paid little of the $33.5 million judgment against him in that case.

OJ Simpson has been drumming up some big goals as he serves his 33 year prison sentence in Nevada for a 2008 robbery and kidnapping conviction.

The 67-year-old former football player has a major crush on Kim Kardashian and plans on dating her once he's released from the slammer, according to RadarOnline.

The one-time murder suspect reportedly doesn't find it a roadblock that the 33-year-old reality star is already married to Kanye West.

The incarcerated senior citizen already knows the E! beauty because her late father Robert represented him when he was on trial for the murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson.

'OJ has a creepy obsession with Kim,' a source from inside his prison told the site.

That obsession includes a wall decorated with alluring photos of the mother to baby North, aged one.

'He has several sexy pictures of Kim hanging up in his prison cell from her 2007 Playboy shot and he isn’t shy about showing her picture to fellow inmates,' Radar's source said.
