They market themselves as a state full of untouched wilderness, craft beer and edgy art exhibits, but Tasmania can't shake its reputation as the bogan capital of Australia.

Finalists for the title of Biggest Bogan in Australia were announced on comedian Paul Fenech's Seven Network TV series Bogan Hunters on Tuesday night and four of the seven finalists hail from the country's southernmost state.

Tasmania scooped the pool with Bogan Hunters hosts suggesting it should secede from the rest of the country and 'become its own bogan state'.

Clint Saxon was one of four finalists to hail from Tasmania in a nationwide search for the biggest bogan in Australia on Channel Seven's The Bogan Hunters

None of the finalists in the nationwide search came from NSW or Queensland, with one finalist each from Victoria, West Australia and South Australia.

Tasmania's top four entrants included Andrew, a man with no teeth who has the names and birthdates of his eight children tattooed down his arms because he's always too 'smashed' to remember them.

'That way if I go to Centrelink and they I ask me I can say “Here we go”,' he told the camera.

Justin, also from Tasmania, is the competition's youngest finalist in his early 20s. He was commended by the judges for his variety of tattoos, including an artistic representation of his ex-girlfriend, whom he got pregnant when he was just 16

His best mate Darren, also from Tasmania, made the finals of the competition, largely for his driving record.

He has 52 driving offences to his name and a 'car graveyard' full of burnt out cars, some of which were destroyed by his own dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.

Justin is the competition's youngest finalist, in his early 20s. He was commended by the judges for his 'Aussie pride', evident in the presence of a Made in Australia tattoo on his arm and a Southern Cross tattoo on his shoulder.

He also has a tattoo that takes up all of his chest and stomach – an artistic representation of his ex-girlfriend, whom he got pregnant when he was just 16.

Clint Saxon, the final Tassie contender, hails from Georgetown, which he calls the 'boganest place in the world'.

Judges said he made the final list because he 'ticked so many bogan boxes', including naming 'doggie style' as his favourite sex position and flaunting some 'homemade' tattoos done by his missus.

But Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, said despite Tasmania earning four spots in The Bogan Hunter final, most people had 'laughed off' the show and its bogan portrayal of Tasmania.

'I think Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and we want people to share our stories, so if that makes us bogans then so be it,' Mr Martin told Daily Mail Australia.

'We’re a bit different, we’re a bit quirky. I guess it depends if you think a bogan is (something) negative.'

Mr Martin said the effect of the show on Tasmania's tourism would be 'non-existent'.

'Anyone who is not going to come to Tasmania… because of a silly TV show, they’re probably not the type of market that’s coming here anyway,' he said.

'It's a bit of a contradiction because of our emerging reputation for art and culture. I suppose we're the bogan capital and one of the most sophisticated destinations on the world map.'

Tasmania's dubious honour of the bogan capital has come as a Tasmanian mayor was forced to deny he called his constituents 'bogans'.

Bertrand Cadart, the mayor of Glamorgan Spring Bay, came under fire for suggesting the opponents of a tourist venture on the state's east coast are 'the most bogan of bogans'.

'The people here, they are too disparate, you know, from the most bogan of bogans... to the greenest pains in the arse,' Mr Cadart told The Monthly magazine.

He later insisted he was not talking specifically about his constituents but about people from all over Tasmania who oppose environmentalist Graeme Wood's plan to turn a former woodchip mill at Triabunna into a tourism complex.

The winner of Bogan Hunter will be announced next Tuesday following a showdown on who has the best bogan appearance, attitude and sex appeal.

The champ wins the Golden Thong award and a ute full of beer.

Bogan Hunters grand final airs Tuesday, July 8 at 9.30pm on the Seven Network's 7mate.
