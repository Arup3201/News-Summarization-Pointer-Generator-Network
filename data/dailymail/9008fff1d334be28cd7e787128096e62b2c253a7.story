An alarming number of Australians are excusing the actions of rapists or domestic violence offenders by shifting the blame on the victim, a new survey reveals.

A nationwide survey of 17,500 people recorded their attitudes towards violence against women, where one in five people believe that if the victim is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, then she is partially at fault for rape.

The VicHealth report also found that 40 per cent of those who were surveyed thought many women who said they had been raped had given the man the wrong impression by leading him on and later had regrets, the Herald Sun reports.

There's also an increase of viewpoints justifying rape and domestic violence

Among those surveyed, 16 per cent believed that women who were raped who said 'no' often mean to say 'yes'.

The National Community Attitudes Survey also found disturbing views that justify rape and violence are on the rise.

Compared to last year's figures, the number increased from four to 10 for those who thought rape occurred because men could not control their need for sex.

Almost a quarter of Australians believed domestic violence is excusable if the attacker is unable to control their anger or regrets the act.

VicHealth chief executive Jerril Rechter told the Herald Sun she had concerns over the number of people who defended such acts and were also under the impression women were part of the issue.

'A culture that excuses rape and violence is one that allows it to happen,' she said.

'Violence is a choice, not an instinct and it is never excusable.' 

Earlier this month a nationwide Our Watch campaign was launched as part of the foundation's strategy to prevent domestic violence in 20 years.

The initiative, to stop violence against women and children through community and school programs, revealed that one woman is killed almost every week by a current or former partner in Australia.
