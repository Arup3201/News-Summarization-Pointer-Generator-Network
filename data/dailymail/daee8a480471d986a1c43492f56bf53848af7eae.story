Wanted: Daniel Andreas San Diego, suspected of 2003 terrorist attacks, has been spotted in Massachusetts

A fugitive on the FBI's 'Most Wanted Terrorists' list, linked to two bombings near San Francisco, may be hiding in western Massachusetts.

Daniel Andreas San Diego, the first domestic terrorism suspect added to the list, was allegedly involved in bombings at a biotechnology firm and a nutritional products company in California in 2003, the FBI said.

He disappeared before being taken into custody after a federal arrest warrant was issued in October 2003.

The FBI said San Diego may be in the Northampton area, about 20 miles north of Springfield in the western part of Massachusetts.

The bureau bases its intelligence on a recent tip from the TV programme America's Most Wanted.

According to the FBI, San Diego has ties to animal rights extremist groups. The bureau is seeking public help to track him down and have offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading directly to his arrest.

San Diego, originally a California resident, is described by the FBI as a white male, about 33 years old, six feet tall and around 160lb, with brown hair and brown eyes.

He has several tattoos, including a large round image of burning hillsides in the center of his chest.

At the time of his disappearance, San Diego did not eat any meat or any food containing animal products, and the FBI believes he may be preparing vegetarian and vegan foods for sale, as a way of making money.

He also may be using his computer networking skills.

Early in the morning of August 28, 2003, two homemade bombs exploded one hour apart at Chiron 
Corporation, a biotech company, based in Emeryville, California.

The FBI believes the second bomb was timed to explode as 
emergency services were dealing with the aftermath of the first.

No-one was hurt in either blast.

Less than a month later, at 3.22am on September 26, a nail bomb exploded at Shaklee 
Corporation, which makes nutritional supplements and eco-friendly 
shampoos and lotions - in Pleasanton, Calififornia.

No-one was hurt in this bombing either.

Both companies had links to Huntingdon Life Company, a company that conducted laboratory 
testing on animals.

After each of the attacks, an animal rights group called the Revolutionary Cells-Liberation Brigade posted an e-mail taking responsibility for the bombings.

It warned Chiron and Shaklee that, if they and others did not sever links to Huntington, the bombs would increase in size and employees' homes and families would become targets.

FBI Agents began tracking San Diego, suspecting he might have part of the group.

But San Diego must have realised he was being shadowed, as he parked his car in downtown San Francisco on October 6, 2003, and walked away.

He never returned to his car and has not been seen since.
