After two years of turmoil, rebellion and bitter conflict, a new era of European rugby is about to begin.

On Thursday night,  Gloucester and Brive launch the Challenge Cup and then on Friday  night at The Stoop, the main event begins when Harlequins take on Castres in the Champions Cup.

For all the angst and animosity that so nearly led to the collapse of continental competition, there is a sense of familiarity about the tournaments that have hastily emerged from the wreckage.

Reduction from six pools to five with the three best runners-up qualifying for last eight knockout phase.

Qualification now solely dependent on league position with winners this year not guaranteed a spot next year.

No drop-down qualification from main competition to the Challenge Cup.

Tournament will be televised on Sky and BT Sport following a lucrative new television deal.

Asked on Wednesday if the revamped competition feels much different from its predecessor, the Heineken Cup, Northampton’s England flanker, Tom Wood, said: ‘No, not at all. It feels exactly the same. It doesn’t change anything - we prepare the same, it’s still a great competition and it’s still a long old haul to get here.’

In terms of front-of-house alterations, there are now 20 teams involved in five pools, rather than the old format of 24 sides in six pools, which should - in principle - lead to a strengthening of the pool stages, now that some of the weakest links have been removed. The tournament’s greater meritocracy is a definite plus point.

‘This competition is meant to be an elite competition and it certainly has the feel of that this season,’ said Mark McCall, the director of rugby at Saracens - who have been the Aviva Premiership’s standard-bearers in Europe in recent seasons. They are bracing themselves for a pool of staggering quality.

The last time the Heineken Cup was won by an English side was on May 20, 2007 when Wasps beat Leicester Tigers 25-9 in front of 81,076 fans at Twickenham.

‘Ourselves, Clermont and Munster were in the semi-finals last year and the year before, so we know it’s going to be incredibly difficult to get through the group,’ McCall added. ‘Last year, we got a more favourable group and there was an expectation that we would get into the quarter-finals. This year, it would be an achievement in itself to get through the pool.’

Bath are back at the top table after years among the second tier in the Challenge Cup. Their form suggests they can mount a compelling quest to reach the quarter-finals, but captain Stuart Hooper knows they have their hands full against Glasgow, Montpellier and Toulouse in Pool 4.

‘The way the competition is set up, teams qualify on merit so you’ve got the 20 best teams in Europe,’ said the lock. ‘With the French teams in our group, you’re going to come up against some of the best players in the world.’ 

The English clubs may soon recognise the wisdom of the old adage — be careful what you wish for. Premiership Rugby led the Anglo-French breakaway in order to secure wide-ranging reforms of the European game, but the immediate up-shot is that they may find it even harder to make their mark in the leading tournament.

While the inaugural Champions Cup represents a fresh start, the backdrop has not radically shifted. 

The new format with 20 teams instead of 24 ensures the best sides in Europe are going head-to-head, says Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall, who led Owen Farrell and his side to last year's Heineken Cup final

French clubs have the biggest budgets and therefore the greatest depth of players, but what they don’t necessarily have across the board is extreme motivation. 

Some Gallic sides will once again react to early defeats by sending out weakened line-ups and focusing on domestic matters.

One reason for English struggles in recent times has been the impact of the Irish, based on careful management of their players, in order to peak for these European windows. 

Now that qualification reform has put a greater emphasis on Pro12 results, Leinster, Munster and Ulster may have to work their stars harder, which may undermine their continental prospects.

To take an example from each province, Paul O’Connell has played just three full Pro12 games for Munster so far this season, but Jamie Heaslip and Rory Best have each made four starting appearances and one off the bench for Leinster and Ulster respectively.

Welsh hopes seemingly rest with the Ospreys, who are the only unbeaten team in Europe. There are just two regions involved this time and one side from each of Scotland and Italy. The standards may rise, but the lack of variety will be most keenly felt in three pools featuring two teams from the same nation. Sale v Saracens, Wasps v Harlequins and Toulouse v Montpellier lack the novelty value of classic European fixtures.

Still, the Champions Cup promises to be fascinating. It has been a mad rush to put arrangements in place and there will be a period of transition behind the scenes, but the hope must be that the new era delivers the glorious drama that the Heineken Cup became adored for.

POOL BY POOL GUIDE AS RUGBY STARTS A NEW ERA

 

Classic pool of death, containing three of last season’s semi-finalists. 

Clermont have the players, pedigree and home fortress to top the pile, but Saracens have the depth and belief to run them close. 

Munster are dangerous in Limerick but not the force of old. So tough for Sale.

FIXTURES

Oct 18: Sale v Munster, Saracens v Clermont. 

Oct 24: Munster v Saracens 

Oct 26: Clermont v Sale 

Dec 6: Sale v Saracens, Munster v Clermont 

Dec 13: Saracens v Sale 

Dec 14: Clermont v Munster 

Jan 17: Sale v Clermont, Saracens v Munster

Jan 24: Clermont v Saracens, Munster v Sale.

PREDICTION 

1 Clermont (To Qualify)

2 Saracens

3 Munster 

4 Sale

Leinster are favourites on reputation, having won the title three times in the last six years, but they no longer have Brian O’Driscoll’s reassuring presence and they’re not yet in top gear.

Resurgent Wasps will believe they can edge out Harlequins to finish as runners-up, while Castres are likely to be pre-occupied with a misfiring league campaign.

FIXTURES

Oct 17: Quins v Castres

Oct 19: Leinster v Wasps 

Oct 26: Castres v Leinster, Wasps v Quins  

Dec 7: Castres v Wasps, Quins v Leinster   

Dec 13: Leinster v Quins 

Dec 14: Wasps v Castres 

Jan 17: Quins v Wasps, Leinster v Castres 

Jan 24: Castres v Quins, Wasps v Leinster

PREDICTION 

1) Leinster (Q)

2) Wasps

3) Quins 

4) Castres

 

Reigning European champions Toulon will be expected to dominate. 

However, their defeat in Cardiff last season shows that they are vulnerable in the group phase. 

Leicester are undermined by injuries, so Ulster are likely to provide the primary threat to Toulon, while the Scarlets may lack the all-round power.

FIXTURES 

Oct 18: Leicester v Ulster 

Oct 19: Toulon v Scarlets 

Oct 25: Ulster v Toulon, Scarlets v Leicester

Dec 6: Ulster v Scarlets 

Dec 7: Leicester v Toulon 

Dec 13: Toulon v Leicester 

Dec 14: Scarlets v Ulster 

Jan 17: Toulon v Ulster, Leicester v Scarlets 

Jan 24: Scarlets v Toulon, Ulster v Leicester

PREDICTION

1 Toulon (Q)

2 Ulster (Q)

3 Leicester

4 Scarlets

Predictions are tough. Toulouse are the European aristocrats seemingly in decline, but they swept aside Toulon last weekend, to provide impetus. 

Glasgow are riding high in the Pro12, while Bath and Montpellier lie fourth in England and France respectively. Bath have the firepower, and confidence to finish first in this tricky group.

FIXTURES  

Oct 18: Glasgow v Bath 

Oct 19: Toulouse v Montpellier 

Oct 25: Bath v Toulouse, Montpellier v Glasgow 

Dec 5: Montpellier v Bath 

Dec 7: Toulouse v Glasgow

Dec 12: Bath v Montpellier 

Dec 13: Glasgow v Toulouse 

Jan 17: Toulouse v Bath, Glasgow v Montpellier 

Jan 24: Montpellier v Toulouse, Bath v Glasgow

PREDICTION 

1 Bath (Q)

2 Toulouse (Q)

3 Glasgow

4 Montpellier

Much rests on the opening clash between Northampton and Racing Metro. 

If the Saints prevail then the Parisians’ interest will soon wane. 

In that event, the Ospreys may qualify. Treviso will struggle.
