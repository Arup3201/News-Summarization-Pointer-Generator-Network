The Conservatives were tonight seeking a last-minute agreement on press regulation ahead of a crunch Commons vote.

Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that he hoped a last-minute deal could still be found and warned a regulatory system that did not have cross-party support might not last.

And tonight Culture Secretary Maria Miller suggested that the three political parties may be closer to a compromise.

Rival proposals for a new system of 
newspaper self-regulation will face judgment tomorrow in a high-stakes 
battle over the response to the phone-hacking scandal.

Ms Miller told Sky News: 'We're very clear 
that we don't want to see statutory regulation of the press in this 
country - we think it would have a chilling effect on journalism.

'I hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can 
really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here.

'I think there's been compromise on both sides to make the Leveson 
report work in practice. We're still in the position where the Labour 
party have put forward a statutory regulation of the press.

'We want to take the discussion to Parliament and I think we can make a 
very strong case that the royal charter proposals are the right way 
forward.'

Crunch time: Chancellor George Osborne (pictured on today's Andrew Marr Show) said he hoped a last-minute deal could still be found and warned a system that did not have cross-party support might not last

Her comments came after Mr Osborne told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘We want to make sure we have a system of press regulation that prevents the abuses we saw in the past happening again, but also makes sure we have a free press.

‘That is such a precious thing: people fought - and literally died - to give us a free press. The Prime Minister has already achieved a huge amount in protecting a free press from those who want to undermine it.

'I hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here'

‘I would say it would be great on Monday if we can get some kind of agreement, even at this late stage, between the parties.

‘Because, frankly, I think press regulation which is achieved in a way which divides the political parties is not press regulation that is really going to last, and it is not going to be a press regulation which is deeply-rooted in our culture.

‘There is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a press law that works. Ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this; we are about getting a press law that works.’

In a reversal of the Westminster status quo, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are lining up against the Conservatives in a coalition for a tougher regime.

Disagreements: The Lib/Lab plan involves underpinning a system in legislation, something which has been opposed by Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) as a risk to press freedom

Both sides propose using a royal charter to create a new watchdog body in response to the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry into abuses by the press.

But the Lib/Lab version involves underpinning the system in legislation, something which has been opposed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a risk to press freedom.

It also rules out a veto for the press over the membership of the watchdog and gives the regulator the power to enforce the publication of prominent apologies.

Mr Cameron - who dramatically pulled the plug on cross-party talks on Thursday - has said he will abide by the will of parliament.

Without an overall Commons majority, allies accept he is unlikely to win sufficient support for using the threat of punitive damages against non-participants to persuade papers to sign up.

Despite efforts to shore up the vote - including bringing a minister back from Japan - a number of Tories are expected to back the Lib/Lab proposals.

Campaigning: Ed Miliband urged MPs to 'stand up for the victims' of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator

Mr Cameron insists his proposal is ‘the fastest possible way to deliver the strong self-regulation body that Leveson proposed that can put in place million-pound fines, prominent apologies and get justice for victims in this country’.

However he yesterday indicated that he did not consider the Lib/Lab proposed statutory underpinning ‘a big issue of principle’ and said he was ‘confident about the future’.

'Monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims'

Labour leader Ed Miliband

‘We're now in sight of getting that regulator with million pound fines and proper regulation in our country,’ he said.

‘The idea of a law, a great big all singing, all dancing media law that would have been bad for press freedom, bad for individual freedom - that's off the table.’

He insisted he too was acting as ‘a friend of the victims’ of phone hacking.

Meanwhile Labour leader Ed Miliband urged MPs to ‘stand up for the victims’ of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator.

‘Monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims,’ he told the Observer.

Opinions: Actor Hugh Grant, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign, said victims would support the Lib/Lab package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts Leveson only 'reasonably well'

‘I think it is an important moment because we have had decades of failing to ensure that we have a system of press complaints and redress which means that ordinary people aren't left at the whim of a sometimes abusive press.’

But Mr Miliband said all politicians now needed to follow their instincts about what was right.

There was criticism of the failure to incorporate fully Lord Justice Leveson's proposals from the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Actor Hugh Grant, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign, said victims such as the Dowlers would support the Lib/Lab package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts Leveson only ‘reasonably well’.

He insisted there were ‘gigantic differences’ with the Prime Minister's scheme, which was ‘cunningly designed’ to return to the previous discredited system.

‘It was never ideal that this would be done by royal charter. That seemed to us strange to haul this medieval instrument out of history,’ he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.

‘But the important victims of this - I do not include people like myself, I am talking about people like the Dowlers etc - would be supportive of it, yes.

‘MPs promised victims to do right by them and they have that chance on Monday.’

The actor confirmed that he personally called members of the shadow cabinet last week to warn them not to settle ‘much too early’ amid signs of cross-party agreement.

Unimpressed: Author JK Rowling said victims had been 'hung out to dry' by Mr Cameron and urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to 'have the courage' to protect them

But he dismissed the idea that Hacked Off was a ‘smooth sinister operation’ - mocking his colleagues such as ex-MP Evan Harris and director Professor Brian Cathcart.

Mr Grant said: ‘It's a few dandruffy professors sitting in a cheap office with a slightly insane, chess champion ex-Lib Dem MP and a couple of threadbare lawyers and me.’

Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said Labour was talking to ‘many’ Tory MPs it hoped to join it - but held out the prospect of Mr Cameron avoiding defeat by doing a deal.

There were ‘just a few issues’ remaining between the two sides - with the ‘substantive’ ones being the powers to force prominent apologies and the press veto over membership.

‘We've always said we would like to reach agreement and actually we could then come to the House of Commons with an agreed position and say 'yes, this is what we want,’ she told the Sky News Murnaghan programme.

‘There are just a few issues that remain between us, but they are quite important ones.’

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes suggested between 20 and 60 Tory MPs could rebel and be joined by smaller parties - which would mean a very heavy defeat for Mr Cameron.

‘On our side of the argument there are Conservatives - up to 60 at the maximum but probably 20 core people.

‘There are Irish parties, nationalist parties, the Green Party, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and possibly some Tories - now that's quite a big coalition.’

Author JK Rowling - who gave evidence to Leveson about press intrusion into her family's privacy - said victims had been ‘hung out to dry’ by Mr Cameron and urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to ‘have the courage’ to protect them.

She said she would not ‘support anything that hampers the press's ability to hold power to account’ but that the Leveson recommendations were ‘reasonable and proportionate’.

Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt said major publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘Leveson compliant’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about press freedom.

He welcomed the parties' agreement on a royal charter and noted that Lord Justice Leveson concluded that ‘the last thing he wanted was statutory press regulation’.

‘All those that I have consulted who are the publishers, they have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start - with teeth,’ he told Murnaghan.

‘Probably the strongest regulatory body in Europe: ability to fine; ability to carry out investigations.

‘They have all signed up to that and they just say “we don't need statute; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the UK now has a press law”.’
