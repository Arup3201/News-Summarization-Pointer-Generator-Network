A young New York Senate candidate suddenly stepped down from her campaign last night, admitting she had cheated on her husband just this month.

Gia Arnold, a 24-year-old mother of three and favourite of the Republican Party's radical right Tea Party faction, announced her decision with a letter posted on Facebook.

'I participated in an extramarital affair beginning in August of this year,' she wrote. 'It was an excuse for an escape from an already declining marriage.

Libertarian: Gia Arnold has quit the race for New York Senate and admitted to having an affair

'Escape from a declining marriage': The 24-year-old mother of three had run on a radical right Tea Party ticket

'I cannot regret the decisions I have made, but I can admit to being happier presently than before.

'It is for my ex husband, my children, my family and friends that I must publicly admit to my actions as I believe honesty and integrity are of utmost importance in life.

'I hope that all [the people] I have disappointed will understand that I am only human and imperfect.'

Ms Arnold, from Holley, a farming village in New York's Orleans County, had been running to replace retiring Republican Senator George Maziarz in District 62.

Ms Arnold says she separated from her husband after beginning the affair on August 1. She told the Associated Press she decided to publicise her personal difficulties because she had run on a platform of honesty and transparency.

While she's suspending her campaign, Ms Arnold says she's not dropping out. Her name will appear on next month's Republican primary ballot and she says that she'll serve if elected.

'Dedicated to integrity': Former supporters accused Ms Arnold of having a different definition of the word

But in light of her surprise admission, she may not be able to count on retaining much support from her former fan base among the radical right Tea Party grouping.

The top ranked comment responding to her Facebook post accused her of betraying her supporters.

Gordon Thomas wrote: 'All of us who have supported you over the past year from near and far feel like we've been kicked in the gut... but that must pale in comparison to how your family feels.

'You have a funny way of showing "integrity". Our definitions must be different.'

'Free to make choices': Ms Arnold had positioned herself politically as a libertarian conservative

Ms Arnold, from Holley, a farming village in New York's Orleans County, had been running to replace retiring Republican Senator George Maziarz in District 62.

She had positioned herself politically as a libertarian conservative.

Appropriately in the light of the most recent development, her online manifesto quotes her as saying: 'Individuals should be free to make choices for themselves and to accept responsibility for the consequences of the choices they make [...]

'Our support of an individual’s right to make choices in life does not mean that she necessarily approves or disapproves of those choices.'
