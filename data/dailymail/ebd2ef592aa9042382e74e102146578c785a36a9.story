We've all been there after a big night out, or a lazy Sunday morning. 

Feeling a bit worse for wear and wanting the only thing can provide the cure - a great mound of fast-food delivered straight to the door.

And now, thanks to  Alex Howsam's One Delivery franchise - delivering well-known takeaways and meals straight to the sofa -  those needs can be catered for.

Meals from fast food chains such as McDonald's, KFC (pictured), Pizza Express and Burger King are on offer 

Ms Howsam, from Stockton, delivers meals from McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Express and Burger King - adding a 20 per cent mark-up cost on top of the food price.

The 31-year-old even offers Sunday roasts from local pub The Penny Black, in Hartburn, Stockton.

But she said it's not just the hungover masses making use of the new service - in fact it's mainly people who are just keen to enjoy their favourite takeaway in their PJs.

Ms Howsam, from Grangefield, who has a fleet of delivery drivers, said: 'I was looking for something to do for extra cash and I saw the franchise advertised on a jobs' website.

'I just thought that I'd give it a go,' she continued. 

A golf enthusiast, Ms Howsam works full-time as an optician dispenser, and runs the service nightly between 6pm and 10pm. 

She also accepts delivery orders on a Sunday morning and afternoon

Ms Howsam has done a Saturday on an ad-hoc basis and is looking to also eventually increase the times and areas she covers - as well as the scope of restaurants. Deliveries are to all of Stockton and in the Middlesbrough town centre area.

A specialist kit is used to keep the food fresh and warm en-route and her profit comes from a mark-up of the food of around 20 per cent as delivery is free.

She added: 'It's been going great and we have lots of regular customers.

'McDonald's is the clear favourite - and there is one guy who just orders McFlurries.

'There are a lot of students. I don't actually get that many hungover people - which I thought it would mainly be when I first started.

'We get people who are just totally desperate for their fast food fix in their PJs!'
