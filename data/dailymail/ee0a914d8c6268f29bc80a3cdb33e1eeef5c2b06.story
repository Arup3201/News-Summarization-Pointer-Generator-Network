The lift began its upward journey with three people inside – but by the time it reached its destination, there were four.

Mother-to-be Ashley Ward, 26, accompanied by her sister Lauren, was being moved to a hospital maternity unit by porter Ian Ramsbottom when the lift shuddered to a halt between the first and second floors.

Mr Ramsbottom forced the doors open – but all he could see was a wall. He used the lift intercom to contact staff, who called in the fire brigade.

Relief: Ashley delivered her son Thomas in a stuck lift with the help of a porter and her sister Lauren

In the meantime, Miss Ward’s 
contractions intensified, so midwives shouted instructions to Mr 
Ramsbottom, 43, and Lauren, 20, who delivered baby Thomas on the floor 
of the lift at North Manchester General Hospital around 2am on Thursday.

Thomas wasn’t breathing so Lauren, 20, rubbed his back and after a few seconds he cried - to the cheers of the crowd outside.

Mr Ramsbottom then took off his T-shirt and wrapped it around the newborn to keep him warm.

Half an hour after the lift became stuck it started moving again and mother and baby were checked over before being given a clean bill of health.

The fire brigade wasn’t needed as the 
lift started moving again after half an hour, and mother and baby – 
weighing 7lb 10oz – were given a clean bill of health at the maternity 
unit.

They are recovering at home in 
Manchester with Thomas’s proud father Tommy McDonagh and 17-month-old 
brother Konor.

Miss Ward, 26, said: 'I was in agony when we got in the lift so I knew the baby wasn't far off.

'Then the lift shuddered and stopped 
but I didn’t realise we were stuck until the porter told us - I felt 
like we were in a film. It was very painful and I was so scared thinking
what could go wrong but it all happened very quickly, I just shut my 
eyes and pushed.

'He is perfect and everyone has been amazing. Lauren was very calm and the porter was brilliant trying to keep us calm.

'When he cried I knew he was alright, there were 20 or so
people waiting as we got pushed out of the lift and they were all cheering but
I was dazed and I just wanted to rest.'

Thomas didn't breathe for a few seconds but cried after Lauren rubbed his back

Ashley was stuck between the first and second floor at North Manchester General Hospital

Ms Ward had been due to be induced on Thursday because her baby was almost two weeks late.

But her contractions started at around midnight and she and sister 
Lauren, arrived at the hospital's A and E unit two hours later.

She was being pushed to maternity when she became trapped in the lift.

Lauren and Ian managed to get Ashley out of the wheelchair and onto the floor just as her waters broke.

Lauren then spotted the baby's head and Ashley said she simply couldn't resist the urge to push. Minutes later 
Lauren was holding Thomas.

Lauren said: 'They told me to rub 
him, I wasn't breathing either but I rubbed his back, his neck, his legs
and although it seemed to take ages a few seconds later he start crying
and we were all so relieved.'

North Manchester General midwives say although it is not uncommon for 
babies to be born in the car park this is the first time the remember a 
delivery in the lift.

Mary Symington, midwifery matron for inpatient services, said: 'We were pleased that Ashley and Thomas had a safe, if slightly unusual delivery.'

Porter Ian, 43, who has worked at the hospital since April 2010, said: 'I am really pleased that I was able to help deliver baby Thomas.

'I would never have believed that I could have done that.  This is an experience that I will never forget.'
