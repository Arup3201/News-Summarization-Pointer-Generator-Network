U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people.

U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles.

Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation. 

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa.

Ahmed Abdi Godane is believed one of six people killed when a drone fired on his two-car convoy in Somalia on Monday night, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the death

Dangerous as ever: Even though al-Shabab fighters have been kicked out of the capital of Mogadishu, they have continued attacking targets throughout Africa

Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month. 

The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured.  

The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack. 

In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now.

A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press.

'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said.

U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack.

'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda

'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.'

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert.

The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.'

Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.
