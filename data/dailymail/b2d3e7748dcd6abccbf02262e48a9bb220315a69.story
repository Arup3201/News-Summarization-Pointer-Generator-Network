People are more likely to make a complaint about online purchases because it doesn't involve face-to-face confrontation, according to new figures

Complaints by British shoppers are soaring - with people more likely to make a complaint about online purchases because it doesn’t involve a face-to-face confrontation.

The number of complaints about online purchases has doubled to more than 66 million in 2014, according to new figures from a Consumer Action report.

Customers are less likely to accept slow service, failed deliveries and inadequate products when they buy goods online.

Retail suppliers received the most complaints last year- with a total of 18.5million individuals registering their disappointment.

And 7.7million complaints were put in to mobile, broadband and television companies. A further 7.3million consumers made their displeasure known to energy suppliers.

Public transport, leisure and tourism, banking and finance, tradesmen, property, postal and professional services were also in the list of the top ten most complained about sectors.

The annual Consumer Action Monitor report showed a significant overall increase in the number of customers willing to take action by registering an official complaint.

Almost half of Britons took action to resolve a problem they had with a service, compared with just 34 per cent in 2013.

And almost one third of these complaints (20million) were made online.

The figures were analysed by Ombudsman’s Services, a non-profit company that aims to resolve disputes for the energy, property, licensing and communication industries.

Lewis Shand Smith, the chief ombudsman, said: ‘It’s clear to see that customers are less willing than ever to stand for poor service and poor quality.

‘While it is encouraging to know that consumers are becoming more aware of their rights and more likely to take action, we’re also seeing millions of problems that aren’t taken up with suppliers.

‘The research highlights a real need for more to be done to tackle poor customer service in the UK.’
