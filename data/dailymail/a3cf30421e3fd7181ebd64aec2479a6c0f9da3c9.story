Sports fans travelling to Olympic events in London faced delays today as rail and Tube services were disrupted.

A signal failure this afternoon at Canary Wharf - only a few stops from the Olympic Park - meant no Docklands Light Railway (DLR) trains were able to run between Canary Wharf and nearby Westferry, causing severe delays.

Earlier, passengers were stuck for about 30 minutes outside London Bridge station due to 'operating problems'.

There were also problems at Cannon Street station, and Tube services on the District line were severely affected by a signal failure at Turnham Green in west London.

The failures on the Tube had been rectified by 1pm today.

It was the second day in a row that 
Games visitors had been affected by transport problems. Tube services to
the Olympic Park were suspended yesterday morning after a defective 
train caught fire at Leyton.

The difficulty at London Bridge, thought to be a signal problem, led to delays to services run by the Southern train company in and out of the station in the morning rush-hour.

London Bridge is one of the major Olympic hub stations, dealing not only with arriving commuters in the morning but those leaving to go to Olympic events.

At Cannon Street, a main London terminus, a signalling problem meant there were fewer trains. This affected services run by the Southeastern train company.

On the Tube, the problem at Turnham Green caused the suspension of all District line services between Earl's Court and Richmond and Ealing Broadway.

The disruption affected ticket-holders wanting to watch the Olympic volleyball at Earl's Court, where the first match - a women's preliminary round game between the Dominican Republic and Japan - was due to start at 9.30am.

Passengers were being advised to take the Piccadilly Line instead.

Transport for London said the signal problems were resolved after engineers moved on to sites at Turnham Green and Chiswick Park.

Services were back to normal to and from London Bridge towards the end of the morning peak.

Cannon Street services returned to normal from 10am.

A recorded message from London mayor Boris Johnson warning passengers of 'huge pressure on the transport network' that was being played in London Underground stations and on buses has been discontinued.

TfL said it was not part of a new strategy and it was planned that the message would only be played for a certain time.

The transport body said today that Tube passenger numbers were up by 7.5 per cent on Monday compared with a normal Monday, with Docklands Light Railway numbers up by a record 65 per cent.

TfL warned that there would be road alterations today to cope with the Olympic road cycling time trials in and around Hampton Court and Surrey.Olympic venues in use today include Horse Guards Parade, which means that central London will be busy.

TfL also said that the Tube's Jubilee line will be exceptionally busy in the early evening as events are taking place at Wembley, Lord's Cricket Ground, North Greenwich Arena, ExCeL exhibition centre in Docklands and the Olympic Park.

Baker Street, Kings Cross and Green Park Tube stations were expected to be very busy with spectators going to and from Wembley.

But elsewhere in the capital, roads were quiet.

Westminster Bridge appeared almost empty of pedestrians and vehicles during the morning rush hour, and traffic was moving freely on Park Lane.
