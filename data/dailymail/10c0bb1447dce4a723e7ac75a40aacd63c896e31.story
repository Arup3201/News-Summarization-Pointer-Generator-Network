Posing for the camera before her school prom, Corah-Beth Slaney is the picture of a pretty, fresh-faced English rose.

But just one month later, the 16-year-old's body had been ravaged by a deadly condition - and doctors have now warned she has just months to live. 

In the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself.

She has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting disease that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles.

And since the prom night, Corah's devastated parents have watched helplessly as the disease has taken over her body.

Her parents watched in horror as within the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself

Her mother, Lisa, 43, said: 'After her prom night, Corah's health rapidly declined - and she's now unable to walk, feed or wash herself.

'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives and it's so rare that there's not much information about it.

'Doctors have warned us that Corah has months to live rather than years and we're just trying to make the most out of our time left as a family.

'It was heart-breaking to hear that our little girl had such an awful, terminal disease.' 

For her parents, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. 

Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah's prom night is something we will treasure forever, it reminds us of the happy times we've shared.

'But despite her diagnosis she has never stopped smiling and still manages to try and sing when she's feeling well enough.'

'She is my only daughter as I have two older sons which makes this even harder for us to take.'

'Her condition means we are living on a timebomb we don't know how long we have left as a family.

For her parents Lisa and Carl, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. Her mother said: 'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives'

What are mitochondria?

In every cell in the body, mitochondria are responsible for producing energy (called ATP) that the cell needs to function. Cells make up tissues and organs in our bodies, for example the heart and liver.

They are like power stations in our bodies, supplying the energy every cell needs to function.

If our cells do not have energy, then the tissues or body organs that the cells are made up of do not work properly.

One analogy is that if power stations do not produce enough energy for the country, there will be areas of blackout, where parts of the country cannot function.

What is mitochondrial Disease?

When a person has mitochondrial Disease the Mitochondria in the cells are not producing enough energy for the cell. Sometimes they do not work at all, and sometimes they are just not very efficient.

If a cell does not get enough energy (ATP) it cannot function properly.

There is a huge variety in the symptoms and severity of mitochondrial disease. It depends on how many cells are affected, and where they are in the body - so every person with mitochondrial disease is affected differently. 

Each individual affected will have a different combination of mitochondria that are working and not working within each cell.

However, there are times when particular body systems are affected in a recognisable pattern and these have particular names, for example Alpers, Leigh’s disease, MELAS and MERRF. 

The commonest parts of the body affected are those that have the highest energy demands; brain, muscle, liver, heart and kidney.

If a lot of mitochondria in the body are affected in the important body organs, like the brain, mitochondrial disease can be very serious.

The symptoms of mitochondrial disease are usually progressive in body systems where the cells have a high demand for energy, such as brain cells.

'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16-years-old she relies on me to wash and dress her.

'We are just trying to make sure she has the best quality of life while she's still with us.'

Doctors were at first baffled by Corah's symptoms but just one month later her parents were told the devastating news.

The teenager's health had been fine until she was 12 years old.

But in 2011, she developed diabetes and needed insulin with every meal.

She then started suffering from seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy.

Her mother said: 'Corah's life had suddenly changed overnight and now her father and I had to help manage her health.

'That was devastating enough, but when her seizures started getting worse, we knew something wasn't adding up.'

'But it took years of hospital appointments before we got an accurate diagnosis - and the medication she was on failed to stop her having fits.'

In June 2014, Corah, from Nottingham, was due to undergo life-changing brain surgery to help control her seizures.

In preparation, Corah needed to be taken off all medication for this to be carried out - something that led to massive, uncontrollable fits.

Mrs Slaney added: 'It wasn't until a specialist suggested that Corah may have mitochondrial disease that I had ever heard of it.

'A muscle biopsy was taken and it was then confirmed that Corah had this horrible disease.'

The teenager's parents are now desperate to raise as much awareness as possible for the condition that will kill their daughter.

They are currently waiting to go to Great Ormond Street to talk with consultants about the best drugs available to help her.

Mrs Slaney said: said: 'Corah took a massive turn for the worst in December, she suffered a huge seizure and we all thought she was going to die.'

Mitochondrial disease causes extreme tiredness, as well as involuntary movements.

The seizures have left Corah with muscle weakness and she is now wheelchair bound.

Corah's mother is now her full-time carer. She said: 'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16, she relies on me to wash and dress her'

Desperate to spend as much time with her daughter as possible, her mother had taken up the role of Corah's full time carer.

'We're trying to get Corah to feed herself again, which would be amazing. But we don't know what's going to happen, so we just take each day as it comes.'

Since Corah's diagnosis, the family have been doing all they can to keep her spirits up.

Mrs Slaney added: 'Corah recently met Jessie J which really helped lift her spirits, she loves singing so it was fantastic for her to meet her idol.

'We're in the process of trying to get as many people as possible to send Corah video messages to cheer her up, she loves Keith Lemon.'

Despite the family struggling to cope with Corah's shocking diagnosis, they are sharing her story in the hope of some way improving the lives of others with the terminal condition.

The family has spoken out to try and raise awareness of the cruel condition that has wrecked Cora's life 

Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah is constantly deteriorating and now that she can't do anything for herself. We are on the waiting list to get a wet room in our house.

'Originally the council placed Corah at the bottom of a two-year waiting list, but thanks to our supporters we are now at the top of that list.

'But unfortunately no funding will be available until April and even then, the work is likely to exceed the maximum grants available.'

So the family have set up a fundraising page for Corah in a bid to raise the vital funds for her wet room and downstairs bedroom.

Mrs Slaney added: 'I want to ensure Corah has the best quality of life possible and having her own downstairs area at home would greatly improve that.

'In just over two weeks we've raised over £7,000.'

The family have pledged that any surplus funds will be donate to The Lily Foundation, which helps research into mitochondrial disease and other metabolic disorders.
