You don't have to wait until Thursday to see Marks and Spencer's new advert starring Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, David Gandy and Helena Bonham-Carter.

Online viewers can get a sneak peek here of the festive fare, which has been inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales, before it's broadcast on TV.

For the first time the brand is using 
social media channels to debut its multimillion pound advert. The full two minute version, which you can view below, has been released on YouTube as well as the M&S website this evening.

Leading ladies: Helen Bonham-Carter and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley star in the M&S Christmas ad

Online first: Rosie flaunts her curves in lingerie from her range as the advert is unveiled on the internet before airing on TV

Get the look: Rosie is seen in the M&S Collection Jumper, £45, left, at the start of the advert while her lingerie in the Arabian Nights scene is a bra, £25 and knickers £12.50 Autograph set with floral dressing gown, £69

Behind the scenes footage and interviews with the stars are also online.

Set to an enchanting orchestral 
soundtrack, the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers 
into a world of 'magic and sparkle' from Alice in Wonderland to the 
Wizard of Oz.

Rosie- of course - the leading lady, is first seen 
pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from 
the real world through a manhole into a snow dusted enchanted forest, seated at a 
fantastical feast.

The ad 
then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house 
scene, an Arabian Nights flight and finally a walk along the yellow 
brick road, with a little help from the ever handsome David and a 
bewitching Helena Bonham Carter, whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer.

Wizard style: Helena wears twisted front dress, £45, and coat, £110, both Per Una

Magical entrance: After falling through a hole in the road when chasing her dog, Rosie makes a stylish crash-landing in the giant's new Christmas campaign

Glamour: Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party, hosted by model David Gandy in Autograph menswear

David wears, from left: Autograph Jacket, £99, Autograph Dress Shirt £29.50 and Autograph Top Hat, £35

The Daily Mail's Liz Jones - often the High Street's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review after she was given a peek on Sunday.

She said: 'From my sneak preview, the ad is a triumph. But will other viewers agree?

'For
 M&S’s vocal shareholders, this cannot just be a vanity project, an 
escape for a few moments into fantasy. It has to make those cash 
registers burst into song.

'This time, I think M&S has done 
its homework, and pulled off quite a coup: while Bonham Carter is known 
for her rather eccentric style of bird’s-nest hair and socks worn with 
flip-flops, of late she has become something of a fashion icon.

Seen here first: The retailer has released the multimillion pound advert online ahead of the full TV airing

Social media interaction: Online viewers will be able to vote for the name of Rosie's dog via Facebook or Twitter

'Here, Helena makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that, although only two minutes long, cost many millions to produce.

'Teamed cleverly with Rosie, she’s a classy, 
unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to Everywoman, 
being neither too frumpy, nor too unattainable.

'The
 product placement — dresses, dresses and more dresses — is perfect, and
 there is nothing cheesy about the production, apart from the Cheddar 
truckles at the tea party. It’s fun, and, given the chemistry between 
Rosie and Gandy, super sexy.

Rosie in Wonderland: In a £49.50 M&S Woman dress

Fairytale to shop floor: Rosie as Red Riding Hood wears Autograph Coat, £139

Follow the yellow brick road: Rosie as Dorothy in a Limited Edition embellished white dress, £59, while David wears a £119 jacket and £37.50 cords as the scarecrow

'Rosie
 is a reliable cash cow (excuse the term) for Marks, with her own-label 
lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store’s history. And 
the chiselled features of David Gandy will keep mums, who will be the 
ones lugging those Magic and Sparkle carrier bags home, very happy 
indeed.'

The brand will be hoping the Christmas offering will boost sales after it was reported that their Autumn 'leading ladies' campaign has failed to engage consumers.

Forecasts for their results suggest a 1.5 per cent drop in sales of homeware and clothing for the three months to September 30. This is despite a big push to appeal to different generations with their latest model signings who included Ellie Goulding and Helen Mirren.

But the Christmas campaign seems set on targetting the younger market by engaging them online. As well as releasing the advert over the internet before it airs on TV, they are giving their Facebook fans and Twitter followers the opportunity to vote on a name for Rosie's dog in the advert.
