David Cameron today called on US drugs giant Pfizer to ramp up its commitment to Britain before bidding again for rival UK firm AstraZeneca.

The Prime Minister said he was 'not satisfied' with the American company's promises to safeguard British jobs. He told MPs: 'I want more.'

Mr Cameron said he agreed with Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable who yesterday refused to rule out intervening to block a formal bid.

David Cameron rejected Ed Miliband's accusation that he was acting as a 'cheerleader' for Pfizer's in its bid for Britain's AstraZeneca

David Cameron was prepared for Ed Miliband's assault on his handling of the bid - accusing Labour of setting up the rules governing foreign takeovers

But he warned the row must not trigger a retreat to protectionism.

Mr Cameron said the UK 'benefits massively' from foreign companies investing cash in Britain.

His remarks came after Labour leader Ed Miliband said there was 'deep concern' over the proposed takeover of AstraZeneca by Pfizer.

Mr Miliband said: 'The deal would have an impact for decades to come on British jobs, British investment, British exports and British science.'

The Labour leader called for an independent assessment of this bid and whether it is in the national interest.

But the Prime Minister said: The 
assessment I want is from the business department on this deal or, 
indeed, because there isn't now an actual offer on the table, any 
subsequent offer.'

Mr 
Cameron said the commitments made so far by Pfizer - including keeping 
at least 20% of the research and development workforce in the UK - were 
'encouraging'.

But he added:
 'Let me be absolutely clear, I'm not satisfied, I want more. But the 
way to get more is to engage, not to stand up and play party politics.

'The more we can do to strengthen the assurances the better.'

AstraZeneca has so far resisted approaches from its rival. But the US giant has not given up hope of completing a Â£60 billion-plus deal - potentially the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company.

Fears have been raised that resulting cost-cutting could cause the loss of thousands of highly-skilled jobs and undermine the UK's science base.

Mr Cameron dismissed suggestions from Labour leader Ed Miliband that he was 'cheerleading' for the deal by tasking the Cabinet Secretary and ministers to discuss the situation with both companies.

He said: 'We are fighting for British science and I just think it is a pity that he is trying to play politics rather than backing the British national interest.

'I will judge all these things about does it expand British jobs, British investment, British science?'

The Prime Minister said the country must not close its doors to foreign investors.

'Britain benefits massively from being open to investment. Nissan is now producing more cars than the whole of Italy," he said.

'Jaguar Land Rover, under Indian ownership, has created 9,000 jobs in the West Midlands since I became Prime Minister.

'Vodafone and indeed AstraZeneca have benefited from the backing of an open country to go out and build and buy businesses around the world.

'There is more inward investment into Britain today than the rest of the European Union combined. Don't let's put that at risk.'

The PM also said it was 'absolutely right' for Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - Britain's top civil servant - to engage with both companies.

Mr Cameron said: 'Our entire approach is based upon trying to secure the best possible deal in terms of jobs, investment and science.

'That is why I believe it was absolutely right to ask the Cabinet Secretary to engage with Pfizer, just as we're engaging with AstraZeneca and I do find it extraordinary that we have been criticised for this.'
