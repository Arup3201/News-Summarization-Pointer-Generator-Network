The owner of British fashion chain Topshop is reportedly in talks to sell a quarter of his stake to the private equity firm that also backs J Crew.  

Topshop owner Sir Phillip Green is thought to be looking to sell such a large portion of the company so that he can raise more than $400million.

That money will then go towards expanding the already-growing Topshop empire and opening more stores in America and venturing into China.

The British magnate is reportedly in talks with Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP which has backed a number of successful fashion franchises in the past.

In spite of their similar names, the heads of Leonard Green have no relation to Sir Green, though they will both stand to profit significantly if a multi-million dollar deal is reached.

Leonard Green, and fellow private equity firm TPG Capital LP, partnered up in 2010 and bought J Crew for $3billion.

All told, Topshop and Topman is collectively valued at £1billion, which equates to roughly $1.61billion.

If the deal goes through, this will not be Sir Phillip’s first time turning to Americans for some help for his British brands.

Last month he signed up American reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain.

Investment: The retail tycoon is thought to want to raise the money to expand his fashion chain into China and the U.S.

Topshop, and male offshoot Topman, have become a staple in the British fashion world and was helped largely by a popular collaboration that it promoted with model Kate Moss.  

The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen.

The chain has also been hailed for its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to its shelves.

The business has 615 franchised outlets operating in 39 countries, three of which are in America. If the new deal is successful it could transform Topshop into a truly global brand.

Topshop already has stores open in New York, Chicago and Las Vegas, with a fourth slated to open in Los Angeles next spring.

British retailers are mostly struggling as consumers hold back spending in the face of job insecurity, rising prices, subdued wage growth and government austerity measures.

The entrepreneur recently criticised Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’.

Arcadia posted a 25 per cent year-on-year rise in underlying profit to $269million in the year to August 25.

Sir Phillip’s family is already estimated to be worth more than £3billion and they benefit greatly from a close watch of tax liabilities.

Arcadia is registered as the property of his wife Tina who lives in Monaco,  so the company does not pay tax  in the UK.

In 2005 Sir Philip was criticised for taking a £1billion dividend out of Arcadia – one of the biggest payouts ever seen from a company to an individual in the UK.

Critics claimed the payout was channelled through a network of offshore accounts, saving Sir Philip, and costing the taxpayer, close to £300million.

Sir Philip is expected to conclude discussions Tuesday and make an announcement Wednesday.

The landmark deal would provide him with partners who know the U.S. retail market and could help with any expansion plans. Topshop and Topman are the most profitable parts of Sir Philip’s Arcadia empire, which he bought for £800million in 2002 and which includes three other British retailers.

A friend of the tycoon said: ‘You would be wrong to suggest Sir Philip is going to use this deal to take cash out of the business. This is about investing in a big push for Topshop and Topman internationally.’
