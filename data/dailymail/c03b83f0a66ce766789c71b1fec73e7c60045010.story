A generation of children have remained living in the homes of their middle-aged parents, according to the latest official analysis of British households.

It found the number of families who squeeze more than one generation of adults under the same roof is rapidly increasing.

The rise in the number of stay-at-home children and ‘boomerang’ children, who return after university, has contributed to a new breed of ‘two-family’ home – the fastest-growing type of household.

The new family life: A generation of children have remained living in the homes of their middle-aged parents, and their numbers are rapidly increasing, according to the latest official analysis of British households

The report from the Office for National Statistics found that the number of married couples living ‘without dependent children’ has risen by 200,000 since 2003.

Although this includes childless couples, the ONS said the increase is due to the growth in homes  with adult children, who are too old to be classed as ‘dependent’.

This means they are over 18, or 16 if no longer in full-time education.

One in every 100 homes now has two families, the report found, largely because grown-up sons or daughters who stay with their parents are bringing partners in to live with them.

The analysis also said an increasing number of single parents are finding their adult children reluctant to leave home.

While more young people crowd in with their parents, the Families and Households report found a rise in middle-aged people living alone.

Around 7.7million people now live by themselves and single-person households aged between 45 and 64 have risen by more than a quarter in the past decade.

Many have never married or are divorced.

At the same time the number of 20- and 30-somethings living alone has fallen as many more choose to live with their parents.

Priced out: The fresh evidence of the spread of the stay-at-home generation comes amid concern that house prices have put homes beyond the pockets of all but the best-paid

The fresh evidence of the spread of the stay-at-home generation comes amid concern that house prices have put homes beyond the pockets of all but the best-paid, forcing many to remain in their childhood homes.

Earlier estimates have said there may be as many as three million young people aged between 20 and their mid-30s who have always lived with their parents.

Yesterday’s analysis based on the state-run Labour Force Survey,  which questions more than 150,000 households, said there were nearly eight million married or civil  partner couples living without dependent children – a rise of 200,000 in a decade.

The ONS said the increase was driven by young adults who have ‘delayed leaving the parental home or returned to it’.

It found a 39 per cent rise in homes classed as containing two or more couples. The ONS said these include households such as ‘a married couple with their son and his girlfriend’.
