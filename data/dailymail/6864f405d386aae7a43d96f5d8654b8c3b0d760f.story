A mansion complete with helipad, diving pool, fully stocked fishing dam, and panic room, is set to set to sell for $20 million, which would break the record for the highest house sale on the Gold Coast.

The property, named Wirraway, is in the sleepy country community of Biddaddaba, between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, near known for its horse breeding.

The house has four bedrooms and six bathrooms, and features two self-contained guesthouses, each with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.

Wirraway in Biddaddaba on the Gold Coast is set to sell for $20 million, which would be the highest price fetched by a property on the Gold Coast

The home features a grand ballroom that can cater for up to 200 people

The house is on a 627 hectare block in the hinterland outside the Gold Coast

The property also features a grand ballroom that can cater for 200 guests, a helipad, 16 dams, including a fishing dam stocked with thousands of Australian bass, an airstrip, a library with floor-to-ceiling shelving, a large pool with a diving board, tennis court with fully enclosed tiered viewing pavilion, fully equipped gym, and a wine cellar with adjoining tasting room, which is fitted with bullet-proof glass and doubles as a panic room.

It is being put up for sale by Brisbane diesel engine technician Preston Richardson and his wife Miranda. Mr Richardson owns Jet Boats Brisbane Pty Ltd.

The couple bought the 627-hectare block in December 2012 for $3.575 million and have reportedly spent $14 million constructing and renovating the house, plus further millions fencing the property, improving pastures, and building and stocking dams.

Wirraway also has a heated diving pool, complete with diving board

The property has 10 bedrooms and six bathrooms, split between the main house and two self-contained guest houses

The home also has an underground wine cellar with adjoining tasting room. The tasting room is outfitted with bullet-proof glass and doubles as a panic room

Shaun Kaddatz, marketing agent at Harcourts Coastal, which is selling the property, said that all up the couple have spent 'more than $20 million' developing Wirraway.

'It's one of the most incredible properties I've ever seen,' he said. 'I've probably seen some of the most spectacular properties [in Australia] but this beats it all.'

'It's based on the original colonial residence that was on the property, but it's a modern masterpiece when you walk through the door.'

The couple bought the home intending it to be their personal residence, but a work commitment outside the area has meant they have to move and cannot live in it.

He said their personal touch was evident when looking at the home.

'The size and quality and attention to detail… it's quite unbelievable, it has to be seen to be believed,' said Mr Kaddatz.

The home is up for sale for $20 million and Mr Kaddatz is confident it will sell for that price to 'the right buyer at the right time.'

If it does sell for the asking price Wirraway will become the highest selling home in Gold Coast history, beating 213 Hedges Ave in Mermaid Beach, which was bought by Harvey Norman boss Steve Cavalier for $19 million in 2006.
