A Balinese woman charged with murdering her Australian husband is expecting the death penalty and her sons believe she probably deserves it.

Noor Ellis has admitted a role in the killing of her husband, Australian businessman Robert Ellis, at their home in Bali last October. She told authorities she had paid two men to carry out the slaying.

The couple's two sons, Peter and John, have revealed they are reconciled with the possibility that their mother could face the death penalty if she is convicted at a trial currently underway in Indonesia.

Both sons have refused to attend their mother’s court hearing.

Instead, Peter’s girlfriend, Maddison McNeil appeared at the hearing and was shocked when a handcuffed Ellis ran to hug her and asked her to pray.

‘She’s still Noor, but she’ll never be the same and we’ll never be the same’ McNeil told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program.

Both sons were questioned about whether they will regret agreeing with the death penalty for their mother in ten years.

‘If that happens, it happens,’ Peter said.

‘But we want justice for our dad no matter what.’

The 60-year-old's body, with wrists and feet bound, was found wrapped in plastic, dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village.

Among the eight people arrested over the brutal execution-style murder were the couple’s two former maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids.

Another two suspects were arrested in November following a two-hour chase that ended in a violent confrontation.

The men, both aged 24, resisted arrest by firing poisonous arrows and using machetes. 

They were finally apprehended after both were shot in the leg. 

Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids

If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty

Sunday Night reported police allege the maids has been paid to remove Robert’s dog so that it would not bark while five men jumped him in the kitchen and slashed his throat, nearly decapitating him.

Peter and John text messaged their mother to ask where their father was to which she chillingly replied, ‘I’ll ask him when I see him.’

When Ellis was arrested at the end of last year, she admitted to police and her two Perth-based sons that she paid $14,000 to men to carry out the murder with her motive likely being his $30 million estate.

Noor’s lawyers have claimed that Robert was abusive and the hit men were only paid to scare her husband, not murder him.

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

Police have also alleged Noor confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often' and has claimed that she was possessed by a spirit or a monster and pushed to organise Robert’s killing by an outside supernatural force.

Her sons, Peter and John Ellis have told The West Australian of the perils they face, not only of a life without their father, but potentially without their mother as well.

‘Mum felt like she wasn’t being treated well enough, she wasn’t given enough money,’ Peter said.

‘And her only option in her mind was to murder my dad.’

 In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors which claimed the victim’s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife.  

Ellis also has two other children from a former relationship. At the time of their father’s death, the four children and Mr Ellis’ brother John released a joint statement. 

‘Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.’ 

‘His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man. 

'His integrity, generosity and spirit is evidenced by the way the business community both expat and Indonesian have rallied to support us and show their respects.’  

This case has come as two Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, face the imminent death penalty in Bali which is expected to happen in the coming weeks.
