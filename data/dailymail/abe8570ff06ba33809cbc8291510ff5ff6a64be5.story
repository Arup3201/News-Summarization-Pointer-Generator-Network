Barry Howell has gone on trial accused of attacking a woman in Manchester city centre after DNA evidence was linked to his son

A father was arrested on suspicion of carrying out a brutal knife-point rape 24 years ago after evidence was matched to his son’s DNA, a court heard.

Barry Howell has now gone on trial accused of attacking the woman in the city centre in November 1989.

It is alleged that Mr Howell jumped out at the woman as she walked back to her car in Red Bank, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre.

The victim is said to have screamed as Mr Howell allegedly ran a knife across her throat and said 'can you feel that?’ before ‘dragging’ her off the street and onto wasteland.

Police were able to recover DNA from a sample from the alleged victim belonging to her alleged attacker at the time – but were unable to identify who it belonged to.

Manchester Crown Court heard that in November last year the sample was run through the database, and a link was found between the DNA profile of the suspected attacker, and the DNA profile of Mr Howell’s son.

Mr Howell, 56, of Burnage, denies rape.

The court heard that following his arrest he told police he had a consensual encounter with the woman. He told police that at the time he was living with his mother in Harpurhey after separating from his wife.

Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting told the court that the alleged victim, an office worker, was passing through railway arches in the Red Bank area when she was set upon at around 6.30pm on November 22, 1989.

The attacker is said to have put his arm round her throat, ran a blade across it, and put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland, where he ordered her to lie face down before raping her, the court heard.

He is alleged to have kissed her before apologising, telling her not to tell the police, and then fleeing.

Mr Mackintosh added: 'At that time science was not such as would enable (the DNA sample) to be linked to any person.

'As the years passed the science relating to the examination of DNA improved and new techniques were developed - one of these techniques was one which enabled DNA found on a sample to be matched to a relative whose DNA may appear on the national DNA database.'

When police went to Mr Howell’s home in January this year and asked him to provide a sample he refused ‘on principle’ the court heard.

Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Howell put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland

But when they returned the following morning with a search warrant he provided a sample which was a ‘one in a billion’ match to that recovered from the victim.

Mr Howell then provided a statement to police detailing a consensual encounter with the complainant.

Asked what reason she would have to make a false complaint, he said: “Is there ever a reason – it happens, doesn’t it?’.

Concluding the opening of the case, Mr Mackintosh said to the jury: 'It’s the Crown’s case that having heard the evidence you can be sure this was not a consensual sexual encounter – it was a brutal knife-point rape.'

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
