Police are looking for the mother gave birth to her daughter and then left her newborn wrapped in a blanket lying on a park bench.

The infant, who has been named Charlotte after the police woman who took her to hospital, was found in Hailesland Park in Edinburgh yesterday.

Police have urged the mother, who was not with the baby, to seek medical attention immediately as she she is believed to have given birth just 24 hours beforehand.

The girl was discovered lying peacefully on a bench behind Kilncroft Stair at around 12.55pm by Lawrence Liddell.

Mr Liddell, 59, said today: 'We really couldn't believe it when we found the baby.

'It was a really tiny newborn wrapped up in a blanket - she wasn't wearing anything underneath.

'I had met my friend in the hallway of the flats and we started walking along together because we were both heading out to visit our mothers.

'As we were walking along we saw the baby.

'She wasn't crying and she didn't appear to be in any kind of distress.'

The child may only have been there for 30 minutes in temperatures of around nine degrees.

Unemployed Mr Liddell, who was with his friend, said: 'The whole thing took us totally by surprise.

'My friend held on to the baby and I went and got the concierge from the flats and the police.'

'We think the mother must have wanted the child to be found judging by where she had left it.

'Thank goodness the baby was found unharmed.

'I hope the mother is found. Who knows what kind of a state she is in?'

The girl is now being cared for by staff at the Simpson's Centre for Reproductive Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.

Baby Charlotte weighs 5.7lbs (2.6kg) and all routine newborn checks have been performed.

As a precaution Charlotte is being treated with antibiotics and tests have also been performed to rule out infection including Group B Strep.

Maria Wilson, chief midwife, at NHS Lothian said: 'Baby Charlotte has had a good night and is doing well.

'Our staff are continuing to care for her and we hope the mum and baby can be reunited.'

Charlotte was found just a short distance from the local police station and train station in a discovery which has stunned local residents.

Monika Tyrrell, 70, a care worker said: 'I feel so sorry for the mother. Something serious must be the matter for her to do something like this.

'Whatever the situation, I hope she can be reunited with her baby.

'She could have had some kind of a breakdown.

'People walk past that bench all the time, there's a lot of movement.

'There's no-one around this area that I know of who looked like they might be pregnant.'

Chief Inspector Richard Thomas of Police Scotland said the baby girl had been found in a maroon-coloured blanket before being taken to the ERI where she is now being cared for.

He said: 'We believe the baby was probably lying on the bench for a short amount of time, probably less than 30 minutes. She does not seem to have suffered in any noticeable way.

'The baby was wrapped up in the blanket and had been washed and cleaned.

'It seems likely she had been found within 24 hours of being born.

He added: 'At this point we are seeking to trace the mother to establish that she is safe and well and receives proper medical attention. We don't want to frighten her.'

Hailesland Park resident Steven Brodie, 35, said: 'I just hope this story is going to have a happy ending.

'It's pretty shocking that whatever has happened, the mother has felt she had no other options but to dump the baby and run.

'You do hear about things like this happening from time to time, but it's pretty astonishing when it happens on your doorstep.

'It's great that the baby has been found safe and well and that it wasn't more serious. Fingers crossed everything turns out OK.'

Anne Denholm, chairwoman of Wester Hailes Community Council, said the mum will have left her there knowing she would be found.

She said: 'It's quite a busy park and has all been done up recently. The poor girl who left her there will need help, it's really sad.

'It's been cold outside so it's a good job she was somewhere she could easily be found.

In 2005, a newborn 6lb boy was found in a plastic bag in Holyrood Park, but the mother was never found.
