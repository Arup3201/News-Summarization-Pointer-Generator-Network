Former UKIP candidate in Clacton Roger Lord has attacked the 'fools' who run the party

The UKIP councillor ousted by rebel MP Douglas Carswell as the party’s candidate in Clacton has quit, with a bitter departing shot at the ‘fools’ who turfed him out.

Roger Lord was forced aside after Mr Carswell – the sitting Tory MP in the Essex seat – last week defected to UKIP and stood down from Parliament to fight a by-election.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced that Mr Carswell would stand for UKIP in the resulting October 9 by-election, despite Mr Lord having already been selected as the party’s candidate.

After Mr Carswell announced his intention to stand for UKIP Mr Lord angrily threatened to ‘rip his throat out’. 

But Mr Lord has said it is ‘time to draw a line under this’. He said: ‘In mountaineering terms it’s time to cut the rope and touch the void, and see what life brings.’

He added: ‘I was talking to Nigel Farage three or four weeks ago, telling him what I was doing in Clacton, and he said ‘I very much doubt Douglas Carswell can be unseated’.

‘It was not a targeted seat for UKIP, but I said I could win. But Nigel Farage didn’t let on and he knew from the off. 

'I think he could have confided in me and told me not to waste my time, instead of me being deselected as candidate and told to quietly shuffle off.

‘According to the rules I have the right to address the national executive but I was rung up and sworn at and told to shut up. I don’t want to deal with fools like that.

‘There are bigger things in life and I don’t want to sink to that level. I know they say politics is a dirty game, but it is not really, it is an intellectual battle between two parties.’

He added: ‘What insults the people of Clacton is that this was a deal made during a discreet meal in Mayfair in London.

‘But will Stuart Wheeler [a key UKIP donor] come down to Brooklands in Jaywick and tell people how their future candidate was decided?’

Mr Lord, of Great Bentley, is now backing Liberal Democrat Gary Scott, Tendring district councillor for Alresford, to take his county council seat.

The 57-year-old farmer, last week suggested Mr Carswell had only ‘jumped ship’ to UKIP because he knew he was going to lose  at the next election. He accused him of simply ‘looking after himself’.

But Mr Carswell defended his decision to join UKIP and rejected accusations that he had been disloyal to the Prime Minister. He said: 'I stab people in the front, not the back'.

Mr Carswell returned to his Clacton constituency last week with UKIP leader Nigel Farage amid speculation eight more Conservative MPs considered defecting.

He said: ‘I like David Cameron, he's a nice guy, he's actually good fun.

‘I don't think I've ever stabbed anybody in the back, maybe I occasionally stab one or two people in the front but I've been frank and straight with people.

Mr Carswell's decision to fight a by-election as UKIP’s candidate - instead of sitting in Parliament until the general election next year - was described Mr Farage as the most honourable decision in his life time. 

It came amid claims up to eight more Conservative MPs have held intensive talks with UKIP about defecting.

After the shock defection of Mr Carswell a source told the Daily Mail that the threat of a mutiny went far beyond just one MP.

It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair.

‘Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas,’ a source said, adding that the MPs were happy to talk to Mr Wheeler – a former Tory who defected to UKIP – ‘because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty’.

‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey,’ the source said.

Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister’s policy on Europe.

The MP announced he was joining UKIP and forcing a by-election in his Clacton constituency in Essex, which will be a nightmare for the Tories to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010.

Mr Cameron was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as Mr Farage triumphantly paraded Mr Carswell live on TV.

The dramatic move has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen his stance on immigration and Europe to stem the risk of further defections.

Tory whips were scrambled to ring round Eurosceptic MPs to shore up support. A senior Tory source insisted that Mr Carswell appeared to be a ‘lone wolf’ and played down the prospect of further departures.

And Mr Cameron angrily dismissed Mr Carswell’s move as ‘self-defeating’. ‘It is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way,’ he said. ‘But it is also, in my view, counter-productive.’

Mr Farage claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of Tory MPs over the past six months who ‘very strongly support everything Ukip is trying to do’.

He predicted that further defections will follow if Mr Carswell triumphs in the by-election, which is likely to be held in the week after the Tory party conference.

‘The real answer to the question about how many others will join, will all depend on this by-election,’ he said. ‘This by-election is going to be a High Noon moment.’ 

Former Conservative MP  Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP last week and is the firm favourite to hold his seat in next month's by-election

Mr Carswell, an early supporter of Mr Cameron’s leadership bid, said the Prime Minister was ‘not serious about change’ when it came to the EU and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election.

Speaking at a press conference in London alongside Mr Farage, he said: ‘The problem is that many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren’t serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs. Of course they talk the talk before elections.

They say what they feel they must say to get our support... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics, on the recall of MPs, on controlling our borders, on less government, on bank reform, on cutting public debt, on an EU referendum – they never actually make it happen.’

Mr Carswell’s decision to trigger a by-election leaves the Conservatives facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming Ukip’s first elected MP. He has built a Tory majority of over 12,000 in what had been a Labour seat.
