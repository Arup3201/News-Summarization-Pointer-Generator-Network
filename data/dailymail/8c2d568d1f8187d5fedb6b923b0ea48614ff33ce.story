A 28-year-old special forces sergeant has been identified as the fifth US solider killed in a friendly fire airstrike in Afghanistan this week.

Pentagon officials said Staff Sgt. Jason A. McDonald from Butler, Georgia, was killed during a security operation in Gaza Village after the unit was attacked by the Taliban on Monday.

McDonald was assigned to 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The other four casualties were Staff Sgt. Scott R. Studenmund, 24, Spc. Justin R. Helton, 25, Cpl. Justin R. Clouse, 22 and Pvt. 2nd Class Aaron S. Toppen, 19.

The tragic incident  has been described as one of the deadliest friendly fire strikes in nearly 14 years of war.

News of the deaths has sent shockwaves across America, with the soldiers' families saying the men died with honor.

Friends and family of Studenmund said he always wanted to be in the military. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The Pasadena, California resident attended the prestigious Flintridge Preparatory School, where he was star quarterback on the football team.

'He was tenacious. He was fierce. From a very early age, he knew he wanted to serve this country,' Mary Lyon, a family friend, told KABC-TV.

After
 graduating from the $31,000-a-year private academy, Studenmund joined 
the army, where he worked hard to rise through the ranks and join the 
Special Forces - one of the most elite units in the U.S. military.

Meanwhile, military
 representatives went to the home of Justin Helton's parents in 
Beaver, Ohio, early Tuesday to inform them of their son's death, a 
relative said.

Mindy Helton said her cousin specialized in dealing with explosives and was based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Helton had been in Afghanistan about two months and was engaged to be married, she said. He had been in the Army since 2010.

A Toppen family spokesman said representatives from the U.S. Army went to the door of his mother, Pam Toppen, in the middle of the night to deliver the news.

Toppen, the youngest of three children, was from Mokena, a suburb 35 miles southwest of downtown Chicago.

'At midnight last night my mom's 
doorbell rang and we received the news that my little brother was one of
 the five involved in friendly fire in Afghanistan,' his sister Amanda 
Gralewski wrote on Facebook.

'My brother lost his life doing what he always wanted to do since he was a little boy.'

As
 Toppen's family and friends gathered at the home,
 his uncle, Jack Winter, described the high school graduate as a caring 
and funny man who had aspired to a career in the military or law 
enforcement.

'Aaron was predisposed to serve. He was very keen to be in the military,' Winter said. 'He was quite proud to be there.'

'He
 was something somewhat rare in youth culture today. ... In a word, I 
would summarize what he had as "class'',' Winter added.

'So rarely now do
 you see somebody like that who truly does have class who's polite, 
humble, loyal, who's a kind-hearted soul, generous.'

It
 was the second death of a loved one for the family this year. Toppen 
was set to leave for Afghanistan in February, but his gravely ill father
 died that month and he stayed for the funeral. He was deployed in March.

Toppen
 was a graduate of Lincoln-Way East High in Frankfort, Illinois, and 
loved the outdoors, especially fishing. Family members at the home — 
where friends continued to stop by and bring food Tuesday evening — 
circulated a picture of Toppen as a young child sitting next to his 
father in a fishing boat.

Military members provided few details of the attack to the family, Winter said.

'A
 military representative came to my sister's home ... and broke her 
heart,' Winter said. 'It just tears your world apart. That's the 
situation my sister is in.'

The Taliban claimed responsibility for Monday's ambush in Zabul.

A
 Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place between
 foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district, and a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. 
The Taliban often exaggerate their claims.

Pentagon reports say the troops were all 
special operations, though Toppen's Facebook page says he is in the 
regular U.S. Army infantry.

Fox News
 reported that the aircraft in question is a B-1 Lancer, a strategic 
Cold War-era bomber that can carry a payload of up to 125,000 pounds of 
explosives.

'Five American 
troops were killed yesterday during a security operation in southern 
Afghanistan. Investigators are looking into the likelihood that friendly
 fire was the cause. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of 
these fallen,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

'The casualties occurred during a security operation when their unit came into contact with enemy forces. Tragically, there is the possibility that fratricide may have been involved. The incident is under investigation,' the coalition said in an earlier announcement.

One of the worst such incidents came in April 2002 when four Canadian soldiers were killed by an American F-16 jet fighter which dropped a bomb on a group of troops during night firing exercise in southern Kandahar.

A senior police official in southern Zabul said the coalition soldiers were killed when they called for close air support.

Provincial police chief Gen. Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay said there was a joint operation by Afghan and NATO troops in the area's Arghandab district early Monday. After that operation was over, the troops came under attack from the Taliban and called in air support, he said.

'After the operation was over on the way back, the joint forces came under the attack of insurgents, and then foreign forces called for air support. Unfortunately five NATO soldiers and one Afghan army officer were killed mistakenly by NATO air strike,' Rooghlawanay said.

There was no way to independently confirm Rooghlawanay's comments. The coalition would not comment and NATO headquarters in Brussels also declined to comment.

The only U.S. troops now involved in combat operations are usually Special Operations Forces that mentor their Afghan counterparts. They often come under fire and are responsible for calling in air support when needed. Because of constraints placed by outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai, such airstrikes are usually called 'in extremis,' or when troops fear they are about to be killed.

Karzai blamed a similar airstrike called in by special forces mentoring an Afghan operation for killing a dozen civilians during an operation in northern Parwan province. The U.S. military vehemently denied the charge, saying that two civilians were killed in crossfire with Taliban militants and that airstrike was called in when forces thought they were about to be killed by insurgents.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack against the joint force in Zabul.

A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place on Monday night between foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district. Ahmadi claimed a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims.

Separately, a NATO statement said a service member died Monday as a result of a non-battle injury in eastern Afghanistan.

The deaths bring to 36 the number of NATO soldiers killed so far this year in Afghanistan, with eight service members killed in June.

The insurgents have intensified attacks on Afghan and foreign forces ahead of the country's presidential election runoff Saturday. Officials are concerned there could be more violence around the time of the vote, although the first round in April passed relatively peacefully.

Casualties have been falling in the U.S.-led military coalition as its forces pull back to allow the Afghan army and police to fight the Taliban insurgency. All combat troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from the country by the end of this year.
