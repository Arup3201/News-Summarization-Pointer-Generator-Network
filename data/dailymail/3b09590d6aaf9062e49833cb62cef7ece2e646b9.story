Brusthom Ziamani - accused of planning a 'Lee Rigby-style' terror attack has denied a hammer, knife and flag he was carrying was a terrorist 'tool kit' that would be used to kill a soldier or politician

A teenager accused of plotting a 'Lee Rigby-style' murder has denied a 12in knife and a hammer in his rucksack were a terror 'tool kit'.

Brusthom Ziamani, 19, was arrested in an east London street last August carrying the blade and hammer along with a black flag and had earlier researched the location of Army bases in the south east of the capital, a jury has heard.

His Old Bailey trial was told that he turned to Islam early in 2014 and was arrested after he showed his ex-girlfriend his weapons, described one of Lee Rigby's killers as a 'legend' and told her he would 'kill soldiers'.

After his arrest last year, Ziamani told a security officer that he had been on his way to kill a British soldier at an army barracks when he was stopped, jurors have heard.

But at his trial today, Naeem Mian, defending, asked Ziamani whether the  flag, hammer and knife he was carrying could be correctly described as a 'tool kit' and he planned to use the flag once he had beheaded a soldier or member of the Government.

The defendant replied: 'That's not what I was going to do.'

Ziamani told the jury he was 'kicked out' of his home after his Jehovah's Witness parents found out that he had converted to Islam.

Initially he turned to the Camberwell Mosque for help, before he fell in with members of an extreme group called al-Muhajiroun - or ALM - who gave him money, clothes and a place to stay.

They invited him to a meeting in the basement of a Whitechapel halal sweet shop and then he went on demonstrations organised by the group.

Talking about the discussion he had heard about  sharia law, he said: 'When I heard it, I thought it was extreme what they would do to someone when they steal or commit a sin. I did not share those views at all, what sharia law does. For example, a theft under sharia you have your hands cut off.'

But the court heard that afterwards, he posted on Facebook: 'Sharia law on its way on our streets. We will implement it, it's part of our religion.'

Asked why he did that, he said: 'I did not believe it. I wanted to fit in with these people because they were giving me places to stay and they did not like moderate Islam.'

The jury have been shown the 12in knife found in Ziamani's back pack when he was stopped by police

He insists the knife and a hammer found on him were not going to be used in a terror attack on a soldier

At the time he was arrested in June last year on an unrelated matter, police found a ripped up letter in his jeans pocket in which he wrote about mounting an attack on a British soldier and expressed the desire to die a martyr.

But he told jurors: 'I was ranting and raging about the situation in Muslim countries which was described in these talks. I did not believe it at all. I was ranting out of anger.'

Ziamani told the jury that he did not disagree with what happened to Fusilier Rigby but he had told police that he would not do it himself.

He went on to say that he carried the black flag with him because he could get texts to go to an ALM demonstration at short notice.

The court heard after he bought the flag at one of the protests, he posted on Facebook: 'I have got my black flag. I'm going to rock it everywhere I go in the Kaffirs' face.'

But the defendant, who had been a Muslim for just three-and-a-half months at the time of his first arrest, said he believed public preaching was the way to achieve sharia law in the UK.

He denied styling himself as Mujahid Karim after one of Fusilier Rigby's killers, saying the Muslim first name meaning 'fighter, a warrior' suited his character because he used to do boxing and wrestling.

Ziamani's lawyer put it to him that he would use the flag after he had committed the attack. He denied this

Ziamani said he was only 'ranting and raving' about extremism to fit in with a group who were offering help

Mr Mian asked: 'At any time were you planning a terrorist attack on military personnel or a member of the Government?' Ziamani replied: 'No.'

Mr Mian had earlier told the jury: 'It's not illegal to be offensive. In fact only recently we saw heads of state in Paris marching to defend the right to be offensive in the wake of that atrocity that happened there.

'Our Prime Minister went there and said it's quite right people have this right. We have this right in this country. That's the beauty of rights - they apply to all of us.

'We have the right to be offensive. We all have the right to have an interest in gore and grisly stuff. We have the right to have undoubtedly repulsive views, some of which he has expressed.

'He is not on trial for his views. He is on trial because the Crown bring a charge to say that he was going to behead a British soldier despite the fact there is not one shred of evidence to show he carried out a reconnaissance mission and, you bet, if there was, they would know. Quite easily done.'

The lawyer added: 'He is not on trial for the murder of Lee Rigby. He is not on trial for his opinions, as repulsive as you may find them.'

Ziamani, of Camberwell, south London, denies a charge of preparing an act of terrorism on or before August 20 last year.

The trial continues and was adjourned until tomorrow.
