A New York Subway train packed with passengers had a lucky escape on Thursday when an enormous drill bit narrowly avoided ripping into one of the F train carriages.

The incident happened as the train was pulling out of the 21st Street-Queensbridge station in Long Island City just before noon.

The giant bit, which measures 10 inches in diameter, shattered the glass of several of the train’s windows and gouged at its steel frame, the MTA has confirmed. 

Close call: A New York Subway train packed with passengers had a lucky escape on Thursday when an enormous drill bit narrowly avoided ripping into one of the F train carriages

The drill, which was being used to dig a hole, missed its mark and came spiraling through the top of the tunnel and narrowly missed entering one of the cars.

The operator had stopped the subway train by using the emergency brakes after hearing a loud noise.

On inspection, MTA workers discovered that the drill had broken through the roof of the tunnel and was just inches from the side of the train.

The drilling was part of the East Side Access project to bring the Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal, officials said.

A worker employed by a contractor - Griffin Dewatering New England Inc. - was using the drill above ground near the station, and was supposed to be expanding a construction well, officials said. 

'Somebody made a mistake; maybe a surveyor or a field engineer,' a source told the New York Post. 

'They drilled into the street but didn’t realize they were right over the F train tunnel. They weren’t supposed to be in that spot.'

No one was injured, but passengers were forced to walk through a rescue train that pulled up behind the halted train  and returned them to the platform.

Northbound F train service was halted for hours as the MTA investigated the incident before being fully restored by Thursday evening.
