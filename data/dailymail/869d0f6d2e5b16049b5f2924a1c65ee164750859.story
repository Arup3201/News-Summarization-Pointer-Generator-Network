As senators debated the Arctic, DC-dwellers engaged in their own seasonal politics.

Defying the city's sledding ban, around 100 children and adults took to Capitol Hill to tumble down the thick layer of snow on Thursday.

A group of parents claimed to be staging a 'sled-in' to protest against the rule, tweeting about it with the hash tag #SledFreeOrDie.

Though Capitol Police refused to lift the ban - citing the fact that there are 20,000 yearly sledding injuries - no arrests have yet been made.

Having a blast: Colton Fleming, six, was one of dozens involved in a sled-in to oppose the unpopular ban

Demands: This man came out in the snow armed with placards calling for an end to the ban

Political: Parents have been lobbying to end the ban for years. It came into place after the 9/11 attacks

'This is a great day for sledding and democracy,' Tim Krepp, one of the snow-covered parents, told The Hill.

He added that he had been warned by police to stop sledding but was not detained for persisting.

'We're out here sledding for America,' Mai Fernandez told Reuters Television after she skidded down the hill with her dog, Ariel, in her lap.  

Sledding has been prohibited on Capitol Hill for security reasons since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

It remains covered in snow after a storm on Thursday, which was part of a huge system stretching from Texas to New England. 

The weather closed schools, canceled nearly 4,000 flights and stranded hundreds of drivers in Kentucky. 

The District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, wrote to Capitol Police officials on Wednesday, asking them briefly lift the grounds' sledding ban to take advantage of the late-winter snow.

That was turned down by Frank Larkin, the Senate sergeant at arms who heads the Capitol Police Board, citing security concerns that made the area 'not your typical neighborhood hill or playground.'

Yet by early afternoon, the sled riding was unimpeded by Capitol police officers, who maintained their usual posts around the building.

'I'm hoping that common sense and a kind heart are ringing through,' said another sled rider, meeting planner Jason Petty, in explaining why the authorities had let things slide.
