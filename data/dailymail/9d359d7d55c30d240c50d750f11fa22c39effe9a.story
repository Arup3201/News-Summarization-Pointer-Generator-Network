This is the moment an undercover cop kicked a fellow officer in the back of the head after apparently mistaking him for a suspect.

Video footage from DNAinfo New York shows  the plain-clothed NYPD officer rush to the aid of a uniformed colleague, who was wrestling  a suspect with the help of another undercover officer.

But the officer, who is seen wearing a grey jumper and jeans, immediately kicks the undercover cop in the back of the head after joining the struggle at Coney Island's Stillwell Avenue station.

He is later seen rubbing the head of the injured officer after realising his mistake.

A female onlooker can be heard saying: 'He kicked a cop.'

Moments later the officer then turns to the suspect and punches him in the face, according to the video.

After being handcuffed, the suspect asked bystanders: 'You saw that?'

Officials say the incident occurred in January, when two NYPD Transit officers stopped a suspected fare-beater.

The anti-crime unit officer from the 60th Precinct, whose identity was not released, was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on modified duty after the 90-second clip surfaced, officials said.

NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau are now investigating the incident along with the office of Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson.

The suspect was charged with fare-beating for the January incident. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and his arrest was sealed.

An NYPD spokesman declined to identify the suspect because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and the case has been sealed.
