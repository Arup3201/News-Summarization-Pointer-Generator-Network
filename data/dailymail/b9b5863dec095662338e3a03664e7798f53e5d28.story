Women with type 2 diabetes are three times as likely to have an early menopause, say researchers.

A study by a team from the University of Cartagena in Colombia showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years, as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women.

This means a woman’s natural supply of oestrogen runs out much earlier than would normally occur, raising the risk of a heart attack, stroke and bone disease in later life.

Acceleration: The authors of the study say that women with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have an early menopause

In the UK, the average age of the menopause is 51 years, when women’s ovaries run out of eggs and they can no longer have children.

The research published in the menopause journal Climacteric (must credit) comes increasing numbers of younger women are developing type 2 diabetes, the most common type.

It is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet.

A team led by Dr Álvaro Monterrosa-Castro, of the University of Cartagena, Colombia questioned 6,079 women aged between 40 and 59 years from 11 Latin American countries about the menopause, depression and diabetes.

They analysed their responses, taking into account factors such as weight, blood pressure and use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).

The study found menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes.

But in contrast, women under 45 who have type 2 diabetes have almost three times the risk of an early menopause.

The study showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years, as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women, with almost one-third of diabetic women aged 40 to 44 having already experienced the menopause.

Risks: Diabetes is associated with a range of other difficulties

The study also showed women classified as obese were 57 per cent more likely to have diabetes, and high blood pressure also increased the risk.

In contrast to previous studies, the study found HRT increased the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent.

Dr Monterrosa-Castro said ‘The study shows several things. Firstly, menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes, but conversely having type 2 diabetes triples the risk of an early menopause.

‘Secondly, the associations between diabetes and menopause can be complex, which reinforces the message that women approaching the menopause need to be treated as individuals, and evaluated according to their own general health, background and risk factors.

‘Diabetes is also associated with a generally poor quality of life, so we should encourage women to avoid risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as being overweight or having high blood pressure.’

He said previous research found HRT cuts the risk for diabetes, but genetic differences or lower doses of oestrogen in modern drugs may account for the study’s result.

The study also found a mixed result for the association of alcohol with type 2 diabetes, with those women taking lower or moderate doses of alcohol having a reduced risk, whereas high alcohol intake was associated with a higher diabetes risk.

Climacteric editor Dr Nick Panay said ‘Premature menopause can impair health and life expectancy if poorly managed.

'This study reinforces the importance of early diagnosis to detect and treat associated conditions such as diabetes, thus optimising short and long term wellbeing.’
