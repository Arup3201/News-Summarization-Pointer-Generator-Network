A teenage schoolgirl who dyed the tips of her hair pink has been punished with isolation for her new look.

Billie Halford, 13, was pulled out of class by her head of year for adopting the fashionable dip-dye hairstyle.

Isolation punishment involves pupils being put in a separate room for the day, where they can be seen by their classmates outside, but cannot mix with other pupils.

Isolated: Billie Halford, 13, was put in isolation at school after dyeing the tips of her hair pink. Her mother, Leah Halford (in the background), 39, removed her from Ringwood School, Hants, after the punishment

Billie's mother Leah Halford, 39, said her daughter is a model pupil who has dyed her hair before.

She decided to take Billie out of Ringwood School, in Ringwood, Hampshire, until the matter is resolved.

Billie, a year eight pupil, went into school last Thursday after dyeing the inch-long tips of her hair with the Manic Panic hair dye's 'hot hot pink' shade.

Extreme: Billie had not been punished by the school in the past for dyeing her hair blonde

Mrs Halford, a mother-of-five from Poulner, in Ringwood, said: 'Billie has got dyed blonde hair, and last week I put a semi-permanent pink colour on the ends.

'I didn't think it would be an issue but she went into her tutor in the morning and the head of year put her in isolation.

'Isolation would be an appropriate punishment for naughty children, not for something as minimal as this.

'I was informed and went into the school to speak to the teachers but they said she would remain in isolation until the colour was gone, but it takes eight weeks to wash out.

'So I took her out of school. I didn't know it was against the rules, I have never even seen or heard of the rules before.

'Billie doesn't get into trouble and she does well in school, but she was put into isolation in a corridor where everyone can see them and wasn't allowed to socialise at breaks.

'I thought it was a bit extreme and thought the school could have handled it differently, perhaps telling me to rectify it.Â 

'I wouldn't have done it if I knew it would cause trouble.

'If it was all pink I could understand, but I didn't think a temporary colour would make a huge difference.

'I think it's bullying - they are saying their pupils can't have individuality.'

Although the dye would take up to eight weeks to fade, Leah has since stripped the pink colour from her daughter's hair and she is due to return to school tomorrow.

The school has defended its disciplinary action saying it is only following its 'clear' rules on students' appearance.

During isolation, pupils are removed from mainstream education and are taken to a learning centre.

They complete their studies between 8.45am and 3.20pm in isolation until the problem is resolved with parents or guardians.

The child is set work by class teachers to complete in isolation, under supervision of support staff.

Breaks are permitted for 20 minutes at 10.55am and 45 minutes at 12.50pm, but pupils in isolation must not mix with other students.

Headteacher Christina Edwards said: 'We have very clear rules with regard to appearance and uniform which parents agree to when they send their child to the school.

'Our rules state that hair should be traditionally styled and extremes of fashion such as shaved hair, beads, braids, unnatural tints, dyes and highlights are not acceptable.

'If a student arrives at school with inappropriate uniform or appearance arrangements are made to continue with learning in isolation.

'At the same time, contact is made with parents to arrange to resolve the problem.'
