A picturesque cabin in a Lapland village often referred to as 'the home of Santa Claus' has gone on sale for £392,000.

Situated close to the tiny village of Akaslompolo, buyers can even have their presents brought to them on Christmas Day in a sleigh pulled by reindeer.

The grotto-like property comes complete with four bedrooms, a sauna, and a ski room.

A log cabin in a Lapland village has gone on sale for £392,000 in Finnish Lapland, near the area Father Christmas is said to come from

The cabin, named Ainotar, is being advertised as ‘everything you need for a luxury escape in the snow’.

As part of the Lappish village of just 400 people, it's under an hour from Rovaniemi - the capital of Finnish Lapland and the official hometown of Santa Claus.

And it's close to Ylläs - a world renowned ski resort and one of the best viewing points for the Northern Lights.

There are around 300 kilometres of downhill and cross-country trails, many of which are floodlit into the evening.

It also offers sports such as snowmobiling, ice fishing or husky sledding, and husky safaris allow visitors to drive a team of dogs.

It wasn’t until 1995, when Finland joined the EU, that foreigners were first allowed to own Lappish property.

Colin Brunt, 52, the owner of agents Above the Arctic that manages the cabin, said: ‘We went on holiday to Lapland with my family ten years ago and we loved it so much we stayed for three years.

‘My youngest daughter was born there and went to Finnish school for a while.

‘It is the most magical place - at Christmas it completely comes alive.

‘In the village, Father Christmas makes visits and finds out who has been naughty and who has been nice.

‘And at the beginning of December all the children in Finnish school are given little hats so they run around the village looking like elves.

‘If you ask very nicely, Santa will even save you're presents until last and arrive on Christmas morning in his sleigh to deliver them straight to your door before he and the reindeer head home for a well-earned rest.

‘You really can make dreams come true.

‘Admittedly it's a bit odd when you're there in the summer and you bump into Saint Nick in the supermarket with his wife and kids!

‘But because of the previous restrictions on property ownership the area above the Arctic Circle is still very much virgin territory for Brits moving abroad - it's an incredible place.’
