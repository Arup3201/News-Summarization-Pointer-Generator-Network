Given that Wolfsburg go into the weekend's round of fixtures sitting comfortably in the upper echelons of the Bundesliga it is little wonder former Premier League outcasts Nicklas Bendtner and Andre Schurrle are looking relaxed.

The former Arsenal and Chelsea forwards were all smiles as they posed for a picture as the team made their way east for Saturday's top-flight clash against Bayer Leverkusen at the BayArena.

Bendtner posted the picture, which also included team-mate Josuha Guilavogui, to his Instagram account on Friday afternoon.

Dieter Hecking's side are eight points behind league leaders Bayern Munich going into the match and are unbeaten in nine matches in all competitions.

Schurrle completed a £24million switch to the Bundesliga club on transfer deadline day earlier this month and starred on his debut as he set up two goals in a 3-0 win against Hoffenheim.

Bendtner joined Wolfsburg in the summer on a free transfer after his Arsenal contract ended following loan spells at Juventus and Sunderland.
