If the frozen waterfalls were not beautiful enough, the spectacular night sky certainly gave these climbers something beautiful to look at.

These striking images shot at Various Canadian national parks show the beauty of the frozen landscapes at night.

As ice climbers scale frozen waterfalls beneath incredible night skies, Canadian photographer Paul Zizka manages to capture the whole scene on camera.

Paul Zizka uses a long exposure on his camera and only a small climbing lamp for light to capture the haunting night images

The 35-year-old photographer has snapped celestial climbing images on clear nights at Kootenay National Park and Johnston Canyon in Banff National Park. 

By using a long exposure on his camera and only a small climbing lamp for light, Paul was able to capture both the crystal blue falls and sparkling night sky above.

However, despite the serene surroundings the sport isn't without its risks as explorers, Mike Stuart, Seb Boulton and Jonathan Fox braved temperatures of -30C as well as avalanche hazards, loose ice and of course the chance of falling.

Paul said: 'I do pick and choose the waterfalls I photograph, I choose the ones that have that additional level of interest, whether it's big scenery, dead trees, open water, caves or a canyon for example.

'Most of the nights we went out there was a really clear night sky, it really helps when trying to capture the beauty of the night sky.

'It's exciting to get to photograph some of these locations as they are only accessible for a limited period of time every year.

'It's harder to climb at night especially as the only light source comes from one's own headlamp.

'Ice climbing does involve dealing with significant objective hazard, including, at times, falling ice, avalanche hazard, the elements in general and the potential for a fall.'
