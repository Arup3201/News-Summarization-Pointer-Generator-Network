Ebola claim: An arrest report said that Joseph Britton, 42, said he had Ebola

A courtroom was evacuated yesterday after it emerged one of the prisoners appearing in the dock had claimed to have Ebola.

Joseph Britton, a 42-year-old accused of battery and disorderly conduct, told officers arresting him Thursday night that he had the deadly disease - despite showing none of the symptoms.

They did not take the claims seriously and took him into court as usual - but when the arrest report was read out, the judge panicked and ordered all the other inmates out of the room.

The claims emerged when an arrest report was read out in court.

They came after Britoon had got to a waterfront bar, tried to smoke but was told he couldn't. He then became angry. 

In the document, a police officer wrote: 'William [Clark, a bar manager] confronted Joseph, who continued to smoke on the fuel docks... He also got right up close to William.

'Williams felt threatened by Joseph and asked him to leave the proeprty. Joseph kept telling William to 'f*** off'.

'Joseph then started to lick his own hand and stated 'I've got Ebola' and began to wipe his saliva-soaked hand on William. He did this several times. Joseph then left the property.'   

Judge John Hurley, who was conducting bond hearings via video-link, was recorded by the Sun Sentinel saying: 'I dunno. What do we do...?

'This gentleman has claimed he has Ebola... I believe you should clear the courtroom of all the prisoners.'

Fire crews and a hazmat team then descended on the courtroom, locking down the jail for four hours.

On his own: Britton was then left in the courtroom by himself. Emergency crews in protective gear then rushed him to hospital, where he was given the all-clear

Officials later confirmed that Britton had no signs of Ebola, and the court, in Broward County, Florida, resumed. He had also been screened when he was first taken to jail. 

Britton was taken out of the courtroom to a medical center in Fort Lauderdale, where doctors gave him the all-clear. 

He licked his hand then wiped it down a bar employee, who had angered him by telling him he couldn't smoke explosive gas tanks, the report said.

Had the disease been real, as many as 250 people could have come into contact with him since the arrest, a prison official said.

Response: Hazmat crews descended on the Broward County jail after the false Ebola claim

Lockdown: Hazmat teams spent four hours securing the jail before it was announced that the Ebola claims were definitely untrue

'Dress rehearsal': The Sheriff for Broward County said the false alarm was a good test for his staff

He was waiting in the courtroom with 91 other arrestees when the evacuation was ordered. Britton was held in an isolate cell while the rest of the prisoners were kept away.

Scott Israel, the Sheriff for Broward County, said law enforcement were considering the false alarm a 'dress rehearsal'. He added that no sheriffs flagged the Ebola possibility because it is 'not their job' to examine arrest reports.

Britton later said he did not claim he had Ebola and that the report was based on a misunderstanding.
