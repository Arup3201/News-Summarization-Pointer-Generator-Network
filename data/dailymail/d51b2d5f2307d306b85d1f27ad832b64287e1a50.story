Promoters of a dance festival where a young woman died of a suspected drug overdose at the weekend have revealed their heartache over the tragedy.

Georgina Bartter, 19, was rushed to hospital from the Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair in Sydney on Saturday afternoon.

She died on Saturday night at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst from multiple organ failure. Friends told police that she took just one and a half pills, believed to be MDMA. 

Adelle Robinson, who runs Fuzzy - the company who organised the festival - told The Daily Telegraph she was devastated, and described the tragedy as the worst thing that's ever happened during her time in the music industry.

'It’s just awful, I’m a mum and I can’t imagine how the family are feeling,' she said.

Ms Robinson also revealed that she was notified as soon as paramedics arrived on the scene and was kept updated on Ms Bartter's condition through the night.

'We had police on site for the duration of the event as well, they had a command centre next to our control room and I was being given 10-minute updates until we found out that she passed away,' she told the publication.

Fellow promoter John Wall said he believed they had done all they could in terms of preventing partygoers taking drugs at the festival, and denied they were 'turning a blind eye to anything'.

He added that with police presence and sniffer dogs there was little more they could have done in terms of prevention.

A person who witnessed Georgina Bartter's collapse at a dance festival was disgusted that at least five bystanders were videoing the 19-year-old as paramedics tried to save her life. 

The teenager was the oldest of three children and believed to be studying accounting. She finished Year 12 in 2013 at Wenona, a private girls' high school in North Sydney.

A witness has told Daily Mail Australia of his distress when he realised strangers were filming Ms Bartter after she collapsed on the dance floor. 

'I was five metres away from her when she collapsed. She was in the middle of the crowd and people had their phones up, pointed at her while medics worked on her,' he said.

'It was just sick. I saw about five guys filming. You can tell the difference between somebody texting and somebody videoing.'

The witness says Ms Bartter was on the ground and unresponsive while at least five men nearby filmed her.

Promoters of the event have revealed their heartache over the death of Ms Bartter, who reportedly took one and a half pills

'One of my friends grabbed the phone out of someone's hands and yelled, "what are you doing?"'

'You wouldn't think people can be so low.' 

A close friend, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with the 19-year-old, told Daily Mail Australia that he first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm.

'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed.

'She started going downhill from there.' 

Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate.

'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said.

As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm.

The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night.

'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl. 

Another man was introduced to Ms Bartter at around 4pm by a mutual friend, and said the 19-year-old was shaking very badly.

The Sydney girl, seen here with family members, was remembered by friends at a service at her high school Wenona on Monday 

'I shook her hand ... Her hand was shaking really really bad, but she was smiling, she said "Hi I'm Georgina",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He said although she seemed unwell he noticed no signs that she was about to collapse.

'If I had of looked at her and she'd been uneasy on her feet or looked like she was swaying we would have helped her ... If we had seen any sign that she was about to collapse we would have done something.'

'It's an absolute tragedy', he added.

On Monday, a service was held in the 19-year-old's memory at Wenona, the high school Ms Bartter attended until her graduation in 2013.

It's understood Georgina Bartter's younger sister currently attends the private girl's school.

'We have had a beautiful service for Georgina today with our Senior College students, and our younger girls have met with staff and counsellors,' said Dr Briony Scott, the school's principal.

'As parents and teachers, we will continue to walk alongside our young people, focusing onhope, and helping them come to terms with this loss.'

Dr Scott says the school community is 'terribly sad' by the death of 'this gorgeous, funny, bright young woman'

'She will be remembered for her scholarship and for her active and friendly approach to life. She had an infectious sense of humour and we will miss her enormously.'

'I thank our community for their kind words and offers of help, which we have passed on to the Bartter family.'

The teenager, seen here with her father, dropped to the ground on the dancefloor at the festival and was then rushed to hospital

'Our hearts and our prayers go out to them at this time.'

The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital.

'Ultimate tragedy, a teenage girl dies,' said Dr Fulde.

'As she was critical, within minutes, the intensive care consultant and team were mobilised and rushed down.'

'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde.

Operating equipment was moved down to the emergency ward as Ms Bartter's condiiton was quickly deteriorating.

'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.'

'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.' 

Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief.

'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.'

The family of the teenager released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'.

The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported.

'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read.

'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.'

Promoters of Fuzzy - the company that organises Harbouside - said they were devastated over the tragedy

The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven.

An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death.

Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event.

Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth.

'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.' 

Witnesses told of how Ms Bartter was shaking uncontrollably while paramedics tried to revive her

The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong.

'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained.

'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.'

The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority in a statement released on Sunday.

'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read.

'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.'

The festival has been held annually at Mrs Macquarie's Chair in Sydney since 2003
