International Development Secretary Justine Greening halted more aid going to Rwanda

Britain yesterday halted £21million in aid payments to Rwanda over human rights concerns.

The surprise move comes only a few weeks after David Cameron called the African country a ‘continuing success story’.

Announcing the policy U-turn, Justine Greening said there was ‘credible and compelling’ evidence that Rwanda was arming a violent revolt in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her predecessor as International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, had controversially resumed aid payments to Rwanda in September, saying it had ended its support for the so-called M23 rebels in the DRC.

The Commons international development committee said yesterday that Mr Mitchell’s decision was inexplicable, given the weight of evidence suggesting Rwandan president Paul Kagame has been backing the revolt for months.

A devastating report by the United Nations last month detailed Rwanda’s central role in a conflict that has left a trail of death and destruction in the eastern DRC and forced half a million people from their homes.

Miss Greening also announced that Britain will give an extra £18million to the DRC to help deal with the humanitarian crisis there.

The decision to suspend the aid programme is embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who has forged a friendship with Kagame and invited him to address the Conservative Party conference in 2007.

In October the Prime Minister mounted a robust defence of Mr Mitchell, telling MPs: ‘I am clear Rwanda has been, and continues to be, a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty.

‘I am proud of the fact the last Government, and this Government, have continued to invest in that success.’

Britain suspended the last tranche of £16million of aid in July when the UN published its interim findings.

But Mr Mitchell, a personal friend of Kagame, reinstated the payments on his last day as International Development Secretary.

Justifying the decision he told Mr Cameron in a letter: ‘Reporting shows that [Rwanda’s] practical support to the M23 has now ended.’

Mr Mitchell denies acting as a ‘rogue minister’ and has stressed Rwanda’s good record of using aid money to help its people.

But in a report on his decision 
yesterday MPs on the international development committee said: ‘We are 
not privy to all the information and advice upon which he made this 
assessment but, on the basis of the other evidence we received, we do 
not understand how he reached the conclusion that support for the M23 
had ceased.’

In Opposition the Tories developed a close relationship with Kagame  in an attempt to lose their ‘nasty party’ image.

Mr Mitchell, Mr Cameron and dozens of 
Tory MPs travelled to the tiny east African country to carry out 
voluntary work and display their caring credentials.

But human rights groups have become 
increasingly concerned by the actions of the Kagame regime in recent 
years – at home and abroad.

Kagame, who was re-elected in 2010 
with 93 per cent of the vote, has been accused of suppressing political 
opponents and journalists in Rwanda.

Since the start of the year the 
country has also been accused of masterminding the M23 mutiny, which is 
led by Bosco Ntaganda, a Congolese warlord and indicted war criminal. 
Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict.

Kagame’s regime is heavily dependent 
on foreign aid, which accounts for a third of its annual budget. Britain
 is the country’s biggest foreign donor and this year alone is due to 
give £75million.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman denied the decision to reinstate aid in September was a mistake.

‘We stand by the decision that we made
 to release the last tranche of funding,’ he added. ‘This is our 
approach to the aid budget. We keep decisions under review.’

Mr Cameron raised concerns with Kagame
 when he spoke to him by telephone a few weeks ago, according to No 10. 
David Mepham, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said the decision to 
suspend aid to Rwanda was long overdue.

He said aid should not be reinstated 
until Rwanda had shown it was prepared to honour agreements to respect 
human rights, adding: ‘For years, these principles have been breached by
 Rwanda without triggering any response from the UK Government.’

Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance said: ‘It’s appalling that British taxpayers’ money has gone 
directly to a government involved in a proxy war that has brought untold
 misery to hundreds of thousands of people.

‘This announcement leaves a huge question mark over why DfID, and specifically Andrew Mitchell, reinstated the aid programme.’

British
 aid to Rwanda is ‘funding a dictator’ and worsening the misery of his 
victims, a former senior aide to the African state’s president claimed 
last night.  

The 
£270million of aid earmarked for the  country over the next three years 
is ‘sustaining a bad regime’, said David Himbara, who was private 
secretary to President Paul Kagame until two years ago.

Kagame’s
 regime is alleged to be funding and arming a bloody rebellion in the 
neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, in a conflict  marked by 
the use of child soldiers and widespread rape and murder.
