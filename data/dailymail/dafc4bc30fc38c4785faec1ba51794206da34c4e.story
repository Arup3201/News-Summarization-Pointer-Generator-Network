Les Ferdinand is in line for a return to QPR, the club where he established his reputation as one of the leading strikers in the country

QPR owner Tony Fernandes is considering Ferdinand for a role at the club’s academy after boss Richard Allen announced last week he was leaving to join the Football Association.

Fernandes said recently: ‘My focus is trying to develop the academy — Les is one of the many names we’re looking at. I’d love to see him come back to QPR but we’ll have to wait and see.'

Ferdinand spent last season as a coach at Tottenham under Tim Sherwood but was left the club after Mauricio Pochettino's appointment this summer.

Fernandes previously said there was no position for the former Rs striker in a Director of Football role but he is understood to be keen on getting the former prolific hitman to take a role working within the youth system at Loftus Road.
