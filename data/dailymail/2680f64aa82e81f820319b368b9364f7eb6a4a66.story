The FA are refusing to say why they are investigating last summer’s £15million transfer of England international Calum Chambers from Southampton to Arsenal.

The surprising probe for a deal that went through with no problems from either Premier League club follows a complaint made to the FA by, it is believed, a disgruntled third party to the deal.

Both clubs are aware the FA are looking into the transaction but do not know why. The negotiations were amicable and handled directly by Les Reed of Southampton and Arsenal’s Dick Law.

Asked whether he was happy with the transfer, Wenger on Friday said: 'Yes, I am very happy about his transfer. I made over 350 transfers since I am here. We have a lot of enquiries about them and we never had any problem.'

Suggestions of agents unrest would not normally be enough to warrant this type of FA attention.

Chambers is on the books of Cassius Sports Management, whose agent Alan Middleton, a licensed lawyer, refused to return frequent calls because a legal colleague said it was company policy not to talk to the press.

Cassius’s head of talent ID and player recruitment is Steve Moss, who is also Chambers’s stepfather. But there is nothing to stop an agency employing one of their client’s family.

Chambers began his career at Southampton before his move to the Emirates Stadium last summer

The issue is said by former team-mates of Chambers to lie somewhere with Arsenal, but a club spokesman said on Thursday: ‘Everything was open, cordial and above board with Southampton throughout the Calum Chambers transfer.’

The FA will not comment about any compliance department activity.

Mark Pougatch will have ITV’s two most high-profile pundits with him in the studio when he makes his debut as axed Adrian Chiles’s successor for the Champions League game between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea on Tuesday week.

Roy Keane, after leaving his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa, will be returning as an ITV analyst on a game-by-game basis and will have his former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes alongside. 

Neither of them hold back with their often scathing opinions, which will give new presenter Pougatch a testing environment for his first game. Keane’s demeanour will be fascinating as in the past his body language alone has shown what he thinks about daft questions from Chiles.

Leading football agent Rob Segal has lost another of his big-name players to Aidy Ward, who is leaving Impact Sports Management to set up on his own. 

Following the defection of Raheem Sterling and Saido Barahino, Arsenal have been informed that England’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will now be represented by Ward and Alex’s father Mark, who also played for England.

The astonishment that has greeted Manchester United paying former manager Sir Alex Ferguson £2million a year for 20 days of ambassador work, first revealed by Sports Agenda, will be that much more with the knowledge the contract is open ended. 

This allows Fergie to carry out such lucrative £100,000-a-day engagements for as long as he wants. The club view is Fergie’s achievements at Old Trafford warrant such largesse.

Virgin threat derailed

The Premier League have played down the threat of Virgin Media’s complaint about the TV match selling process to broadcast regulators Ofcom — who have dismissed their attempts to derail today’s rights bids deadline. 

But the issue was concern enough to be discussed at length at yesterday’s club summit, with chairmen worried about where regulatory intervention is going to strike next. Club meetings are often a foreign-owner free zone but at least Liverpool’s Tom Werner was there on Thursday, while Sunderland’s Ellis Short has replaced David Gill on the audit and remuneration committee that will select the next Premier League chairman.

Dave Jones, Sky Sports football presenter, is to become an executive director of League Two Oxford United. His colleague Jeff Stelling is president of Hartlepool but hopefully Jones will not plug his allegiance on air as often as Stelling bangs on about struggling Hartlepool.

Peter Alliss, who has made clear his upset at BBC losing live Open golf coverage, is one pundit that Sky are not interested in signing when they take over the rights in 2017. Alliss will be 86 by then and will surely call it a day after the Troon Open in 2016, if not at St Andrews this year.
