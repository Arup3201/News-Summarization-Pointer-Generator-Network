Patients should have the option to top-up their NHS treatment with small monthly payment in return for an ‘enhanced’ service, a report suggests.

Allowing people who can afford it to invest extra money would raise billions of pounds and give all patients a better healthcare experience, the authors say.

Those who choose to pay - a sum starting from £100 per year for someone on a wage of £20,000 - would still receive the standard service in NHS hospitals and clinics.

But by voluntarily paying extra they could avoid long waiting times for procedures and seek treatment in any centre in the country if they are subject to a postcode lottery where they live, according to the report by the think tank Civitas.

It recommends that better-off patients be able to buy extra treatment, which is not currently available, from NHS trusts as well as private providers.

The authors, NHS consultant Dr Christoph Lees and researcher Edmund Stubbs argue that this ‘contribution scheme’ would alleviate the current stress on the health service and offset the need for higher taxes across the board, while also staying true to the principle of free healthcare at the point of use.

They say polls show there is a ‘public appetite’ for increased contributions to the health service, with one survey suggesting 60pc of the public would be willing to pay increased income tax if it went towards healthcare.

‘The proposed NHS contribution scheme would help safe-guard the NHS's core commitment to meeting the needs of everyone’, they say.

‘Where NHS services are known to be poor, the alternative of seeking treatment elsewhere will be available to patients. This is one means of challenging the existing 'postcode lottery' where patients have widely differing quality of NHS treatment in different areas of the country.

‘Money raised from the contribution fee could then be invested in these weak or inefficient aspects of NHS service, improving the level of care for those who use them, even where they are non-contributors to the scheme.’

Allowing patients to top up what is known as their ‘personal budget’ set by the NHS, would save money and avert the need for any further reorganisations of the health service, they say.

‘It would simply act as an add-on; allowing individual patients who chose to contribute, an increased personal choice of provider instead of having to use those providers made available by the present block tendering out of services by commissioners.’

They propose a contribution of 0.5pc of income deducted each month from their payroll like income tax. They believe the scheme could raise £3.5 billion a year depending on how many people sign up.

After four consecutive monthly payments - to avoid individuals contributing only when anticipating illness - those who take part would be entitled to access their personal treatment budget.

‘The additional income could encourage investment in separate facilities for elective procedures that are often cancelled at short notice when there is pressure on A&E departments’.

Contributors could also benefit from extras aimed at encouraging people to take more responsibility for their own health, such as annual ‘health MOTs’ for a lower price than with private providers.

The health service is projected to face a £30billion funding hap by the year 2020. Both the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised billions more for the NHS over the next five years but will still fall short of the funding needed.

The Civitas proposal would create a two-tier system, as the authors acknowledge, but they say this has already been created by the advent of private healthcare.

But critics suggest that if the middle classes take on fees and receive better treatment, they may be less likely to stand up and flight for better services for all.

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The NHS will remain free at the point of use and patients can already choose where they have NHS treatment.’
