A stunning collection of images taken by a wildlife photographer have revealed what life is really like in the animal kingdom. 

From pouting penguins to nosy orangutans, Sean Crane has captured a wide range of creatures, travelling from India to Uganda and Croatia to observe them in their natural habitat.

Alongside candid photographs of the animals are others of Mr Crane, whose 'day job', as he describes it is as an advertising executive, working alongside conservationists. 

In addition to travelling to every continent to capture images of exotic animals, the photographer from Connecticut also spent a year driving around the U.S. to visit those closer to home. 

The gallery of animal portraits below was taken in the rainforests of Indonesia, Madagascar and Borneo, home to some of the planet's most endangered species. 

Also featured are squawking penguins on the Falkland Islands and regal cheetahs as they roam across conservation parks in Kenya.

A bearded piglet poses for a portrait in Borneo. The species is the only native wild pig on the island and is typically found in its rainforests

A diademed sifaka hangs upside down form a tree in Madagascar, its yellow and grey fur unmissable from a distance. The species is critically endangered with very few of its kind found at one time 

A red bellied lemur hugs a tree in Madagascar, its bright brown eyes opened wide for the portrait. The animal can normally be found foraging at all levels of the rainforest 

A black and white ruffed lemur hugs a tree in Madagascar. The animal is easily recognised by its wide amber eyes. It is rarer than its counterpart, the red ruffed lemur, also found in the island's rainforests

A surprised looking leaf-tailed gecko opens wide for the camera in Madagascar. It is considered the smallest species of gecko in the world with adults typically measuring between three and six inches in length

A nosy orangutan stretches out towards Mr Crane's camera in the  Tanjung Puting National Park in Indonesia. The species is threatened by rapid deforestation across South East Asia 

A Black Crested Macaque bares its fangs for the camera in Tangkoko National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Black crested macaques are critically endangered with an estimated 5,000 remaining in the wild

A dough-eyed deer is taken by surprise as it finds a quiet spot to rest in the Madagascan wild. As well as dense rainforest there is an abundance of wildlife in the island's drier patches

An angry Rockhopper penguin squawks towards Mr Crane's lens at the The Rookery on Saunders Island, one of the Falkland Islands

A lazy Juvenile Northern Elephant Seal looks woefully down the camera as it rests on washed up reeds on a beach in central California

A sad looking baby  sea lion on the shores of the Galapagos Islands. The species is classed as vulnerable because it can mostly only be found on the archipelago 

Looking menacingly at the photographer's lens, a marine iguana clutches onto salty rocks for his portrait in the Galapagos Islands. Its grey and blue scales are the perfect camouflage in its dark and watery habitat

A juvenile Southern Elephant Seal takes in the view at Carcass Island on the Falkland Islands. Males weight eight to ten times what females do - the largest weight difference between sexes in the animal kingdom 

A proud cheetah poses calmly for this extraordinarily close-up portrait in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. The vast wildlife park is home to 10 of the species alongside rhinos, lions and birds

Mr Crane helps as a mother orangutan grooms her young in the Borneo rainforest. The photographer has travelled to all seven continents to capture exotic wildlife in its natural habitat

The advertising executive also travelled the U.S. and lived out of the back of his car to compile one gallery. Above, he strokes the head of a confident wild cheetah on the bonnet of his jeep in Kenya
