The first Ebola test for the quarantined King Charles Spaniel belonging to a Dallas nurse hospitalized with the virus has come back negative.

The city of Dallas said on Wednesday that one-year-old Bentley will be tested again before his 21-day quarantine period ends on November 1.

Bentley was quarantined after his owner, 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham, was diagnosed with Ebola.

After she contracted the virus, her apartment was decontaminated by a hazmat-suited cleaning crew (right) and her dog quarantined 

Dallas spokeswoman Sana Syed tweeted recently: 'Bentley is doing great! Turns out he likes butt rubs.'

She added that the 'cutie' was 'doing great', spending time with vets and playing with his toys.

Miss Pham was the first of two Texas nurses infected after treating the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., Thomas Eric Duncan, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.  

The city has been sending pictures of the dog regularly to Miss Pham, who is the first person to contract Ebola in the United States. 

She's being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where her condition was upgraded to good.

Bentley is being cared for by the City of Dallas Animal Services at a decommissioned naval air base.

The pet, evacuated from Pham's apartment, has been under the spotlight after officials in Madrid put down the dog of a Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola while caring for a patient. 

There was an uproar in Spain after Madrid authorities euthanized a dog belonging to the nurse sickened by the virus.

Nurse Teresa Romero, 44, lost her 12-year-old dog Excalibur who was put down amid violent protests in Spain over the authority's decision. The nurse has since recovered from Ebola.
