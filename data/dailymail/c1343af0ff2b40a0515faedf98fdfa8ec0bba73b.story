Jacqui McCoy, was 30 years old when she embarked on her one year weight-loss challenge on ABC's Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition and had been battling fertility issues on account of her size.

Weighing in at 355lbs, the West Palm Beach, Florida, native was depressed, insecure and embarrassed to let even her husband see her naked.

Now boasting a trim 148lb body, Jacqui wowed viewers on last night's episode with the biggest weight loss in television history having shed over 58per cent of her body weight from start to finish.

Fabulous and fit: Jacqui McCoy weighed 355lbs at the start of her Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition challenge and by the end of the year dropped an astonishing 207lbs, weighing in at 148lbs

Though natural conception, she has since discovered, is still hindered by blocked tubes, the inspiring wife and hopeful mother has been told she is now a perfect candidate for IVF and will start treatment soon.

And since family is what spurred her on her mission, the humbled reality star can only be thankful for her incredible achievements so far.

She told ABC: 'I'm not sure I would have fought as hard as I did if I wasn't as motivated by the thought of having a family.'

At
14 years of age, Jacqui had been a bright teenager with a natural gift for 
singing and a promising future until one night at a party, a young boy 
attacked her.

Unable
to cope with the pain of keeping her shameful story a secret she turned
to food and thus began a path towards morbid obesity and a life of 
misery.

Shame: At age 30, Jacqui was so ashamed of her weight she would hide from her husband Shawn when naked

No pain no gain: Training with Chris Powell, the West Palm Beach native was motivated to shed the weight by her inability to conceive a child due to obesity

Under the guidance of Extreme 
Makeover's trainer Chris Powell, by the second week of her diet and 
exercise regime, Jacqui had converted her living room into an impressive
workout space.

Chris'
high expectations demanded that she drop a whopping 
90lbs in the very first 30 days, a goal she reached and for which she 
and her husband, Shawn, were rewarded with a long-overdue honeymoon trip
to Ireland on ABC's dime.

But, it wasn't all fun and games for 
Jacqui. During the trip she was tasked with completing a gruelling 
100-kilometre bicycle ride over the hilly terrain.

Over
the ensuing three months, she whittled her weight down to an admirable 
210lbs and when she shed another 35lbs she became the first woman under 
Chris' supervision to have lost 50per cent of her body weight in just 
nine months.

This
impressive achievement made her eligible for excess skin removal 
surgery, a procedure to remove the surplus flesh that often hangs off the
bodies of those who lose drastic amounts of weight.

Stunning transformation: Jacqui made television history by losing over 58per cent of her body weight over the year and was rewarded with a Walmart gift card valued at $50,000

New woman: Since losing the weight for the reality show, Jacqui has kept up a healthy lifestyle and begun weight-loss coaching others including her younger sister who thanks to her help has lost 48lbs

By the end of the year, weighing in at 148lbs, fit, strong and healthy both in mind and body, Jacqui was rewarded for her brave accomplishment by Walmart with a $50,000 gift card.

Thanks to this money, the reality show victor told ABC, she was able to pursue her dreams and aspirations rather than return to work straight away.

Of her life-changing experience she said: 'I got this amazing gift and I want to share it with everyone I can.' And so, Jacqui has become a weight-loss coach herself.

Among her clients, she counts her very own sister who dropped 48lbs under her sister's influence. And it isn't just her sister who has benefited from Jacqui's new found wisdom and fighting spirit.

These days instead of chowing down on burgers and chips at get-togethers, her family have embraced new healthy foods and cook a feast of grilled chicken and vegetables instead.

United: Though Jacqui and Shawn have been told her tubes are blocked and natural conception is unlikely, she is a good candidate for IVF treatment

Sharing the wisdom: Jacqui's family have benefited from her experience too and have substituted their diet of burgers and chips for grilled chicken and vegetables

Not only is she healthier, happier and excited to start a family, Jacqui has found her voice again and recently sang at her cousin's wedding.

'I found the biggest hurdle to weight loss is not your body but your brain. It was when I changed my mind about who I am, what I am worth, and what I am capable of doing. Once I finally found my fight to lose the weight I realized life is a fight,' she told ABC.

And just to put a perfect conclusion to an inspiring story, Jacqui will be encouraging next season's Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition hopefuls as a coach alongside Chris Powell.

'Getting to pay it forward it the greatest reward, I am so excited,' she gushed.
