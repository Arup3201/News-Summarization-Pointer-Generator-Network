A high school senior without a date for the prom made a Hail Mary shot with her YouTube video asking Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade to accompany her.

And against the odds her cheeky request paid off when the basketball heartthrob arrived ready to accompany his date to last night's dance

Nicole Muxo, 18, made a video on April 20 asking the shooting guard if he'd take time out of his play-off schedule to accompany her to the Archbishop Coleman Carroll High School prom.

Despite his knee injury and it being a rare night off the court, he decided to surprise her - turning up to the delight of the teen and her senior year.

Writing about his night out on Twitter this morning, Wade wrote: 'I had a blast at Prom. Never be 2 scared to ask.'

Ms Muxo, a senior at the South Florida school, is a huge fan of the Heat but particularly Wade.

'I was so surprised. I didn’t expect it at all,' Nicole told CBS Miami.

The next day she took to Twitter again to thank the player adding: 'You made my dreams come true.'

The 31-year-old father of two, whose on court nickname is Flash or D-Wade, called the high school student while she was in the dance at La Jolla Ballroom in Coral Gables - making her think he was just telling her to have a good night.

But then he walked in, greeting her with a hug as she put her hand to her mouth.

He said it was the persistence of the young lady, who tweeted him numerous times as well as posting the video, that won him over.

Ms Muxo made the proposal film with her sister and best friend.

Delighted: The 18-year-old was overawed by the star's appearance. He is her favorite basketball player

In it she poses in front of a Wade poster and says: 'Hi Dwyane Wade, my name is Nicole and my senior prom is coming up. I have everything set for a perfect night except for the perfect date, as you're my favorite basketball player I wondered...'

The video then shows her posing with signs saying 'Will you go to prom with me?'

This isn't the first time she's approached Wade, having asked him to go to her homecoming too.

However, this time her use of the video and refusal to say no paid off.

'She continued to go for it no matter how many times I told her I’m going to be busy she continued asking if I’m going to come,' he told the broadcaster.

Basketball fan: The Miami Heat fan wouldn't take no for an answer

Proposal: Ms Muxo asked the player through a Youtube video, pictured

He danced with the teenager and posed for pictures with her and her friends before making his exit.

'You wanted me to be your date, I appreciate it so much,' he told her. 

Thinking the star could well be a no-show, Ms Muxo had a back-up date in Laurent Chaumin but the fellow senior took the star's arrival well.

And he was delighted at the fact that Wade complimented him on his suit.

Wade joked he was 'the third wheel' and then left the teenagers to it.

He has an ongoing knee problem which is being treated ahead of Wednesday's Eastern Conference finals.
