Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki have been having a great time since the end of the WTA Tour season.

Wozniacki ran the New York Marathon last week, before the two tennis stars were spotted at a New York Knicks basketball game on Tuesday.

And now the two top ten players have found a new source of fun, hanging out by a pool and taking pictures together.
