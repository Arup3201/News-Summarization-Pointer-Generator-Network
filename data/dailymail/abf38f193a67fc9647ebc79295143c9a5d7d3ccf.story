The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been given a makeover - or at least, their Madame Tussauds wax figures have.

The pair were first installed together at the London tourist attraction two years ago - to mark their first wedding anniversary - and bosses thought it was time for an update.

The models previously sported the outfits which Kate Middleton and Prince William wore when they got engaged, but they have now been ditched for evening wear.

Evening wear: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's models have been restyled to give them a glam look

How they looked before: Madame Tussauds worked with Issa and Gieves & Hawkes to ensure the clothes worn by the couple would be perfect representations of the real thing

Kate has been dressed in a full-length turquoise silk jersey Issa London gown, shoes and clutch bag by LK Bennett, while William is in a double-breasted black Gieves and Hawkes dinner suit.

The figures are placed in the royal zone along with those of the Queen, the Prince Of Wales and Prince Harry.

Tussauds marketing manager Matthew 
Clarkson said: 'The Royal Family have always been the highlight of a 
visit for many guests to Madame Tussauds London.

'And the young royal couple have been particularly popular since their launch two years ago.

Intricate design: The tourist attraction wanted to give the models a fresh look

'After two years in the attraction, it seemed the perfect time to give them a glamorous makeover.'

The Tussauds artists worked from the iconic pose of the two at the announcement of their engagement.

Tussauds revealed that the couple were kept closely informed of work on the figures at every stage of the creation, a process continuing a relationship with the Royal family that goes back 180 years, when Madame Tussaud opened her first attraction in London featuring the figure of King William IV.

The figures cost £150,000 each to make and took a dedicate team of artists four months to create.
