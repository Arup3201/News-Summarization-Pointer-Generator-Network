Christmas came early for a four-year-old boy obsessed by trucks, when UPS decided to reunite him with his favorite driver and give him a truck of his own.

Carson Kight of Colorado Springs, Colorado, would always look forward to seeing his local UPS delivery man, Ernest Lagasca, who would make deliveries in his neighborhood. 

'When I first started off he wouldn’t even come out of the house, he would just look at the truck from inside the window… he loved trucks in general, but for some reason the UPS truck really captivated him. He’s just intrigued by it,’ said Lagasca, who Carson calls Mr Ernie.

UPS recently uploaded a feel-good video of Carson, dressed in his own UPS uniform taking delivery of his very own miniature UPS truck.

Carson then made deliveries to his neighbors' homes in his brand new battery-powered truck with the help of a home-made map.

The truck should go some way to making up for the fact that Lagasca was transferred to a different route and therefore no longer sees Carson as often.

Speaking to local TV station KRDO, Lagasca said: ‘He used to brighten my day. And it was right in the middle of my day where I kind of needed a little bit of a pick-up.’   

For Lagasca though, who has worked at UPS for over 25 years, the new route helps as it involves more driving and less heavy-lifting.

The two were reunited when UPS arranged for Carson to come to the depot and meet the whole fleet of drivers, who had heard all about the boy from Lagasca.

‘It's every dad's dream to see your son be part of a team, and not just in football, but in life,’ Carson’s father Jim Kight told KRDO.

‘For every one of them, they're making 10,000 Christmases happen or holidays happen for us,’ said Kight.

For Carson the thrill was not just seeing lots of big brown trucks, but getting to catch up with Mr Ernie again, and deliver some happiness of his own to his neighbors.
