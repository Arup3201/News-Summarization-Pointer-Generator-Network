The impeccable colours and lighting could easily fool you into thinking these photographs have been taken from the set of a Hollywood blockbuster.

In fact, this amazing set of photographs shows a Royal Marine unit readying itself for the front line at a training camp in the U.S. desert.

Proving that they are naturals in front of a camera, the soldiers from 42 Commando unit are pictured being put through their paces at the US Marine Corps's combat centre in Twentynine Palms.

The vast training centre has 932 square miles of desert, similar to that encountered in Afghanistan, where soldiers can undertake live fire exercises.

The unit lost seven servicemen during their six-month tour of Afghanistan between April and October last year.

The battalion, based at Bickleigh Barracks near Plymouth, is a subordinate unit within 3 Commando Brigade.

The command was first raised during the Second World War, as the Marines underwent an expansion, serving in India and Burma between 1943 and 1945.

Marines from the unit have also served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and the Falklands.
