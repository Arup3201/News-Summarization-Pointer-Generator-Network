Self-esteem problems: Mohammed Emwazi was even given anger management therapy at school

Fellow secondary school pupils bullied Mohammed Emwazi - calling him ‘Little Mo’, it emerged yesterday.

Emwazi - revealed last week as Jihadi John - was also said to have self-esteem problems and was even given anger management therapy at Quintin Kynaston school in north-west London.

A former friend said a gang of older teenagers used to wait outside the school for Emwazi, then 14 and smaller and weaker than other boys his age.

‘They would steal his lunch money and push him around a bit,’ he said. 

‘He was very quiet and a bit scrawny back then so we used to call him Little Mo.’

The St John’s Wood school is subject to a Department for Education investigation after it emerged that at least three past pupils have joined Islamist terror groups and contemporaries of Emwazi have claimed young Muslims were ‘groomed’ by radicals.

Its former headmistress, Jo Shuter, said she recalled Emwazi was bullied when he was 14, but denied there had been a problem with radicalisation.

She told the BBC yesterday: ‘He had some issues with being bullied, which we dealt with.

‘By the time he got into the sixth form he, to all intents and purposes, was a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted.

‘There was never any sense that any of these young men as I knew them were radicalised when they were at school.’

One of Emwazi’s contemporaries at the school, Choukri Ellekhlifi, was killed in Syria after joining an Al Qaeda group and a third pupil, Mohammed Sakr, was killed in a US air strike on Al Shabaab fighters in Somalia.

Emwazi’s younger brother Omar, 21, was known as a member of the ‘Muslim Mafia’ at Quintin Kynaston.
