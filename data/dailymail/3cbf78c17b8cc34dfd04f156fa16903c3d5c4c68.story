She may be 76 and have clocked up over 80 million book sales but Judy Blume isn't putting the pen to rest yet.

The famed American author, whose novels including Blubber and Forever were among the first to tackle racism, sex, divorce and bullying, is releasing her first book in over ten years.

Blume, whose last book for adults, Summer Sisters, was published in 1998, will be releasing the new tome in the summer of 2015.

She's back! Judy Blume is set to release her first book in over 10 years. The yet-to-be-named novel will be her first since Summer Sisters in 1998

The book, which will be for adults, is yet to be titled and next to no details have been divulged.

Speaking to The New York Times, Blume's publisher, Carole Baron at Alfred A. Knopf, said: ‘It’s pure Judy Blume, writing about family and about friendships, about love, about betrayal. It’s quintessential Judy.

Not putting that pen down yet: Blume, who has won more than 90 literary awards, will be basing her new book around family, friendships, love and betrayal, say her publishers

Blume, who has been working on the novel for four years, said: 'I’m both thrilled and terrified, my usual feelings at this point.'

Blume, who has won more than 90 literary awards, first began writing when her children were attending preschool and her first novel, The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo, was published in 1969.

Book worm: Her best sellers include Blubber (1974) and Summer Sisters, which was published in 1998 and has sold more than 3 million copies

She went on to publish 13 more books such as Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. (1970), Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing (1972), and Blubber (1974).

She then penned Wifey (1978) and Smart Women (1983) for adults, which became best sellers on the New York Times best-seller list.

Summer Sisters, which was published in 1998, was her last book and has sold more than 3 million copies so big things can be expected for her upcoming novel.
