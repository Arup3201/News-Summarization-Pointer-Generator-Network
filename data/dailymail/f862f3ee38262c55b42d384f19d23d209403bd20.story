Like Newcastle United 24 hours earlier, West Ham found Malaga too classy an opponent as the La Liga side lifted the Schalke 04 Cup following a comfortable 2-0 victory.

The Hammers were taken apart in the first half as the Spaniards struck twice inside three minutes and missed a penalty before the break.

Malaga were easy 3-1 winners against Newcastle on Saturday and they again toyed with a Premier League side here at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen.

West Ham debutant Carl Jenkinson was also forced off with what looked like a hamstring injury one hour into his debut, the Arsenal defender having only joined on a season-long loan last week.

Should the injury prove serious, manager Sam Allardyce could well re-enter the transfer market in search of defensive reinforcements.

But the manager might also be concerned by the manner in which his side were torn apart midway though the first half.

First Jose Rosales scampered down the right and centred for Ezequiel Rescaldani who flashed his header into the side-netting.

But that let-off was a warning of things to come for the Hammers and Malaga duly put the game to bed inside three minutes.

Rescaldani made strides into the penalty area and took full advantage of Winston Reid's half clearance before tucking beyond Adrian.

Juanmi then escaped down the right flank and located Luis Alberto, on loan from Liverpool, at the far post and he did the rest with a smart finish, working room for the shot before curling into the far corner.

Jenkinson was guilty of a blatant block on the tricky Alberto at the expense of a penalty on 30 minutes but the same player saw his weak effort blocked by Adrian.

West Ham United: Adrian, Jenkinson (Nash 62), Reid (Potts 78), Burke, Cresswell, Noble, Whitehead, Diame (Cullen 46), Jarvis, Vaz Te, Zarate

Malaga CF: Kameni, Perez, Angeleri, Rescaldini, Samuel Sanchez, Juanmi (c), Rosales, Sergio Sanchez, Boka, Alberto, Recio

Goals: Rescaldini 22, Alberto 24

After the interval Rescaldani went in search of his second and saw Adrian palm over his vicious blast on 55 minutes. From the resulting corner the Argentine striker looped a header towards the far corner and Adrian was forced to backpedal and again shovel over the bar.

Sergio Sanchez whistled an effort from range onto the roof of the net and Junapi somehow lashed wide of an open goal from six yards as Malaga continued to tease passes around the final third.

Jenkinson then over-stretched in a 50-50 challenge and hobbled down the tunnel to add to Allardyce's woes.West Ham – with summer signing Mauro Zarate in attack – offered nought at the other end save for a Matt Jarvis run on goal but his heavy touch allowed keeper Idris Kameni to slide and clear. Allardyce will now step up his efforts to bring in a new striker ahead of the Premier League kick off a week on Saturday.

Peter Crouch is a possibility and Sunderland's Connor Wickham could emerge as a target should his contract wrangle persist.

But with Andy Carroll out until November and £12million signing Enner Valencia set to miss the start of the season, they remain worryingly short of attacking options.
