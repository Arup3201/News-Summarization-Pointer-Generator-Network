The last photographs of remote hill tribes in Thailand barely touched by modern society have been revealed after more than 30 years.

The rare images captured in the 1970s and 80s show children smoking tobacco, neck stretching jewellery and opium picking in the fields in a remote land completely separated from the modern world.

John Spies lived in isolated locations in northern Thailand with the remote tribes, which no longer exists due to their people moving on into more urban areas.

John Spies captured these rare images over 30 years ago, of remote hill tribes in northern Thailand. Here some children smoke tobacco, which was common among the tribes

Mr Spies said that children smoking tobacco was quite common as the tribes, who were almost cut off from the outside world, weren't aware of the damaging health effects

The people of the tribes were entirely self-sufficient, and farmed the land by growing rice and keeping animals such as pigs

But during the time in the 1970s and 80s he spent with the tribe, he got a unique insight into their lives.

The photographer, who is originally from Australia, has lived near Chiang Mai in Thailand for 37 years.

He even learned to speak the northern Thai dialect, the common language the hill tribes used to communicate with each other.

He
 explained: 'There were around seven major ethnic groups spread across 
the hills of northern Thailand in the 1970s and 1980s with a few smaller
 groups in border areas.

Many of the tribal people had travelling dentists fit gold caps over their front teeth as a show of wealth and a sign of beauty

'I visited villages of all of the major groups - together they are commonly called hill tribes, but in reality they are not really a tribe.

'More accurately they are distinct ethnic groups with their own culture, language and traditions.

'There were no schools and the people were living in remote villages - they had no idea about the outside world.

The tribes also farm opium and pick it in the fields surrounding the villages, left, as well as growing and producing their own rice, right

Young members of the tribe weren't discouraged from smoking tobacco as they had no idea that it would be harmful

'They had seen airplanes fly overhead and some asked me if I came from the moon.'

While spending time with the tribes, Mr Spies even learned to speak the northern Thai dialect, the common language used by the people to communicate with each other.

He also witnessed many of the traditions of the tribes which include young children smoking home-grown tobacco and how they played with muzzle-loading rifles.

Mr Spies added: 'Most children either smoked their rough home-grown tobacco or chewed betel leaf which they mixed with tobacco, lime and chestnut tree bark, which would blacken their teeth.

'They had no idea that tobacco was harmful.

'Even babies breastfeeding - some would feed for up to five years - would grab their parent's cheroot and take a puff.

'They were self-reliant and grew subsistence rice on slopes that they had cleared of forest cover.'

Most of the tribes have now moved on and into more urban areas meaning many don't exist anymore
