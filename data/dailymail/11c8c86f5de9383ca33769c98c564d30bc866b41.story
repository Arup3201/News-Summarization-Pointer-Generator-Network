This is the underground bare-knuckle boxing club where men risk bloody noses and broken bones for a shot at the $40,000 prize.

The real-life Fight Club, which keeps moving locations, cropped up last in Wilimington, Delaware.

Organizers and competitors openly admit that the fights are illegal - but this does nothing to stop scores of spectators paying $100 for a ticket to watch the carnage and gamble on the outcome.

Combat takes place in a ring on the ground marked by masking tape. The only rules are that biting, kicking and holds are banned, and that it is illegal to attack an opponent who is on the floor.

Fight club: Two competitors go toe-to-toe in a dimly-lit arena, competing for a $40,000 prize

Impact: One contestant is left with a bloody nose as part of the underground competition - this fight was held in Wilmington, Delaware

The organization is known as Genco.tv - a nod to the owner's ambitions to stream the bouts live to an online audience, according to the News Journal.

Danny Provenzano, 50, who has appeared on the Real Housewives of New Jersey, is the nephew of a New York gangster. He himself has served jail time for racketeering.

He told the paper he has been organizing fights around Delaware for as many as a dozen years without alerting the authorities.

But a match from this spring was filmed for an episode of investigative cable show 60 Minutes Sports, unveiling one of the brutal fights. 

Heads down: Then men go toe-to-toe, or closer, in the unlicensed bouts, which could attract hefty penalties should the law get involved

Fans: Spectators pay $100 a piece to get inside the bout - and from there can place wagers on fighters

Location: One of the bouts took place upstairs in this warehouse, above a car repair shop - but the building's owner isn't keen for a repeat performance

In the footage Bobby Gunn, a retired Canadian boxer, takes to the ring and walks away with $40,000 in prize money. 

The fighting bears some resemblance to the 1999 Brad Pitt film Fight Club. Though clearly the oft-touted 'first rule' that the club be kept an absolute secret is not adhered to.

A perhaps accidental similarity is that the Delaware city where the fights now take place shares a name with Wilmington, California - which was the real-life filming location for parts of the film. 

Provenzano said that the bouts have been unveiled in a bid to make his enterprise legitimate. He claims to be in discussion with state authorities - though he would not say which one - to get a permit for the fights.

According to Delaware state laws, any unlicensed 'combative fighting' event carries risks of prosecution for all those involved.

Anyone who fights, as well promoters, organizers, judges and referees are liable, and could be hit with $1,000 fines for violations.

Friendly start: Two men bump fists before doing their best to knock one another out

Unhappy finish: One brawler was left cut and bloodied after his time in the ring was over

One neighbor told the News Journal: 'It's kind of odd that you live here and don't even know something like that is going on,' she says. 'It's a problem just waiting to happen.'

The fight filmed for 60 Minutes Sports was held in an empty room above Blueprint Motor Sport, a car repair shop.

The owner let For his part, Blueprint's Tamar says he agreed to let the fights be held at his business after a friend called asking for a favor because the first location fell through.

He says the night was more of a hassle than he anticipated with spectators having to walk through his showroom to use his bathrooms, passing Maseratis and Ferraris under the watchful eye of Tamar's employees.

The owner Provenzano use the space as a favor - but says the event was so much hassle that he wouldn't agree to it again.
