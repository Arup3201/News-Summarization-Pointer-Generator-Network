Party leader Nick Clegg depicted a 'diminished and divided' nation out of the EU if Cameron ruled alone

The Lib Dems sought to frighten voters off a majority Tory government last night by evoking a nightmarish image of Britain if David Cameron ruled alone.

Party leader Nick Clegg depicted a 'diminished and divided' nation out of the EU, the economy 'halted in its tracks'.

In a wounding attack, he forecast David Cameron turning 'trapped between being a poor man's Margaret Thatcher and a rich man's Nigel Farage'. 

The onslaught, dubbed 'Nightmare on Dave Street' by Lib Dem insiders, came as he admitted to party activists at the first day of the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that they faced 'the fight of our lives' at the next Election.

The conference opened with the party languishing at just six per cent in one opinion poll and amid fears half the current 57 Lib Dem MPs could lose their seats next year. But Mr Clegg aimed to revive spirits with an impassioned plea for voters to deny Cameron or Ed Miliband a majority.

The Deputy Prime Minister, stung after an unnamed aide to Home Secretary Theresa May last week described him as a 'w****r', reserved his sharpest words for the Tories.

He said: 'Imagine... Britain, diminished and divided after a botched attempt to renegotiate our relationship with Europe and a vote to withdraw from the EU. Companies pulling out of the UK left, right and centre, the markets losing confidence, hiking up our borrowing costs.'

The future Tory Party would be 'in hock to their Right wing, desperately pandering to Ukip's ugly nationalism', he claimed.

But the Lib Dem leader also conjured up dire images of Labour majority government, 'borrowing a few million here, a few billion there. Throwing good money after bad at every problem that comes along. Debt piling up and up until the day of reckoning'.
