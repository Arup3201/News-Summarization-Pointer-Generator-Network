Main suspect: Fishmonger Zulkipli Abdullah, 24, arriving at Kuching Magistrate Court on Wednesday. He was on bail for armed robbery when Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger were attacked, police said

The main suspect arrested in connection to the murders of two Newcastle University students stabbed to death while on a medical placement in Borneo was on police bail for armed robbery when they were attacked, it emerged today.

Local police said that they were just days away from passing a file to prosecutors on 24-year-old fishmonger Zulkipli Abdullah when he allegedly stabbed Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22, to death.

He was arrested along with accomplices Yeo Kia Sing, a 29-year-old mechanic, and two jobless men, Remy Bin Marjuki, 19, and Abdul Aziz Bin Karim, in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Sarawak deputy police chief Datuk Dr Chair Khin Chung told the Daily Mirror: '[Abdullah]
 will face separate charges for armed robbery. We had just finished our 
investigation at the point when this attack was carried out.'

The four men face the death penalty after 'admitting the crime'.

Two
 were said to have previous convictions for drugs and armed robbery and 
three had tested positive for Methamphetamine, a powerful stimulant also
 known as crystal meth, according to a police report.

Datuk Dr Chair Khin Chung said that one of the suspects in the group had served two months in prison for possessing drugs.

He
 said: 'He was in jail for two to three months in 2012. He was caught 
with a quantity of drugs in his possession. He served time for it.'

Meanwhile, the bodies of Neil Dalton, 23, and Aidan Brunger are due to arrive back in the UK today.

They were taken taken to the airport at Kuching last night for a flight through Kuala Lumpur and on to London.

Earlier
 in the day they had been formally identified by two British friends in 
the mortuary of the Sarawak General hospital where they were on a study 
programme.

‘As you can imagine, it was a very traumatic and sad job that their friends volunteered to do,’ said a hospital official.

British friends of the men have declined to speak publicly about the deaths.

Medical
 Director Dr Chin Zin Hing told the Mail: ‘A female friend of the two 
men had thought about saying a few words in public about them but she 
became too upset.

‘We 
have 22 foreign medical students at the hospital, most of them being 
from the UK and you can imagine that this has been a very distressing 
time for all of them.’

It is understood that several close friends of Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger have received counselling from other hospital staff.

But a warning has also been issued to all medical students to take great care when going out at night.Government
 officials have insisted that Kuching is safe and that the attack on the
 students was unprecedented.

But they, too, have advised all foreign 
visitors not to place themselves in situations which could cause them 
harm or distress.

Yesterday, a 
cafe owner who tried to save the two Newcastle University students 
stabbed to death while on a medical placement in Borneo told how it took
 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.

The
 owner of a bistro in the Jalan Padungan area of Kuching in Sarawak 
province, in the west of the Malaysian part of Borneo, said he saw one of the alleged killers calmly walk away after 
the incident, the Daily Mirror reported yesterday.

 Ran told the newspaper: 'He looked right into my eyes when he saw me 
and slowly walked around the side of the car and got inside the 
passenger seat.

Accomplices: Yeo Kia Sing, a 29-year-old mechanic, (left) and jobless man Abdul Aziz Bin Karim (right), were two of the men arrested in connection with the murders of Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22

'He was 
trying to act all cool in front of his friends, but his eyes were wide 
like two moons. I don't know if he was on drugs, but he wasn't acting 
normally.

'Nobody acts like that after stabbing someone. It was like it was nothing to him.' 

Mr Ran said he and another waiter 
tried to help Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger, but they died before an 
ambulance arrived 30 minutes later.

'I will never forget it, not as long as I live,' he told the paper.

Deputy police commissioner Chai 
Khin Chung said yesterday that police had completed their inquiry, as 
the men had confessed and they would now be passing on their evidence 
for prosecution.

Accused: Police arrest Remy Bin Marjuki, one of the four suspects, on suspicion of murder at his home in Kuching, Malaysia. Police said that one of the men arrested had previously served jail time for drug possession

'We have finished our investigation, the crime has been solved,' he said.

'The suspects have been apprehended and they have admitted the crime. We have recovered the weapons from the crime.

'We
 are waiting for the corpses in the hospital mortuary to have the 
post-mortem carried out. We have all the major evidence in our hands 
which we will send to the prosecution.'

He said the two students had got into 
an argument with the men on the table next to them in the bar and after 
leaving on foot, they were followed by car and then attacked from 
behind.

He added that the tragedy was very unusual for the city as it is 'always very peaceful'.

It has been reported that two Irish medical students were assaulted just days before the stabbings.

The hospital where Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger had been working is providing counselling to other students since the tragedy.

The attack happened at 4.15am local time 
following a row in a city centre bar over the students being too noisy, 
said Sarawak deputy police commissioner Chai Khin Chung

 Hospital medical director Dr Chin Zin Hing said the deaths of the two 
men, who finished their elective with the hospital at the end of last 
month, were 'very sad'.

He said: 'We are trying to provide counselling for the students here. We currently have about 20 British elective students.'

Newcastle University said two members of 
staff had been sent out to Kuching to offer support to the students 
still out there and to help the authorities.

Professor Calvert said: 'We have been in touch with the students who are still in Kuching, in constant touch really, overnight there have been emails going back and forward to try and offer what support we could until our staff could get there.

'We now have two members of staff who have arrived in Kuching, they have met up with the students and are trying to smooth the way with the authorities to make things as easy as possible so they can do what has to be done and then get back home again.

'Of course they're very, very upset, medical students are a close community anyway and they were out there with friends and colleagues from their course and it's such a tragic thing to have happened.

'They're very upset but we're confident the people we have out there are offering them every support and just hope we can get them back soon.'
