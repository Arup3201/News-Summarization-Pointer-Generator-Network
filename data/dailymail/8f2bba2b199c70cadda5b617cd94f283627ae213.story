Warning: M&S chief executive Marc Bolland has said prices will rise in an independent Scotland

Marks and Spencer today became the latest big name retailer to warn prices will rise in an independence Scotland.

The firm’s chief executive Marc Bolland joined the bosses of B&Q-owner Kingfisher and shoe repair chain Timpson said firms would have to choose ‘whether or not to pass on the increased costs through higher prices to Scottish consumers’.

Alex Salmond was today forced to deny he is plotting a ’day of reckoning’ against businesses opposed to his dream of independence, after warnings from BP, John Lewis, Asda, Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone, RBS and Lloyds.

More than £17billion in shares in Scottish firms have been dumped by investors in recent weeks and when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, the pound tumbled to a 10-month low.

A row over the impact of a Yes vote on businesses was ignited when SNP grandee Jim Sillars said an independent Scotland would break up or nationalise pro-Union firms.

Mr Sillars, a former deputy leader of the SNP who appeared campaigning with Mr Salmond last week, said: ‘This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.’

In an attempt to quell the deeply damaging row, Mr Salmond today rushed out a statement attempting to reassure businesses they have nothing to fear if Scotland goes it alone.

Mr Salmond said: ’Jim Sillars is a great campaigner who has put aside his personal grief over the loss of his wife Margo MacDonald to put his heart and soul into galvanising the Yes vote.

’He is fighting a fine campaign all over Scotland - but the day after a Yes vote will be a day of celebration for the people, not reckoning for big companies drawn into the No campaign by Downing Street.’

He added that Mr Sillars was ’simply trying to express the anger felt by so many people about the revelations that some supermarket statements were orchestrated by the Prime Minister himself’.

Mr Salmond went on to claim that people in Scotland ’are in no mood to be bullied by big Westminster Government putting pressure on big business to intimidate the people of Scotland. Indeed, just the opposite is happening.’

However, in a joint letter, M&S, Kingfisher and Timpson warned about the ‘greater complexity of trading across a national border coupled with the uncertainty over big issues such as the single currency and membership of the EU’.

‘Within our group there is first-hand experience of trading across national borders - in France, Ireland and across the world. Our experience is that it always leads to more red tape and higher costs and we feel it is important to share this experience,’ they wrote in the Daily Record.

‘We know that running a separate pricing system in Scotland will mean taking the difficult decision as to whether or not to pass on the increased costs through higher prices to Scottish consumers.

‘And it won't just affect us, it will also impact on our thousands of suppliers, many of which are small to medium-sized businesses.’

Major stores including Asda and Next have already warned that prices on essentials such as bread, milk and children’s clothes will rise.

The boss of Iceland also added his voice to growing concerns, saying he would ‘panic’ if Scotland voted Yes.

The cost of landlines, mobile phones and internet will increase in Scotland, a host of firms will say before the vote.

BT is in talks with mobile providers Vodafone, EE and O2 as well as TalkTalk about issuing a joint statement warning of the implications of separation. It will be released over the weekend or early next week.

The cost of installing broadband cables or mobile phone masts are already higher in Scotland because of the distances involved. Currently these are subsidised by the rest of the UK, but an independent Scotland would be likely to have its own separate pricing structure.

A draft of the letter was yesterday said to warn of ‘the inevitability of cost increases’.

John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield this week warned that the department store would be forced to pass on higher costs of operating in an independent Scotland.

Iceland boss Malcolm Walker, whose chain has 71 stores and a major distribution centre in Scotland and employs more than 2,000 people, said his first response to a Yes vote would be to ‘panic!’.

‘The consequences will be just massive,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘To be perfectly honest with you, we didn’t take it too seriously.

'I don’t think anybody for one moment considered that there would be a Yes vote.’ Large Scottish banks including RBS and Lloyds have drawn up contingency plans to move their registered offices South.

UBS said an independent Scotland would shed jobs and tax revenues.

Economists at the bank said: ‘Until there is clarity over the currency arrangements and the banking system, Scotland is likely to suffer some degree of a credit crunch.

‘Scottish GDP would suffer a one-off contraction of somewhere between four per cent and five per cent as half of the banking sector moves to Britain before independence.’

A spokesman from Deutsche Bank said last night that ‘a Yes vote would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill’s decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US’.
