The mother of the small-town girl who had dreams of becoming a Hollywood actress was today driving across the country to be reunited with her daughter after she was found alive following four months of being 'tortured and drugged by a registered sex offender'.

Sharon Stratton, from Tennessee, will be reunited with her daughter Satara later today at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital where she is heavily sedated and being treated for a number of injuries.

After frantically searching for her since November, Ms Stratton spoke to the MailOnline about the 'nightmare' she has lived through and the horrific ordeal her daughter endured at the hands of 'monsters'.

Alive: Police have located actress Satara Stratton, pictured, who went missing in November. She was believed to be addicted to heroin and under the influence of a sex offender

She said: 'That man destroyed my little girl. He held her captive for more than four 
months in a place where she could not escape from.

'He drugged her, 
tortured her, attacked her and who knows what else. I'm trying
 to get to Satara as fast as I can, I have been driving since 6pm 
yesterday.

Satara Stratton was said to be a happy fun-loving girl until she moved to Hollywood

'She needs to be with her family and 
we need to get her healthy and back to normal and give her time to 
recover from the nightmare she has been through.'

She added that when Satara is awake in the hospital, she screams uncontrollably - terrified the man will find her and drag her away.

Satara Stratton's disappearance 
garnered national attention several weeks ago when it was reported the 
pretty 24-year-old had gone from aspiring Hollywood actress to heroin 
addict who had been swept up in the city's seedy underworld.

A picture of her looking healthy and 
happy appeared alongside her drug-ravaged mugshot which highlighted the 
shocking transformation she had gone through in just eight months.

Los Angeles police announced yesterday she had been located in 'good condition' at an unspecified hospital.

Ms Stratton, who is a university professor, said it was the registered sex offender who had kidnapped her daughter who left her at the hospital after increasing pressure
 from police. He fled soon after and is thought to be still on the run.

Satara, whose screen name was Satara Silver, is now being held in a secure place until he is found. She is being treated for some external injuries and
 bruising over her body. She is also suffering withdrawal symptoms from 
the drugs she was injected with.

Over the last eight months, police
 have arrested Satara on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting 
how her life had spiraled out of control. Arrests have 
included possession of narcotics 
in a hospital.

Police are now believed to be looking for the sex offender whose offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14.

Her mother revealed that prior to this, Satara was a normal, happy and quiet young girl who loved dancing and soccer.

She had been acting since she was three-years-old and enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie.

It was when she was working in New York that she was advised to move to LA as she had dreams of also becoming a film director.

Determined to make a success of her 
new life, the petite blonde began taking classes and started a job 
at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard.

But
 it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, 
causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los 
Angeles Times last month.

She added that her daughter's troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her and harassing her.

Speaking today, Ms Stratton said she believes the employee may have been working with the sex offender as the two were friends.

'I don't know what their motive was or 
if it was a money thing,' she said. 'But my daughter is very petite and 
young looking and I believe one of the men is a registered pedophile, so 
perhaps that was why he went after her.

'She was very vulnerable. They singled 
her out and preyed on her. My daughter never touched hard drugs in her 
life. She was always a very demure and quiet girl.'

The university professor said she is just glad Satara is still alive after a threatening email was sent to Satara's boyfriend last month saying he was going to kill both her and her mother.

'I spent two weeks in LA looking for 
her after that. I got no help from police who warned me victims aren't 
usually found alive after three months missing,' she said.

'It was only when I made a plea on 
Facebook and then the media got hold of it that the police really 
started to investigate her disappearance.'

Sightings: Stratton, who appeared in a handful of films, was seen 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard

Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began

Police had considered her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refused to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly.

The
 last time Sharon spoke to her daughter before she was located was in 
November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died.

Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times.

Though Ms Stratton doesn't know the full details of what her daughter went through, she believes her daughter was stalked before being 'grabbed' after being offered a ride home.

It will likely be a while before her daughter can even talk about what happened, she said.

'I want to get my daughter back and 
give her the love and care she needs. The last four months have been a 
nightmare, I haven't been able to sleep or eat or work or even think.

'Once she is back to normal, I know 
Satara will go back to pursuing her dream. She will not give that up 
just because of what that man did to her.

Downfall: Police mug shots from drug charges show Stratton looking increasingly disheveled and ill

She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'.

Authorities have never divulged the nature of her health issues.

On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.'

She added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants.

'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections. So where is she?'
