A controversial plan for Tory and UKIP supporters to ‘swap votes’ to keep Ed Miliband out of No 10 and ensure Britain gets the chance to leave the European Union has been launched by writer and political campaigner Toby Young.

His ‘Country Before Party’ scheme aims to stop UKIP robbing the Tories of the Commons seats they need to defeat Labour in the next Election.

Mr Young claims it would give UKIP leader Nigel Farage and a handful of his candidates a chance of winning seats.

He plans to set up a website  to enable UKIP and Tory supporters in different constituencies to pledge to ‘exchange votes’.

Polling experts last night cast doubt on whether the scheme could work, given the Tories had more to gain than UKIP.

But Tory-supporting Mr Young, who has won praise  for setting up a free school in London, says he is determined to give it a try.

He said: ‘Whatever their party allegiances, most people are in favour of a referendum on the EU. But the Tory-UKIP split could let Ed Miliband into Downing Street. And he’s said that unless circumstances change he will not allow a vote on our future in Europe.’

John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said: ‘Such a scheme could only hope to make a significant difference to the composition of the next House of Commons if the Election race were much closer than it is at present.

‘It could prove nigh impossible to find even a dozen seats in which sufficient Tory voters could be persuaded to switch to UKIP. Consequently, the idea looks at risk of seeming to offer UKIP too little.’
