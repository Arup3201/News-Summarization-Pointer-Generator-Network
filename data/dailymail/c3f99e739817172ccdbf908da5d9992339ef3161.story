Facial oils, once the preserve of slightly batty aromatherapists and all but the crinkliest of crinklies, have gone mainstream over the past few years.

L'Oreal, always a litmus test of what’s marketable and mainstream in beauty, is preparing to launch one on January 20 for the first time in the company's history (Age Perfect Extraordinary Facial Oil, £24.99, with ingredients that include orange peel, geranium and rose), while the shelves of Boots already resemble the condiments section of Sainsbury's.

As someone who has always suffered from dry skin, I've long been a fan of facial oils. I first started adding rosehip oil to my face cream in my early 20s.

Slick: Sarah has long been a fan of facial oils

Back then, you could only get it from health food stores, stashed away between the bleach-free tampons and the linseed oils.

Rio Rosa Mosqueta was the brand, all the way from the Chilean Andes. The packaging looked like it had been designed by a yeti - and it didn't smell much better either.

The brand still exists (riorosa.co.uk) and the product has since been refined a little - although not too much. It remains basic, but excellent: 100 per cent natural, lightweight, long-lasting and, at about £10 for 20 ml, very good value for money.

Its biggest and best rival is Trilogy's Certified Organic Rosehip Oil, which is a rather slicker proposition in terms of packaging and marketing, including celebrity endorsements (always a boon) from Miranda Kerr and Anna Friel.

Both these oils are pure rosehip. Many of the newer facial oils on the market, however, offer a combination of ingredients, from plant and flower essential oils to other oils entirely - argan, avocado, carrot, raspberry, hazelnut, sesame and so on (if you are allergic to nuts, do please check the ingredients of any oil you are thinking of buying).

Some combine elements of nature with 
so-called 'cosmeceuticals': ingredients such as peptides to help 
brighten and decongest the skin, for example, or plant stem-cells.

The
 biggest misconception about facial oils is that they are not suitable 
for oily or combination skins and that they will make your face look 
shiny and greasy. In fact, providing you use them judiciously, they can 
benefit all types, from the most sensitive to the most troublesome. On 
combination skins, for example, the right facial oil will help reduce 
the chances of acne scarring and even soothe break-outs.

The skin condition rosacea, for example, is exacerbated by products that dry out the skin since stripping away the natural oils simply sends a signal to the body to produce more. Acne-prone skin, especially in adults, is often also dehydrated - which is why it can be so hard to treat effectively.

And anyone taking medication for their acne will also find that their skin becomes noticeably drier and tighter; again, a few drops of the right oil will soothe and treat without leaving behind a heavy patina of product.

This time of year, though, is hell for all skin types - especially given some of the mad weather we've been having lately. Cold winds, freezing rain, blow-heaters in shops and bone-dry central heating: this is when the facial oil really comes into its own.

The key to remember is to use only the smallest amount. I have a big face and very dry skin, but if I'm using the Trilogy Rosehip, for example, two drops in the palm of a hand is more than enough. Rub your hands together to warm the oil, and then just press your palms into your face before massaging in any excess.

If you like, you can add a day or night cream over the top. If my skin is really dehydrated, I exfoliate first and then pop a treatment mask over the top (not one of those clay ones, obviously, but a moisturising mask).

The only thing I would caution against is getting the stuff in your eyes - they will puff up; and if you're using an oil at night, allow it a couple of minutes to sink in before you turn the light out, otherwise you will just end up with a well-moisturised pillow case. 

Banish bags: Clinique under eye serum

One of the most common complaints around this time of year is dark shadows and bags under the eyes.

It's a combination of factors: lack of sleep, early mornings, a general feeling of liverishness after all those mince pies and extra glasses of wine, and the kind of winter pallor that sets in after months without sunshine.

The area under the eyes is a tricky one. The skin is thin, and there's also not a lot of tissue there. As we get older, this can lead to a slightly cavernous effect, as the skin slackens and the supporting fat and muscle degrades. Dark shadows deepen and loss of volume can be a problem.

This can be corrected by surgery or, in some cases with filler (known as tear-trough rejuvenation); but the effects are not always an unqualified success - plus they are painful and expensive.

Before you resort to any of that, there is much that can be done with a few clever tricks. Simply distracting the eye visually from your dark shadows is the first step.

A good eyebrow shape, for example, opens up the eye area, framing the face and making you look brighter and more alert. Eyelash curlers too will help.

It can be tempting to try to eliminate dark shadows by piling on the under-eye concealer. This is not a good idea: everyone, even the most fresh of face, has a degree of shading under and around the eye, so if you strip this out altogether, you'll just look weird, like those men from that strange Channel 4 documentary the other night (Secrets Of The Living Dolls, it was called, all about gentlemen who like to wear giant latex lady-suits in their leisure time. Most peculiar).

A total white-out will also make your eyes look smaller. So be judicious, and stay close to your natural skin tone to avoid the dreaded reverse-panda effect. Dot the product on the inside of the eyes, near the bridge of the nose, under the eyes and at the edges, and blend well.

CRUSH... Nars Limited Edition Multiple Duo Foolproof colour at its best - £33, narscosmetics.com

FAIL... 'Bikini bridge' aka a picture of a piece of Lycra suspended over a concave stomach. Go and eat cake, for heaven's sake.

If your bags are dreadful, there is something to be said for embracing them, and working the consumptive look. Smudgy black eyeliner and muted plums are ideal, or soft greys if you're a blonde.

Avoid browns: they'll just make you look even more tired. Add a feverish flush to the cheeks, and you should get away with it.

In terms of eye creams, serums and gels, it's good to find one that has a rollerball applicator, since the process of circular massage will help decongest the area. Again, don't go overboard on the amount of product, but do make sure you keep the area well-hydrated, as dryness will only contribute to the look of exhaustion.

Clinique All About Eyes Serum (£22), for example, is an excellent choice; for what it's worth I'm very pleased with my Nourish Kale Anti-Ageing Eye Cream (£29.50, nourishskinrange.com).
