These are the shocking injuries caused by a robber who has been jailed for life for attacking vulnerable pensioners in their own homes.

Lee Roberts, 33, had already been jailed for 11 years in 2004 for the manslaughter of Neville Bassett, 90, during a burglary, but soon after being released he was at it again.

Robert's worst attack was on an 87-year-old woman who needed 13-stitches to repair cuts across her face that was battered black and blue.

These are the horrific injuries an 87-year-old woman suffered after being shoved against a radiator by Lee Roberts who went on to steal £500 from her during a raid on her Chelmsley Wood home

Roberts was released from jail in 2011 and a court heard that by the end of last year the drug addict was targeting pensioners aged between 71 and 92 in the Solihull and Yardley areas - stealing cash and other valuables.

His most brutal raid came on December 20 when he shoved the 87-year-old woman against a radiator before dragging her from room to room demanding cash.

He then tied a cushion over the pensioner's head before fleeing her home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, with £500.

In another robbery, Roberts left a 73-year-old woman with a broken finger and medics had to cut a treasured ring from her hand. He also robbed a 92-year-old dementia sufferer.

The judge told Roberts that one of the 'most serious aspects' of his offending was the fact he had returned to 'this sort of crime' after already being jailed over a death in 2004

Roberts struck five times either side of New Year by knocking at the doors of pensioners and bundling them inside when they answered.

He admitted four counts of robbery and one charge of burglary and was jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday.

Judge Roderick Henderson told Roberts, of Olton, West Midlands, that he must serve at least six years and nine months before he is considered for release.

He added: 'One of the most serious aspects is you chose to go back to this sort of crime, picking on vulnerable, elderly people.

'You used whatever violence was necessary to get whatever you could get from them.

'Your previous offending resulted in the death of one person, that should have given you a clear message.'

The judge said the crimes had a 'devastating effect' on the victim's lives.

The court heard after battering the 87-year-old woman, Roberts stole a TV and loose change from a 73-year-old woman in Solihull on January 2.

He then snatched a 91-year-old woman's pension two days later, and three days after that grabbed a handbag from a pensioner when she answered her door in Birmingham.

Robert's ransacked the dementia sufferer's Hobbs Moat flat sometime between January 4 and 7.

In a victim impact statement, one of Roberts' elderly targets said she had never felt so vulnerable in her home which she had lived in for 45 years.

'I always check my window before I go to bed to make sure he's not waiting outside. I think it's horrible this man has made me feel this way.'

Roberts' defence team said he had turned to crime to fund his drug habit after being sacked from a job when his criminal past came to light.

After the hearing, Detective Constable Arran Cox from West Midlands Police, described the crimes as  'terrifying ordeals' for those involved.
