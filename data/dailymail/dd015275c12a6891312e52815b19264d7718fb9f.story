Nico Rosberg has taken his preparations for the Malaysian Grand Prix to a whole new level after climbing to the top of one of the giant Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.

The Mercedes star, who finished second in the opening race of the season in Australia, filmed himself and some friends making their way up the 88-floor building on foot.

Rosberg and his pals managed all 2,170 steps to reach the top of the 1,483 foot building, leaving them with amazing views over the Malaysian capital.

The German appears determined to get himself in the best possible shape for Sunday's Grand Prix after finishing behind rival Lewis Hamilton on March 15.

But the gruelling climb to the top of the Petronas Towers - which were the world's tallest buildings between 1998 and 2004 - remains a far cry from Rosberg's perfect day.

Speaking about his ideal way to spend 24 hours, he told The Daily Telegraph: 'My wife and I would be alone in our place in Monaco. She would make me some healthy pancakes before we go off on our bikes for an hour and have lunch on the beach.

The German will be looking to go one better when he races in the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend

'We’d take an afternoon nap and, as the sun sets, we’d take the car through the mountains. And then in the evening I’d mess around looking at old cars in magazines and have dinner cooked by my wife at home using the fresh vegetables from our biogarden. 

'And then we’d fall asleep watching an educational documentary. I need to do this day really soon.'
