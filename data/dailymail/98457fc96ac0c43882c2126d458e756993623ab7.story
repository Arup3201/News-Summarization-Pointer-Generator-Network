Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson has told Saido Berahino to stop ‘bleating’ and ‘moaning’ after the England hopeful was elbowed in the face by Marcin Wasilewski on Saturday.

The West Brom striker, 21, had treatment after what he described as a ‘clear elbow’ from the Pole in the second half. 

The FA will read referee Stuart Attwell’s report on Monday — the elbow went unpunished — and consider whether action is necessary. But an angry Pearson said Berahino should leave the talking to his manager Alan Irvine. Pearson said: ‘If they want punishment I’m disappointed. Saido is wrong — it was good defending. ‘He’s not gone to elbow him. It’s called the 'clothes line'.

If I have a player who wants to run across me I’m going to put my arm up. If he runs into it it’s his own tough luck.

‘I’m not interested in players who are moaning. I think it is poor when players bleat — leave it to their own managers. Players should keep their mouth shut and perform on the pitch.’

Berahino was reluctant to discuss the incident further but said: ‘I will let the FA take care of it.’

One way or another, the England Under 21 striker is becoming the talking point of a West Brom side which has now suffered just one defeat in six League games.

Leicester have scored only twice and conceded eight in five games since beating Manchester United 5-3.

At one stage on Saturday their supporters chanted Irvine’s name — quite a turnaround from the summer when his appointment was greeted by significant indifference.

That change in mood is largely down to the form of Berahino, who was central to the move that led to Esteban Cambiasso’s own goal in West Brom’s win. Roy Hodgson is considering handing him an England call this month and the striker said selection would allow him to ‘repay’ the nation, having moved here aged 10 to escape war-torn Burundi.

‘It would mean the world to me,’ said Berahino. ‘England, the UK as a whole, has given me a second chance in life.

‘I am helping my family and we are living a good life. It would be great for me to repay in that way.’
