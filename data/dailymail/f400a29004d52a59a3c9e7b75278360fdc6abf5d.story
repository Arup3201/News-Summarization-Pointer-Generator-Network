A shocked teenager bought a McDonald's chicken burger only to find someone else had taken a bite out of it.

Lovis Gaertner, 18, ordered the McChicken Sandwich with a portion of fries when he made the surprise find and demanded a new burger.

The firm has since apologised, admitting one of its staff members was 'under a lot of stress'.

Poultry standards: A Swiss teenager got a shock after he opened a McChicken burger only to find someone else had already taken a bite out of it. McDonald's said a staff member was under a lot of stress

The teenager was with friends at a branch of McDonald's in Arbon, north east Switzerland, when staff sold him the burger.

But instead of giving him a new one, they accidentally passed over one which had been sent back for being too cold by his friend Andrina Lehrer, 21.

She overheard him complaining and confirmed she had taken a bite out of the burger, which should have been thrown away.

Lovis Gaertner, 18: 'It was like a bad joke'

Mr
 Gaertner, who took a photo of the offending meal before sending it 
back, said he is still annoyed despite receiving an apology and a new 
burger.

'I couldn't believe it when I opened the carton and saw that not only was it cold, but a big bite had been taken out of it by somebody else,' he said.

'It was like a bad joke, and I took it back to complain. They apologised, and gave me a replacement.'

Ms Lehrer added: 'I thought they would throw it away - after all I had taken a big bite out of it.

'I can't believe they put it back on sale again. It must have been at least 10 minutes before that I had handed it back to them, and it was cold then.'

A McDonald's spokesman confirmed that the incident had been an embarrassing mistake.

'One of the staff at the restaurant was under a lot of stress and made a mistake,' he said.

'Nevertheless, it is something that never should have been allowed to happen.'

The spokesman said according to McDonald's policy, the burger should have been disposed of in the organic waste bin.

He added: 'We plan to get in touch with the customer again and make a personal apology.'
