Nathan Kennedy, 35, plundered jewels, computers and a credit card after squeezing through the small hole he made by removing bricks in the wall

A thief burgled his next-door neighbour by knocking a hole
in the attic wall before he crawled through the gap in the loft space and
dropped down into the house.

Nathan Kennedy, 35, plundered jewels, computers and a credit card after
squeezing through the small hole he made by removing bricks in the shared wall.

Baffled
Neil Barton, 29, and girlfriend Abi Dunn, 28, discovered goods missing from his
home in Barton Hill, Bristol, twice in a week - but found no sign of forced entry.

He finally
foiled the dastardly plan after a friend suggested he check his attic - where
he discovered the hole and spotted his stolen items in Kennedy's loft
space.

Kennedy
was jailed for three-and-a-half years after he admitted the brazen burglary.

Mr Barton, an insurance broker, said: 'It was crazy - your home really does not
feel like your castle after something like this.

'It
was so brazen, it was almost laughable. I'd heard banging and drilling coming
from next door and thought he was doing some DIY.

'It
turns out he was - but only so he could get through the loft into my house. I'd
never had anything to do with him so didn't know anything about him.

Kennedy was jailed for 42 months by Bristol Crown Court after he admitted burglary. He also caused around £1,500 damage to the attic and roof

Kennedy used chisels and a drill to bore a hole - now bricked up - in the attic wall separating the terraced houses in Tenby Street in Barton Hill, Bristol, last summer

'At
first, we couldn't understand how someone had been getting in as each time we
came home and found we'd been burgled, all the locks on the doors were in place.

'We
even had a bit of a job convincing the police and insurance companies at first
that it wasn't some kind of scam on our part.

'Although
I suppose you could say it was an inside job.'

Kennedy used chisels and a
drill to bore a hole in the attic wall separating the terraced houses, in Tenby Street, in Barton Hill, Bristol, last summer.

He then
clambered through the 3ft space and into Mr Barton's house when he
and Miss Dunn, a teacher, were at work during the day.

In the
first raid, on July 7 last year, he helped himself to two laptops - before he
returned seven days later to take other items worth £3,500.

He then
attempted to put the loose bricks back in the wall - covering the hole on his
neighbour's side with cardboard to cover his tracks.

But Mr Barton-
alarmed by the second burglary in a week - went up and checked his loft after a friend suggested the criminal could be creeping in unnoticed.

When he
climbed into the attic, he realised he could see into Kennedy's loft space - and
spotted some of his stolen items.

Mr Barton said: 'I could not believe it. We called the police straight away and they
knocked his door down and arrested him.

'We
had never spoken to him before - we did not even know what he looked like.

'I
got my stolen stuff back, but it was just insane.

'He must have crept around the
house while we were at work.'

Kennedy was jailed for 42 months by Bristol
Crown Court after he admitted burglary.

He also caused around £1,500 damage to
the attic and roof.
