A police officer has used his Movember moustache to raise even more money for charity after realising he became a deadringer for some of Britain's most famous stars.

In the past week sergeant Chris Bethell has dressed as Borat, Inspector Clouseau, and Blackadder because his facial hair made him look like the actors who played them.

The sergeant also posed as Lord Lucan and Freddie Mercury, raising £400 so far for the Movember cancer appeal.

Sgt Bethell, based in Barrow, Cumbria, has blogged, tweeted and used Facebook to show off his remarkable collection of doppelganger pictures.

'By creating a different face every day during the final week and writing humorous dialogue and verses, I found a fun way to catch the attention of many good friends on Facebook and Twitter', he said.

'Their comments, encouragement and generosity have been a terrific motivator'.

During November each year, Movember is responsible for the sprouting of millions of moustaches around the world.

Lord Lucan: The policeman looks uncannily like the aristocrat who disappeared without a trace in 1974

Borat: Chris even braved a dip in the November seas as he recreated a classic moment by Sacha Baron Cohen

Men then raise vital funds and awareness for prostate, testicular cancer and mental health.

Sgt Bethell said: 'I know several people who in recent months have been diagnosed with serious illnesses.

'Having friends who have had to suffer through no fault of their own, I became acutely aware of how lucky I am.

'This is just my way of giving a little back and raising awareness about men’s health.

'So far this week, over £400 has been raised and still people are sending me donations'.

Officer Crabtree: His costumes, including this one showing him as as Allo Allo's best-love characters is helping him raise a large amount for charity

Terry Thomas: Using a cigarette holder and adding a gap between his teeth he transformed himself into the cad actor

As an independent, global charity, Movember's vision is to have an everlasting impact on men's health.

It challenges men to grow a moustache for the 30 days of November, thereby changing their appearance and the 'face' of men's health.
