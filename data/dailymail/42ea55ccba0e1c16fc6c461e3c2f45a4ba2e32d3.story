Bad batch? Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith was one of four deaths linked to molly in the summer of 2013

The parents of a University of Virginia student who died after taking the club drug Molly are hoping to prevent further deaths from the drug by raising awareness of its deadly consequences in a new documentary.

University of Virginia sophomore Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith, 19, died in August 2013 at one of the largest dance clubs in Washington. 

At the time her family knew that she had overdosed. 

Her mom and dad, Rob and Dede Goldsmith are featured in a clip released by the makers of an upcoming documentary.

Shelley, was a student at UVA in 2013 when she died after taking MDMA at an electronic dance concert in Washington, D.C.

The Goldsmiths are looking for club organizers to introduce  policies that allow music festival organizers to put safety measures in place that reduce risks from drug use without fear of prosecution.

Mrs Goldsmith is hoping to change federal drug laws through a policy known as harm reduction.

'She is a good messenger. She was a great kid. She was smart, she was affable, she was musically-inclined, she was the whole package and it happened to her. If it can happen to her, it can happen to your kid,' said Dede Goldsmith in the YouTube clip.

The documentary is produced by DanceSafe founder Emanuel Sferios' Viveka Films and is expected to be shown at film festivals in the summer of 2016.

Message: Rob and Dede Goldsmith are driven to ensure people understand that it is not stupid kids or drug addicts that are at risk, but regular teenagers and young people at colleges and universities

Gone but not forgotten: Her mother says her daughter, Shelley,  loved cupcakes

'She had a presence about her and had a great big beautiful smile,' says her mom Dede, holding back tears.  

Dad Rob tries to explain his daughter's drug use. 'The connotation of drug user implies its someone who uses drugs all the time. She used drugs to enhance her experience and was looking to have a good time and to feel close to people around her.

Education things say Molly is bad. Shelly and her friends took it because they liked the way it made them feel. That has to be acknowledged in a effective, realistic educational way. There's some good sides and attractive sides to this but there are some risks.'

Her parents appear driven to ensure people understand that it is not stupid kids or drug addicts that are at risk, but regular teenagers and young people at colleges and universities.

'These are really smart kids. She was a smart girl,' says her mom. 'There is a need for education but a lot of information that is put out is not accurate so the only practical response is Harm reduction.' 

Harm reduction suggests that educators take on practical strategies designed to reduce the consequences of drug use.

Tragic: Goldsmith was a sophomore at prestigious University of Virginia, where she was awarded the highest merit scholarship. Her father has now come forward to say her death was caused by molly

'If her death can open someone's eyes, then we need to talk about it,' Rob Goldsmith said.

'Shelley deserves a legacy of being someone who cared for people, someone who achieved, someone who contributed, and not a druggie who died,' he said. 'That's not who she was.'

Goldsmith hailed from Abingdon, Virginia and was admitted to her prestigious university with the highest possible merit scholarship.

She hoped to one day have a career in politics and had the resume full of distinctions to help her on her way. 

My girl: 'Shelley's death has to have a meaning for me as a rational loving mother.I can't live with the thought that she just died. There's no purpose. I believe that things happen for a reason,' says Mom Dede

Happy memories: Her Mom Dede says, 'I really want to do what I can to protect young people. I grew up with Shelley - she had a lot of friends and I miss not being involved with them'

'Her love of life was contagious,' reads Goldsmith's obituary. 'She volunteered at the food bank, worked for Democratic candidates, decorated cupcakes with her friends'

'The war on drugs hasn't worked. Harm reduction is our only viable option,' says Rob.

'Shelley asked for water just before she died and was heading to the bar but never made it. She was feeling the effects of being very hot and taking Molly, the risks of heat stroke and exhaustion are a real possibility.'

Asked what is her driving force in taking part in the documentary, Dede Goldsmith has a clear answer: 'I really want to do what I can to protect young people. I grew up with Shelley - she had a lot of friends and I miss not being involved with them.

Shelley's death has to have a meaning for me as a rational loving mother.I can't live with the thought that she just died. There's no purpose. I believe that things happen for a reason.

I believe that she died so that other people would live.'

Missing their girl: 'The war on drugs hasn't worked. Harm reduction is our only viable option,' says Rob. They hope the death of their beautiful daughter will help save the lives of others in the future

More dangerous? Molly has been known for years as MDMA or Ecstasy, but some say its powder form is more dangerous because it is easily adulterated when put inside capsules

Molly is a crystalline or powder form of the well-known club drug Ecstasy.

However, some believe Molly--which can be snorted or swallowed in a capsule--is more likely than the drug in tablet form to be laced with anything from caffeine to methamphetamine.

The moniker 'Molly' could also refer to the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) or to a variety of similar and related chemicals.

The drug is popular at music and dance venues because of its ability to energize its user.

Users also report a sense of heightened empathy and of a heightened ability to 'feel' the music.

It is nearly impossible for a user to judge exactly how much Molly they can safely take because there is no set measure of potency and it is often impossible to tell if a dose has been adulterated.
