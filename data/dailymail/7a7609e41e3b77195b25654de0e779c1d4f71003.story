One of the star’s of TLC’s hit reality series My 600lb Life has been out on her first ‘traditional’ date, after losing over half of her body weight.

During a special one-off episode of the TLC show, which aired last night, viewers were given a chance to see how life has changed for season two success story Tara, 36, who managed to shed more than 300lbs during her time on the show.

When viewers first met the mother-of-two, from Lafayette, Louisiana, she weighed 606lbs. 

But, after achieving her dream of getting down to a healthy size, Tara revealed in last night’s show that she had been on the lookout for a good man to share her new life with and had agreed to a dinner date with her son's barber, Eugene.

New beginnings: On Wednesday's My 600lb Life, the show revisited season two star Tara, 36, who was starting to date after losing 300lbs

But, despite revealing that she has known Eugene for 14 years, she admitted that she was still nervous about going out on an official date with him.

'I have never in my life been on a traditional date,' she said. 'I don't know if I am ready, but I am going to take a chance.' 

When Tara started the show, she spent most of her days in bed because of the constant pain in her joints.

She depended on her family members to come to her because she was almost completely unable to leave her house. If her two children needed to go somewhere, she relied on her mother and step-father to take them.  

Within a year of undergoing major weight loss surgery, Tara lost 300lbs.

Eye on the prize: Tara ordered a shrimp salad and refused to have any of Eugene's appetizer during their date. 'If it's not healthy or its too much food, I'm not going to do it,' she told the cameras 

After meeting outside a restaurant, Tara and Eugene ventured inside where he told her that she looked 'stunning', which seemed to put her at ease.

'Now that I have lost the weight, this is a whole new world for me,' she said. 'The reason I am willing to give Eugene a chance is that he is a good man.' 

When the waiter came to take their order, Tara proved once and for all that she is still dedicated to her weight loss – and has not fallen back on her bad eating habits.

'I have to be careful about what I eat,' she told Eugene after ordering a small shrimp salad. 

Different world: Tara used to weigh 606lbs and was forced to rely on her family members to take care of her and her two kids 

Barely moving: Before her weight loss, Tara spent most of her days in bed because her joint pain prohibited her from walking

She refused to share any of his appetizer - not even the tomato that he had offered her. 

'If it's not healthy or its too much food, I'm not going to do it,' Tara told the cameras.

She explained to Eugene that if she ate the tomato, she was going to get full.

'Okay. Good girl,' he replied with admiration.  

Incredible journey: Tara underwent weight loss surgery and lost half of her body weight within a year

Starting over: Tara said she has no desire to regain the weight she had lost. She is dedicated to her health and continues to watch what she eats

Eugene later asked Tara about her health and where she sees herself five or six years from now.

'I am not trying to get back [to 600lbs] because that's not healthy for nobody,' she responded. 'I want to be a wife one day.'

Tara said that losing the weight and starting to date was something that she was doing for herself in order to try and move on with her life.

'I have to be happy with myself to find someone. I am starting to feel like I can have a life again and I can be happy.'

She added: 'It's scary, but it is exciting at the same time.'
