A book which is more than 320 years old written by an artist detailing every colour imaginable has come to light. 

The artist, only known as A. Boogert, created the 800 page guide, which was written in Dutch in 1692 with instructions on how to mix watercolours.

He begins each chapter with a guide about how to use the colour when painting before explaining how to create certain shades by adding water.

The book is entitled Traité des couleurs servant à la peinture à l'eau, and is thought to be the most comprehensive colour guide of its time

More than 270 years before the Pantone Colour Guide, the artist known only as A. Boogert created the book detailing every colour imaginable

Each chapter begins with a guide on how to use the colour when painting before explaining how to create certain shades using just water

This is done through hand painted illustrations of different coloured swatches.

The completely handwritten and hand painted pages of ‘Traité des couleurs servant à la peinture à l’eau' was probably the most comprehensive guide to painting and colour of its time.

The modern equivalent of the book, the Pantone Colour Guide, wasn’t published until 1963, with medieval book historian Erik Kwakkel believing the 17th Century guide has rarely been viewed. 

The book is completely hand written in Dutch and is 800 pages long. It is thought it was intended to be an educational guide

Every single colour imaginable is shown in the book, of which there is only a single copy in existence

Medieval book historian Erik Kwakkel, who has translated part of the work, says not many people will have seen the book

Mr Kwakkel has also translated part of the introduction the book, which was intended as an educational guide.

There is only a single copy of the book in existence, given that it was entirely created by hand.

The original book is currently kept in the Bibliothèque Méjanes, a library in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France.
