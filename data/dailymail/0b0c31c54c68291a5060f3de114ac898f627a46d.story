Micah Richards will seek a return to England in the summer in an attempt to get his career back on track as clubs line up to sign the defender.

West Ham, Everton, Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan are all showing an interest in the defender ahead of a summer move.

However, the versatile defender's preference is to return to the Premier League ahead of next season, which could end Roberto Mancini's hopes of a reunion with Richards or a switch to Germany.

The right-back, currently on loan at Fiorentina, turned down a new five-year contract at Manchester City and will leave the club on a free transfer this summer as he seeks regular first-team football.

And plans are being made for the 26-year-old to return to these shores.

Richards feels he is completely over the injury concerns that dogged the latter part of his career at City.

Nevertheless, the England defender has found first team chances hard to come by in Florence, due in part to a change in formation from manager Vincenzo Montella, though he impressed in the side’s 3-1 win over Sassuolo at the weekend.

His time spent on the bench has been the source of frustration for Richards, but the fact he is finally over his injury problems is reason for huge optimism for the defender as he looks to kick-start his career next season.

Richards saw a move to Inter break down on transfer deadline day after Montella pulled the plug on the deal after deciding he wanted to keep the full-back as part of his squad.

And Richards remains open to moving to the San Siro - but a return to England is his priority.
