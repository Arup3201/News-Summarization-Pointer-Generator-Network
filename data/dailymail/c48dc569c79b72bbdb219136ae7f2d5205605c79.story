The RFU are cashing in on a Rugby World Cup on home soil by bringing out six different England shirts in little more than 15 months.

The rampant commercialism prevalent at Twickenham saw England kit suppliers Canterbury launch two shirts, which featured the controversial Victoria Cross motif, last September.

These will be followed on to the market by another two World Cup shirts before the start of the tournament in September. And then there will be another double kit launch by England ahead of the 2016 Six Nations.

Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford said last night: ‘Merchandising is an important part of sport but governing bodies must be responsible and help fans and parents by showing restraint.’

The RFU say the extra shirts, which start at £50 and go up to £90.99 for an exact replica, are being brought out because England cannot have sponsors 02 on their jersey during the World Cup — and the Canterbury deal is for two new strips per season.

But there was public unrest when Nike brought out four England football kits in less than a year to take advantage of the 2014 World Cup. And rugby fans are being asked to fork out for even more changes of strip in a similar period.

An RFU spokesman said: ‘We have brought out one new home and alternate strip each season for the last five years, as is normal across the sports industry. The prices have remained unchanged for three years and every penny made is invested back into the game.’

The RFU signed a four-year kit deal with Canterbury, understood to be worth more than £5million a year, in March 2012 when England’s rugby stock was at rock bottom after the 2011 World Cup debacle in New Zealand.

The surprisingly big Canterbury offer allowed the RFU to reject Nike’s reduced renewal terms.

Headhunters Odgers are understood to be arranging the recruitment of the FA’s new chief executive at a significantly reduced fee. This is because the FA board’s nominations panel are prepared to do some of the work themselves, with chairman Greg Dyke making it known at the start of the process that he couldn’t see the need to hire a recruitment agency as the directors themselves could come up with a strong short-list to replace Alex Horne. FA concerns about any perceived cronyism in the appointment led to Odgers belatedly coming on board.

Former England hooker Mark ‘Ronnie’ Regan’s obscene speech at last year’s rugby writers’ awards dinner — described as an all-time low in the organisation’s 55-year history — has also sadly sounded the death knell for guest speakers at the bash. 

The revamped, sanitised version at the Marriott Grosvenor Square had a brief gushing question and answer session with Jonny Wilkinson instead.

But that was no replacement for an after-dinner speaker — indeed, part of the event’s charm was anticipating how awful the speech might be. Bring back Ronnie.

England manager Roy Hodgson was at Upton Park on Tuesday night to watch the FA Cup action

The dinner Roy Hodgson sought to arrange with his England players during the long gap between internationals was due to be held at St George’s Park. But as there were no gaps in the crowded football calendar, the date has been scrapped and the senior England side have once again side-stepped attending a venue that is meant to be their headquarters.

Sajid Javid, who has shown little or no interest in sport since becoming Culture Secretary, is nonetheless said to have been influential in the Government turning down House of Lords amendments to the Consumer Act that would have greatly helped regulate ticket touts in time for the Rugby World Cup.

Javid has spoken previously about his enthusiastic support for the secondary ticket market.

Lord Moynihan, who led the Lords campaign, said: ‘Every day the list of victims of crime grows as a result of inadequate regulation of the secondary market.

‘We will explore every way of protecting sports fans over the action of touts when the bill comes back to the House of Lords.’

Giles Clarke, looking over Lords Cricket Ground, is set to become president of the ECB

Any opposition to dictatorial Giles Clarke becoming president of the ECB evaporated at a meeting of the first-class counties who unanimously recommended a change of statute that will allow Clarke to deal with ICC issues in this new role. Yorkshire’s Colin Graves is certain to take over as chairman with an extended five-year term. But still to be worked out is how long Clarke can stay on as president without becoming a loose cannon.

London Wasps’ move to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry looks to have got under the skin of Leicester, the best supported rugby club in the Midlands. The Tigers have been so exercised that they have booked giant billboard space at the entrance to Wasps’ new home to promote their long established history at the other end of the M69.

Wasps have settled into their new home, the Ricoh Arena in Coventry , with two consecutive wins 

The exodus of British rugby players across the Channel is at least balanced by legendary France flanker Serge Betsen’s decision to settle in Ealing, west London. The 40-year-old, who won 63 caps during a stellar 16-year career with Biarritz and Wasps, is gaining his training badges and intends to set up a rugby academy in his name.
