It was a lazy day for these chimpanzees as they basked in the unseasonably warm weather today at Whipsnade Zoo. 

The chimps were pictured reclining on their backs as they soaked up the pleasant spring sunshine in their pen at the zoo in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

Some were seen shielding their eyes from the dazzling March sun but others sprawled out like the most ardent sunbather.

It was another fine day across much of the UK, with highs of 13 degrees and unbroken sunshine in the south of the country. 

It comes after the UK experienced the hottest day of the year on Saturday, with Santon Downham in Suffolk reaching 63F (17C), hotter than Barcelona and Rome.

But now, after a balmy spell of weather, severe gales and prolonged outbreaks of rain will return tomorrow. 

A yellow 'be aware' severe weather warning for wind is still in place for the north west of Scotland after more than 4,000 homes were left without power after high winds buffeted much of the country.

The three-day graphic shows a changeable spell of weather in the coming days, with prolonged spells of rain spreading from the west 

Kirk Waite, from the Met Office, said: 'Tomorrow morning is likely to be a cold start for much of the country but cloud spreading from the south and west will bring outbreaks of rain in the afternoon for western parts of the country, northern Ireland and Scotland. 

'The best of the sun will be in East Anglia and the south east of England. Overnight, cloud and rain will work its way eastwards.

'Then on Thursday after a cloudy start to the day, another band of rain will work its way from the west in the afternoon. On Friday it will be a cloudier and wetter day for large parts of the country.

'Saturday and Sunday will be cold and cloudy with rain coming in from the east this time. The best of any bright spells will be in the far west of the country.'
