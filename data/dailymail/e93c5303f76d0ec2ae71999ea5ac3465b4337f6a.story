Ferrari is set to unveil a new super-Ferrari next week which is expected to cost over £2million and have in excess of 1000 brake horsepower.   

The new FXX K is a souped-up version of the Italian car manufacturers' LaFerrari, which was the Italian car manufacturers fastest ever road-legal car.

The LaFerrari, which had just under 800bhp, could reach 217mph. The new model has another 200bhp and can accelerate from 0-62mph in less than three second.

Although the exact cost of the vehicle has not been released, the limited edition track car is expected to cost in excess of £2million.

By ignoring regulations for road and race cars, Ferrari has built a 'completely uncompromising' vehicle designed to give 'an unprecedented driving experience'.

It has been designed solely with the racetrack in mind and has a 50 per cent increase in downforce to boost cornering.

The 'K' in the name is a reference to the 'KERS' - the kinetic energy recovery system - it adopts in maximising its track performance.

Befitting of a speed machine, the car will have a deafening roar. Ferrari engineers removed the silencers from the hybrid race car's exhaust system.

Ferrari announced the first details of the FXXK yesterday ahead of its global debut in Abu Dhabi next week.

Ferrari said: 'Unfettered by homologation and racing regulations, the FXX K will never be used in competition.

'It was, in fact, developed to be completely uncompromising, incorporating technological innovations that will guarantee an unprecedented driving experience to the exclusive group of Client-Test Drivers with whom the Prancing Horse will roll out a test programme over the coming two years.'
