Atletico Madrid defender Joao Miranda has revealed he is negotiating a move away from the Spanish champions and says he is in discussions with clubs in Spain's Primera Division and the Premier League.

The Brazilian centre-half was one of the crucial pillars of Diego Simeone's side last year - his solid partnership with Diego Godin helping Atletico keep the tightest defence in Spain on their way to winning the league title.

Atletico signed Miranda on a free transfer from Sao Paulo in 2011 and inserted a 30million euro (£24.2m) buy-out clause into his latest contract renewal to wade off interest from rival clubs.

However, the 29-year-old has insinuated he wants to leave the Vicente Calderon and explained that the buy-out clause will not necessarily be a stumbling block to interested clubs.

'I have received several offers and we are negotiating,' Miranda told Radio ESPN.

'I have offers from the Spanish and English leagues, and other competitions. My agent is currently in Europe, resolving my future. My buy-out clause with Atletico Madrid is 30m, but that is negotiable.'

Miranda did not reveal which clubs in England are chasing his signature, although he has been linked with Manchester United in the past.

The defender also admitted his dismay at being left out of Luiz Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad, and announced that his brief international career - he has made just seven appearances for Brazil - had come to an end.

'I'm sad,' he said.

'I was quite hopeful about getting called up and it was very disappointing to not make it into the 23-man squad.

'I'm enjoying a very good spell at the moment, booth physically and technically. I believe I could have helped Brazil.'

'I will continue my life with Atletico Madrid or another club, because I have offers. But my time with the national team is over.'
