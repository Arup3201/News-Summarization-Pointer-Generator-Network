Breathometer, the firm that makes smartphone-connected breathalysers, is hoping to make it easier for drunk people to get home.

The company has teamed up with taxi-service Uber to allow the Breathometer app to call a ride when the user's blood alcohol content is near the legal limit of 0.08 per cent.

As well as the 'call Uber option', the app also allows you to call a friend, schedule a cab, find somewhere to get food, or find a place nearby to spend the night.

In a recent blog post published, Uber revealed that it integrated with Breathometer nine weeks ago as a case study.

The company says more than 54 per cent of Breathometer users who made it to the 'Get Home Safe' screen decided to take an Uber rather than call a friend.

'Having to call a friend or schedule a cab isn't always an easy choice,' said Charles Michael Yim, CEO of Breathometer.

The user has to open a Breathometer mobile app on their smartphone, and then power up their gadget using the small button on the bottom of the product. The device should the automatically with the smartphone, and once connected, asks you to confirm it has been 20 minutes since your last drink

'Access to a dependable and on-demand ride solution directly from our app for anyone that has been consuming alcohol is critical.'

California-based Breathometer sells the $99.99 Breeze, a wireless breathalyser that clips on to your clothing, and the $49.99 Original, which plugs into your phone via its headphone jack.

The user is then asked to take a deep breath and blow into the mouth of the gadget for five seconds.

Alcohol that a person drinks shows up in the breath because it gets absorbed from the mouth, throat, stomach into the bloodstream.

As the blood moves through the lungs, some of the alcohol moves across the membranes of the lung's air sacs into the air.

This concentration exhaled by the drinker can be detected by the device, which then uses a simple calculation to find out how much alcohol is in their blood.

You no longer have to rely on an honest friend to tell you whether your breath smells unpleasant - now there's an app for that.

Breathometer, has created Mint, a new gadget that assesses both the quality and hydration level of your breath.

A small device that's placed in the mouth automatically draws an air sample and, seconds later, the Breathometer smartphone app reveals whether you're minty fresh or breathing fire.

Users receive a 'mint score' between one and five, letting them know whether they're 'good to go' or 'need a mint'. 

Mint detects odor by measuring the volatile sulphur compounds in your mouth, which the company says can also indicate gum disease or tooth decay.

The gadget also measures the moisture level of your mouth's mucus membrane and lets you know whether you need a glass of water.
