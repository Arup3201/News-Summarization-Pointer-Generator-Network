Soldiers serving in Afghanistan over the festive season were given a morale boost when they received a visit from the Princess Royal.

Princess Anne flew into Camp Bastion to be shown around by a number of units to see the work they are doing.

The princess, who was accompanied by her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, was shown around Camp Tombstone where the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 Scots) are based.

The battalion, which is based at Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh, left Scotland in September to complete a six-month tour of Afghanistan.

They have been working with members of the Afghan National Army in Camp Shorabak, which is the Afghan base attached to Bastion, in an advisory and training role.

Major Andy Watson, 33, from Edinburgh, said: 'The visit is fantastic. It was a nice surprise as we only found out about it at the last minute for security reasons.

'We were showing off a series of photographs to demonstrate what we've done and our approach to our mission over the past three months, and also some equipment as well. For many of the Jocks it's the first time they've met Her Royal Highness, so for morale it's fantastic - especially this close to Christmas.'

Group, including the Apache department, and the Military Working Dogs 
Squadron, as well as the 7th Regiment of the Royal Logistics Corps and 
12 Logistic Support Regiment.

Dog handler Corporal Adrian Dickson, who serves with the RAF Police, is on his first tour of Afghanistan.

The final soldiers to leave Afghanistan as part of a planned reduction in troops will be back in the UK tomorrow.

Around 75 soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Mercian Regiment (1 Mercian), are due to fly out of Camp Bastion.

They are the last of 500 troops to leave the military base in time for Christmas, taking the number serving from 9,500 to 9,000.

The Mercians will arrive back at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, tomorrow, before returning to their base at Marne Barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, the following day.

Yesterday, about 60 troops from the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 Scots), also left Afghanistan.

They will be reunited with their families tomorrow at their base, Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh.

Since embarking on a six-month tour of Afghanistan in September, 1 Scots have been working with members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Camp Shorabak, which is the Afghan base attached to Bastion, in an advisory and training role.

Speaking about the visit by the Princess Royal, he said: 'It's a big boost in morale. It means we're not forgotten about.

'A lot of the guys that are based in the unit are out in forward locations a lot of the time. We come back in every four to six weeks for two to three days at a time, so to get something as high profile as this is brilliant.'

Cpl Dickson, 34, from Leigh in Lancashire, added: 'I'm going home this weekend for my R&R (rest and relaxation) fortnight and I'm most looking forward to seeing my family. It's a long time that we're out here, as we go for months of training away from home before the tour actually starts.'

Broudreaux, a black Labrador, is said to have made two significant finds on his last tour.

Princess Anne is the Colonel in Chief of 1 Scots, the Military Working Dogs Squadron and the Royal Logistics Corps. She also visited the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Free Hospital.

Lieutenant Joe Littledale, 24, from south London, is a transport troop commander with the 7th Regiment, Royal Logistics Corps, which is responsible for receiving and organising all of the supplies and equipment coming into Camp Bastion.

'It's a great honour (to meet the Princess), it's great to know that people from back home are coming out here, especially our colonel in chief, who has been chatting and getting down with the troops,' he said.

'It gives us a chance to get all the kit out and have a play as well. She's seen a lot of changes in the processes and the kit that we use as she's been out to Afghanistan several times before, so she was able to talk to us about that and take a real interest in it.'
