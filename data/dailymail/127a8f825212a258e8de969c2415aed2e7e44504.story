Holster those guns and put down those pitchforks because a chemist has come up with a surprising way that you could help you survive a zombie apocalypse.

Using a combination of three terrifyingly disgusting smells, an expert believes she can create ‘Eau De Death’ that mimics the smell of rotting human flesh.

While many people may prefer to stick to floral perfume and musky cologne for the time being, the scientist thinks that it could be used to dupe zombies into believing a wearer is dead – should the highly improbably night of the living dead occur.

It features just three chemical compounds.

Putrescine and cadaverine are the main ingredients, which are emitted early on in the decaying process.

Both organic chemical compound are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and are toxic in large doses.

They are largely responsible for the foul odour of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to bad breath and can be found in semen.

Methanethiol, which smells like rotten eggs is also added to the 'perfume' to create its offensive bouquet.

Dr Raychelle Burks of Doane College in Nebraska says that the zombie-repellent or ‘death cologne’ can be made using just three chemicals – and that a little would go a very long way.

She explains the vile concoction is primarily a mixture of two ‘perfectly named’ putrid chemical compounds called putrescine and cadaverine, which are emitted early on in the decaying process.

‘But maybe if you want to really round off the smell of death for the cologne, we should add in methanethiol.

‘It’s got that rotten egg, boiled cabbage smell,’ she said in a video for the American Chemical Society.

The idea is that a spritz of the pungent perfume would make you smell like a corpse and not be of any interest to a hungry zombie trying to sniff out fresh meat to gnaw upon.

‘This cologne is an evasive method, which when coupled with zombie mannerisms - as seen in “The Walking Dead” or “Shaun of the Dead” - would be effective in avoiding a zombie attack when moving among a zombie horde.

‘One could also wear it when casually waiting out the zombie apocalypse so as not to attract the attention of a roaming horde of zombies,’ she told NBC News.

Dr Burks has been working on death cologne for three years and said in the video: ‘If we’re really trying to mimic a corpse we have got to get the smell down to perfection.

‘Nobody wants to be the guinea pig that spritzes on the death cologne and realises it doesn’t quite work.’

For people worried about how easy it would be to produce vast quantities of the stench in a bid to protect the population of Earth, Dr Burks said remarkably little would be needed as it is ‘incredibly stinky in very low quantities.’

She explained that modified E.coli bacteria could be used to make all the polyamines (an organic compound with two or more amino groups) needed to produce the scent.
