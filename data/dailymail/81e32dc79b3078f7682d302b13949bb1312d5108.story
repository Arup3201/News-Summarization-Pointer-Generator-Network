Simon Rustage, 47, won £250,00 a year for the next 15 years on a scratchcard yesterday, but today he was back at work as a warehouse stock handler

A warehouse stock handler who won £250,000 a year for the next 15 years on a scratchcard yesterday has been back at work today, despite his huge windfall. 

Simon Rustage, 47, won the top prize on a £10 ‘Mega Rich’ scratchcard he bought at his local shop in Warrington, Cheshire, and will be paid a total of £3.75million.

But today he went back to work as normal, and insists that he has no plans to sell his £220,000 three-bed semi-detached house, or take early retirement.

Speaking outside his home  in Warrington, he said: 'I've been working today. I woke up and went and did a full 9-hour shift as usual.

'It might sound strange to some people but I've got no plans to quit my job or sell my house.I think in some ways life will carry on as normal.

'That's not to say I won't spend the money - I know I will.But because it's over a lot of years and not in a lump sum, it takes some of the temptation away.

'Because I was working today I haven't bought anything yet, although I would quite like a new car.

'I'm really happy and as long as my kids are taken care of, that's good enough for me. That's what really matters.

'When I woke up this morning it did feel a bit strange and I know life will be different now. But it will be different in a good way and I'm really looking forward to the future.

'I think I still need a few days for it all to sink in.'

Earlier today Melanie Turner, who split from Mr Rustage 15 years ago after the couple had two children together, revealed she's not bitter about her ex's good fortune, but is slightly jealous of his winnings.

Mr Rustage, who will be handed a total of £3.75million, says he does not plan to quit his job, will not sell his house, and says he hopes life will carry on as normal

Mr Rustage - who lives in this £220,000 three-bed semi-detached house - says he wants to use the money to make sure his children are looked after, but admits he would also like a new car

Mr Rustage went to work for a full nine-hour shift at this warehouse near Warrington today, despite his windfall

Mrs Turner, who has since remarried, told the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t expect I will see any of the money and I wish it had been me that won the lottery, but so long as he carries on looking after the kids then I think it’s great, it’s fantastic that he’s won.’

The 40-year-old carer, who met Mr Rustage in their local pub when she was 17, added: 'His win doesn’t change my opinion of him.

'He’s always paid his CSA and seen the kids, he’s a good dad and granddad. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we’ve been friends throughout.'

Mr Rustage told yesterday how he celebrated his life-changing win with his partner of 14 years, Jacqui Webb, 38.

‘She came home and we cracked open a bottle of champagne,’ he said. ‘The money was in my account the same day. I keep having to pinch myself, it still hasn’t really sunk in.’

Mr Rustage, who lives with Miss Webb and their two children, Megan, eight, and Nathan, 14, said he has no plans to move from their £200,000 three-bed semi, in Appleton, Warrington, because ‘it’s a nice area’.  

Big win: Simon Rustage won £250,000 every year for 15 years on a lottery scratchcard this week

But he admitted he would be swapping his Vauxhall Astra for a flashier car, buying a season ticket to his beloved Warrington Wolves rugby team - costing up to £296 for 2015 - and treating 12 family members and friends to a two-week holiday in Menorca next year.

He decided to splash out £10 on the card after winning £120 the day before on a football bet. 

‘I don’t usually buy £10 scratchcards, they are a bit expensive,’ he said. ‘But I’d won about £120 the day before and had just been to collect it. I was feeling lucky and thought ‘go on then.’

‘I scratched it there and then in the shop but I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I had to pass it to the shop assistant who confirmed I had won £250,000. I was just totally shocked. I had to look at the ticket about 40 times, but was absolutely delighted.’

However, it wasn’t until the following morning, when Mr Rustage rang Camelot to confirm his win that he realised the cash was not a one off, but will eventually amount to £3.75million - or £250,000 every year for 15 years.

Mr Rustage said he will also be putting some cash away for his granddaughter, Myla-Rose, 20 months, and two older children – soldier son George, 17, and daughter Hannah, 19 - from his marriage to first wife, Mrs Turner.

Will lightning strike twice? The winning ticket was bought at Bridge Lane Stores in Warrington, Cheshire 

Mrs Turner's mother, Sandra Brunt, 63, a retired area manager, said: ‘Simon’s really level headed.

‘He probably doesn’t have it mapped out yet what he’s going to spend it on, but he told me he was pleased it was not coming all in one go.

She added: ‘He said that would have been a bit mind blowing, he told me he felt a little bit sick when he first found out.

'We’re just all so pleased, it’s nice to know someone who has won the lottery.’

Mrs Turner said Mr Rustage was planning to pay for Hannah, who also works as a carer, to have driving lessons and to buy a car for both his older children.

Baqar Hussain, 50, manager of Bridge Lane Stores, was on duty when Mr Rustage bought his lucky ticket.

‘Simon buys scratch cards in here nearly every day,’ Mr Hussain said. ‘He’s a great guy - everyone is very happy for him.

‘He scratched the card here in the shop and he had to ask me if the ticket was genuine because he was so stunned that he’d won.'

Mr Hussain added: ‘He’s been in here after the win - he hasn’t let the money go to his head. I hope he enjoys spending his winnings.’

Next-door neighbour George Dean said: ‘He came round to tell us that he had some big news.

‘We had no idea what it was and then he told us he’d won a quarter of a million pounds every year for the next 15 years. None of us could believe it - we’re really happy for him.

‘He hasn’t told us what he’s going to spend it on yet - we’ll have to wait and see.’

Mr Rustage’s windfall is the second lottery win at his workplace, transport company Norbert Dentressangle, where a syndicate of staff scooped a £1.7m Lotto Jackpot in January.

However, it was six weeks before the syndicate discovered they had won after forgetting to check their ticket.
