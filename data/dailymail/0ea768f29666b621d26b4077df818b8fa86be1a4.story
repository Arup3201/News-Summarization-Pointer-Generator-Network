Two Silicon Valley companies will now cover egg-freezing as an incentive for top female talent in their prime fertility years who don't want to sacrifice motherhood for work.

Apple and Facebook say they'll shell out out as much as $20,000 for women to put their parenthood plans on ice.

The firms also hope the incentive will help women balance child-rearing and work life. However, even as success rates continue to rise, there are no guarantees the method will lead to conception down the road. 

Looking for female talent: Apple and Facebook say they'll shell out out as much as $20,000 for women to put their parenthood plans on ice

Facebook has already started covering the procedure, which can cost $10,000 or more plus annual storage fees, and Apple's program begins in January, according to NBC News.

Apple's plan is covered as part of its fertility benefits while Facebook's will fall under its surrogacy benefit.

While the move is sure to bring in gifted tech talent eager to have it all, experts warn that freezing eggs is no guarantee of a future family.

Women inject high levels of hormones for a week in order to ovulate as many eggs as possible. Retrieving them is an outpatient procedure that can cost $10,000 to $15,000, sometimes not including the cost of the medication. Clinics also charge a storage fee, and then women who wind up using their eggs will pay thousands more to undergo in vitro fertilization.

Anyone considering egg freezing needs careful counseling about their age and the odds of success if they want to later thaw those eggs for use in in vitro fertilization, the guidelines stress.

Sperm routinely are frozen. So are the extra embryos of couples undergoing infertility treatment, in case they want to use them for later pregnancy attempts.

But eggs proved more delicate and difficult to freeze than sperm or embryos. The problem: Eggs contain lots of water, and early methods of freezing and thawing allowed ice crystals to form that could destroy or damage them. In the past decade, scientists created a flash-freezing method called vitrification that appears to overcome that challenge.

For a number of years, egg-freezing has been offered experimentally for young women or girls who are diagnosed with cancer or other serious illnesses that would destroy their ovaries.

Then there's age-related infertility: About 1 in 5 U.S. women now have their first child after age 35, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet the ability to conceive begins dropping around 35 and more rapidly as the 40s near. Women have fewer eggs left, and these older remaining ones aren't as healthy, meaning even if the woman can get pregnant she's more likely to miscarry. 

There are only about 1,500 known live births resulting from frozen eggs worldwide, compared with about 1 million IVF births using fresh eggs.
