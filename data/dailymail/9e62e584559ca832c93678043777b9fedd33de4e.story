As Barbara Walters gets ever closer to her retirement next month, the 84-year-old says she might return to the interviewee who won her the highest ratings of her 50 years on TV: Monica Lewinsky.

Walters' 1999 interview with the scandalous former White house intern drew a record 74 million viewers, but the TV news queen says it's Lewinsky's personal saga that could win her the spot as Walters' final ever interview.

'I’d like to interview Monica again. I think Monica’s story is very interesting, because everybody else has been able to move on. I’m touched by the fact that she hasn’t been able to,' Walters said.

Redo: Retiring TV news queen Barbara Walters says she'd like to make Monica Lewinsky her final interview. Their 1999 sit down was Walters' largest ratings draw ever with an historic 74 million viewers

Years of Barbara: Walters, 84, will retire next month after shattering the gender glass ceiling with her 50 years on television

Walters made the statement in a recent Variety cover story, but it isn't the first time she's both praised Lewinsky and hinted she may be her last interview.

Shortly after Walters shocked and saddened the world with the May 2013 announcement of her retirement, she discussed Lewinsky during a sit down with Extra.

'I wouldn't mind if my last one was Monica Lewinsky,' she said.

'I like Monica. She hasn't been seen,' continued Walters. 'I think she's a good person and I wouldn't mind doing an interview with her.'

A few days later, Walters brought it up again while chatting with David Letterman.

'I think she has an OK life,' she said. 'I think it’s still difficult for her. Since this is my last year in television, I would love to be able to talk to Monica again.'

While all signs suggest Lewinsky will be Walters' last chosen interview--and it's hard to fathom the now 40-year-old would turn it down--the woman who helped Bill Clinton get himself impeached isn't the only person on Walters' bucket list.

She's also said she'd love to make history by getting a rare interview with Queen Elizabeth or the pope.
