What started out as a joke may have now become part of the UK's food landscape as childhood favourite the crisp sandwich looks set to take over restaurant menus. 

Following in the footsteps of Belfast's Simply Crispy - which opened earlier this month - Stock Exchange Bakery in Bristol has now introduced the classic snack to its punters.

The crunchy sandwiches, which come in freshly made buns or sliced multi-granary bread, are being sold for £2.50.

Punters get to choose from 20 different crisp flavours includes McCoy's flame grilled steak and Quavers to Monster Munch and Walkers Sensations Thai sweet chilli

For an extra 50p, the more adventurous can add either ham, cheese or onions, while an extra 20p will add either sweet chilli sauce or chutney. 

Owner Georgina Turner is offering crisp fanatics a choice of 20 different flavours to tackle, from traditional cheese and onion or ready salted, to the slightly more unusual Monster Munch or Sensations Thai sweet chilli.

The bakery, which opened three months ago, launched the crisp sandwich scheme as a way to cheer up their punters. 

Ms Turner said to The Bristol Post: 'It's just a bit of fun, really. We know that money is tight for a lot of people these days and we thought we would offer something a bit different.'

The bakery, which opened three months ago, offers sandwich filings for an additional 50p and sauces for an extra 20p. Customers can also choose to add a serving of soup for £1.50 

If the snacks prove to be as popular as as Simply Crispy, the bakery may have to keep them on the menu.

Businessman Andrew McMenamin had planned to keep his Simply Crispy pop-up in Belfast going for just four weeks.

But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London.

'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said.

He transformed his business That Wee Café, into the crisp sandwich shop after reading a spoof article about a 'trendy' establishment that was serving the 'fashionable' sandwiches on a satirical website. 

Diners at the café can choose from 35 different crisp flavours and three different types of bread on which to make their ham and cheese sandwich.

The £3.50 dish is served with soup – topped with croutons made from Monster Munch crisps – and chips.

Crisp sandwiches are starting to gain something of a celebrity following, with Belfast boxer Carl Frampton even being honoured with a sandwich named 'The Jackal' in his honour.
