A teenage boy was rushed to hospital on Sunday after he and 47 others were trapped inside the renowned SeaWorld ride Skytower for four hours at the San Diego water park.

Others were treated at the scene for anxiety when operators and emergency crews were finally able to bring down the 320-foot high observation tower, which is a family-friendly attraction that gives a birds-eye view of the park.

Fire Department spokesman Lee Swanson said the problem was initially reported as a power failure, but they later determined it to be a mechanical malfunction.

The group were stuck at about 220 feet up in the air, according to San Diego 6.

'They had air conditioning, so it wasn't like they were sweltering in a box,' Swanson said.

One 17-year-old was taken to hospital for an evaluation.

There were no other injuries.

SeaWorld communications director David Koontz issued a written statement thanking the riders for their patience.

'With guest safety as our top priority, park engineers spent four hours trouble-shooting the problem before restoring power to the Skytower and safely returning the 46 guests to the ride loading area,' the statement said.

'The guests were never in danger and park officials were in constant communication with them while the power failure was being addressed.

'Two SeaWorld employees were also in the Skytower providing guests with water and snacks.

The guests also received return admission and other park amenities, Koontz said.

Swanson said firefighters were prepared to rescue people with ropes, something the department trains for at SeaWorld once or twice each year.

However SeaWorld employees were able to bring the ride down on their own.
