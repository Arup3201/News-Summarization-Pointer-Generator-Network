Nick Clegg tonight pleaded with his party to unite behind him, as Lembit Opik made fresh calls for the Lib Dem leader to quit.

Writing for MailOnline, ex-MP Mr Opik warned that without a new leader the Lib Dems faced ‘destruction’.

In a damning assessment of the Deputy Prime Minister’s performance, Mr Opik claims that if the party were a business ‘he’d have been fired a long ago’.

Clash: Ex-Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said it was 'nothing personal' but Nick Clegg has to quit as Lib Dem leader 

The searing criticism from one of the Lib Dems’ best known figures comes after peer Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called for Mr Clegg to quit.

Mr Clegg sought to brush off the attack from a long-standing critics, insisting: ‘He tends to always do so like clockwork at this time of year.

‘When it's conference and the weather turns bad, up pops Matthew Oakeshott with some disobliging remarks about me.’

Tonight in an address to the party faithful in Glasgow, Mr Clegg tried to ignore his critics and instead urged ‘unity’.

‘Since our party was formed, every step of our journey has been taken together,’ he said.

‘We have decided the policies, fought the campaigns and taken on the vested interests.

‘We decided, together, to go into government. People who don’t understand us like to call debate division.

‘I think it is debate that give us our unity. Unity about what we want to see for our country.’

But after three and a half years in government, many Lib Dems remain deeply uneasy about the power-sharing deal.

With the party stubbornly stuck at around 10 per cent in the polls, behind UKIP, there are fears many MPs will be lost at the 2015 election.

Mr Opik, who has called for a new leader before, warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 seats with Mr Clegg in charge.

He writes: ‘I’ve got nothing against Nick Clegg personally.  It’s purely business. 

‘And the truth is, if the Liberal Democrats were a business, he’d have been fired a long ago. 

‘No ‘Chief Executive Officer’ could survive such terrible performance indicators: a catastrophic decline in membership, a virtual halving of local Councillors, a dreadful deposit-losing London mayoral result and the worst poll ratings in over two decades.’

However, Mr Opik himself was the butt of a series of jokes in the conference hall.

Kirsty Williams, Lib Dem leader in Wales, backed the party's campaign for 1million extra jobs, saying: 'Why do we need to keep talking about jobs, jobs and more jobs? We need to find Lembit one.'

Pressure: Mr Clegg used a speech at the party conference in Glasgow to issue a plea for unity

The former MP for Montgomeryshire wants Mr Clegg to announce his resignation as leader, while continuing as Deputy Prime Minister.  

He went on: ‘Clegg has already done irreparable damage to Lib Dem prospects in the next General Election – making his stated goal of doubling the number of MPs a risible joke.

‘Clegg’s legacy will then be nothing less than the destruction of decades of effort by me and other activists, only to have seen our investment evaporate in five short years.’

However allies of the Deputy Prime Minister have made clear they think the party needs to ‘grow up’ and accept the tough responsibilities of being in government.

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne urged left-leaning Lib Dems to stop attacking the government they serve in.

In a thinly-veiled barb aimed at the likes of Vince Cable and Tim Farron who boast of being unhappy about the coalition, Mr Browne said: ‘We cannot be half-in Government and half-out. We cannot claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us.

‘We cannot be in the Government but campaign against the Government at the same time.

‘The Liberal Democrats are an independent party and we will stand on our own manifesto, but we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in Government. No foot dragging.

‘No craving the easy gesture politics of opposition. No fence sitting. We have risen to the challenge and we have served our country well. We deserve to stay in office and continue our positive work.

‘The Liberal Democrats should be proud of our Government.’
