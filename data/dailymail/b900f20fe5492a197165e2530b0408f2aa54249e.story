Former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster has heaped praise on his compatriot Toni Kroos after the German's eye-catching performance against Rayo Vallecano.

The 24-year-old scored his first La Liga goal for Los Blancos as they comfortably defeated Rayo 5-1 at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening.

And Schuster, who played for Los Blancos between 1998 and 1990, believes Kroos is playing perfectly at the moment, even comparing the former Bayern Munich star to himself.

Former Real Madrid boss Bernd Schuster compares Toni Kroos to himself in Monday edition of Marca

As a player (1988-90)

Appearances: 61

Goals: 13

As a manager (2007-08)

Honours: La Liga (2008), Copa del Rey (2008)

Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, Schuster said: 'He was one of the best. He did a bit of everything: defend, attack, give an assist, score one for himself. 

'For Bale's goal, it was quintessential Kroos - he recovers the ball, moves up the pitch and gives that deadly pass. He finished off the day with his own goal - shooting is something he's marvellous at.

'I can expect anything from Kroos because he's an intelligent player. And intelligence is something very important in football. 

'As a player, he has it all: a vision of the game, short passes, long passes... but I still think that his best position, at least where I like him the most because his full potential can be exploited, is a little further up the pitch. 

'We are similar in that we are both German, blonde and have the same vision of the game.'

Elsewhere in Spain and Mundo Deportivo and Sport both lead with stories on former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who travelled back to Catalonia to vote on the region's fight for independence.

Mundo Deportivo carry quotes from the Bayern Munich manager, who insists that Luis Enrique will bring success to the Nou Camp after a difficult start to the season.

Elsewhere on the continent and French paper L'Equipe focus on Paris Saint-Germain's 2-0 victory against Marseille on Sunday evening, a result which takes Laurent Blanc's side to within one point of the Ligue 1 leaders.

Goals from Lucas Moura and Edinson Cavani sealed victory for the hosts, who are the only side in the French top tier yet to be beaten this season.

Coverage in Italy is dominated by Juventus' 7-0 thrashing of Parma, which leaves the Serie A champions on course to retain their title.

La Gazzetta dello Sport claim that it was a 'new Juve' after boss Massimiliano Allegri opted to change to a 4-3-2-1 formation, a tactical change which helped produce a stunning performance in Turin on Sunday.
