England have not been blessed with many batsmen who thrive under pressure in one-day internationals but they may have found one in James Taylor.

For all the talk of the potential power hitters such as Alex Hales, Jos Buttler and newly-installed captain Eoin Morgan, England will need someone like Taylor at No 3 to hold together an innings if they are to regularly post the 300-plus totals that will be necessary at next month’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

James Taylor is looking forward to the new era under Morgan 

The 25-year-old, who averaged 73 for Nottinghamshire in one-day cricket in 2013 and 88 last year, finds himself in pole position to bat at three for England in the upcoming Tri-Series against Australia and India.

It is an opportunity he earned thanks to a brilliant knock of 90 in Sri Lanka last month, when he came back into the side following a 15-month absence for the fourth ODI in Colombo after then captain Alastair Cook was banned for slow over-rate offences.

‘I knew I needed to take any opportunity that came my way and that arose when Alastair couldn’t play,’ he said ahead of England’s first warm-up match against an ACT XI on Monday in Canberra.

New England captain Eoin Morgan has been described as a 'strong leader' by James Taylor

‘I was put in a massively pressurised situation — if I didn’t score runs I wasn’t going to the World Cup. But you want to be put in those situations because that means things are going well. 

'Hopefully, I’m put in those situations again where I’m relied on. I had hopes of being here and always knew if I did score runs and kept knocking down that door the opportunity would arise.

‘I just want to win games for England.’
