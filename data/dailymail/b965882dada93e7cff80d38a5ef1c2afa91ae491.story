Gordon Brown came close to losing his sight when he was in No 10, the former prime minister hinted last night.

He made the admission in his Kirkcaldy constituency, as he confirmed he will not stand for re-election in May.

Mr Brown said goodbye with his wife Sarah and young sons Fraser and John – as he did when leaving Downing Street in 2010.

Emotional: Gordon Brown told supporters he would continue to campaign on issues close to his heart

In a highly personal speech, he told of the pain the couple suffered when they lost their first child, Jennifer, shortly after her birth. He also revealed that problems with his eyesight in Downing Street were more serious than previously admitted.

The former Labour leader suffered a serious rugby accident at the age of 16 which blinded him in one eye, and he required lengthy treatment to save the sight in the other. 

In 2009, Downing Street confirmed that medical checks had picked up minor retinal tears in Mr Brown’s good eye – but at the time he said there had been ‘absolutely no deterioration’ in his eyesight.

Traditional: Mr Brown spoke in the Old Kirk in Kirkcaldy, the oldest church in his constituency town

'Although I'm standing down from public office I want to renew my commitment to public service,' he added

Support: Mr Brown hugging his wife Sarah ahead of the speech, which drew praise from former opponents

Yet last night Mr Brown revealed that surgeon Hector Chawla, who saved his eyesight as a boy, came to his aid. He said: ‘When I was in Downing Street and he was retired and they discovered there were tears ... he came to help me again.’

He told 200 assembled friends and Labour Party members at the Old Kirk church: ‘I will not forget, Sarah will not forget, the strength you gave us when our daughter Jennifer was born and then died.’ 

As his wife looked on, he added: ‘For her love and for her support in every campaign we’ve done – national elections, local elections – Sarah was incredible in giving me support and supporting the Labour Party.’

Friends said Mr Brown wanted to go out on a high, just weeks after making a critical intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to secure the future of the United Kingdom.

David Cameron, who replaced Mr Brown in May 2010, said: 'Gordon has given a huge amount in terms of public service and his contribution in government and in Parliament'

Family portrait: Mr Brown said he would remain in Fife, adding: 'It is Fife where our home is and where we will be, where our children John and Fraser, who are here tonight, are happily at school'

Then and now: Mr Brown leaving Downing Street with his wife and two children after his defeat in May 2010

They also said the former prime minister still harbours ambitions to take on one more major international role, such as leading the International Monetary Fund, before he retires for good.

According to Labour sources, Ed Miliband approached Mr Brown in the immediate aftermath of Scotland’s referendum to see if he would consider taking over the moribund Scottish Labour Party.

But Mr Brown declined, saying publicly that he was ‘too old to be the comeback kid ... and I’m too young to be an elder statesman as well’.

Mr Brown, who has served in the Commons for over 30 years, will not take a seat in the Lords. Instead, he said he will focus on his role as a UN ambassador for education, as well as his and his wife’s other charity work. 

Mr Brown married his wife Sarah in 2000 and they have two sons, John and James. A baby girl, Jennifer, was born prematurely and died in January 2002

Mr Brown served as Chancellor under Tony Blair for 10 years, during which the two men repeatedly clashed about when the Prime Minister would step aside to make way for his old friend

However, he indicated he would return to front-line politics to keep Britain in the EU, should a referendum take place, adding: ‘Although I’m standing down from public office, I want to renew my commitment to public service.’

Mr Miliband last night hailed his predecessor as a ‘towering figure’ in the Labour Party and British politics. David Cameron, who defeated Mr Brown at the last general election, said he ‘wished him well’.

Mr Brown, 63, had been widely expected to step down from Parliament in May. He has made only fleeting appearances at Westminster since leading Labour to a crushing defeat in 2010.

When he left office Britain had one of the biggest budget deficits in the developed world, which politicians on all sides are still grappling with.

However, friends insist that history will be kinder to a man who helped broker a rescue package for the world economy when it stood on the brink of collapse.

Mr Brown entered the House of Commons in 1983 when he won a majority of 11,000 in Dunfermline East

After Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer

After years of waiting to become Prime Minister, Mr Brown finally entered No 10 on June 27, 2007

The second son of Rev Dr John Ebenezer Brown, a Church of Scotland minister, Gordon Brown was brought up in Kirkcaldy, a small coastal town north of Edinburgh in Scotland.

At the age of 16, he joined Edinburgh University to study history becoming the youngest undergraduate there since the war.

He became a Labour MP for Dunfermline East at the second attempt in 1983 with a majority of 11,000, after briefly working as a lecturer and TV reporter, and began forging an alliance with fellow MP Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson.

Gordon Brown enjoyed a mixed relationship with Tony Blair and craved the leadership for many years

He was made chancellor in 1992, choosing not to stand for leadership thereby clearing the way for Blair, on the understanding he would retain power at some point. 

After Labour's 1997 landslide victory, Brown became the most powerful chancellor in modern times.

But he never stopped coveting the top job and  spend much of the next 10 years pushing Blair to make good on their deal.

When Blair finally stood down in 2007, after winning three Labour election victories, Brown was made party leader, and prime minister, without a contest. 

While on the campaign trail in Rochdale ahead of the 2010 general election, Mr Brown was caught on microphone describing local pensioner Gillian Duffy as 'bigoted' when she quizzed him about immigration

However he found the job he had so craved more difficult than he envisaged and he struggled, particularly with the onset of the global recession in 2008.  

After a disastrous showing in the local and European elections in 2009, he lost the 2010 general election campaign after losing more than 90 Labour MPs in what was Labour's worst electoral performance since Michael Foot in 1983. 

Mr Brown returned to the front line political stage for the Scottish referendum and played a crucial role in keeping the Union with a barnstorming speech in Glasgow the day before votes were cast.
