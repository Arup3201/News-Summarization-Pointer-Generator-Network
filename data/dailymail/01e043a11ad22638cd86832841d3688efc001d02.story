A BBC journalist faced calls for  his sacking last night for attempting to cover up the extent of his involvement with the far-Right British National Party.

Duncan Weldon, the controversial new economics correspondent for Newsnight, took part in a racist leafleting campaign in 2000 which made scaremongering claims about refugees being ‘shipped’ to Newcastle.

The leaflets alleged that a London council planned to move 16,000 asylum seekers to the area, saying the ‘shipping’ of refugees would ‘change the ethnic make-up of the area’, lead to ‘whites living in fear’ and cause Newcastle to become ‘riot-torn’.

The campaign was organised by Kevin Scott, a self-confessed racist with a conviction for assault who used the slogan Rights For Whites.

BNP leader Nick Griffin was later forced to apologise for the leaflets, but Mr Scott refused, saying: ‘I think the multi-racialists should apologise to the people of Newcastle .  .  . for trying to impose a multi-racial society on them against their democratically expressed wishes.’

Mr Weldon – already embroiled in a row over his suitability for Newsnight because of his Labour Party affiliations and lack of journalistic experience – posted a blog online this weekend to try to play down his part in the BNP’s campaign.

Writing after being asked about his BNP links by The Mail on Sunday, he said he had spent ‘a year  or so’ when he was a school sixth-former ‘flirting’ with the far-Right, but insisted: ‘During that time I never joined any political organisation or attended any meeting, but read ravenously.’

However, in an article he wrote in 2002 as an Oxford student under the false name Sam Healey, he admitted being involved in a number of BNP events, including one demonstration that descended into a violent encounter with the police.

At one event, he handed out the ‘decidedly racist’ leaflets, while the other event was a demonstration of ‘about 200 members’ which saw police ‘holding people back’. He added: ‘I don’t know if my parents ever suspected, but most of my friends at home knew. They were incredibly relieved when I stopped attending meetings.’

Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who wrote to Newsnight editor Ian Katz questioning Mr Weldon’s suitability, said: ‘Given  the revelations about his secret  BNP past, it is clear Mr Weldon is unsuitable for a position in our national broadcaster.’

A BBC spokesman said last night that Mr Weldon ‘is a highly respected professional who has assured us he has not been a member of the BNP’.
