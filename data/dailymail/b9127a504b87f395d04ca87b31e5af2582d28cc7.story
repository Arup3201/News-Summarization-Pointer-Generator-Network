Admission: New immigration boss Sarah Rapson said she may 'never finish the job' of fixing Britain's chaotic visa processing system

The boss of Britain’s new immigration body yesterday said its chaotic visa processing system will never be fixed.

Sarah Rapson, who started as director general of UK Visas and Immigration 54 days ago, believes she will 'never finish the job'.

She told MPs she could not rule out finding more backlogs of unprocessed cases in the system she had inherited.

‘Are we ever going to say about this 
really quite difficult organisation, with a set of complex things it has
 to do, "it is perfect"? I don’t think so,' she told the Home Affairs 
Select Committee.

'My 
intention is to make some improvements. I would be grateful for the 
committee’s advice on where we should prioritise. But will we ever 
finish the job? No.'

She told the committee the agency was currently processing 190,000 cases.

Committee
 chairman Keith Vaz replied: ‘You do realise you’re giving us new 
figures we didn’t know about. These are astonishing figures.’

Miss Rapson said she would not have taken the job if she was not ‘slightly optimistic’ she could make a difference.

But
 she added: ‘There are lots of people in the organisation who have got 
ideas about how we can make things better. Is it ever going to be fixed?
 I answered that question from you earlier, I don’t think so.’

The
 body was formed earlier this year when the UK Border Agency was split 
in two – with Miss Rapson’s department focusing on the visa system and 
another authority dealing with immigration law enforcement.

Both are directly under ministers’ control.

Announcing the UKBA’s demise in March this year, Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted to end its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’ after years of failure. It followed a series of damning inspections and reports exposing horrendous backlogs in asylum and immigration cases.

Earlier this year, the Home Affairs Select Committee warned it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear a backlog of asylum and immigration cases the size of the population of Iceland.

Last year the Government also hived off the UK Border Force, which is responsible for frontline controls at air, sea and rail ports, from the wider UKBA.

That followed a scandal over border controls when it emerged thousands of people had been admitted to Britain without having been checked against a watch list.

Yesterday, officials downplayed the significance of the 190,000 figure given by Miss Rapson, pointing out it had been supplied to the committee before.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We receive and process thousands of applications every day and so there will always be a large number of cases on our systems.

‘This year we have reduced outstanding applications substantially in the vast majority of routes, improved in-country processing times and maintained out of country service standards.’

Meanwhile, Labour could introduce targets to drive up the number of immigrants entering the UK, it emerged last night.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna suggested the party wanted to see more foreign students coming to Britain.

He told the left-leaning IPPR think-tank he was ‘certainly open’ to the idea of a ‘clear numerical target for growth’ in student visas.

The comments risk undermining Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has openly criticised the last government’s ‘open doors’ policy.

Tory MP Nick De Bois said Labour ‘still don’t get it’, while Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said Mr Umunna had got his facts ‘completely wrong’.
