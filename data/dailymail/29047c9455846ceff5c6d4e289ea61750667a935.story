David Cameron today shrugged off reports 14 Conservative MPs have launched a secret plot to oust him as Tory leader.

The Prime Minister went ahead with a visit to a Sony warehouse, destroyed in last year's riots, amid reports of a 'drip, 'drip' process to challenge his leadership.

It is understood the 14 have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a leadership contest.

Under Tory rules a contest is automatically triggered if 15 per cent of the party’s MPs write letters to Mr Brady calling for the leader to go.

The 14 letters, reported in the Spectator magazine, which has close links to the Tories, remain well short of the 46 needed to trigger a leadership contest.

But, because of a quirk in the rules, the letters remain on file indefinitely, meaning that Mr Cameron could face a ‘drip, drip’ process of discontent.

Today the PM was shown round the newly-reopened Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC) warehouse in Enfield, north London which was set on fire during the riots last summer.

Allies played down the significance of the revolt against the PM, noting that making spending cuts while being in coalition was always going to be unpopular with some sections of the Tory party.

A source said: 'He is getting on with the job, as usual.'

Rebel Tories and loyalists alike dismissed claims that an organised coup was under way.

One rebel MP said there was no serious threat to the Prime Minister’s position for now because there was no alternative leader waiting in the wings.

But he said the situation could change if Mr Cameron failed to turn round the party’s fortunes before the next election, or if London Mayor Boris Johnson, viewed by some as a possible future leader, returns to the Commons.

‘There is no organised campaign against the Prime Minister at the moment,’ he said.

‘You could easily get 46 names if there was an alternative leader, but there isn’t. If Boris was here things might be very different.

‘But if we find ourselves running towards a cliff like lemmings as the next election approaches then the party would change leadership overnight. It is that brutal.’

Loyalists also dismissed claims of a concerted move against the Prime Minister.

Mr Brady last night declined to comment on the report. But he stressed that it was impossible for anyone else to know how many, if any, letters he had received from colleagues about the Prime Minister.

‘No-one other than me could possibly know because I do not discuss it with anyone,’ he said.

Supporters of Mr Cameron attempted to toughen up the leadership rules before the last election by raising the threshold for triggering a contest and placing a time limit on letters sent to Mr Brady.

But the move was abandoned after the Tories failed to win a majority at the election.
