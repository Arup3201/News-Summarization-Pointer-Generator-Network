A model who was arrested for stripping naked at the AFL Grand Final has blamed her racy antics on the fact she had consumed too much 'free alcohol' on the day.

Scottish Heather McCartney, 26, who lives on the Gold Coast, took off all of her clothes and danced in a corporate box at the Melbourne Cricket Ground surrounded by hundreds of shocked sports fans on Saturday.

The former Playboy model told Triple M radio she was not paid for the stunt following Hawthorn's big win over the Sydney Swans.

'I guess I got a bit carried away with all the free alcohol in the box,' McCartney said.

'Everyone was making silly bets on the day so I thought I’d just up the ranks and go, "Well, I’ll get naked." I don’t regret it but I’m sorry for offending anyone.'

McCartney was fined $300 for her actions after she appeared in court on Sunday. 

'It was a silly thing to do, I guess, and I can see how it’s been blown out of proportion, but I had a great time.'

Her comments come after the tenant of the corporate box denied hiring her for her post-match performance.

The  corporate suite is leased by building firm Edgeton Properties, according to the Herald Sun.

A representative from the building company denied hiring Ms McCartney as the AFL announced they were investigating the incident.

'Edgeton Properties did not hire a stripper to perform in a corporate suite at the MCG Grand Final,' the company told the newspaper in an email.

It's not yet known if the company was using the corporate box during Saturday's game, or if it had leased it out.

The company would not comment on who was using the corporate box  and how Ms McCartney came to be naked when the game ended.

Ms McCartney denies being a stripper.

The AFL fan has also been revealed to be a rugby league supporter, although it is unknown whether she will support the Rabbitohs or the Bulldogs during this weekend's NRL grand final

Several photos have emerged of Ms McCartney in various sporting attire, with the model posting several racy snaps of herself online wearing a Queensland NRL State of Origin jersey.

Other photos show her wearing a Socceroos jersey, various Australian-themed swimsuits, baseball themed shoots and most recently, both Sydney Swans and Hawthorn Hawks-themed lingerie ahead of her notorious antics.

Ms McCartney was arrested by police following complaints at the MCG.

She reportedly lashed out by kicking, bunching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. 

The 26-year-old was photographed being led away by police where she spent the night in a cell and was fined $300 for indecent manner. 

She told a Melbourne court the following day that it was a bet. 

Ms McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. 

She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time.

A post on her Instagram revealed that Scotland-born McCartney was supporting Australian football team, the Socceroos during this year's World Cup

Ms McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning.

She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.'

One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said Ms McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'.

Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG, who have launched an investigation.

MCG spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald Sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances and appropriate action would be taken.

'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said.

An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. 

AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke said he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL.

'It's a disgrace. It's the people's game and it's for families,' he said.

'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' 

The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody

Ms McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt.

One Facebook user named Kevin Richardson commented: 'How was your night in the slammer Heather??'

Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' 

Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling'

William Divic said: 'Damn didn't recognize you with clothes on'
