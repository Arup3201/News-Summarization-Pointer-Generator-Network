The BBC has banished men in tights for its new lavish period drama because they are not 'masculine' enough.

Actors dressed in stockings have been a staple of television drama such as Shakespeare and Robin Hood for decades but The White Queen costume designers they would be too 'distracting'.

The series, set in the 15th Century, tells the story of the scheming for the throne during the War of the Roses.

Costume designers said tights were not 'masculine' enough and replaced them with tight trousers

Men in tights have been a staple of period dramas, such as in Errol Flynn's depiction of Robin Hood

Such is the garment's association with poor period dramas that a film was named after the joke, Robin Hood Men In Tights.

Costume designer Nic Ede decided to dress actors such as Max Irons, from Red Riding Hood, and James Frain in tight padded trousers instead.

He said 'these days tights are associated with Robin Hood movies and bad jokes'.

The White Queen, starring Rebecca Ferguson and Janet McTeer, which starts next month, is set against the backdrop of the battle between the House of Lancaster and the House of York.

It is the BBC's major 10-hour adaptation of Philippa Gregory's bestselling historical novel series, The Cousin's War.

Not only are the costumes a departure from the norm, but so is the make-up.

The hair and make-up department on the show said they deliberately 'dulled' the actors' appearance 'to make their faces look almost tired on camera - rather than what is usually applied to "brighten" faces for TV'.

However, it was not all bad news for the talent.

Ferguson,
 who plays Elizabeth Woodville - the beautiful commoner who marries 
Edward IV, was given a waist-long real hair wig and a coronation gown 
made from gold crochet fabric adorned with hundreds of pearls.

Mr Ede said it was his favourite costume that he created on set.

The BBC is hoping the series will be a ratings winner.

Controller
 of BBC Drama, Ben Stephenson, said: 'One of the most ambitious series 
the BBC has made, this 10-part series is an epic drama that makes real 
history as gripping as the best fiction, featuring a cast of 
extraordinary new talent and some of our finest actors.'
