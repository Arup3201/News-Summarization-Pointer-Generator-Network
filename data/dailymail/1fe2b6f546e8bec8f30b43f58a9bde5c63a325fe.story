Whilst many Americans are dreaming of a white Christmas, they probably didn’t want it like this.

Though the vicious blizzard that swept through the Great Plains and caused fatal road accidents Monday is losing steam, it's left behind quite a mess, making holiday travel difficult or impossible for thousands of people in five states.

Major thoroughfares in the Oklahoma panhandle are still closed, and snowdrifts – which have reached up to ten feet in Colorado – still prove dangerous. The snow dumped as much as fifteen inches of snow on some areas across the five-state region.

At least 40 people were snowed into the 
Longhorn Motel in Boise City, Oklahoma, where violently blowing snow 
left drifts as high as three feet.

‘Some people cannot even get out of their hoses,’ hotel manager Pedro 
Segovia told the Associated Press. ‘There is too much snow. It was 
blowing. It’s real bad.’

Fierce winds and snow that caused 
fatal road accidents and shut highways in five states are crawling 
deeper into the Great Plains, with forecasters warning pre-holiday 
travel could be impossible there.

Schools in Manhattan, Kansas, cancelled 
classes for the day as they anticipated several inches of snow -  and snow 
drifts of up to 10ft high were reported in southeast Colorado by authorities.

Hotels were filling up quickly along 
major roads from New Mexico to Kansas, and nearly 100 rescue calls came 
in from motorists in Texas as blizzard conditions forced closed part of a
major route.

About 10 inches of snow had fallen in
western Kansas before dawn on Tuesday, and several more inches were 
expected. ‘We're talking about whiteout conditions,’ meteorologist Marc 
Russell said.

The
storm was blamed for at least eleven deaths. Four people were killed 
when their vehicle collided with a pickup truck in part of eastern New 
Mexico on Monday where blizzard-like conditions are rare.

Yesterday:
It was a rainy night for New York and Pennsylvania; snow left New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma

Today: The weather system has dumped heavy rains on the Great Lakes region. The system is headed towards the East coast, promising a soggier Christmas than many had hoped. Parts of the Great Plains still has residual icy showers

The Southeast will also experience some thunderstorms.

A storm starting in British Columbia could bring snow to the northeast and New England, while DC and many across the nation will most likely have a wet, not white, Christmas.

Meanwhile a prison guard and inmate died when a jail van crashed along an icy Colorado roadway. The other five deaths came in Texas after a plane crash was blamed on the conditions (see box).

The late-autumn snowstorm was turning
roads to ice and reducing visibility to zero. The conditions put state 
road crews on alert and had motorists taking refuge and early exits off 
major roads.

In northern New
Mexico, snow and ice shut roads from Raton to the Texas and Oklahoma 
borders 90 miles away. Hotels in Clayton, New Mexico, close to where the
three states touch, were nearly full.

Linda
Pape, general manager of the Clayton Super 8 motel said it was packed 
with unhappy skiers who had been headed to lodges in Colorado and 
elsewhere in New Mexico.

Limited visibility: Traffic makes its way down Highway 64 as snow and sleet falls on Monday in Guymon, Oklahoma. The wintry weather was preceded by more than a half-inch of rain and a blizzard warning is in effect

Stuck: Longmont police respond to three separate weather-related accidents as snow falls on Colorado Highway 66 in Longmont, Colorado, on Monday. A major storm is bringing blizzard conditions to the U.S.

‘They lost a day or two of skiing, and they had budgeted an amount of money they were going to spend,’ she said. ‘Now they have to spend more staying somewhere else.’

Ms Pape said it's not uncommon for skiers
to get stuck in Clayton during the winter, and she keeps two freezers 
and a refrigerator stocked in case roads are closed.

'They lost a day or two of skiing, and they had budgeted an amount of money they were going to spend. Now they have to spend more staying somewhere else. They are not happy, but we are not letting them go hungry'

‘They are not happy, but we are not letting them go hungry,’ she said. Many of the areas hit on Monday enjoyed relatively balmy 60F temperatures just 24 hours earlier.

The storm came after much of the country had a relatively mild fall. With the exception of the October snowstorm blamed for 29 deaths on the East Coast, there has been little rain or snow.

The snow moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle early on Monday, and 1.5 inches accumulated in about an hour, said Vicki Roberts, who owns the Black Mesa Bed and Breakfast in Kenton.

Her inn sits at the base of the 4,973ft-tall Black Mesa, the highest point in Oklahoma. Looking out her window, she couldn't see it.

Wreckage: The crash site of a single-engine plane is seen on Monday in Brazos County, Texas. The crash killed five people, including two children. The flight originated in Atlanta and was headed for Waco, Texas

‘I have a mail route and I'm not going,’ Ms Roberts said. ‘You just don't get out in this.

A single-engine plane crashed in Texas on Monday night, killing the pilot, his wife and two children - as well as his brother.

The Piper Saratoga aircraft crashed in a farming and ranching community in Brazos County after it went into bad weather.

The flight originated in Atlanta, Georgia, stopped in Jackson, Mississipi, and was headed for Waco, Texas, when it crashed.

Authorities identified the victims as Michael  Butler, 33; his wife Kelly, 34; their daughter Brooke, 14; and son Braden, age 2.

The family was from Stockbridge, Georgia. Also killed was the pilot's brother, David Butler, 37, of Mount Clam, Texas.

' We'll be socked in here. If we lose power, we'll just read a book in front of the fireplace.’

Travel throughout the region was difficult. New Mexico shut down a portion of Interstate 25, the major route heading northeast of Santa Fe into Colorado.

Clayton police dispatcher Cindy Blackwell said her phones were ‘ringing off the hook’ with calls from numerous motorists stuck on rural roads.

Bill Cook, who works at the Best Western in Clayton, said he hadn't seen such a storm since the 1970s, when cattle had to be airlifted with helicopters and the National Guard helped out.

His hotel was packed Monday with people ‘happy they have a room,’ and some of the children were playing outside in the snow.

Keith Barras, the owner of the Eklund Hotel, a landmark in Clayton since the 1890s, said guests were happily milling around the lobby and he expected to be full by nightfall.

Batten down the hatches: The snow will move north and east by Wednesday to affect more areas

‘We have lots of board games, one of our customers has a guitar, we have a piano, so there'll be a party tonight,’ Mr Barras said.

But farmers said the storm was bringing much needed moisture from rain and snow to areas of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas parched by a drought that started in the summer of 2010.

Virginia Kepley, 73, spent Monday afternoon baking pumpkin bread to give as Christmas gifts while snow fell on her farm near Ulysses, Kan.

‘I decided to try to get as much done today in case the electricity goes off and I can't make it tomorrow,’ she said.

Ms Kepley was grateful for the snow after some of her family's wheat never got enough moisture to sprout last season. A new crop had been planted in the fall for harvest next summer.

‘It is wonderful for the wheat,’ Ms Kepley said. ‘At least we have wheat we can see this year.'
