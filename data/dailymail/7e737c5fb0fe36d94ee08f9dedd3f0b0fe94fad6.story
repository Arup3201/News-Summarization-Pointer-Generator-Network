Most middle-aged men worry about holding on to their thinning hair, but Adrian Chiles has the opposite problem.

The 46-year-old faced an internet backlash this week when he presented the England international friendly with a mop top hairstyle.

Sports fans aren’t known for their interest in hair and beauty, but the subject set Twitter alight with criticism during the  ITV1 coverage on Wednesday evening.

Nice hair: Adrian Chiles faced an internet backlash when he presented the England friendly with a mop top

Fellow sports presenter Gabby Logan tweeted: ‘Adrian Chiles has more than his fair share of hair tonight.’

One bemused football fan even went as far as to insist the former BBC One Show star had the ‘worst hair do in the business.’

Images of the star with his hair dubbed into the shape of a rat began to trend on the social media site – with hundreds of followers sharing the image with their friends.

Sharing the image one viewer said: ‘Is it just me or does Adrian Chiles hair resemble some kind of small furry creature?’

More than his fair share: Gabby Logan later posted this rather more complimentary message on Twitter

Also questioning on social media, one fan ‏said: ‘Learnt one thing whilst watching England...Adrian Chiles needs a haircut!! Helmet hair.’

Another said: ‘ Adrian Chiles’ hair is classic Star Trek baddy alien hair #HarshButFair Is that really hair or is he wearing a hat? Lego mans hair.’

Mr Chiles is currently working as the chief presenter for ITV Sport presenting football coverage. He also works as a presenter on BBC Radio 5 Live.
