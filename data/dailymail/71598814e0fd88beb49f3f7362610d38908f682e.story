Nurse Kaci Hickox insists that she is not under quarantine and has said she is seeking time to decompress at an undisclosed location in Maine

The nurse who was quarantined at a New Jersey hospital despite exhibiting no Ebola symptoms after arriving from West Africa, won't follow the quarantine imposed by Maine officials, her attorney said on Tuesday night.

Kaci Hickox insists that she is not under quarantine and has said she is seeking time to decompress at an undisclosed location in the state.

'Going forward she does not intend to abide by the quarantine imposed by Maine officials because she is not a risk to others,' her attorney Steven Hyman said.

'She is asymptomatic and under all the protocols cannot be deemed a medical risk of being contagious to anyone.'

Hickox will abide by all the self-monitoring requirements of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Maine, Hyman said.

Health officials in the state said on Tuesday that they're prepared to legally enforce the state's ‘voluntary’ quarantine on health care workers who've treated Ebola patients.

Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew declined during a news conference to comment specifically on the case of the nurse.

But Mayhew said her department and the attorney general's office were prepared to take legal steps to enforce a quarantine if someone declines to cooperate.

'We do not want to have to legally enforce in-home quarantine,' she said. 'We're confident that selfless health workers who were brave enough to care for Ebola patients in a foreign country will be willing to take reasonable steps to protect residents of their own country. 

'However we are willing to pursue legal authority if necessary to ensure risk is minimized for Mainers.'

In Maine, a quarantine comes into play only when people have had contact with Ebola patients; others who've been to the three countries will be monitored, officials said.

Hickox, who volunteered in Africa with Doctors Without Borders, was the first person forced into New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for people arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport from three West African countries.

Hickox, who spent the weekend in a quarantine tent, said she never had Ebola symptoms and tested negative in a preliminary evaluation.

Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have been sharply criticized for ordering mandatory quarantines.

President Obama seemed to condemn Christie in a speech on Tuesday.

'America in the end is not defined by fear – that's not who we are,' the president said, calling for 'new monitoring and movement guidance that is sensible.'

'America is defined by possibility, and when we see a problem, and we see a challenge, then we fix it. We don't just react based on our fears.'

Obama did not mention Christie by name, but it was clear who the president was addressing as he spoke on the South Lawn of the White House.  

On Monday, Hickox traveled from New Jersey to Maine, where her boyfriend is a senior nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent.

Her boyfriend opted to leave Fort Kent to spend time with her during the quarantine period, officials said Tuesday.

If Hickox were to show Ebola symptoms, then her boyfriend and any others who had contact with her also would be subject to quarantine, Mayhew said.
