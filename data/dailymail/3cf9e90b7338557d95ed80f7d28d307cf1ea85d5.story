Pupils as young as six were taught to treat Western women as 'white prostitutes' by a school at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' Islamist plot.

The shocking 
disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims Muslim 
radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of Birmingham schools.

A leaked copy of one 
report says teachers at Oldknow Academy told school inspectors they were
 alarmed by the use of terms such as ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ 
in school assemblies, and that non-Muslim teachers were banned from 
being present.

A report by the Education 
Funding Agency says: ‘We were told by teachers that non-Muslim teaching 
staff are no longer allowed to take Friday assemblies. In separate 
interviews, staff told us that in Friday assemblies, occasionally words 
have been used such as “white prostitute” and  “hellfire” which they 
felt were inappropriate for young children.’

Well-placed
 sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the term ‘white prostitute’ 
was used to suggest to pupils that Muslim women were moral but 
non-Muslim women were not.

Oldknow
 Academy, which has around 600 pupils, is said to have been the subject 
of a gradual takeover by extremists, who allegedly pushed out head 
teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the
 school.

Officially, Mrs Kondal is on sick leave, and she refused to discuss the matter with The Mail on Sunday.

She was among four of the school’s six senior managers who have left in recent months.

It
 is also claimed that in one assembly, just before Christmas last year, a
 senior teacher led ‘an anti-Christian’ chant. He allegedly shouted at 
the pupils ‘Do we believe in Christmas?’, to which the pupils replied 
collectively ‘No we don’t.’

The senior teacher is said to have made other ‘anti-Christian comments’ at the same assembly. 

Officials
 from education watchdog Ofsted, who have also studied the ‘Trojan 
Horse’ claims, investigated the ‘anti-Christmas’ chant incident, but 
found no evidence of it.

However,
 a source said that teachers and pupils at Oldknow have referred to 
Christians as ‘kaffirs’, a derogatory Arabic term meaning infidels.

The
 source said that as part of the Islamic takeover, urinals from the 
boy’s toilets were removed, in accordance with Muslim custom which 
frowns on those who stand up to urinate.

More
 than 95 per cent of Oldknow’s pupils are Muslim. It holds Islamic 
prayers every Friday, teaches Arabic and organises trips to Mecca.

Last
 week, Oldknow teacher, Samir Rauf defended the school, accusing Ofsted 
inspectors of ‘having an agenda’. He said he had seen no evidence of an 
extremist takeover, and denied Christmas had been banned.

In
 February, a senior Oldknow teacher is said to have posted a message on 
social media urging all Muslims to disown those who gave up their faith.

He said: ‘Do not love the one who does not love Allah. If they can leave Allah, they will leave you.’

Only
 a year ago, an Ofsted inspection of Oldknow found it ‘outstanding’ in 
all areas, including in promoting multi-racial harmony.

It is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching.

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove is expected to put five schools into special 
measures when the reports are published tomorrow. He will make a Commons
 statement as head teachers hold a press conference in Birmingham to 
speak publicly for the first time.

The five schools 
include Oldknow, and secondary schools Park View and Golden Hillock. The
 running and teaching at all three have been described as ‘inadequate.’

According to a leaked report, teachers at the school lead chants criticising Christmas

Ofsted
 inspectors criticise poor teaching at Golden Hillock, and in their 
report say: ‘Too little is done to keep students safe from the risks 
associated with extremist views.’

The
 school, which has just under 900 pupils, is said to have been taken 
over by extremists with an ‘Islamising agenda.’ Former head teacher 
Matthew Scarrott reportedly left because he opposed the change.

Ofsted
 say Golden Hillock did not provide adequate sex education and that some
 female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘intimidating’.

The
 school did little to ‘mitigate against cultural isolation,’ leaving 
students ‘vulnerable to the risk  of marginalisation from wider British 
society and the associated risks, which could include radicalisation’.

However
 Mohammed Shafique, chairman of governors at Golden Hillock, said he 
would challenge any move to put the school into special measures: 
‘Ofsted’s views are completely unfounded, we do not practise 
isolationism or segregation. They did not check the reality on the 
ground. They were listening to comments Michael Gove made.’

At
 Park View, it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil, 
given lists of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them and 
that staff preach ‘mind-blowing’ anti-Western propaganda in assemblies.
