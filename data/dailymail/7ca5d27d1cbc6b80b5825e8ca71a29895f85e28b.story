It all began three weeks ago, when several hundred pro-democracy students stormed the Hong Kong government headquarters demanding a free and fair vote in the upcoming elections.

Since then the so-called Umbrella Revolution - named after the umbrellas demonstrators have been using to defend themselves against police pepper spray - has spiralled out of control, with tens of thousands of students engaged in violent running battles with officers.

Tonight has proved no different, as the activists' ranks have swollen once more. While some are digging in for the long-haul in city's finance district, where main thoroughfares remain closed, others have gone on the offensive to recapture old protest zones from the police.

Despite pictures emerging of demonstrators bloodied after battles with police armed in riot gear with truncheons and shields, the sheer weight of numbers has allowed the pro-democracy movement to overwhelm police lines in areas such as Mong Kok, which the activists recaptured on Friday.

Officers have been using surprise pre-dawn raids to scatter demonstrators that have set up smaller fringe camps away from Admiralty, where the main protest is taking place. But as quickly as they tear down the camps, the demonstrators move back in.

In fact, rather than break their will, the violence being used against the demonstrators has drawn more to their cause. The police tactic of using tear-gas brought tens of thousands out on to the streets initially, and a video of cops beating a handcuffed protester weeks later rallied yet more to the cause.

It appears - for the moment at least - that the police have no idea how to deal with the worst unrest seen in Hong Kong in the last decade. But equally they cannot back down, as the Chinese leadership will not allow it. 

Their splintered efforts have not been helped by the city's highly unpopular leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying - known as CY - who angered protesters when he abruptly called off scheduled talks last week, saying a constructive outcome was unlikely. He then revived the proposal for talks a week later, amid soaring tensions and public anger.

Even if the talks materialize, they are unlikely to resolve the deadlock. Leung has repeatedly said that Beijing will not give in to the students' demand to open up nominations for the city's inaugural direct election in 2017, and he has little wiggle room to offer compromises.

'At this stage, Beijing is running the show. Beijing is dictating ways and means that it hopes the Hong Kong government will take to defuse the crisis,' a source said.

The only crumb of comfort the authorities can take from recent events is that, as the demonstrations drag out, the groups within the protest camps have become divided as to their aims and means of achieving them.

From the start, a key feature of the protests has been their amorphous and organic nature. Three groups at the heart of the movement have rallied the crowds and led efforts to negotiate protesters' demands with the government, but there's no central leadership. 

Many taking part say the groups, headed by students and a law professor, do not represent them. That spontaneity appealed to many supporters, but it's become clear that the movement is unraveling at the edges and losing its unity of purpose.

As the standoff drags on, factions of more radical protesters are breaking off from the peaceful sit-ins at the main protest zone. For several nights in a row, large, rowdy crowds have stepped up their tactics to gain control of streets, scuffling with riot police. 

Others responded to calls on social media for flash mobs and what police condemned as 'guerrilla tactics,' sporadically rushing into traffic to dump barriers in the road before running away.

Most protesters say they want the movement to stay peaceful, and some are frustrated by the divisions among activists.

While many things remain uncertain about the increasingly violent standoff between protesters and police, one thing remains certain: this will not be over anytime soon.
