A boxer who starred on TV bailiff show Repo Man has been spared jail after he scrawled abusive graffiti on a cancer victim’s home - falsely branding him a paedophile.

Yob Reece Jones - known as 'Rampage' in the ring - was paid by another man to plaster the £275,000 home of Kenneth and Jayne Mair with false allegations as part of an ongoing feud.

The 26-year-old starred in the Channel 4 documentary ‘Repo Man’ - a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the shadowy world of debt collectors and bailiffs.

Mr Mair, who lives with his wife and daughters, Alex, 24, and Natasha, 21, said he was 'disgusted' with the sentence - which he branded 'too soft'.

Two million viewers tuned into the controversial Channel 4 show, which saw Jones and his team repossess cars and other property from debtors.

Stafford Crown Court heard Jones used bitumen to write ‘nonce’ and ‘sex pest’ on the walls of Mr and Mrs Mair’s home in Cannock, Staffs, on April 24 last year.

Tattooed Jones pleaded guilty to criminal damage today and was given a 16-month sentence, suspended for two years.

He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work, and told to pay Mr Mair, who is battling liver and bowel cancer, £400 compensation.

Judge Recorder Rachel Brand said the damage to Mr Mair's £275,000 family home in Cannock, Staffs, was 'appalling'

Jones, 26, told the court he carried out the graffiti attack so another man would write off a £1,000 debt

Dad-of-one Jones, of Uttoxeter, Staffs, was also banned from approaching Mr and Mrs Mair’s home.

Judge Recorder Rachel Brand told Reece he was a 'fool' for carrying out the attack on behalf of another man, who he refused to name in court.

She said: 'Someone else used you. Now you are here on your own to pay the penalty. What a fool.

'What you did to this man’s home was appalling, creeping up in the dead of night, daubing insults which, come daylight, would have been seen by anyone passing by.

'You had no grievance with this man, in effect being paid to do it. You were told the debt of £1,000 you owed would be wiped out.'

The court heard Mr Mair, 59, a retired development manager, and his 56-year-old wife, a theatre manager, had been the victims of a four-year campaign of harassment.

It accumulated in the graffiti attack on their property and Jones was caught after he left gloves containing his DNA at the scene.

The court heard Jones refused to reveal the identity of the other man involved.

Prosecutor Nick Burn said: 'During the police investigation, the defendant maintained no comment.

He added: 'Of particular impact were the words used.

'It is quite plain that there is no substance whatsoever to the assertion that the victim is in any way responsible for any crime or misbehaviour.'

Victim Mr Mair hit out at the suspended sentence Jones received, insisting it was 'too soft'

Prosecutors told the court the words daubed on the house had no grounding and the victim bore no responsibility

Cancer sufferer Mr Mair said he had to get his neighbours to help him clean up the mess

Rashad Mohammed, defending, said Jones did voluntary work teaching youngsters to box.

He said: 'This defendant has no grievance with him...someone else has asked him to do their dirty work for them.'

Speaking after the case, Mr Mair said: 'I am not a well man and my neighbours helped me clean off the graffiti.

'The grafitti, which was in two-foot high letters said ‘nonce’ and ‘sex pest’. All these claims are false, of course.

'When I found out what Reece Jones’ sentence was I had finished a session of chemotherapy and I was knocked for six.

'He (Jones) got nothing. He has got away with attacking my home.

'I am disgusted the sentence was so soft - what kind of message does that send out to these bullies?'
