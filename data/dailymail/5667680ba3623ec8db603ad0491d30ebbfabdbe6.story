A champion strongman has revealed the incredible diet that helped claim a national strength title – and it includes downing 18 pints of milk a day.

Tom Price, 23, stuffs himself with 10,000 calories every day - four times the recommended amount for a man - to fuel his gruelling training regime.

Weighing in at a huge 20st, the 6ft 3ins man eats 12 Weetabix for breakfast washed down with up to ten litres of high-calorie gold-top milk.

After his Weetabix, Mr Price has four bowls of porridge mixed with protein powder and blended ice cream.

The strongman, from the Kingswood area of Bristol, said: ‘I can eat quite quickly, so eating breakfast doesn’t take much time at all.

‘But I would struggle to eat 10,000 calories worth of solid food a day, so that’s why I drink all the milk.

‘I get a lot of my calories from milk - it gives me the energy I need to compete.’

Mr Price, who only began competing in strongman competitions last year, has already been crowned England’s Strongest Man under 23.

He is well on his way to following in the footsteps of his heroes - five-time World’s Strongest Man Mariusz Pudzianowski, and legendary English strongman Geoff Capes.

Breakfast

12 Weetabix washed down with up to ten litres of high-calorie gold-top milk. This is followed by four bowls of porridge mixed with protein powder and blended ice cream.Lunch:

Mr Price eats two lunches each day. A typical example of one of them would be a family-size portion of chicken fajitas.Dinner:

A high-calorie, high-protein meal such as a 12oz steak with chips.Snacks

Plates of pasta and high-protein snacks.

After his big breakfast, Mr Price eats another two giant meals every day during training, including a typical lunch of a family-sized portion of chicken fajitas.

At night, he tucks into giant portions of high-protein and high-carbohydrate meals, such as a 12oz steak and chips.

He also manages to fit in snacks of pasta and protein between meals, just to boost his energy levels.

On top of his job as a computer engineer, Mr Price manages to fit in five three-hour training sessions a week.

He said: ‘I’m quite lean and have low body fat, so I need to keep myself fuelled up, because I don’t have a big bellyful of fat in reserve.

‘I have always liked milk - even when I was a kid.

‘It’s my favourite drink by far. I used to drink full fat milk, but I switched to gold-top for the extra calories.

‘I buy food in bulk, so I only spend about £40-50 a week.’

He added: ‘I have always been pretty big and enjoyed working out in the gym so I thought I would give it a go.

‘It is very tough but I enjoy it because there is always a goal to aim for at the end and I love competing.

‘My first competition was Bristol’s Strongest last year, when I came second.

‘Then I won Trojan’s Strongest Man, which covered the whole South West, at The Robins pub in Ashton last month.’

Mr Price can already deadlift 320kg - the equivalent of four people.

He can also bench press 225kg, and can squat 280kg - the weight of a fully-grown male Siberian tiger.
