An elderly woman was arrested on suspicion of murder this morning after the body of a man in his 70s was found in a country park.

Paramedics found the man after they were called to the car park of the Seven Sisters Country Park in Sussex in the early hours of this morning.Â 

Police, who said that the woman, who is in her 70s, was taken to hospital suffering from 'injuries', are examining several theories including the possibility of a failed suicide pact.

It is believed that the woman raised the alarm herself just before 2.30am today, calling emergency services to the remote spot on the edge of the Friston Forest, outside Seaford.

Detectives said the couple were known to each other but they would not confirm that they were husband and wife.

A Sussex Police spokesman said that the man died in the country park, which includes the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs and leads to Beachy Head, although they stressed the man was found within the park rather than near the steep cliffs.

Detective Sergeant Dave Tye said: 'To help us with our investigations we have closed a section of the Seven Sisters Country Park, along with the car park at Exceat.'

A blue coloured police forensic tent could be seen erected at the scene of where the body was found.

Police are in the process of contacting the man's next of kin, and said they believed the couple were not from Sussex but from elsewhere in the south-east of England.

A spokesman for the South East Coast Ambulance Service said: 'We were called to just off the A259, at the Exceat car park.

'Sadly one man aged in his 70s was pronounced dead at the scene.

'We also treated a woman aged in her 70s. She was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital, in Brighton, for further treatment.'

He confirmed the woman had sustained physical injuries.

The Seven Sisters Country Park covers nearly 700 acres of chalk cliffs, river valley and open chalk grassland.

Managed by East Sussex County Council, it is popular with walkers, birdwatchers, cyclists and canoeists.
