Nazi past: A German broadcaster has dropped a detective series after its actor Horst Tappert (pictured collecting his Bambi for '98 National Film' award) was revealed as a former member of the SS

A German broadcaster has dropped repeat showings of a detective series after it emerged its late star had served in Hitler's SS.

Horst Tappert, who played Derrick in the show of the same name, had kept his military past a secret up until his death in 2008.

But last month archives revealed he had served in the Totenkopf panzer division, one of the most ruthless units of the Nazi paramilitary force.

ZDF, the German public broadcaster, said it was 'shocked and troubled' by the revelation.

A spokesman told the AFP news agency: 'We have no plans to broadcast any more reruns. We will not honour an actor who has lied over his past'.

According to the archives, Tappert was a 19-year-old panzer grenadier when he was wounded on the Eastern Front in 1943.

His Totenkopf (German for 'death's 
head') panzer division had the motto 'My Honour is Loyalty' and became 
one of the most feared units of the Waffen SS - the fighting arm of the 
SS.

Tappert only said of his war record that he had served as a medic.

Bavaria's interior ministry is 
considering stripping the actor of an honorary chief police inspector 
title awarded to him in 1980, according to theÂ BBC which cited German media reports.

More than 280 episodes of Derrick were made between 1974 and 1998.

Set in Munich with the distinctive baggy-eyed detective in the lead role, the series was watched by generations of Germans and was also extremely popular in Russia, China and South Africa.

In 2006, famous German novelist Guenther Grass caused dismay after revealing he had served as a member of the Waffen SS.
