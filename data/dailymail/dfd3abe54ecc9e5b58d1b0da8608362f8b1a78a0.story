The bone-crunching, bloody world of rugby might seem an unusual place to find a shining example of ‘new man’.

But according to England star Ben Foden, his years on the pitch have given him the confidence to be hands-on with raising his children – especially when it comes to changing nappies.

Now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share time off work after having a child.

Family man: Ben Foden on the pitch with his wife Una and their daughter Aoife last year. Now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share their parental leave

Something which should be no problem for the £200,000-a-year Northampton Saints player and his pop star wife Una, whose girl band The Saturdays are said to be worth more than £2.5million.

The Government drive sees the fullback call on other fathers to take more time off to ensure their wives’ earning potential isn’t hit by having a child.

A law allowing parents to split time off after having a baby comes into force on April 5. It will mean that after an initial fortnight, they will be able to share the allowance of 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay. 

At the moment, men can take only two weeks off.

Ben and Una - pictured when she was pregnant with Aoife in 2011 - are currently expecting their second child, they have one two year old daughter Aoife already 

Foden, 29, and his 33-year-old wife have a two-year-old daughter, Aoife, and are expecting a son next month.

The player expects some mocking for his role in the Government drive but believes rugby’s rough and tumble world has made him a better father. He said: ‘There will be some changing room banter. It’s part and parcel of being a rugby player.

‘But to be honest, this campaign is making me look a lot cooler than some other stuff. There are six or seven young dads in the team and we take it seriously. Being rugby players we are used to sweat, spit, blood and rolling around in the mud, so no one has a problem about getting their hands dirty changing nappies.

‘I do everything, all the nappy changing and feeding. I was there for Aoife’s first words and her first steps.’ Foden said the ‘new man’ approach is becoming increasingly common, even in the traditionally macho world of rugby.

He added: ‘In this day and age, women can just as easily be the main breadwinner as men. Why should they have to give up their careers when they have children?’ Foden is already in a situation where his wife earns more than he does.

The five members of The Saturdays have had 13 top ten singles and were reported in 2012 to be collectively worth £2.6million.

Exact figures for her earnings and wealth are not known but her schedule will vary on whether she is recording and touring with The Saturdays or working on a separate project or campaign.

Besides the £200,000 a year that Foden is thought to earn from his club, for which he will train for five to six hours a day, he was reported in 2013 to earn £15,000 for each Six Nations match with England.

Nick Clegg will this week encourage fathers to take advantage of the option to split leave. But a survey of 2,000 men and women by employment website Glassdoor found three-quarters of men opposed the change, fearing loss of status and earning power.
