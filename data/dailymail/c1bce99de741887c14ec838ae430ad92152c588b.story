Having been flushed with the success of seeing Hull City reach the FA Cup final, a local bathroom maker has decided to commemorate the occasion with none other than... a limited edition 'Steve Bruce Tigers Toilet Seat'.

Rather than being a poor excuse for toilet humour, Ideal Standard has created a toilet seat featuring the club's tiger stripes on one side - which could still cause some fans an upset stomach after owner Assem Allam's derided attempts to rebrand the club.

But, perhaps even more concerning, is the image of Steve Bruce that greets the user once the lid has been lifted, supposedly a tribute to the first manager to lead Hull to a FA Cup final.

Toilet humour! Ideal Standard's toilet seat features the Tigers' stripes and Steve Bruce under the lid!

However, should the Tigers' attempts to upset overwhelming favourites Arsenal fail when the two sides meet at Wembley on Saturday, the aim of any disgruntled supporters after the game cannot be guaranteed.

Bruce's team talk will have been made easier after an image that appeared to show Arsenal's victory bus, emblazoned with the words 'Arsenal, The FA Cup Winners 2014' was leaked - while traffic notices around north London suggest making way for a victory parade on Sunday.

Not to be outdone, Hull have confirmed they would be staging their own celebrations, although at least the statement was less self assured: 'Should our historic appearance in the FA Cup final next weekend result in theTigers lifting the iconic trophy, a victory parade through the streets of Hull will take place on Sunday 18 May.

'The parade will start at the KC Stadium and take in many areas of Hull including Anlaby Road, the city centre, Holderness Road, Sutton Road, Greenwood Avenue, Hall Road, County Road, Pickering Road and Hessie.'

Causing a stink! Steve Bruce's reward for taking Hull to their first FA Cup final is his image in a toilet seat

Ideal Standard, the UK's leading bathroom
 manufacturer, employs around 300 people in Hull and has been making 
their products there since 1936.

Keith Boad, managing director, Ideal Standard UK, said: 'We are very proud of our hometown football team, Hull City AFC and wanted to do something to mark their achievement and let them know everyone at Ideal Standard will be supporting them in the final.

'This is certainly something a little bit fun and a little bit different, but because of our heritage and our innovative designers, we understand bathrooms better than anyone else and know that people want personalised solutions for their bathrooms at home.

'Let’s just hope this WC seat lid isn’t the only thing Steve Bruce will be lifting up this weekend – and we are certainly hoping that Hull win, rather than loos!'
