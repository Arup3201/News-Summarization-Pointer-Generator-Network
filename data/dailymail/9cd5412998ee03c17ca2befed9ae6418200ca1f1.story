It was an accolade previously held by the Duchess of Cambridge. But today, as Kim Sears cheered Andy Murray to fourth round victory at the Australian Open showcasing yet another affordable gem, it was clear she has earned the title Queen of the High Street. 

Despite having her own successful company painting animal portraits - not to mention a boyfriend worth millions - Kim always looks to the high street for her courtside outfits.

But with her glossy hair, expensive highlights and that darn Mulberry bag we've been coveting for over a year now, she makes absolute bargain High Street buys look anything but.

Kim has managed to keep her trusty Mulberry Willow handbag looking immaculate over the course of a year - it's a fashion conundrum. Does she every put it down?

Her £1,350 Mulberry Willow has proved to be a real favourite. She has been carrying it since last year and her fondness shows no sign of abating (we're wondering how she has kept it looking so new - does she have  multiple, like the Queen and her Launer bags, or Kate and her nude L.K.Bennett pumps? It's a conundrum we would love to solve: answers in the comments section below).

Kim turned up at the Rod Laver stadium to support her boyfriend of eight years as he took on French hope Stéphane Robert.

He may have beat the Frenchman in straight sets, but it was no easy ride - Murray fought hard to win, taking him through to the quarter final - and another step closer to picking up the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the first time.

Kim has attended all of Andy's matches in Australia so far - but has still had time to work on her tan... yes, we are a little bit envious

Murray will next face the winner of the Federer Vs Tsonga match, which is underway now.

And while it is often pointed out that Kim Sears is a loyal girlfriend to Murray, it is clear from the tennis ace's comments that the two are very much a team.

Murray recently praised Miss Sears’s ability to gauge when he needs company and 
when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship. 

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’

And he says that Kim helps him from a business perspective too.

After banking nearly £20million in 
prize money, Murray admits to feeling ‘vulnerable’ when bombarded by 
people wanting to do deals, so he relies on ‘savvy’ Miss Sears to spot 
those trying to leech on to him.

KIM'S VERY VISCERAL REACTIONS TO ANDY'S TOUGH 4TH ROUND GAME...

...tense yet hopeful

Jubilant!
