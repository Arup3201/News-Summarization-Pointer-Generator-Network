A mother-of-two was shot dead by her estranged boyfriend in an apparent murder-suicide, police have said.

Erin Nicole Cully, 26, was found at a property in Morning View, Kentucky, just two weeks after telling friends she was 'leaving the past behind'.

The body of her ex-partner Jason Stephens, 28, was also found at the house.

Tragedy: Erin Nicole Cully is believed to have been shot dead by her estranged boyfriend Jason Stephens in a murder-suicide at a property in Morning View in Kentucky

Detectives believe he shot Cully with a handgun before turning the weapon on himself.

The children, both under five, were not there at the time.

Stephens had moved out of the home he shared with Cully and their children about a year ago, but it is not clear why, according to WCPO Cincinnati.

On New Year's Day, Cully posted a upbeat message on her Facebook page saying: 'Cheers to a new year! Up and at it early this morning for work feeling great!!

'Leaving the past behind me and working on the future for me and my babies!'

No reports of domestic violence: Stephens had moved out of the home he shared with Cully and their children about a year ago, but it is not clear why

Officers were called to the property in Cruise Creek Road by Stephens' father at around 6pm on Tuesday when he failed to get in contact of his son.

His family had noticed that his firearm was missing.

Police say Stephens did not have criminal record and Cully had never filed a report against him, but they are planning to ask friends and family if they were aware of any history of domestic violence.

The children are being looked after by relatives.
