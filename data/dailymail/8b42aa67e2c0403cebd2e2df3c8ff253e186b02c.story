At least two people have been killed and dozens injured after a coach carrying more than 50 passengers collided with a height restriction barrier in Tianjin municipality, China today. 

Without explanation, the 59-seater vehicle had driven into an ordinary bus lane, which has a height restriction of 2.8 metres.

After crashing at speed, the top of the bus was virtually ripped off as the black and yellow barrier tore through the coach's metal exterior.
