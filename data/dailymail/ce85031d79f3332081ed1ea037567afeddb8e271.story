Animal control officers responding to a call about a skunk near a frat house found a helpless critter with a beer can stuck on its head.

The Cincinnati Inquirer reports that the first call that Oxford police received Sunday morning was for a skunk stuck in a beer can near the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. 

Animal control officers managed to free the drunk skunk, but not before snapping police snapped a picture.

'They said the poor thing was banging, couldn't see where he was going. So he was running into shrubs,' Sgt John Varley told the Inquirer.

According to him, animal control successfully got the can off the skunk's head without being sprayed.

Varley joked the skunk was released on his own recognizance. 

The Beta Theta Pi residence is located near Miami University, just northwest of Cincinnati. 

In spite of the Miami University frat being the founding chapter, Beta Theta Pi had its national charter revoked in February due to allegations of hazing. 

Varley says police have received calls before about skunks and other wild animals before. 

This one was the first he knew of that had to be rescued from a beer can.
