David Cameron yesterday visited a refugee camp on the Syrian border as he announced that he and newly re-elected President Barack Obama will consider military options to remove dictator Bashar al Assad.

Mr Cameron said he and Mr Obama would make hastening the end of the Assad regime a priority as he was greeted by cheering young girls at the Za'atari refugee camp, which holds 20,000 of the 200,000 refugees who have fled Syria for Jordan.

Earlier he visited the border area where 500 refugees are crossing every day as the death toll from the civil war climbs towards 40,000.

Mr Cameron said: 'One of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.'

Cabinet Office officials have been 
told to examine how Britain could get around a European Union arms 
embargo on Syria to funnel weapons directly to opposition fighters.

No-fly zones imposed by RAF jets and 
direct Western air strikes have not been 'ruled out'. Those options will
be discussed when Mr Cameron chairs a meeting of the National Security 
Council on Syria next week.

Diplomatic talks are also planned 
between the UK’s special envoy to the Syrian opposition John Wilkes and 
rebel military chiefs in an effort to ‘help shape the opposition’, Mr 
Cameron said.

Mr Cameron, 
who is now closing a three-day Middle East tour, said: ‘I wanted to hear
for myself the stories of people who have been bombed and shot and 
blasted out of their homes in Syria.’

The
46-year-old criticised the ‘deeply-illegitimate and unpleasant regime 
that is raining down death and destruction on its own people’ and said 
it was ‘truly horrendous to hear those stories’.

Mr
Cameron added: ‘It just redoubles my determination that now, with a 
newly-elected American president, we have got to do more to help this 
part of the world, to help Syria achieve transition.’

The Prime Minister travelled by 
helicopter to a valley dominated by the Al Wahdah dam, which is one of 
the busiest crossing points and was recently hit by Syrian shells.

Some
of those arriving seeking shelter in Jordan had walked for up to 15 
days to reach the border, he was told by the local Jordanian military 
chief.

At the camp, he met 
some of those recently arrived in the country and was treated to a 
patriotic Syrian song by young girls at one of the classroom tents set 
up for the many children living there.

Mr Cameron told them: ‘You are not just missed in Syria. All of the world wants to help you, including my country.’

Speaking about the moves to set up talks 
with the rebel military leaders, he said: ‘There is an opportunity for 
Britain, for America, for Saudi Arabia, Jordan and like-minded allies to
come together and try to help shape the opposition, outside Syria and 
inside Syria, and try to help them achieve their goal, which is our goal
of a Syria without Assad.’

It is a recognition that events are increasingly dictated by the military figures and not the splintered political groupings, who met in Qatar this week in an effort to forge an alliance against Mr Assad.

And there are rising concerns that extremists are gaining a major influence inside opposition forces.

Mr Cameron left open again the possibility that the president could be allowed to flee the country voluntarily to a state where he could evade any criminal charges against him over the slaughter which has killed upwards of 30,000 people so far.

‘I would like to see him face justice but, frankly, any option that involves him leaving the country and a transition taking place would be good for the people right behind me here,’ he said.

At present 2.5million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance and the number of refugees in the surrounding region is predicted to almost double to 710,000 by the end of the year.

That could mean a quarter of a million alone in Jordan.

Of the new aid, £9.5million will go on blankets, soap and food for those forced out of their homes within Syria and on emergency help for the 8,300 Palestinian refugees based in Syria.

The rest - taking total UK aid to ease the crisis to £53.5million - will be used to help those who have fled to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - including safe transport from the border to the camps where they are being housed.

Mr Cameron will fly back to the UK after meeting with the King of Jordan for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel but will not arrive in time for Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons.
