The mother of murdered Milly Dowler told yesterday of the cruel moment she was given false hope that her daughter was alive.

Weeks after the 13-year-old disappeared, Sally Dowler was finally able to connect to her daughter’s mobile phone because some voicemail messages had been deleted.

She recalled how she cried out to her husband, saying: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail – Bob, she’s alive.’

Faces of anguish: Bob and Sally Dowler giving evidence side by side to the Leveson Inquiry yesterday

Murdered: Milly Dowler was abducted and killed by Levi Bellfield

Mrs Dowler, 51, and her 59-year-old 
husband were giving evidence about phone hacking to the Leveson Inquiry 
into Press standards. The couple were not told by police until this year
that their daughter’s mobile phone was hacked by the News of the World,
and that messages were deleted.

However in a surprise development last night, lawyers for the alleged hacker, private investigator Glenn Mulcaire who worked for the now defunct Sunday tabloid, denied he was responsible and claimed the police inquiry would confirm this.

Milly was abducted by nightclub bouncer Levi Bellfield near her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Her body was found six months later on Yateley Heath, Hampshire.

Addressing the inquiry yesterday, the pain and anger was evident in Mrs Dowler’s voice. She said she had rung her daughter’s mobile repeatedly after she vanished.

‘At first we were able to leave messages, and then her voicemail became full and then you rang and then you just got the recorded, “You are unable to leave messages at the moment”,’ she said.

Then, on one occasion, Mrs Dowler was able to connect to Milly’s voicemail system and in a moment of elation she heard her daughter’s voice on her recorded message.

The revelation that Milly’s mobile phone
had been hacked by the News of the World triggered public outrage, and 
was the catalyst for the establishment of the Leveson Inquiry.

Frustration: Sally Dowler said she didn't sleep for three nights after being told that Milly's phone had been hacked

Denial: Lawyers for Glenn Mulcaire last night said he was not responsible for hacking Milly Dowler's mobile

The Dowlers learned about the hacking in April as they prepared for Bellfield’s murder trial.

Mrs Dowler said: ‘As soon as I was told, literally I didn’t sleep for about three nights because you replay everything in your mind and just think, “Oh, that makes sense now”.’

The couple said they believed their own mobile phones or home phone had also been hacked.

They told the inquiry how they 
privately arranged to retrace their daughter’s steps seven weeks after 
Milly disappeared. Three days later a photograph of Mrs Dowler appeared 
in the News of the World.

She
told the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London: ‘We 
did not see anyone – they must have used a telephoto lens.

‘How
on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that day? It felt 
like such an intrusion into a really, really private grief moment.’

Mrs
Dowler said the media had helped to publicise Milly’s disappearance, 
and to appeal for information about her. But she said her family had 
been engulfed by constant attention from journalists at their home.

The
couple, who gave their evidence sitting side by side, suffered brutal 
cross-examination during Bellfield’s Old Bailey trial and their 
treatment prompted a review of the way victims’ relatives are dealt with
by courts.

They received a personal apology from News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch for the hacking. Mrs Dowler said Milly’s sister Gemma told him: ‘Use this as an opportunity to put things right in future and to have some decent standards and adhere to them.’

Mrs Dowler added: ‘It was a very tense meeting. He [Murdoch] was very sincere.’

Her husband said police had told the couple that Milly’s phone was hacked by private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who worked for the News of the World.

Mulcaire was jailed, along with the paper’s former royal editor Clive Goodman, in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on phones belonging to aides to the Royal Family.

Last night Mulcaire denied he had deleted messages on Milly’s phone. His solicitor Sarah Webb said: ‘He confirms that he did not delete messages and had no reason to do so.’

Scotland Yard has launched a criminal investigation into the claims surrounding phone hacking at the News of the World.

The Dowlers started legal action against the paper and their case was settled for £2million earlier this year, with Mr Murdoch agreeing to make a £1million personal donation to charity.

Accusations: Hugh Grant yesterday said the Mail on Sunday may have hacked his phone. The newspaper 'utterly refute' the claims

Hugh Grant made extraordinary claims yesterday that the Mail on Sunday may have hacked his phone to obtain a story about his relationship with Jemima Khan.

Last night the newspaper ‘utterly refuted’ the allegations made by the actor during two-and-a-half hours of evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.

The 51-year-old star said the story published in 2007 claimed his relationship with Jemima was on the rocks because of his ‘late-night phone calls with a plummy voiced studio executive’.

He said the story was untrue and he believed the only explanation was messages left on his phone by an executive’s assistant with a ‘plummy’ voice.

‘I would love to hear what the (Mail on Sunday’s) explanation of that is, if it wasn’t phone hacking,’ he declared.

The Mail on Sunday said the story had emanated from a freelance journalist who had been told by a source close to Jemima Khan herself and added: ‘Mr Grant’s allegations are mendacious smears driven by his hatred of the media.’

Challenged about his hacking claims against the Mail on Sunday, Mr Grant was asked by counsel for the inquiry Robert Jay QC: ‘You haven’t alleged that before, have you, in the public domain? I think the highest it can be put is frankly it’s a piece of speculation on your part, isn’t it, in relation to this question?’

During a combative appearance, the actor also accused the Daily Mail of obtaining information about the recent birth of his baby with Chinese ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong from a source at a London hospital.

The Mail unequivocally denied the allegation, saying the information came from a showbusiness source two weeks after the birth, and stressing that it spent a further two weeks seeking a response from Mr Grant’s representatives.

‘None was forthcoming and indeed we did not publish anything until Mr Grant’s publicist issued a statement describing the baby as the product of a “fleeting affair”. Throughout, the Mail behaved with total journalistic propriety.’

Mr Grant also claimed the Daily Mail had paid £125,000 to Miss Hong’s former boyfriend for pictures.

In fact, it was the Mail on Sunday which conducted an interview with him, paying a fraction of the amount mentioned by Mr Grant to an agency for the interview and photographs.

Actor Grant speaking at the Leveson Inquiry at the High Court also accused the Daily Mail of obtaining information about the recent birth of his baby with Chinese ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong from a source at a London hospital

The actor, the first celebrity to appear before Lord Justice Leveson,  described phone-hacking as ‘cowardly, bullying and shocking’. He accused tabloid journalists of wide-ranging abuses and insisted it was time to regulate the press.

During his evidence Mr Grant also made allegations against the Sun, Daily Mirror and the Daily Express – and the police, who he accused of leaking information.

The actor said that the day after Miss Hong gave birth to his child, ‘the phone calls started’.

Mr Jay said: ‘Whatever they were saying to you to get you to confirm or deny the story ... they didn’t publish the story did they? The Daily Mail did not publish the story until the news had been broken by someone else. The reason why they didn’t publish the story is because you didn’t confirm its truth.’

The inquiry heard that the Daily Mail did not run an article about the birth of Grant’s child until the story was broken by an American magazine.

Mr Grant said: ‘I think the reason that they didn’t publish it was because they would not have looked good merely on leaked information from a hospital, which is unethical.’

Mr Grant claimed he had a conversation with Paul McMullan, a former News of the World journalist, in which he suggested the Daily Mail was prepared to buy hacked material.

Mr Jay said: ‘He hasn’t given any details there of any phone-hacking involvement by the Daily Mail, has he?’ Mr Grant: ‘No.’

The actor was particularly withering in his contempt for the paparazzi who gathered outside Miss Hong’s home, accusing one photographer of deliberately driving his car at his former’s lover’s 61-year-old mother.

Earlier this year, Mr Grant said he had to go to a London hospital in the ‘middle of the night’ and that details of his ailment and treatment had appeared a couple of days later in the Sun and Daily Express.

It came five years after the Daily Mirror had run a story about Mr Grant’s visit to see a specialist at another London hospital. The article had contained details of his condition and treatment.
