John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline.

Following the fall-out from the Hungarian Grand Prix, Watson dissects the situation at Mercedes following Lewis Hamilton’s team orders snub.

Mercedes were in the worst sort of position ahead of Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix, with one driver in Nico Rosberg starting from pole position and their other driver, Lewis Hamilton, beginning the race from the pit lane. 

When both drivers are at the front of the grid, it is a relatively straightforward situation. But when you have a different scenario as they had in Germany with Hamilton at the back after his qualifying crash or in Hungary, following his fire, they are less adept at dealing with the more complex plots.

Podium finish: Hamilton managed to claim third place in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday

Niki Lauda, Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe remind me of The Three Stooges. You have got Lauda, sitting in the garage, like Alfred Neubauer, the legendary Mercedes team manager of the 1950s. The only problem being is that Lauda isn’t the team boss.

Then you have Wolff who is oilier than the Torrey Canyon, and Paddy Lowe who is a technician. His speciality is engineering. It is not making those big team decisions, and he is the one I feel sorry for.

Lauda has come out and said Hamilton was right to move over for Rosberg and this is part of the problem.

The bottom line is, whoever was the person who chose to put these three people in charge has made a major error of judgement. I refer back to the one man who should be controlling all of this, and that is Ross Brawn.

Mercedes-Benz brought in Lauda, Lowe and Wolff but they allowed the person who could have managed this situation to leave the team.

In 2012, Mercedes panicked because of poor results and internal pressures and what they offered Brawn was a job he didn’t want to continue in. He stood back from it and Mercedes brought in The Three Stooges.

Sunday’s race was there to be won. Red Bull and Daniel Ricciardo did an incredible job, but they showed up the absolute ineptness of the management team at Mercedes-Benz. Finishing only 3rd and 4th with what they had was frankly very poor.

Admittedly, the situation was a complicated one. They had one strategy for Rosberg and a different one for Hamilton, and the inclement weather and deployment of the Safety Car threw up a host of variables, but neither Lauda, Wolff or Lowe are capable of rationalising or thinking on their feet.

Quick changeover: Hamilton makes a quick pit stop during the Hungarian Grand Pix

In my opinion, consensus team management does not work. Teams benefit from one team principal based on years of experience, and who is the guy that has all of that? Brawn.

Mercedes can talk and talk about how they will review their team orders, but it doesn’t matter what they say or choose to do. It comes down to their ability to deal with any, and every occasion that might arise on the day.

In Hungary they did the best they could, but they failed.

With Hamilton, they have a driver who is psychologically fragile. Then they have another guy, in Rosberg, who is a more complete and rounded person.

Hamilton is the most naturally gifted driver out there - he isn’t the best driver, Fernando Alonso is - but in terms of his person, he is an incomplete and immature man and he needs to be babied and loved. 

The conspiracy theories are absolutely getting to him because he is beginning to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy, which does not exist but in his own mind.

In terms of performance and speed, Hamilton should win the world championship, but it isn’t just about that, it is about winning the most points and in Rosberg you have got a very smart, clever guy who is a million miles ahead of Hamilton in those areas. He is infinitely smarter and smart wins Formula One titles.

He also accepts and acknowledges that Hamilton in a one-on-one situation is going to beat him, but there is more to it than that.

Rosberg is using his strengths effectively and using that as the way to beat Hamilton whereas the Briton has only got one way of beating his team-mate and that is sheer speed.

Psychologically he can’t beat him, and there are undoubtedly a lot of mind games going on.

If I could advise Hamilton, I would tell him to dump his advisers because they are doing him no favours.

Support: Hamilton needs some more help from his family if he is going to be number one

Admiration: John Watson is a keen admirer of Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg (left)

He needs, as his father Anthony use to provide, some proper guidance. Since he was released from the shackles of McLaren, I feel he is over-compensating in his own personal life.

He needs a lower threshold of lifestyle than he currently has, but I am not 19 Management. They aren’t a motor racing management team, they are a showbiz management team and he needs somebody there to support him psychologically and to focus on the elements that are important in his career; when the going gets tough, you have to focus.

Of course it is not his fault that he suffered mechanical issues in Austrailia, Canada, Germany and in Hungary. He is a winning machine and ought to be the world champion this year. but there is something that is skewing it.

I respect and admire the way Rosberg goes about his personal life and his racing because he does it in the manner I concur with.

He got married last month, but it was a private affair with family and close friends. Indeed there were no glossy magazines there.

If I was advising Hamilton, I would tell him to stop going down the route he is appearing to go down and focus on his ability and his strengths.

The example his team-mate is giving him is the example that he should be following.
