Prancing around a new snooker table in time to music and waving a cue around might be tricky with an agonisingly painful back.

And so would scaling the heights of Sydney Harbour Bridge, building an extension, frolicking in a swimming pool, playing football and climbing trees.

But Dean Woods somehow managed all of this while claiming his back was so bad that he had to sign off work.

The benefits adviser, 44, told bosses the pain meant he was incapable of sitting at his desk.

Sprightly: Woods cavorts around his pool table while claiming he could barely walk.

He was handed £15,000 in benefits 
over around four years and demanded that the Department of Work and 
Pensions pay more than £40,000 to adapt his work station before he would
come back, even writing to his MP to accuse them of dragging their 
feet.

However, investigators raided his home after a tip-off and found damning evidence about the married father-of-three’s lifestyle.

As well as a certificate commending 
him for scaling the 400ft arch of Sydney Harbour Bridge, there was a 
picture of him near Ayers Rock, also in Australia.

On his laptop, they found a video of 
him dancing around a new pool table at his five-bedroom detached home. 
There were also pictures of him enjoying physical activities such as 
gardening and football.

Once he claimed to have been admitted
to a spinal unit for surgery when he was boarding a flight to Turkey at
Manchester Airport.

Thousands of pounds of disability 
aids which he claimed he needed were found discarded, while 30 unopened 
bottles of painkiller morphine were also seized.

The raid on his home in Freckleton, Lancashire, also uncovered a new motorbike in the garage.

Woods had told bosses at the DWP he 
could barely walk as a result of his back problems and needed help to 
get out of bed. He began claiming disability living allowance in 2007, 
declaring himself long-term sick two years later.

Managers agreed to give him four months’ leave while they spent £46,000 adapting his work station.
The department even honoured an arrangement that he could work two hours
a day while being paid as though he were working full-time.

However after his arrest last August, his story began to unravel, prosecutor Steve Scott told Preston Magistrates’ Court.

Preston Magistrates Court, where Woods was jailed for 60 days and ordered to pay back £15,000.

‘The defendant’s laptop contained 
numerous images that show him working on his extension,  gardening, 
climbing trees, playing football and throwing his children around in a 
swimming pool,’ said Mr Scott.

‘Perhaps somewhat telling is the photograph of him climbing Sydney Harbour Bridge.’

Woods, who hobbled into the dock 
using a walking stick, was jailed for 60 days after admitting failing to
notify a change in circumstances that meant he overclaimed benefits to 
the tune of £15,000 between 2007 and last year.

He has been sacked from his job at DWP offices in Preston and Blackpool and repaid the money.

He claimed he had been able to do the things in the photos because of his medication.
