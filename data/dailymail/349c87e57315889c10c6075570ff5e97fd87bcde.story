The influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania will be ‘nothing like’ the levels seen when Poland joined the European Union, the Prime Minister said yesterday.

Campaigning in Somerset ahead of tomorrow’s local elections, Mr Cameron said the huge numbers coming from Poland since it joined the EU in 2004 – put at 1.1million – was due to Britain putting no controls on immigration while other countries did.

He said: ‘When a country joins the European Union you can put in place transitional controls. You can say to that country, ‘You can’t all come here for the first seven years’.

Calming words: The UK will not have 'another Polish situation,' David Cameron, seen speaking in Bridgewater, Somerset, said regarding the possible influx of migrants from new EU nations

‘The last government, when Poland and a lot of other countries joined didn’t put those controls in place.

‘And because other European countries did we did have an enormous influx of people from Poland and those other countries.

‘This time because the transitional controls have been put in, we are not lifting the restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria alone, it’s happening right across Europe.

'So I don’t think we’ll have anything like the situation we had in the Polish situation.’

Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May have been criticised by Tory MPs for failing to comment on the issue and what the impact may be on the health service and welfare system.

Restrictions: The Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured during the Queen's speech at a State Luncheon for The President of the United Arab Emirates today, said the restrictions would apply across Europe

The Prime Minister yesterday said the immigration system was ‘one of the messes we inherited from the last Government’ who ‘didn’t know who was coming in to the country and who was going out.’

He said the numbers were ‘out of control’ with net migration - the difference between the number of people moving to Britain and those leaving - as high as 200,000 per year.

‘Over ten years, that’s two million extra people coming to live in Britain. That’s like two cities the size of Birmingham, that’s the problem we inherited. We’ve got that number down by a third, that’s progress but I want us to go further.

‘If people want to come and work, just as if British people want to go and live and work in Spain or elsewhere that’s one thing.

‘But what we can’t have is a situation where people choose to come and live in a different country because the benefits are generous or because there’s a better chance of getting a council house.

‘You can’t have that sort of benefit tourism and we’ll be taking action on that front.’

Crossing borders: The lack of restrictions on new EU member states under the last government has resulted in 1.1million Polish coming in to the UK since it joined the EU in 2004

Mr Cameron said the problem needed to be tackled across government. He said: ‘You’ve got the immigration minister thinking about immigration, but actually you need the health minister to be thinking about it, the Home Office minister, the legal affairs minister because having a tough approach on immigration should be across all those things.

‘You shouldn’t have instant access to the NHS, instant access to housing, instant access to benefits, so we’re sorting all those things out so that people who do come here will be people who want to come and work and make a contribution just as you’d be welcome if you wanted to do that in another European country.’

In a Westminster debate last week, Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the public had a right to expect ‘some kind of sensible estimate’ of numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from ministers.

The MP for Kettering said if it was the same proportion as from Poland - 1.1million out of a population of 73million since 2004, there would be 425,000 arriving from Bulgaria and Romania whose combined population is 28million. Migration Watch put it at around 50,000 a year, which also works out as 400,000 over eight years.

Even Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who was Europe Minister under Labour when mass immigration was underway, has urged the Coalition to learn from his mistakes.

He said: ‘With the benefit of hindsight I hope the mistakes that were made, and there were mistakes made because research ought to have been commissioned.

‘I hope ministers will learn from mistakes made by people like myself and others. I hope that proper research is commissioned and that is something the government has categorically refused to do.’
