Ryanair has been on the charm offensive in recent months, eager to prove it does value its customers, despite previous claims to the contrary.

Which is probably why it was so quick to jump on a claim on Twitter that a woman was being charged extra for her 'emotional baggage'.

Comedian Ryan Hand managed to confuse the airline with a tongue-in-cheek tweet stating: 'What a disgrace, there's a woman crying at the @Ryanair check in desk who's been made to pay more for emotional baggage.'

Ryan Hand could not believe it when Ryanair thought his tweet was genuine

Within two minutes of sending the tweet, Ryanair responded with the question: 'Hi Ryan, which airport is this happening at? IK'

Mr Hand was so amused by the Ryanair response that he posted a second message, telling all his followers to retweet the conversation. 

The presenter and comedian wrote: 'I can't believe Ryanair have just fallen for this joke LOL retweet!!!'

The tweet was immediately picked up by his followers and has been retweeted 1,100 times and 'favourited' 689 times.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is normally known for having a sense of humour

But it seems Ryanair's sense of humour returned quickly enough.

When asked for comment about the incident, a spokesperson said: 'As the fastest responding airline on Twitter in Europe, we pride ourselves on the speed of our customer service.

Comedian Ryan Hand posted the joke on Twitter

'We apologise for temporary technical difficulties with our sarcasm detector today.'

Airline CEO Michael O'Leary is famed for his sense of humour, often joking about at press conferences.

However, his outspoken manner, threatening all sorts of additional airline charges from a so-called fat tax to a fee for using the toilet, has seen the airline become increasingly unpopular with passengers.

The joke Twitter conversation came as an 85-year-old grandmother really was left in tears at Stansted Airport after being refused travel for trying to travel to Edinburgh using a bus pass as identification. 

Helen Trotter, from Hawick, Roxburghshire, had used the permit to prove who she was on the outbound flight, however Swissport staff at Stansted - acting as third party agents for Ryanair - advised her that this form of ID was not acceptable for the return journey.

A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'Customers flying domestically within the UK should travel with a passport or driving licence. In rare cases, where customers have no other form of ID, travel may be permitted with a bus pass.

The airline launched a charm offensive last year in a bid to win over customers

'We have asked our third party handling agent at Stansted (Swissport) to explain why this issue was not escalated and ensure it does not recur.

'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Trotter and transferred her free of charge onto the next available flight that day, however she chose not to travel.

'As a gesture of goodwill, we are offering Mrs Trotter a free return flight from Edinburgh to Stansted and hope she will fly with us once more.'
