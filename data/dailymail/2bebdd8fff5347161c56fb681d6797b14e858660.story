Rough sleepers are being given $300 cameras to wear to expose what it is like being homeless.

The footage is then uploaded to the web - revealing the masses of people who avoid eye contact and walk quicker when they see someone begging in the street.

Volunteer Adam Reichart, 44, began the project by standing outside a supermarket in San Francisco and pleading: 'It's my birthday tomorrow'.

Caught on camera: Homeless people in San Francisco are being fitted with $300 GoPro cameras to reveal what it is like being shunned every day from their point of view. Pictured: Former drug addict Adam Reichart, 44

Ignored: Mr Reichart stood outside a supermarket and begged, pleading: 'It's my birthday tomorrow'

But as several hours passed almost no one stopped or even looked at him.

Eventually the footage shows passers-by donating money and, as the day draws to a close, two women buy him a hot meal.

The moving video is accompanied by the story of Mr Reichart's life, which has seen him sleeping on the streets regularly for 30 years after his mother and wife died and he became a drug addict.

Drug-free for the last four years, he met the founders of the Homeless GoPro project in January and hopes to be the first of a long line of homeless people wearing the cameras.

But this week he had all his teeth surgically extracted, making him even more unapproachable in the eyes of some.

Shunned: Most of the passers-by avoid making eye contact. Mr Reichart claimed people are losing social skills

Mr Reichart said: 'In the last five years I've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless. About half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently'

The volunteers have the 
high-definition video cameras fixed to their chests and the footage is 
picked up later by the project's organisers and uploaded to YouTube.

Mr
 Reichart said: 'I notice every day that people are losing their 
compassion and their empathy, not just for homeless people but for 
society in general.

'I feel technology has changed so much where people are emailing and don't talk face to face any more that people are losing their social skills, their compassion, their empathy and their feeling of real life.

'In the last five years I've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless. About half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently.

'Everyone asks "why did you end up on the streets?" but not everyone realises homelessness is a product of society'.

Donation: A man gives money to Mr Reichart as he begs outside the supermarket. Co-founder of the project Kevin Adler, 29, said he was inspired to start the work after his uncle was homeless for 30 years

Organisers plan to enlist several more of San Francisco's 6,500 homeless people.

Co-founder of the project Kevin Adler, 29, told MailOnline he was inspired to start the work after a family tragedy.

Project: Kevin Adler and Adam Reichart

'My uncle Mark was homeless for about 30 years,' he said. 'He had schizophrenia and died about 10 years ago.

'I
 visited his grave for the first time at Thanksgiving and I felt there 
were many other people still living in Mark's situation whose stories 
hadn't been told.

'A $300 high-definition camera is usually reserved for extreme sports and weekend adventures so it's surprising for it to give us a window into the lives of people we're not usually tuned into.

'Adam's a brilliant human being who has been on the streets for the same amount of time as my uncle Mark.

'They wear the cameras for a few hours and are really just going about their normal days. The purpose is to build empathy because that's a very powerful force connecting people together.

'It's what we all probably experience - there's a lot of implicit rejection where people just turn their shoulder away.

'But then there are brief moments of humanity, when someone buys him lunch or gives him a few dollars or even just stops to say hi.'

He added: 'We chose not to conceal the cameras for the reason that some people may object to having surreptitious videos being taken of them. But most people seemed to act as they would when seeing any homeless person.'
