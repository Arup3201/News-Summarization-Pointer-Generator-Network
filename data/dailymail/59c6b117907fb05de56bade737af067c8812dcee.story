When Caroline Howkins bought her stunning Georgian house Rabley Park eight years ago, she had no inkling of its fascinating film and TV history.

It was only when she received a call from a location scout who had used the property before that she learnt the six-bedroom mansion was still listed as a potential setting.

She leapt at the chance to have it captured on camera once again.

On the box: Six-bedroom mansion Rabley Park, near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire,has featured on both the big and small screen over the decades

‘It turned out Rabley had appeared in several episodes of The Avengers as well as black-and-white films such as Cast A Dark Shadow starring Dirk Bogarde,’ says Caroline.

It is so well known to Avengers fans that a coachload of followers came on a pilgrimage to see where scenes were shot.

The house appears in different guises in five separate episodes of the cult 1960s series, which starred Patrick Macnee as John Steed and Diana Rigg as Emma Peel.

In a 1967 instalment, called Mission . . . Highly Improbable, it is the home of a man called Shaffer, played by Ronald Radd.  A fight scene takes place on the front lawn, culminating in the character being impaled on a stake.

Caroline has gone on to hire out Rabley Park, which is set in 12 acres near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, to several television companies, including the BBC, which filmed several episodes of EastEnders there over two weeks in 2008.

Move star looks: The fees from screen appearances has been put back into improving the £3.95million property, including the addition of and indoor pool with a hot-tub and sauna

A framed photo of the cast and crew standing in front of the house has pride of place in the entrance hall.

The property was meant to be the home of Archie Mitchell, played by Larry Lamb. At the time, Archie was the new love interest in the life of the now-departed Peggy Mitchell, and the father of sisters Ronnie and Roxy.

‘He played a millionaire who lived here, and as Peggy walked up our sweeping driveway for the first time she said, “It’s a palace,” ’ laughs Caroline.

‘Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy, was lovely, just as you’d imagine her.

‘It was disruptive but we loved having them here. They fed us very well – there was a catering van, and always lots of biscuits and an urn of tea on the go.

‘On the one occasion we didn’t have access to our kitchen because of filming, they footed the bill for dinner out.

‘Because it’s filmed about six weeks in advance, they picked all my daffodils from the garden and replaced them with plastic roses to give it a feel of summer.’

Famous faces: Rabley Park appeared in five episodes of The Avengers, starring Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg

Caroline is now selling the house for £3.95 million, because of divorce, but she  and her children Luke, 20, and Chaz, 18, have fond memories of playing host to cast and crew members working on various projects.

‘We were invited to the premiere of the film Love’s Kitchen,’ says Caroline, as she leafs through the scrapbooks she has compiled  for each production, including the 2011  movie which starred Claire Forlani and Dougray Scott, and including a cameo from Gordon Ramsay.

‘It didn’t get great reviews but it was great for us. Dougray Scott was very charming.’

The house was also the scene of a teenage party in another British film, Truth Or Dare, which also experienced limited success  commercially.

‘The children were extras, playing party revellers.

'My daughter got to do some work experience with the art department, which was great as she’s now studying an art foundation course.’

Caroline explains that hiring the house  out pays as much as £1,600 a day, the most lucrative job being an advert that was filmed over two days in the kitchen for the food company Sharwood’s.

All the filming fees and more have been ploughed back in to the property, on which the family has lavished money.

The swimming pool extension, which includes a water slide, hot tub, sauna and gym, set them back £500,000.

They also spent £75,000 installing a three-bay garage and £50,000 renovating the two-bedroom lodge cottage.

More money went on a state-of-the-art kitchen, including a cool room, and they splashed out £20,000 on  a fountain on the front lawn.

Uncovering Rabley’s exciting television career inspired Caroline to delve further into its past, and after trawling through newspaper archives she found it has another, more dubious, claim to fame.

On New Year’s Eve, 1823, the house was the scene of a murder when a local constable was shot by a guest of the people who occupied it at the time.

‘The murderer was evading bail over money he owed and had been tracked down to Rabley by bail clerks,’ says Caroline. ‘The constable was badly injured and later died.’

It sounds like a plot twist from one of the many dramas that have been filmed there.
