It's been dubbed the ‘Walkie Talkie’ - but this skyscraper looks more like an old Nokia mobile phone.

The £500million development at 20 Fenchurch Street in Central London hit the headlines this summer after the reflection from its window panels melted car wing mirrors in the street below.

Last week the developer of the building, Land Securities, said it was ‘close to resolving the issue’.

And as shown by these aerial 
photographs - taken from a passenger plane flying over London this week -
the building looks like a 10-year-old Nokia 2600.

Popular
in 2004, the device sported a coloured display, polyphonic ringtones, 
games and desktop tools - but did not have a camera or Bluetooth 
capabilities.

Aeroplane 
passenger Paul Stephenson, 48, who took the pictures, said: ‘It struck 
me straight away - it looks like a giant mobile phone springing up out 
of the street.

‘It’s the only building with white sides and the top half of the front window panels look just like a screen from an old-fashioned handset.’

Land Securities said the glaring issue has not deterred tenants, with 56 per cent of the 37-storey building let, with a further 20 per cent in the hands of solicitors.

A spokesman for Land Securities said no alterations have yet been made to the building. She said: ‘We are close to a solution and that will involve physical alterations to the outside of the building.’
