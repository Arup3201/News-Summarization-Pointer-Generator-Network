We may depend on them from the moment we are born, but research shows we only fully appreciate our parents when we turn 27.

A study into how children feel about their family shows that after bickering through our teenage years, it takes almost a decade to come to respect our parents.

But for parents raising teenagers in London, it will be an even longer wait to feel loved by their children.

Research shows the capital is the worst region for families appreciating each other.

Teenagers from the North West value their parents the most and are able to display this than children growing up elsewhere in England.

The various stages of the parent-child relationship are examined in the survey by Paramount Pictures.

Results showed that while teenagers start to see their parents as vulnerable when they turn 14, most people don’t get to know their parents on their own terms until they are 28.

The survey of 2,000 UK families revealed that the main reason people are thankful for their parents is by looking at how other people were brought up in comparison.

And in hindsight, people said they should have shown their parents more respect as they were growing up.

Only one in four people said they fully appreciated their parents when they were teenagers, while three quarters of adults admitted to not giving their parents enough credit during their turbulent years.

How people appreciate their parents depends on their gender, according to the survey.

As adults, twice as many women than men will happily turn to parents for help with concerns about money or domestic problems.

In contrast, men are more reluctant to ask their mum and dad for advice.

A fifth more women than men said they learn the importance of their family when they went on to have children of their own or saw how other people were brought up.

Whereas men said it was getting their first job or leaving home for the first time that changed how they feel about their parents.

Nearly a quarter more women than men cited their teenage years as being particularly trying, while a

fifth more men than women recall their teens as being the complete opposite.
