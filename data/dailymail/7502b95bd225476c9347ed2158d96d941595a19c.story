It was hard to tell if the bride was blushing - but it was a tender moment nonetheless.

Three pairs of loved-up koalas were 'married' in a mass wedding ceremony at Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou, China, yesterday.

They included male Jimmy, who grew up in captivity, who was paired up with Killarney, a female flown in especially from Australia.

They were held together by their keepers as vows were exchanged before the happy couple shared a celebratory banquet of eucalyptus leaves.

The park has successfully bred more than 20 koalas since it imported six from Australia in 2006.

Koalas are not known for their monogamy and males will attempt to mate with as many females as possible during the mating season.

Animal weddings are not uncommon - unofficial registrar Ann Clark has married several pairs of dogs and cats in Desborough, Northamptonshire.

Besotted owners have spent up to Â£20,000 on ceremonies including chauffeur-driven cars, nibbles and even professional photographers.

Other animals to have been joined in holy matrimony around the world include a pair of giraffes in Brazil, two frogs in India and two miniature pigs in China.
