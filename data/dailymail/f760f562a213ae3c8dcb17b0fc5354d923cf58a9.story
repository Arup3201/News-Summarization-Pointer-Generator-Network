Tamara Ecclestone says she has been left ‘paranoid’ about her safety after a conman threatened her with kidnap.

The socialite’s fears were revealed as dental technician Martin Peckham was yesterday jailed for five years for the ham-fisted plot to blackmail her father, Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone.

He claimed that a Bahraini gang would abduct the TV personality and model unless a £200,000 ransom was paid.

The penniless fantasist, who pleaded guilty to blackmail, came up with the scheme after reading about a similar plot against the Ecclestones that was foiled earlier this year.

In a statement read at court, Miss Ecclestone, 28, said: ‘I do not feel safe when I go out, or even when I’m home.

'I have security around me 24 hours a day. I’ve become paranoid; I have to have all my windows and doors checked twice, and I keep my going out to a bare minimum. I feel trapped.’

Peckham, 41, posed as a security specialist controlling a team of mercenaries watching over Tamara who would withdraw their protection unless cash was handed over.

But Southwark Crown Court was told their tormentor was in fact just a fantasist who needed money after losing an £8,500 deposit on a wedding venue and, unknown to his fiancee, being unable to afford the new venue.

He was traced by police after failing to withhold his mobile number in a series of calls to Mr Ecclestone’s office between June 20 and July 4 this year, using the false name ‘Marcus Black’.

Mr Ecclestone, who was then abroad, delegated the task of dealing with the threats to Tamara’s then boyfriend, Omar Khyami.

In a statement issued before he was 
dumped in July over his appearance in a sordid sex tape, Mr Khyami wrote
of Miss Ecclestone: ‘She has become very tense, stressed, and paranoid,
which is completely out of character.

'When we’re out, she’s always looking behind her to see if someone is following her.

'We are not sleeping very well as the whole situation is constantly on our minds.’

Police arrested Peckham on July 4 after using phone records to track him down to his work in Colchester.

The web history from a laptop in his car included Mr Ecclestone’s Wikipedia page, as well as a newspaper story about the earlier blackmail plot.

Also found were text documents apparently drawn up by the father of two as scripts for the threatening phone calls.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner said of the plot: ‘It was committed by a fantasist, but it was exacted with planning, persistence, and determination.’

Judge Alistair McCreath told him: ‘These were people already in fear, and you compounded their fear.’

Peckham’s barrister Satyanand Beharrylal said: ‘The actions of Mr Peckham were hopeless and hapless compared to seasoned criminals.

‘It was a complete hoax from start to finish.

'He saw the tabloid story and, in a moment of pure stupidity, came up with this idea.’

In a statement, Mr Ecclestone said: ‘At the time it seemed very serious, but I was pleased to know that it was basically an amateur trying to extract money.’

Southwark Crown Court heard that Tamara Ecclestone was affected 'very badly' by the hoax blackmail
