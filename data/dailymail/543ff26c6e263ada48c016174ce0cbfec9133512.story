When Mark Smith saw police searching for a wanted man in his street he didn’t hesitate to do his civic duty and help them to find him.

The suspect was duly arrested – but as Mr Smith looked on from outside his door he was savaged by one of the police dogs in a terrifying ordeal that left him fearing he was going to die.

The German Shepherd mauled the father of three’s arm so badly that surgeons likened the injuries to a ‘shark attack’. His left arm was ‘ripped to shreds’ and he may never regain full use of it.

To make matters worse, instead of apologising straight away, the police handler said: ‘That’s what my dog does.’ Mr Smith, 45, a brewery worker, is consulting lawyers and will be making a formal complaint.

‘My arm is basically useless,’ he said yesterday. ‘The dog has almost eaten me. I have never experienced power or severity like it. The doctors don’t know if I will get the use back in my arm.’

The incident happened as three police dog handlers were hunting a suspected criminal who had run into back gardens of a cul-de-sac in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, last Thursday morning.

Mr Smith had just returned from the bank and saw the suspect go into a neighbour’s garden. He and other residents helped police look for the man.

When he was found, officers took the dogs out of their van to make the arrest and told Mr Smith to go back to the safety of his drive.

The suspect, who had allegedly tried to run down a police officer, was caught and arrested.

But Mr Smith was then attacked by one of the dogs as he stood outside his door watching the drama.

He said: ‘Suddenly one of the police dogs, who was not on a lead, appeared from nowhere. It just flew straight at me, it was not growling, not barking.

‘It grabbed me by my left arm and took me to the ground and just started to bite. I can’t describe how horrific it was. I am a big lad and its jaws were completely around my left arm.

I could hear my arm crunching and severing. It must have had me for five or ten seconds. I was screaming.

‘I passed out with the pain and I assume the handler managed to call off the dog because I felt the jaws release my arm just as I faded out of consciousness.

‘The attack was brutal. I could hear it crunch and crack, and I’m having trouble sleeping now as I can hear the sounds ringing through my mind. I thought I was going to die, if it had stayed on me much longer then I might have done.’ His wife, who was in their house, was ‘distraught’.

Police called an ambulance when they realised Mr Smith was badly injured and he was taken to Leeds General Infirmary. He faces extensive plastic surgery and hospital treatment on his arm.

‘The surgeons have cleaned it and tried to reconstruct it but there are bits missing,’ he said. ‘There are still huge gaps under the bandages.’

The next day an officer phoned Mr Smith to apologise and promised an investigation. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed a member of the public had been bitten by a police dog.

‘The matter has been passed to the force’s Professional Standards Department who will investigate should a complaint be forthcoming,’ he said.

The arrested man, 26, was wanted for a breach of a non-molestation order. He was later charged with theft, drug possession and breaching the order
