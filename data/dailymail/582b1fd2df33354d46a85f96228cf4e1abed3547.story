Clearly in high spirits, fun-loving Prince Harry dons a comical straw hat emblazoned with a Union Flag as he enjoys a fairground ride.

Dressed in an open-neck blue shirt and wearing sunglasses, the 29-year-old royal pulled faces when fellow revellers at a music festival saw through his disguise and yelled ‘Hello Harry’ as he soared past.

Harry even jokingly pretended to do a robot dance and was later seen dancing to acts including Clean Bandit and Foxes.

One festival-goer at the Secret Garden Party in Huntingdon even photographed him stripping off his shirt – causing much excitement among females nearby.

Michaela Baker, who filmed Harry on the fairground ride at the festival said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I got on the ride and saw Harry next to me.

‘He had a really good time and was waving his arms around and encouraging others to.’

The event, described as the ‘festival for professional party-goers’, is held in a beautiful landscaped garden in Cambridgeshire.

It attracts some 20,000 music lovers each year but has a chequered past.

Twenty people were arrested there last year for possession of drugs and a man was taken to hospital after taking a suspected drug overdose.

The East Anglian Air Ambulance – for whom Prince William will be working from next month – was also scrambled in 2013 to airlift a man who fell from a tree.

Harry, who celebrates his 30th birthday on September 15, quit his role an Apache helicopter pilot in the Army Air Corps earlier this year to take a Ministry of Defence desk job in London in order to bring the Invictus Games to Britain.

The event, which will be held from September 10 to 14 at the Olympic Park in London, will see 600 wounded servicemen and women from 14 countries compete in a Paralympic-style games.

Harry said recently: ‘Basically my full-time job at the moment is making sure that we pull this off.

‘These guys are a credit to the country so give them a chance to come out and inspire others around them.’
