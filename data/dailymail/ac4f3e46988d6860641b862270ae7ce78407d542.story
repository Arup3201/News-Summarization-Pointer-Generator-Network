Nick Clegg was accused of ‘treachery’ by senior Conservatives last night after pulling the rug from under the Government’s flagship childcare reforms.

The Deputy Prime Minister plunged Coalition relations to a new low after publicly attacking proposals to help cut costs for working families by relaxing rules on the number of toddlers that nurseries and childminders can supervise.

The Conservatives said Mr Clegg had signed off the plans before they were announced earlier this year and pointed out the changes would be optional for pre-school providers, increasing choice for parents.

The BBC was last night leaked an exchange of letters between Childcare Minister Liz Truss and Mr Clegg from last December.

It makes clear that Miss Truss flagged up the change in ratios of carers to children as ‘the most high-profile of my proposals’.

In his reply, Mr Clegg gives her clearance to press ahead.

Angry Tory backbenchers urged David Cameron to ignore Mr Clegg’s last-minute objections and press ahead.

In an article today for MailOnline, Sir Martin Narey, the former head of the children’s charity Barnardo’s, also dismissed the ‘noise’ from Mr Clegg and praised the ‘brave reform’.

He said many nurseries would welcome new flexibilities, which were ‘widespread in France, Denmark and Sweden, all widely recognised as having excellent childcare systems and all of which have minimum ratios larger than ours’.

Mr Clegg told his weekly phone-in show on the radio station LBC 97.3: 'I think four [children] is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six'

‘We need better staff and we need to allow them more professional discretion in determining how many children for whom they can safely care,’ he added.

Miss Truss, the architect of the reforms, was dragged to the Commons after Mr Clegg’s office confirmed he had had second thoughts about backing them.

Miss Truss insisted the current system of childcare was ‘not working for parents’, who faced some of the highest costs in the world.

Under the Government’s proposals, in September the minimum staff-child ratio for children aged one and under will ease from 1:3 to 1:4 and those for two-year-olds from 1:4 to 1:6, where staff are better qualified. In Ireland and Germany, the ratio for two-year-olds is one adult to six children, in France it is 1:8, while in Denmark and in Sweden there are no national staff ratios at all, Miss Truss said.

‘At present we have the tightest ratios in Europe for children under three and we also have the lowest staff salaries. Nursery staff here earn £6.60 on average, barely above the minimum wage. Our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high-quality staff to be able to exercise professional judgment.’

But Mr Clegg insisted he had reservations about changing the ratio. ‘When we as a government consulted on changing the number of little toddlers that each adult can look after, the response from experts, from parents from nurseries was overwhelmingly negative,’ he said. ‘They felt that the risks outweighed the benefits and it wouldn’t necessarily reduce costs.’  

Mr Clegg told his weekly phone-in show on the radio station LBC 97.3: ‘I think four [children] is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six. This is not a great ideological thing, this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country.’

In the Commons, Tory MPs lined up to support Miss Truss, who is tipped as a potential party leader, and urged her to go ahead with the changes. Wellingborough MP Peter Bone described giving nurseries more choice over child-to-adult ratios as ‘a good Tory policy’.

He added: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister, if he wants to comment on this, if he doesn’t want to run away from something he has agreed on, he should be in this House, not on a radio programme. I suggest we press on with this policy and ignore the Liberal Democrats.’ Senior Conservatives were scathing about the Lib Dems’ change of heart, with one accusing Mr Clegg of ‘appalling treachery’.

Another accused him of ‘running scared after the usual whinges from the trade unions and lefties on Mumsnet’. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said David Cameron ‘very much shares’ Miss Truss’s views on the need for reform.

But Professor Cathy Nutbrown, who was commissioned by former Lib Dem children’s minister Sarah Teather to review childcare qualifications last year, said: ‘There really is a need to slow down this policy to ensure that well-qualified people are available.’

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: ‘David Cameron and Nick Clegg are creating chaos and confusion on childcare.’
