Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has demanded full details of the reports be published, after they were leaked to the Mail On Sunday

NHS bosses have been accused of covering up plans to close A&E units and cut hospital beds – after paying £10million for reports they are now refusing to publish.

They have paid management consultants including KPMG a total of £10,282,593 for advice on ‘improving long-term affordability’ across 11 regions that cover 13million people.

The Mail on Sunday has seen a leaked copy of one of the secret reports, recommending the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds, sparking fears of plans for widespread cuts in other areas.

Such concerns are stoked by an official, watered-down summary of the project, which mentions the need for ‘tough decisions’ to balance the books in the 11 ‘challenged’ areas, where budgets are being overspent.

Using business jargon, it speaks of ‘service reconfiguration’ – which critics say is code for cuts – and ‘rationalising the [NHS] estate’, or selling off hospital buildings and land. But nowhere in the Making Local Health Economies Work Better for Patients paper, partly commissioned by NHS England, are any details spelled out.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham last night demanded the full details be published before the Election, saying: ‘The public, who have paid for these reports, have a right to see them before they go to vote. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt likes to lecture the NHS about transparency, but it is clear he doesn’t put his money where his mouth is. He must make immediate arrangements to publish all of these reports or people will conclude he’s a hypocrite.’

KPMG, whose advisers include former NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year. The Mail on Sunday has seen the one covering Staffordshire, which was leaked to a Labour MP.

It said NHS managers should ‘investigate the feasibility’ of stripping Stafford hospital of all its emergency services – including the A&E department – and turning it into ‘an elective and rehabilitation centre’.

KPMG also recommended closing hospital beds there and in Stoke, Tamworth and Burton to plug a potential £217million black hole.

If similar suggestions have been made for the other ten areas, NHS managers will be considering plans to close numerous A&Es and potentially thousands of hospital beds.

However, NHS England has refused to publish the 11 reports, despite admitting there is ‘in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible’.

Instead, it has answered a freedom of information request from The Mail on Sunday, which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments, by arguing that releasing them now would ‘prejudice the outcome’ of work to draw up five- year plans for the areas. ‘For these reasons, we believe withholding the information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information.’

In the same response, NHS England admitted how much it spent.

Stafford hospital supporter Richard Duffy believed it highly likely that management consultants had recommended closures elsewhere too. ‘That seems to be the remit they were given,’ he said.

Despite the terrible history of Stafford hospital, where hundreds are thought to have died in the 2000s due to poor care, the town has rallied to save its departments from the axe.

The other ten areas are: Cumbria, Eastern Cheshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Cambridge & Peterborough, Mid Essex, North-East London, South-West London, East Sussex, and Devon.

KPMG confirmed it worked on two reports. A spokeswoman added: ‘Any further enquiries on the recommendations should be directed to the client.’
