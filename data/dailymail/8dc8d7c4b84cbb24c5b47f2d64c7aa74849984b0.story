It's rare to find anyone who owns a pet rabbit in Ohio and even rarer to find one who dresses theirs in handmade frocks.

So when veterinary technician Annie Kiener, 25, decided to do exactly that and post one of the cute pictures online, she was staggered by the response.

Since posting the picture on website Reddit yesterday, she has been inundated with people from all over the world asking her if she would make similar dresses for their rabbits.

Since posting her dressed up rabbit picture on website Reddit, Annie Kiener, 25, from Ohio, has been inundated with rabbit dress orders from pet owners all over the world, from the UK to Australia

In the space of 30 hours the picture of one of her three pet rabbits wearing a dress similar to this one, received 30,000 hits and became the site's most viewed

Annie and her husband Scott, 25, have now turned their one bedroom apartment in Columbus, Ohio, into a factory

The six dresses that they had in stock have already sold, and 20 orders are now in the process of being made

The couple are making one dress every hour from their Ohio apartment

As a result, her and her husband Scott, 25, have turned their one bedroom apartment in Columbus, Ohio, into a rabbit dress factory, and alongside their three pet rabbits are churning out dresses at a rate of one an hour.

'In the space of 30 hours the picture received 30,000 hits and became the site's most viewed.

People from the UK, Australia and Canada have written to us asking for similar dress for their rabbits. It's been incredible.'

One woman wrote to them asking for a rabbit wedding dress because she is about to get married and wants her pet to be in the wedding picture.

She wrote: 'I was wondering if you could make a wedding dress with a
 veil for my bunny?

'I am getting married next month and thought about 
bringing my rabbit to to the ceremony.

'She's also a lop ear girl and 
we've had her for 7 years and counting.'

Hey there: I was wondering if you could make a wedding dress with a
 veil for my bunny? I am getting married next month and thought about 
bringing my rabbit to to the ceremony. She's also a lop ear girl and 
we've had her for 7 years and counting.

Hi! I love your wife's bunny dresses. I'm always dressing my buns up 
but I have to resort to dog clothes because no one makes bunny stuff. Would your wife be able to make a little wedding dress and tuxedo? I 
have a boy and girl bunny living in sin. But seriously, that's something
 I would like to buy. My budget would probably be around 100 dollars, 
depending on how complicated the design is and the quality of 
fabric/sewing. I live in Germany but would probably send money to my dad
 in the US to purchase.

Another said she wanted to marry her 
two pet rabbits and asked if Annie would design and make a wedding dress
 for the female rabbit and a tuxedo suit for the male.

She wrote: 'Hi! I love your wife's bunny dresses. I'm always dressing my buns up

Annie and Scott met while working in an Ohio restaurant five years ago, married 
last year and have three rabbits of their own: Pancake, Finlay and 
Hopkins.

Annie sent out Christmas cards with one of her pet rabbits modelling a Santa Claus dress on the front. The possibilities are endless

According to Scott, a Spanish senior at Ohio State University,  animal lover Annie started designing rabbit dresses so she could take pictures of her pets dressed up.

'It started off as a bit of fun because she wanted to take cute pictures,' he said.

'Her and her mum designed a pattern and Annie made it, and it went from their.

'We never expected this kind of response because no one tends to keep rabbits in Ohio.

'When we bought our third we had to drive to Indiana, approximately 150 kilometres away to pick it up.

'She was a photography student at Ohio State University and is now 
training to be a vet, so her random mix of skills and passions have come
 together perfectly with this venture.'

The six dresses that they had in stock have already sold, and 20 orders are now in the process of being made.

The fabric is bought from local craft stores or donated by family members who have had it on hand from past projects. 

'Annie will spend hours in a store pouring over the different types of fabric, always trying to come up with the perfect combination,' said Scott.

They cost $30 each or more for specific design requests. Further details can be found on their website AnnieElleBunnies.

The industrious couple got married last year and share a love for rabbits. They have a purpose built wooden cage in their hallway where they keep their three pets: Pancake, Finlay and Hopkins
