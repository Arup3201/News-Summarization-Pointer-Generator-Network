Voters should not be allowed to see MPs eating or drinking, John Bercow declared today in a row over a film crew roaming the corridors of power.

The Commons Speaker said the makers of a documentary on the workings of Parliament would be barred from filming politicians ‘relaxing’ or ‘enjoying themselves’ while wining and dining in the subsidised bars, tea rooms and restaurants .

The extraordinary ruling comes after complaints from MPs who fear being caught out like Labour leader Ed Miliband who was ridiculed after being photographed struggling with eating a bacon sandwich.

Labour leader Ed Miliband was mocked after a PR opportunity eating a bacon sandwich backfired last month

Legendary filmmaker Michael Cockerell was granted rare permission to film inside Parliament, after previously taking cameras inside Downing Street and the great offices of state.

The team have been given unprecedented access, including camera crews being allowed on to the floor of the House of Commons during PMQs.

However, after today’s clashes between David Cameron and Mr Miliband, Mr Bercow was bombarded with complaints about the extent of the filming.

He rejected the idea of filming politicians eating or drinking in Parliament. Last month Mr Miliband was mocked after a PR visit to New Covent Garden Market culminated in unflattering photos of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

Tory MP Heather Wheeler said: ‘There is a feeling in the chamber that where the TV cameras are going is perhaps getting too far, too fast.’ 

She warned of rumours that cameras would be allowed into the voting lobbies and urged Mr Bercow to block it.

Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth also warned against allowing sensitive and ‘extremely private’ conversations being filmed.

‘In my own humble opinion it would be quite improper for those conversations to be recorded,’ he said.

Mr Bercow insisted he ‘wholeheartedly’ backed the documentary, and would not intervene on every request made to film in different parts of Parliament.

But he made clear he would veto an imminent request to film MPs eating or drinking inside the Palace of Westminster as ‘wholly intrusive, unfair to MPs, and unacceptable’.

He told MPs: ‘If such a request to interfere with the private space of members when they are relaxing, enjoying themselves and consuming food or drink in the tea room is made, those making the request will be disappointed.

‘I do not think an Honourable Member consuming a cup of tea and beans on toast should be subject to a film crew.’

Some MPs back the idea of filming the whole of Parliament at work, to change the perception created by Prime Minister's Questions

Despite the complaints about the documentary, some MPs backed opening up the workings of Parliament to a wider audience.

Tory MP James Gray said: ‘The public out there get the wrong impression from things like PMQs, and people like me strongly support the fact Michael Cockerell is getting into the voting lobby and elsewhere. He will be demonstrating to the world we do a good job here and let's see them in the voting lobbies and elsewhere.’

Mr Cockerell's documentary is the first of its kind in more than three decades.

The four-part BBC series on life at Westminster called Inside The Commons is to be broadcast next year.
