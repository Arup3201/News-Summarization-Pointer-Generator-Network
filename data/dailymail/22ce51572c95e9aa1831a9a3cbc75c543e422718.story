A thief was caught stealing money from a disabled neighbour who she was supposed to be caring for after his family set up a hidden camera in his home.

The shocking footage shows Lisa Cobane casing Malcolm Gill's living room before distracting the multiple sclerosis sufferer and snatching a £20 note while his head is turned.

The mother-of-three had offered to help Mr Gill, 66, while permanent carers were found, but his family became suspicious when money and property went missing from the house.

Mr Gill has difficulty remembering daily events, and so relatives installed the hidden camera and left the money on the mantelpiece as bait to catch the unaware Cobane.

Cobane, 32, is clearly shown spotting the money at his home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, pointing to something behind a confused Mr Gill and stealing the cash when he is not looking.

The out of work hairdresser, who moved to  Grindleton Avenue, Sharston, Wythenshawe, admitted theft when she appeared before Stockport magistrates.

She will be sentenced later this month and magistrates warned that she could face jail.

Mr Gill's niece Louise Haig set up the sting with help from private detectives Proactive Investigations.

After the hearing, she said: 'Her defence solicitor said she was remorseful and felt ashamed.

'I don’t believe for a moment she is, and think the only thing she is sorry about is being caught.'

Claire Parrott, defending, told the court that her client had led a previously crime-free life, but after splitting up from her partner she started taking amphetamines and drinking heavily.

Within a year, Cobane had developed a daily habit for the drugs, said Mrs Parrott.

A spokesman from Proactive Investigations, who set up the camera, said: 'We are delighted to have been given another opportunity to succeed where others have failed.

'In this case we have assisted a particularly vulnerable member of the community and family.'
