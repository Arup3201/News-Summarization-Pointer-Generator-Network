Unemployed queue at a government run job centre in Malaga, southern Spain

Spain’s unemployment rates have hit 25 per cent – the highest since records began after Generalissimo Franco's dictatorship.

Spanish officials have confirmed today that a quarter of its population – and a shocking 53 per cent of young people – is currently without a job.

This is the latest blow to the country’s economy as the government had hope the tourist season would help the country on its way out of recession.

It is now looking towards a bleaker future, despite a vow of support from the European Central Bank, as 5.7 million Spaniards eligible for work stand unemployed.

Although the number of people who lost their jobs was significantly less in the second quarter -  53,500 compared with 365,900 in the first quarter - the country’s unemployment rate is still the highest in the industrial world, the national statistics office said.

A third of all unemployed in the Eurozone now live in Spain with more than half of those eligible to work under the age of 26 unemployed according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.

The Bank of Spain last week estimated a contraction of 0.4 per cent, after a 0.3 per cent decrease in January to March, with the official economic growth figures expected next week.

Spain's economy is reeling in the aftermath of a decade long real estate boom that crashed with the debt crisis, bringing the Spanish financial sector to the brink of insolvency.

Under pressure from European authorities who have accepted to bailout Spanish banks, Spain's conservative government has approved tens of billions of euros' worth of spending cuts, tax hikes and other measures.

The latest set of measures announced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on July 11 aimed to save 65 billion euros (nearly £51 billion) over three years.

Rajoy says the steps will help cut the public deficit in line with targets agreed with the European Union and strengthen the economy in the long term.

Critics say the measures will make the poor suffer unfairly from moves such as a public sector bonus cut and a rise in sales tax that together will hit consumption.

Alberto Roldan, an analyst at Spanish brokerage Inverseguros, said: ‘All the spending cut policies they are taking are restrictive and run counter to growth.

‘Raising the fiscal pressure in a country with 25 per cent unemployment is absolutely regressive.’

No to cuts: Demonstrators during a protest in downtown Madrid, Spain earlier this year. Further cuts to public spending of £51 billion were announced two weeks ago with similar consequences

Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest at the measures.

The
Spanish region hardest hit by rising unemployment was Catalonia in the 
northeast with a rate of 33.92 percent, Friday's figures showed.

The 
lowest rate was 14.56 percent in the affluent Basque Country.

The Spanish government's latest 
unemployment forecast is for a rate of 24.6 percent at the end of 2012.

This is a separate figure from that of the statistics office, an 
autonomous state body.

The government forecast unemployment will ease to 24.3 percent in 2013 and 23.3 percent in 2014.

Spain's sovereign interest rates had risen to dangerous levels but eased
back Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowed ‘to 
do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.’

The Madrid stock market was up fractionally by 0.15 per cent in early 
afternoon trading Friday, after surging six percent Thursday on Draghi's
comments.
