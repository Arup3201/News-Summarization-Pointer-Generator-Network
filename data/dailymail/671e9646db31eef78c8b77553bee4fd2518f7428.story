The mother of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wailed as she heard her son's voice for the first time since he was charged with the deadly attack.

The 19-year-old alleged terrorist revealed that he was in no pain and had been eating for a long time, saying: 'They are giving me chicken and rice now, everything's fine.'

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has been allowed 
one phone call with her surviving son who remains in a prison hospital 
in Massachusetts recovering from gunshot wounds following a shoot-out 
with police where his brother Tamerlan, 26, died.

It is the first time that the public has
heard the voice of Dzhokhar since he was accused of having detonated bombs in Boston with his brother. Three people died and 264 were injured in the 
attack.

Emotional: Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat broke down as she spoke on the phone with her son in prison

Brief contact: The alleged terrorist has been allowed to call his parents once as he awaits trial in Massachusetts

'Everything's fine': The voice of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was heard for the first time since he had been charged over the Boston bombings which killed three people

Dzhokhar's voice is calm and quiet as he tells his mother that he has 'plenty of money', claiming  supporters opened a bank account in his name and deposited $1,000.

The bombing suspect's mother played a recording of the telephone conversation with her teenage son to Channel Four News.

In the clip, she tearfully asks if he is in pain, to which he responds: 'No of course not. I'm already eating and have been for a long time.'

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva then tells her son that 'we all love you, Muslims and non-Muslims love you'.

She later claimed that Dzhokhar told her on the phone that one supporter had opened a bank account for him where $1,000 had been deposited.

Tsarnaev, 19, is accused of carrying out the attack in Boston almost two months ago and has been charged in federal court with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 

The terror suspect was arrested after a 36-hour manhunt and is currently being held at Devens Federal medical center as he recovers from gunshot wounds, including one to the neck.

Weeping: The mother of the alleged bombers weeps as she stares as the phone as she told her son that 'Muslims and non-Muslims loved him'

Claims: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, left, and husband Anzor Tsarnaev said that in their only phone conversation with son Dzhokhar last week, he claimed that supporters were putting funds in a bank account for him

Sticking to her story: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of the two Boston bombing suspect, continues to claim that her sons have been set up for the attacks

Recovering: Tsarnaev has been allowed one phone call with his parents in Dagestan while he recovers in this Massachusetts prison hospital

His parents have also raised $8,000 from those who support claims that their sons are innocent of the terrorist attacks, the first on U.S. soil since September 11. 

A 'free Dzhokhar' website has also been set up which draws support from around the world.

Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded.

Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects' father, said last week that he believed his sons to be innocent and that the justice system had failed.

He told the AP: 'All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive.'
