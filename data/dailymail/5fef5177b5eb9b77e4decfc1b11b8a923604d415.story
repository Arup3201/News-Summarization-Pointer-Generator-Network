Jean-Paul Gaultier has never been one to shy away from controversy, having previously used transgender models and a topless Madonna on his catwalks.

So it should come as no surprise to see bearded drag queen and Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst gracing the catwalk for his haute couture autumn/winter 2014 show.

Conchita, the female alter-ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, closed the couture show yesterday on the Rue Saint Martin in Paris.

The singer wore a bridal gown that was entirely black and adorned with gold and red embellishment and finished with a black veil and a hairline of black sequins.

It was evidently a proud moment for Gaultier, who took to one knee in front of the Austrian singer.

Conchita was not the only alternative model to grace the catwalk, with 56-year-old Swiss model Catherine Loewe also making an appearance before taking a tumble while on the runway.

The collection itself featured dark, Gothic pieces, including black fur coats, paneled leather pencil skirts and circular crinoline skirts.

Gaultier's most breath-taking piece was one he named 'Maleficent' - inspired by Angelina Jolie's recent role as the Disney villain - which saw a model wearing a black bustier with mink bands and dark crepe pants holding out a mirror in which she stared, pouted and cackled.

The use of drag in the designers show attracted much support and admiration from his fans including director, Baz Luhrmann who brought drag-queens to our screens in films such as Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet.

The director, spurred on by the liberated show, spoke openly about gay rights, praising Gaultier for his groun-breaking approach.

'Gaultier was always about transgender sexuality, about high and low,' he added 'for him to be having his show crowned by the grand dame of drag queen or transsexual expression is appropriate.'

The 51-year-old director referred to the recent backlash 
against gay rights around the world, especially in France and several US
 states, adding that seeing Conchita in a mainstream fashion show indicates that gay rights are advancing.

'What you see is a sort of reaction against how successful it's been.'

This was not the first encounter between Gaultier and Conchita; the pair met at the 2014 Life Ball, one of the world's largest AIDS charities.

They were spotted later, hand in hand, at the Vogue Foundation Gala dinner at the Palais Galliera.

Gaultier's controversial approach has seen him reap financial rewards: 'I can say yes, it is profitable. I love it as we have more and more clients. I am proud to be a designer of couture.'

He says the secret of his success is to make wearable clothes, but to not compromise on the couture craftsmanship.

'Do couture truly as couture.'
