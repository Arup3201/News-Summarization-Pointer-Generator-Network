Thankfully, we've yet to see any signs of the dark future predicted in the Terminator films - but Androids do seem to be taking over the world.

YouTube's head of content, Robert Kyncl said in a speech at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that more Android devices are activated - ie turned on for the first time - than babies are born on Earth.

Kyncl joked that Andy Rubin, Google's director of mobile, was now looking for customers on other planets.

Rubin said in December last year that 700,000 Android phones were being activated every day.

The phones, of course, have an open goal - the birth rate has been dropping steadily since the Eighties, with UN estimates at around the 300,000 mark according to a 2008 study.

The birth rate is predicted to drop to 16 million people per year by 2025, from a high of 17 million per year.

The only thing holding back Google's phones is demand - and with smartphones poised for a move into emerging markets, that seems unlikely to slack off.

Apple does not release comparable statistics, but that Google's Android handsets - made by a huge number of manufacturers from Samsung (whose Note tablet is pictured) to Motorola - could well overtake Apple's total figure of 250 million activations of devices running iOS, including iPods, iPhones and iPads shortly

Google's Android handsets climbed from 400,000 last May to 700,000 per day, according to Rubin's figures.

In November last year, Android was already standing at 200 million activations.
