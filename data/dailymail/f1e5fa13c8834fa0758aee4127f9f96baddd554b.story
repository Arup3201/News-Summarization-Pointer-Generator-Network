David Meyler is free to play in the FA Cup final after the Hull midfielder escaped punishment for stamping on Manchester United youngster Adnan Januzaj.

United interim boss Ryan Giggs hit out at Meyler for sinking his studs into Januzaj’s outstretched leg in the latter stages of United’s 3-1 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

The FA were unable to take the matter further after referee Craig Pawson yesterday said that he had seen the incident.

Stamp it out: Meyler got away with the stamp on Januzaj late in the second half

Pawson, however, admitted that he would 
have taken more action if he had seen it from the camera angle that 
appeared to show Meyler deliberately standing on Januzaj.

Meyler, who
 was facing the  possibility of a three-match ban, will now be available
 to play for Hull against Arsenal in the Cup Final at Wembley on May 17.

It is the second time this season that Januzaj has been the alleged victim of a stamp after Fulham's Sascha Riether was banned for three matches in November after accepting a FA charge of violent conduct.

Hull boss Steve Bruce insisted that he did not see the incident, but Giggs described it as 'a joke'. He added: 'I didn't see it but I've seen his leg. It's the second time it has happened to him this season. It's not great to see, and it's terrible his leg.

'He needs protecting. He's a brilliant, exciting player and the authorities need to sort it out. It's just the length of his leg, not cutting into his skin. It goes form his knee to his ankle.'

Giggs came on as a substitute for his 963rd - and possibly final - appearance at Old Trafford in his last home game as interim boss, and admitted that he is still in two minds whether to play on next season.

Thin line: Meyler was already on a yellow card for an earlier foul on Tom Lawrence

He used the occasion to give supporters 
'a glimpse into the future', giving senior debuts to James Wilson and 
Tom Lawrence alongside Januzaj.

Wilson, 18, scored two of United's goals and admitted that he only knew he would be in the team on the morning of the match.

'It
 came as a shock but he had faith in me,' he said. 'I got out there and 
tried to show what I could do. My family were out in full force tonight 
and it was a great feeling.

'When the first went in it was total 
euphoria. The second one was a great experience. It was about getting 
used to the physicality and the pace of the game. I played here for the 
Under-21s but it is different with 75,000 people.'
