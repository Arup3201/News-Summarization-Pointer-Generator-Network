There was the most cursory handshake at the net afterwards, confirmation that one player had completely overwhelmed the other.

With a fairly crushing 6-3, 6-2 victory, Maria Sharapova had sent out the message to Eugenie Bouchard that nobody should overstretch the comparisons between the two of them just yet.

Sharapova produced a superbly aggressive performance to render their Australian Open quarter-final something of an ant-climax, romping through in just 78 minutes as Bouchard put up disappointingly little resistance.

The Russian now meets the No 10 seed and compatriot, the rather underestimated Ekaterina Makarova, who beat the No 3 Simona Halep 6-4, 6-0. The 26 year-old from Moscow is something of an Australian Open expert, this being the fifth time she has advanced to the fourth round or beyond, and now makes her first semi-final.

Shrieking on every shot with perhaps a little more intensity than usual, Sharapova was intent on dictating the points to the 20-year-old Bouchard, and not allowing to hog the baseline too much and move her around.

She was especially brutal on the Bouchard second serve, climbing into it to the extent that the Canadian won just six points off it in the match. 

'I had to try and take the time away from her,' said Sharapova, who expressed surprise that her next opponent will be Makarova.

'You would have made Halep favourite but she has been playing really good tennis and she is a lefty, you don't see too many of those around,' she added.

What this match really showed is that Sharapova is the finished article while Bouchard is still a work in development. Nonetheless, the young Canadian has made a solid enough start to backing up her breakthrough year of 2014.
