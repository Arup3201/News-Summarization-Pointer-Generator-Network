This little panda cub may be only three months old but it has already got an interesting picture for the family album - even if it does look a little awkward.

Today, the cute bear received a regal hug from Queen Sofia of Spain at Zoo Aquarium in Madrid.

The cub, who has not been named yet, sat on Sofia's lap and seemed a bit uncomfortable as she squeezed. But maybe it was just star-struck.

Go easy on the squeeze... Queen Sofia of Spain cuddles the baby panda during her visit to Zoo Aquarium in Madrid today

She's a queen? Why didn't you say so. Here's my star-struck look: People can log on to the zoo's Facebook page to choose a name for the cub

You gotta sort out my identity crisis: By December 2, the baby will have a name, from one of the five choices: De Mao, De Fu, Xi Fu, De Bao or Xing Bao

This is not the first time the 75-year-old wife of King Juan Carlos has met the endangered animals.

In September 2007, she opened the refurbished panda enclosure at the zoo upon the arrival of Bing Xing and Hua Zuiba - the proud parents of the new cub.

And in 2010, she returned to see seven-month-olds Po and De De, the third time pandas had bred in European zoos at that time.

Internet users have until December 2 to vote for the name of the new baby - which was born on August 30 - via the zoo's Facebook page.

The five choices are De Mao, De Fu, Xi Fu, De Bao and Xing Bao.

The pandas will live in Madrid for ten years as a part of an International Conservation Cooperation Project between China and Spain.

The joint project was a goodwill gesture promised by the Chinese government during a visit by Queen Sofia to China in June 2007.

Like Britain's Queen, Sofia is a 
direct descendant of Queen Victoria â€” she is a 
great-great-great-granddaughter - and the two are cousins.

Is the giant panda actually Spanish?

Scientists now believe the origins of the giant panda 
lineage may lie not in China but Spain.

Last November, two
 fossils, dating back 11.6million years, were unearthed in 
northeast Spain - and are thought to be of the oldest recorded ancestor 
of the species.

The 
two sets of jaws and teeth belong to a new genus, Kretzoiarctos ('bears 
of Kretzoi') - in honour of paleontologist Miklos Kretzoi, who had 
discovered other extinct pandas.

The details of the unique bear were 
described in a paper published in the open access journal PLOS ONE by 
Juan Abella and colleagues from the National Museum of Natural Sciences 
and the Catalan Institute of Paleontology, Spain.

The fossils have the characteristics of a bear adapted to eating tough plant material like bamboo, the researchers said.

The
 giant panda, native to certain parts of China, is the only living 
member of this unique bear family with these dietary habits.

Speaking at the time, Mr
 Abella said: 'The new genus we describe in this paper is not only the 
first bear recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, but also the first of the 
giant panda's lineage.'
