Military intervention in Syria moved a step nearer after Nato announced it would meet to discuss the shooting down of a Turkish warplane.

Amid a tense stand-off, Ankara invoked Article 4 of the defence alliance which allows a member state to consult allies if its security is threatened.

Two Turkish airmen were still missing last night after their unarmed F-4 Phantom jet was shot down by Syrian forces.

A F4 Phantom Turkish fighter jet was shot down by Syrian security forces over international waters, say Turkey

Turkey’s foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the jet ‘momentarily’ 
strayed into Syrian airspace during Friday’s training flight but was 
shot down after returning to international airspace.

Damascus insisted the ‘unidentified’ aircraft was engaged while over 
Syrian territorial waters, which extend 12 nautical miles from the 
coastline.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said the ‘deplorable’ incident 
underlined the need for Syrian president Bashar Assad’s brutal regime to
go.

He said: ‘This outrageous act underlines how far beyond accepted 
behaviour the Syrian regime has put itself and I condemn it 
wholeheartedly.

‘The Assad regime should not make the mistake of believing it can act 
with impunity. It will be held to account for its behaviour.’

Whitehall sources said Ankara’s decision to call the Nato meeting in 
Brussels tomorrow meant the prospect of military intervention would be 
discussed.

Earlier this month Mr Hague suggested the UK may send troops to Syria if the country spiralled into a Bosnian-style civil war.

More than 14,000, mostly civilians, have been killed in the past 15 
months since Assad ordered his soldiers to crush an uprising.

÷Russia is to defy David Cameron by sending back to Syria a cargo ship 
loaded with helicopter gunships blocked by the UK last week.

The MV Alaed was yesterday in the Arctic port of Murmansk as sources in Moscow cautioned against ‘acts of provocation’.

Mr Hague called the act 'outrageous' and said it underlined the need for Bashar Assad's regime to go
