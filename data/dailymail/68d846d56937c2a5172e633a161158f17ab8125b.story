The ponytail has gone, along with the modelling career and a shedload of money, but the ebullient Darragh MacAnthony is not a man to look back and dwell.

There has been a book too — ‘just about the football club, it was a bit daft’ — not to mention an app ‘to keep results up to date, but it wasn’t very good’.

Meanwhile, owning Peterborough has turned the League One club’s extrovert chairman into an anxious, superstitious obsessive — ‘my OCD is getting worse’.

Suited in a verging-on-baggy pinstripe, MacAnthony strides into his minimalist office at the training ground, past the empty bookshelves, and admits he has never sat at his huge, empty desk before.

It turns out that the decorators have been in since he last made the trip from his Florida home. He likes it, especially the montage of family portraits which adorn the walls, even if they remind him how much he is missing wife Natalie and their children: Darcy, Callum and Cara, all under 10.

There is an internal door to the manager’s office, currently occupied by interim boss Dave Robertson following the reluctant severing of an eight-year on-off relationship with Darren Ferguson.

‘So you thought I’d be in a tracksuit?’ He speaks in a soft Irish brogue but the words are delivered at rat-a-tat speed in a contradictory combination of dictatorial charm. His style is to cut to the chase.

The answer to his question is yes. Based on the evidence of an 11-point Twitter demolition of his players two months ago, the assumption is that MacAnthony is an owner who likes to meddle.

‘I knew you’d get to that,’ said MacAnthony, or @DMAC102. ‘Give me 11 reasons not to talk about Twitter!

‘I have been caught saying things on Twitter which I probably shouldn’t have but my personality has always been honest and direct. I make mistakes, I am impulsive.

‘What did the players think? I didn’t need to ask. I spoke to them on Friday and joked “I’m going to give you 11 great reasons on Twitter why I’m happy” (five wins in six since Ferguson’s departure).

‘They know where I’m coming from and I don’t think any of them could argue with my points. I understand it’s not the done thing, but I didn’t buy a football club to live by the rules of the establishment.

‘Am I a frustrated football manager? No. I am an owner and a frustrated fan. If you look for a manager who says I said “you must play so and so”, you won’t find one.’

MacAnthony left Ireland for Spain with his family at 15 and by 29 had made a fortune from the property market, a large chunk of which went straight down the drain in the recession.

MacAnthony described getting relegated  from the Championship in 2013 as his worst moment at the club

At 17 he flirted with modelling, influenced by his girlfriend at the time, and a fact gleaned as he comfortably poses for photographs. ‘I had a ponytail, which my Mum used to do for me. Natalie doesn’t believe it when I tell her I used to be a model, but it was good money.’ 

Another girlfriend tempted MacAnthony to London and college. He lasted two weeks before heading back to Spain.

Buying a football club was a dream toy for the boy in 2006 and has remained a source of pain and pleasure ever since.

‘I was 28-29 and at the top of my game,’ recalled MacAnthony, now 39. ‘Then the recession came and the world nearly ended financially. It was tough, but the club kept me sane.

‘It’s hard to name one best moment as there have been so many but the worst is easy. We were relegated from the Championship on 54 points two years ago.

‘We were 2-1 up (against Crystal Palace) with seven minutes to go and needed a draw. In the most horrific seven minutes in the history of the club they scored twice.

‘I was watching from home — I have every game streamed to me. I’m very tense in my chair, superstitious, and my OCD is over the top. You’re not going to make this article about my OCD are you? People will laugh. I was never like this at the start and now it’s uncontrollable.

‘Everything has to be in the same place on my desk and pointing in a certain direction. No-one can talk to me during a game. One of the guys who worked for me walked in and we lost so now no-one is allowed to.

‘When we were relegated I watched and reacted like a fan. Then the financial implications come in. Jesus, we have just lost £6million worth of revenue.’

The logistics of living in the US mean that MacAnthony’s visits to the £500,000 newly-refurbished training ground — rented at £1 a year from the school next door — are regular rather than frequent. Email and telephone have to do the rest of the time.

There is a lot to cram in, including this interview. Halfway through there is a knock on the door. ‘I’m busy,’ shouts MacAnthony as the door flies open regardless. ‘I’m doing an interview.’

The beaming face of director of football Barry Fry peers round the door. ‘How you doing love? We need him (MacAnthony).

‘One minute, one photo. We’re signing a new player love, and there’s nothing more important than that.’

MacAnthony is as helpless as the rest at stopping the irrepressible Fry and a short time-out is called, our photographer in hot pursuit.

Back at his desk, the chairman itemises the previous 24 hours, which involved meetings and the signing of six teenagers on pro contracts.

The smile fades when the conversation turns to Sir Alex Ferguson’s son Darren, who managed Peterborough twice under MacAnthony. ‘It was tough. It was like losing a member of the family. We spoke every day and we shared the highs and lows. It’s still quite raw.

‘We have to get the next appointment right. The club has been stressing me this season, I have aged. But it’s enjoyable again. I’m in the luxury position that the guys in situ are banging down the door.’

The new manager will be expected to recruit young, cheap players, produce a winning team and be prepared to lose them as the business plan is one big departure a year — the club have generated £30m of sales under MacAnthony.

Britt Assombalonga was the £5m cash cow last year, a record £1m signing from Watford sold on to Nottingham Forest, sparking another angry tweet from @DMAC102 when Forest missed a due payment.

There could be new projects in the pipeline. A follow-up book to his first tome, From Hobby to Obsession, perhaps?

‘It was me and a Dictaphone,’ revealed MacAnthony. ‘And then I employed someone to write it. They wrote it badly from an English point of view.

‘The fans liked it and it sold 10,000 but there was nothing about my personal life in there. I haven’t written my autobiography yet — now that would be an interesting book!’
