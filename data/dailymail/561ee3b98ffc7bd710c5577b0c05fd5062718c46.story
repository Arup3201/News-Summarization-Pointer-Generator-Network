Brent Taylor, a 23-year teaching veteran, was ordered to review a hygiene course by the principal at Scootney Springs Elementary School

The parents of an 8-year-old student at a school in Washington state are unhappy after their son was ordered to unclog a toilet with his bare hands.

The incident happened on November 6 at Scootney Springs Elementary School in the small city of Othello.

The third-grader said he reported the blocked toilet and teacher Brent Taylor told him to clear it with his hands.

‘It’s nothing I haven’t done before,’ Taylor reportedly told the student.

Artie and Lisa Adams said they learned of the incident when they asked their son about his day at school.

‘He said everything was good, but my teacher made me put my hand inside the toilet. We were like, “What?’” Artie Adams told KEPR.

The parents complained and the school principal reprimanded Taylor and ordered the 23-year teaching veteran to review a hygiene course. 

Taylor had taken the same course just two months ago. He also received a warning letter.

Othello Superintendent George Juarez has said he stands by the principal's decision and he doesn’t plan to investigate the incident further.

The Adams family are unhappy at what they consider to be too lax a punishment.

‘He did get made fun of, kids did see this happen and he’s not going to go to that school,’ Lisa Adams told KEPR. 

The boy has since transferred to another school.
