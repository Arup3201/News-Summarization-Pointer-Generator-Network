In the case of these striking and delicate images, it would appear beauty and brains really can co-exist.

Each of the Asian-style designs depict a range of neuroscientific images, ranging from a hippocampus to the tree-like expansion of neurons, and even a slice of a spinal cord.

They combine the traditional sumi-e ink painting style with modern images captured by a microscope and on a computer.

This 'brainbow' image shows a hippocampus. The hippocampus is involved in forming, organising and storing memories. It also connects emotions and senses, such as smell and sound, to memories. The hippocampus is a horseshoe shaped paired structure, with one hippocampus located in the left brain hemisphere and the other in the right

The images were painted by Greg Dunn who has a Ph.D in neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, in the Asian Sumi-e style, also known as ink painting. This piece is of the crab's stomatogastric ganglion, which is a collection of neurons in the crab that controls its chewing and digestion of food

The work was created by neuroscientist-turned-artist Greg Dunn.

He received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011.

All of the images are painted by hand, but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures.

Sumi-e has been practiced for around a 1,000 years, predominantly in Japan.

Dr Dunn’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas, or using a syringe to place it on the frame.

'I enjoy Asian art. I particularly love minimalist scroll and screen painting from the Edo period in Japan [and] am also a fan of neuroscience,' explained Dr Dunn.  

All of the images are painted by hand, but are inspired by microscopic images of complex brain structures. Sumi-e has been practiced for around a thousand years, predominantly in Japan. Dr Dunn’s interpretation of the art in involves either blowing ink around a canvas, or using a syringe to place it on the frame. This image shows cortical columns which are columns of neurons that perform similar tasks in the brain

This image looks like a butterfly, but is in fact an artistic representation of a cross-section of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is found in the vertebral foramen and consists of eight cervical, 12 thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral and a coccygeal segments. A pair of spinal nerves is between each segment of the cord

The left-hand image of the cerebellar lobe was painted using 22K gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel. The cerebellum is the region of the brain required for movement and motor memory. Elsewhere in the collection is an image depicting a glia cell (right). Glia cells are a type of 'support' cell that take nutrients to neurons, and hold them in place. A brain has around 10 times the number of glial cells than neurons

'Therefore, it was a fine day when two of my passions came together upon the realisation that the elegant forms of neurons - the cells that comprise your brain - can be painted expressively in the Asian sumi-e style.

Dr Dunn has, more recently, began etching images onto metal, too. 

This process, dubbed microetching, carried out with Dr Dunn's colleague Brian Edwards involves scanning and editing neurons using computer software, which are then etched onto a metal sheet using a process called photolithography. 

This image shows the brain of a fly from the Drosophila genus -  a type of small fruit fly

The left image is called Crackled Neurons, while the right is called Neuromuscular Junction. 'Neurons may be tiny in scale, but they possess the same beauty seen in traditional forms of [Japanese art]- such as trees, flowers, and animals', continued Dr Dunn. 'I admire the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean masters because of their confidence in simplicity. I try to emulate this idea'

This involves printing the images onto a sheet, placed on top of light-sensitive layer above a piece of steel. When ink is placed onto the sheet it blocks light hitting the layer beneath. 

Ultraviolet light is shone onto the metal and engraves the image in the locations where the photosensitive layer was blocked by the ink. Gold leaf is then placed on the surface.

In one image, Dr Dunn has was inspired by the stomatogastric ganglion in a crab. This is collection of neurons that controls the chewing and digestion of food in the crustacean.

This image, which resembles a watery landscape, is called Hippocampus II, and depicts a  rodent hippocampus. Dr Dunn uses several mediums in his paintings of the mind, resulting in images that are dreamlike and scientific. He explained that the medical imagery he uses as a springboard for many of his works are just blueprints, because he's 'always trying to walk a line between photorealism and interpretation'

This Cortical Circuitboard microetching was designed to resemble a circuit inside a computer

In another, the artist painted a cerebellar lobe in 22K gold dye and enamel on an aluminised panel. The cerebellum is the region of the brain required for movement and motor memory.

Elsewhere in the collection is an image depicting a glia cell. Glia cells are a type of 'support' brain cell that take nutrients to the neurons, as well as holding them in place.

A brain has around 10 times the number of glial cells than neurons. 

The left-hand image is called Hair Innervation. Innervation is a nerve supply, usually to a specific part of the body. It was printed using ink on 22K gold. The right-hand image shows neurons in the maki-e style of painting, which translates as 'sprinkled picture' and involves placing Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder onto a brush

Along with Dr Edwards, Dr Dunn recently received a grant from the National Science Foundation to create a giant microetching of the human brain at as close to full complexity as possible.The full work will be completed and installed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 2016. Dr Dunn's Cortical Sunburst scroll is pictured

Dr Dunn recently exhibited his reflective microetchings, prints, scrolls, and gold leaf paintings at the Society for Neuroscience meeting at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC.
