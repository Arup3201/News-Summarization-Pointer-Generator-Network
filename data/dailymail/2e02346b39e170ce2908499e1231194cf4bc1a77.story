When neighbors went to check on the house of Jerrod Christian, pictured, after a tornado, they found items he allegedly stole from them on his front lawn

Neighbors who went to help out a fellow resident after a powerful tornado swept through their street found items they had reported stolen all over his front lawn.

The twister, which hit Sullivan County in Tennessee, flattened the house of Jerrod Christian and once the tornado passed, neighbors went to check the house.

But when they arrived, they found nobody present but did find tools that they had noticed had gone missing from their own homes worth a total of $2,000.  The discovery of the stolen goods was made by Ed Cleek, who was called to go an check the lawn of Christian's house, where he spotted his air compressor lying in the yard.

He told ABC News: 'My house was torn up pretty badly, so I was checking things up. Then someone called me and said: "Hey, I think that’s your air compressor. You want to take a look?"'

When police arrived they found additional possessions stolen in a separate burglary earlier this month including an air hose, a rachet, a welder and a weed trimmer.

Christian has now been charged with two burglaries and two thefts. 

At the time of the tornado, Christian was not at his home, but instead in Sullivan County jail on unrelated charges.
