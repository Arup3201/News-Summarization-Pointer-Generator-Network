Samsung's Galaxy S2 Android touchscreen has sold 10 million units: Its successor is liable to be a showcase for Samsung's most hi-tech components

Samsung has officially confirmed the existence of the Galaxy S3 - the hi-tech follow-up to one of the most iconic Android smartphones.

The phone will be unveiled at a special event early this year - and will be on sale shortly afterwards.

The 'special event' approach is akin to Apple's glitzy iPhone launch events - and a new idea for Samsung.

If Apple launches iPhone 5 this summer, as expected, the S3 is liable to be among its most heavyweight competitors in the second half of this year.

'The successor to the Galaxy S2 smartphone will be unveiled at a Samsung-hosted event in the first half of 
the year, close to commercial availability of the product,' said the 
Korean electronics giant in a statement.

Technical specifications of the device haven't been released.

Samsung's Galaxy series are traditionally used to showcase the most hi-tech components manufactured in Samsung's factories - and have been ahead of the components in Apple's iPhone.

Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S Advance - a cheaper model of the hit handset with slightly less cutting-edge components. It's available now

The Galaxy S2 came out last August and was hailed as the ultimate geek's phone. It was fast and had a great camera.

The Galaxy S3's spec has not been officially announced, but according to reports, here's what it might include...

The Galaxy S2 was one
 of the first handsets with a laptop-esque dual core processor, and 
offered an eight megapixel camera months before Apple's iPhone 4S.Samsung still makes several components that are used in Apple's iPhones.

Samsung's Galaxy S2 sold 20 million units at last 
count.

One in 10 of the whole Korean population owns an S2, and the phone  is still a cult favourite on tech sites.

The S2 helped propel Samsung's smartphone sales past Apple's in the 
third quarter of 2011. 

'Samsung’s Galaxy lineup has been one of the most sought after smartphone lines worldwide,' says Boy Genius Report.

'The Galaxy S II became the company’s fastest selling smartphone ever, selling three million units in just 55 days.'

'Moreover,
 Samsung sold more than 30 million Galaxy S and Galaxy S II smartphones 
worldwide as of October.'

'There is no question that consumers are 
interested in the Galaxy.'
