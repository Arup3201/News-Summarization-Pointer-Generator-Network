The King of Belgium says his £770,000 a year allowance, handed to him after he abdicated in July, is not enough to live on.

But Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said there would be no negotiations and the money paid to King Albert II would remain the same.

'The government is not going to change one comma' of the accord thrashed out earlier this year on annual payments to the royal family, he said. 

'Not enough': King Albert II reportedly says his £770,000 a year allowance is not enough to live on

'The government has no intention, directly or indirectly, to change anything at all in this important reform.'

The prime minister, whom the king had singled out for praise in his abdication address, was responding to reports Albert II felt he had been short-changed, Yahoo news said.

King Albert II 'says he has not been treated as he had hoped and that he now finds himself in difficulty.'

Before he abdicated this year after a 20-year reign, the King was given a tax-free alloance of £933,000-a-year to pay for the upkeep of the entire royal household.

After stepping down and allowing son Philippe to take the throne, the popular monarch was handed £770,000.

He was also provided with a team of ten aides but is still 'complaining bitterly about the annual payment' said a court correspondent from Le Soir.

Associates, worried by his 'poor morale and recriminations,' are trying to help him, the paper said.

Several options including the government paying for his official residence or the navy running his luxury yacht which is worth about £384,000.

The monarchy is an important symbol of unity in a Belgium divided between the Flemish north and French-speaking south.

Belgian sculptor Delphine Boel is also trying to be recognised as the natural daughter of Albert II. As king, Albert II enjoyed immunity from the law but since he abdicated he faces court action after Boel named him in a suit to establish her true father.

Her mother is Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps who, according to a book released in 1999, had an affair with Albert in the 1960s before he became king.
