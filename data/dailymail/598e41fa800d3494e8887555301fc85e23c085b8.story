TV star: Former Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader, Sarah Jones carried out a sordid affair with one of her 17-year-old high school students

The Bengal Tigers cheerleader who became infamous for having illicit sex with a minor, Sarah Jones, is getting married to that very same teen, Cody York.

The couple became engaged on Thursday while they were in Florida with members of her family.

York’s Facebook page shows a photo of the couple kissing with Jones wearing a ring. They appear to be on a beach.

Jones was 27 when she admitted to having sex with  then 17-year-old York, who was a student at Dixie Height High School, where Jones also worked as a teacher.

Jones managed to avoid jail time by pleading guilty to felony custodial interference and misdemeanor sexual misconduct for having sex with a student last October.

Now 28 and working part-time as a paralegal for her attorney Eric Deters she has decided to get married.

York is now 19 and a college student.

'I fully support Sarah and Cody,' Deters told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'And if they want to get married and live happily ever after or not, who knows? Nobody ever knows how marriage turns out. I wish them all the best.'

The case and the Jones’ relationship with York were the subject of a Dateline NBC program last October.

In a separate case, Jones’ defamation lawsuit against the
website TheDirty which ended in a mistrial in January, is set to go 
start again with a new trial in July.

She is suing the site for $11 million for two stories it posted about her in 2009 when the website and its owner made lewd comments made about her online long before any accusations involving the teenager surfaced.

If Jones' lawsuit succeeds and is 
awarded a large sum of money, other websites including Facebook, 
YouTube, Twitter and Amazon could be bombarded with lawsuits over 
material posted by their users.

Jones resigned as a teacher at Dixie Heights and from the Bengals cheer squad in late 2011 after four years with both jobs.

Deters said at the time that Jones had 
done nothing wrong and stepped down because a rumor that she had become 
involved with a student became too much.

She said of their relationship: 'The truth will set you free. The stress fell off of me when I didn't have to hide anymore. If you can love someone at their lowest, that says a lot'

Student: Cody York has supported his former teacher and said he 'loves everything' about her - now he is making the biggest commitment of all and about to marry her
