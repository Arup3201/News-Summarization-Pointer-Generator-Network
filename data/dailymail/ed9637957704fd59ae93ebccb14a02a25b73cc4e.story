World Cup winning rugby star Mike Tindall turned out for an amateur rugby club in Devon on Saturday, two months after retiring from the professional game. 

Tindall, who was part of the backline when England famously won the Rugby World Cup in 2003, turned up at North Tawton RFC in Devon to be part of their coaching staff. 

Insurance company QBE ran a nationwide competition to award four amateur clubs with a 'hit squad coach', and North Tawton were one of the winners.

The England legend was taking part in a QBE initiative aiming to support the development of rugby at all levels 

But little did the club, players and thrilled spectators know Tindall had brought his boots and he joined the action for the second half.

Tindall said: 'Since retiring I have been biting to get back on the pitch. 

'I didn't come here expecting to be involved in a playing sense but the players and coaches were keen on the idea.' 

North Tawton, of the Devon Tribute 2 division, beat Crediton 26-17 in a pre-season friendly. 

Tindall set up two of the tries and the crowd were treated to some trademark bursting runs and crunching hit. 

The 35-year-old first linked up with North Tawton back in February but has kept in close contact with the club.

Tindall showed his new North Tawton team-mates how it's done on the pitch as well 

He turned up on Saturday to manage the pre-match drills, team talk and tactical substitutions but even the players were surprised when he jogged onto the pitch halfway through proceedings.

Former Gloucester centre Tindall called time on a glittering career in July, which yielded 75 England caps. 

North Tawton prop Alfie May said: 'Some of the boys read a tweet that Mike sent to Richard Wigglesworth saying that he was hoping to play for North Tawton but we didn't read too much into it. 

'Mike has offered us so much of his time coaching on both the sidelines and on the pitch and it was just amazing seeing him play in our home kit. 

'We will have the photos up in our clubhouse for the foreseeable future.'
