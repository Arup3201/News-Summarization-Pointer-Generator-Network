Robert F Kennedy Jr has blasted Fox News as a detrimental force in American life as he took potshots at conservative news networks.

Speaking from Utah on Friday, RFK Jr said 'right-wing control' of the media was damaging to political parties trying to work together.

The environmental lawyer also said in the interview that he opposed the practice of fracking saying it carried serious health risks and polluted lands and river.

He noted that 22 per cent of Americans get their news from Fox, telling HuffPost Live that the network has 'divided our country in a way that we haven't been divided probably since the Civil War'.

RFK Jr later attended the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest which benefits the charity he is president of and founded, the Waterkeeper Alliance.

He was pictured with girlfriend Cheryl Hines as he mingled with celebrities including Neil Patrick Harris, Gavin Rossdale and Larry David.

The four-day event, where tickets started at $1,200, has competitive ski-ing between Olympians and celebrities, along with live auctions, concert and cocktail parties.

Last month, it was widely reported that the family of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s late wife has hired a high-powered investigation firm to look into ‘unanswered questions’ about her death.

Mary Richardson’s relatives have asked Washington-based Investigative Group International to see if the suicide on May 16 was actually a ‘wrongful death’.

The company - which was hired by Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal -  is said to have assigned a former homicide prosecutor to the case which will also examine Mr Kennedy’s movements in the days before.

The explosive development opens the door to the Richardson family bringing an unlawful death lawsuit against Mr Kennedy because they believe he is in part responsible for her demise.

The reports suggest Miss Richardson’s family are not convinced by the official account of what happened on the day of her death, which a coroner ruled was suicide by hanging.
