Back to school season is an expensive time for parents, with many paying up to £350 for their children’s uniform, according to new research.

The study asked parents with two children about the cost of kitting out their kids for the new academic year.

According to respondents, every year parents have to replace jumpers, polo shirts, trousers and school shoes, adding up to about £189 per child.

So FEMAIL has put together a list of supermarkets - including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's - in which you can kit the kids out to go back to school for almost half that: £98.49.

Some parents invest in pricier items and spend up to £200 in the hope that they will last longer

The all-important winter coat was considered another pricey buy, often averaging at £30 for a decent high street purchase, with sports kits coming to a total of £20.

Other items including pencil cases, stationery and school bags contributed to the cost averaging at a total of £25.

For those parents with children at secondary school, extra costs came for blazers, ties and collared shirts.

When asked about the general pricing of uniform, over half, 53 per cent of parents, said that it was expensive but something they had to buy.

They also said they could budget for it as they knew that expense would be coming around every August and September.

Parents say kids demand a new pencil case and stationery each year

One respondent said: 'I always know September is going to be an expensive month when my boys go back to school.

'The summer holidays is only six weeks long but they seem to grow so much in that time meaning everything needs to be replaced.

'On the uniform alone I usually end up spending about £200, I do tend to buy more expensive things with the hope that they’ll last longer.'

Another woman involved in the study commented: 'Buying a school uniform is just one of those things you can’t avoid.

'The uniform isn’t so bad because kids do grow out of them, but I get frustrated when my children demand a new pencil case and stationery each year. I have no idea what happens to them.'

A spokesperson for NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research, said: 'A lot of parents dread doing the uniform shop which is understandable because it is very expensive these days, but there are ways to keep the costs down.

'Shopping around to find cheaper alternatives is one way to reduce the costs and also by bulk buying where possible at the start of the school year.'
