A celebrity gossip site has claimed that one of their blind items predicted that L'Wren Scott was not well just four days before she killed herself in her Manhattan apartment.

The site, Crazy Days and Nights, posted an item on Thursday March 13 about how a 'C list celebrity but is A list in her own little corner of the celebrity world' had disappeared and was going through a very rough patch with her cheating, shorter 'permanent A-lister ' boyfriend.

Though the unsubstantiated claims were first posted as a blind item- and the name of the subject in question was left out of the post- the author later updated it after Scott's death was confirmed on Monday and claimed that she was the subject.

Mick Jagger's spokesman immediately denied any claims that the longterm couple had separated before her death.

Together: Mick Jagger's spokesperson confirmed that 'of course' they were still a couple when Scott killed herself but Jagger has been known to cheat on his partners in the past, as that was the reason for both divorces

Connections: A blind item described the subject as being 'a C list celebrity but is A list in her own little corner of the celebrity world' which would fit with Scott's reputation in the stylist and fashion communities, seen here at her 2008 show with Christy Turlington, Kyra Sedgwick and Ellen Barkin

Her roots: L'Wren was adopted by Mormon parents 
in Roy, Utah and raised as LuAnn Bambrough, as seen here in pictures 
from her high school yearbook

Though
 Jagger's cheating has been cited as the cause for his two previous marriages, his representative
 said that 'of course' the Rolling Stones frontman and the designer were
 still together at the time of her death.

No sources were revealed for the post nor is it clear how the anonymous blogger would have any inside knowledge to substantiate the claims.

Resting place? It has been reported that Jagger is pushing for Scott to be buried at Hollywood Forever cemetery

One
 of the most tangible connections in the blind item alludes to the fact that
 Scott cancelled her London Fashion Week show a few months before her 
death. At the time, she cited delayed fabric orders but her financial 
filings have shown that the U.K. end of her luxury brand was in debt.

'There
 are reports she had a breakdown because he was cheating on her. She 
canceled a huge event she was working on and has retreated into a 
hospital to get help although some people say she is hiding out at her 
home with medical professionals,' the item reads.

Sourcing: Crazy Days And Nights is run by an anonymous blogger who identifies themselves only as 'Entertainment Lawyer' and they are known for having a number of shocking items that are sometimes later proved correct

Mystery solved: The original blind item was posted on Thursday March 13, days before her suicide on Monday March 17 but after her death was confirmed, the blogger revealed that she was the subject of the post

No confirmations have been made regarding any medical treatment she may have received ahead of her March 17 death.

Posts on Crazy Days and Nights are 
attributed to an anonymous blogger who calls themselves 'Entertainment 
lawyer' and there is no telling who their sources are.

The New York Post's gossip columnist Cindy Adams also made outrageous and unsubstantiated claims that her friends were aware of her troubles and made no motions to help.

'Her stylist friends, fashion friends, p.r. friends, critic friends all say they knew she was hemorrhaging financially. Nobody helped,' Adams wrote today.

The blind item was not the only sign of chatter about problems between Scott and Jagger to come out in recent days, however.

The
 Mail on Sunday has learned that the designer secretly remortgaged the 
luxury Manhattan apartment for $1.2million (£700,000) then asked Jagger 
to bail her out in February last year, triggering an argument.

Over
 the weekend, a source close to Jagger, who is worth a reported 
£200 million, revealed he had been ‘blindsided’ by the extent of his 
lover’s woes.

Inseparable: Dating since 2001, the couple first
 remained private and then began attending events together years later, 
(seen left in 2006 and right in November of last year)

The source emphatically denied claims by Scott’s friends that the couple’s relationship had been strained by a series of rows over money, saying:  ‘They were inseparable to the end. He did everything he could to help and support her. There was an element of frustration [for Mick] that money was being poured away into a bottomless pit. He wasn’t the only investor to feel that way.’

But Phillip Bloch, the stylist who befriended Scott, 49, when both started out as models in Paris, claimed: ‘Everyone knew the relationship was in trouble. Her spending could be reckless. There were massive rows.’

Another friend added: ‘There was a massive argument last year when Mick learned she had secretly borrowed against the apartment.

Frozen out: Scott's sister Jan Shane (pictured) wants her to be buried in their family plot in Roy, Utah

‘He bailed her out but she was going round saying he had told her, “Call me when you sort out your mess.”’

Jagger’s spokesman insisted he had never said this.

There are also reportedly new tensions between Scott's family and Jagger, as the designer's estranged sister has called for her to be buried in the family plot in Roy, Utah.

Scott, who was adopted by a Mormon family and raised by the name Luann Bambrough, was close with her brother Randall and hadn't spoken to her sister Jan Shane in six years.

Randall, a financial adviser, had been working with her to sort out her business debt in recent months, has reportedly been in discussions with Jagger and agreed to his request to have the designer's body flown to Los Angeles for a funeral in California.  Jan told The Mail on Sunday that she has been left completely out of the negotiations and hopes that L'Wren's body will end up in the already-carved plot next to their parents.

‘No one has told me anything about a funeral. I’ve not had a single call from anyone in the Jagger camp. I’m beside myself,' she told The Mail On Sunday.

‘Are they going to make it so secret that her own family is banned from attending?’
