It is not the obscene prospect of the £500,000-a-week player which most blatantly exposes the moral bankruptcy of big-time football in this country.

It is the reluctance of all but one of the Premier League clubs to pay all the rest of their staff a living wage.

Even as he was announcing the sale of three seasons of British television rights for Premier League matches for more than £5billion, chief executive Richard Scudamore brazenly defended the right of his clubs to pay lesser workers £6.50 an hour. 

Radamel Falcao is on an eye-watering £285,000 a week during his loan spell at Manchester United

With the new TV deal, players at the level of Sergio Aguero could be on £500,000 a week by 2020

No he is ‘not uncomfortable’ with the clubs he is enriching beyond Croesus keeping some employees on that bare legal minimum rather than the UK living wage of £7.85 an hour, rising to £9.15 in London.

Nor, by inference, does Scudamore regard it as a ‘disgrace’ that so many cleaners of dressing rooms, sweepers of terraces and pourers of tea earn £284,772.50 less for a 35-hour week than the £285,000 which is the reported salary of Radamel Falcao for making intermittent appearances with Manchester United.

Once this new TV deal is boosted above £8bn by the placement of overseas broadcasting rights, Senor Falcao’s wage packet is expected to be eclipsed by the first half-a-million-pounds-a-week ball-kickers.

Even though that may appear grotesque in relation to the ordinary ability and average achievements of the Premier League’s over-rated celebrities, good luck to them.

But not at the impoverishing expense of those who clear up after them.

Chelsea take a great deal of flak these days – not least their manager Jose Mourinho – but in this issue they are setting an example which should embarrass their 19 Premier League rivals.

Chelsea alone have contracted to meet, at least, the basic demand of the Living Wage Foundation.

While Manchester City have agreed to pay the living wage to staff they employ directly, though not contract workers, others like Arsenal, who charge the most in the land for season tickets, simply ignore the outrage.

Nor can Scudamore guarantee that the rise in television revenues – now up to an astonishing £10m per match – will bring about the reduction in admission prices for which supporters are campaigning.

‘Not all the clubs make a profit,’ he bleats.

 

Well, if they don’t they have only themselves to blame for paying their players – and worse still their agents – way too much.

And when Scudamore protests that ‘the fans want the best talent to come and play in the Premier League’ he conveniently forgets that Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar and others of the world’s creme-de-la-creme prefer to ply their trade abroad.

Actually, that makes his negotiation of the new TV deal all the more remarkable, especially in the eyes of ‘my 20 employers.’

Hence his own salary and bonus package amounts to around £2m a year. And now they are considering promoting to executive chairman this man who, less than a year ago, was facing widespread demands that he be sacked for ‘sexually inappropriate’ texting.

Quite how the toilet cleaners at the Emirates feel about that they have yet to tell us but Scudamore says: ‘Like in the film and pop industry the absolute talent get paid a disproportionately high amount.’

Of course he is right when he says: ‘We’re in the entertainment business.’

Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's best player, left the Premier League for Real Madrid six years ago

The Premier League is not so much a sporting competition as a circus with, yes, we the media as one of its three rings generating much of the manically excessive hype.

Hence this mega-bucks deal which will feed its own greed and never mind that it will further weaken our feeble England team by financing the import of yet more foreign footballers.

But what about this industry’s more lowly workers?

Says Scudamore: ‘There is a thing called the living wage. Then there is a minimum wage which the politicians have the power to raise, which is not for us to do.’

One of those politicians, shadow London minister Sadiq Khan, calls his remarks ‘disgraceful.’

He exhorts the Premier League clubs to lift their most lowly-paid staff onto the living wage ‘so they can put food on the table and pay the rent.’

Food for thought, also? Only the morally bankrupt would think not.

Because whether it be Mr Scudamore or the majority of his 20 paymasters, somebody should be feeling ashamed about that.

Jose Mourinho is in his element in the spotlight.

Paul Lambert was like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

Two more examples of why, in the lead article to this column, I refer to the Premier League as a circus.

Mourinho, as one of the ringmasters, not only survives but prospers at Chelsea because he meets controversy – like the Branislav Ivanovic non-biting incident at Wednesday’s evening performance – with outraged indignation.

Jose Mourinho plays his role to perfection - performing for the gallery and preparing to be champion

Paul Lambert is out of a job after his reign as Aston Villa manager was brought to an end on Wednesday night

Lambert suffers pain, torment and humiliation at Aston Villa, which is invariably the miserable lot of circus animals.

One plays to a captivated gallery and prepares to be anointed, once again, as a champion.

The other shrivels in the glare and is hounded out.

It is the way of the beast

Some accuse Louis van Gaal of long-ball tactics.

Others criticise Manchester United’s manager for playing Wayne Rooney too deep, in midfield.

If both are true, no wonder his expensive ensemble are struggling,

By-passing your best player – which is the Boy Wayne, not the Angel di Maria – is not a very good idea.

Hold on a minute, is that Wayne Rooney playing as a defensive midfielder for Manchester United?

United boss Louis van Gaal has been under the spotlight for using Rooney in a deeper role than he's used to
