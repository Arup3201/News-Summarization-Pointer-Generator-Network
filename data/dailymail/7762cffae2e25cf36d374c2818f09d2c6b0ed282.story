Diafra Sakho has had no trouble finding the net for West Ham this season, and that continued on the Hammers' mid-season break to Dubai.

Unfortunately for the Senegalese striker, it was on the tennis court as he took some time away from the sport he knows best.

West Ham fans will be relieved to find that Sakho is unlikely to quit his day job for a place on the ATP World Tour any time soon... that's if his Instagram video is anything to go by.

The east London side have headed to warmer climes to enjoy their week off from Premier League action as attention turns to the FA Cup.

Sam Allardyce's men were knocked out by West Brom in the fifth round, and will not take to the field again until they face Arsenal next weekend.

While the Southampton squad headed to the slopes in snowy Switzerland, West Ham opted for something warmer; the 30 degree heat of the United Arab Emirates.

Sakho has scored 11 goals for the Hammers so far this season; nine of which in the Premier League, and he and his team-mates have now been rewarded for their hard work with a trip abroad.

West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald told the club's official website: 'Since the start of December it's been full on and we're only just coming up for air at the start of March. 

'It's been a tough couple of months but what we normally do is go away so the lads can get a bit of sun on their backs.

'We do a bit of training in the gym and along the beach, as well as having a couple of football sessions. It's more important that they have a bit of relaxation time and get the sun on their backs.

'In last two or three months everyone’s had their tracksuit tops, gloves and hats on and it’ll be great to go across there and we’ll still be working, but special for the boys that it’s in the heat.'
