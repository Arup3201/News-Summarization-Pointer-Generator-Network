But that all changed on Wednesday when the lucky Labrador was finally reunited with the family after being spotted wandering a neighborhood 18 miles from his home.

When his owner, picked up the phone on Tuesday and it was the West Windsor Police Department, Wesley's owner, Miguel Cruz of Hillsborough Township thought it was a mean joke.

'Now I’m thinking April Fool’s. What a cruel joke this is. I said come 
come on, is this an April Fool’s prank? No, no they found him, they 
found Wesley,' he told CBS Philly.

The four-year-old Golden Labrador was found early Tuesday morning following a call to West Windsor police of a dog roaming a neighborhood. They were easily able to identify him as Wesley because of a microchip that he had implanted.

The officer 'retrieved a very friendly and very large Labrador,' Lt. Robert Garofalo of the West Windsor police told the Princeton Packet. 'The dog jumped right into the back of his patrol car and was more than happy to go for a ride.'

Garofalo added that Wesley was likely taken care off since he seemed overweight. The Cruz family said he put on 25 pounds since they last saw him.

Wesley was found in West Windsor, almost 20 miles away from the Cruz home

Wesley's reunion with his family, Miguel, his wife Myra and their 12-year-old son Sebastian happened Wednesday in the lobby of the West Windsor police headquarters. In a video posted by the West Windsor police, Wesley gets extremely excited the moment he sees his family again.

While finding Wesley after such a long period of time might be considered a miracle, Miguel Cruz says he never gave up hope the lab would be found alive.

'We thought maybe he got run over by a car or a deer killed him in the field,' he said. 'We’re so happy he survived and was picked up and returned to us because of his chip.

'We were so sad, so distraught for 17 months. We talked about him until the very end and never gave up hope.'

And when Wesley finally returned home on Wednesday, 'he was all smiles like he was saying, “Hey, I’m back,”' Cruz added.
