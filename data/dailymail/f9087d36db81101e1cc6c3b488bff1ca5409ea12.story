Eamonn Holmes was today forced to make a grovelling on-air apology after pictures showing the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in her bikini were shown to millions of This Morning viewers.

The photographs, labelled 'violating' by the Palace, were taken as Kate strolled along a beach with Prince William on the exclusive private Caribbean island of Mustique.

Italian gossip magazine Chi and Australian weekly Woman's Day have published them, but the British media has refused because they breach the royal couple's privacy.

But today This Morning presenters Eamonn 
Holmes and Ruth Langsford were discussing the story in a news review section when Chi's front 
cover flashed up and filled the screen, but the pictures were 
not blacked-out.

Holmes was later forced to offer a humbling 'unreserved apology to the Duke and Duchess' for the 'deeply regrettable' error on the show.

'Earlier during today's news review we were discussing photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a beach in Mustique published in an Italian magazine,' he said.

'Unfortunately we accidentally showed an unblurred image of the magazine cover, which briefly showed the photographs. This was a deeply regrettable error and we are very sorry.

'We apologise unreservedly to the Duke and the Duchess.'

It appears the hosts were unaware of the production error and continued to discuss the story with Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts.

It comes just three months after Phillip Schofield and ITV agreed to pay Tory peer Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name.

Schofield attempted to bring this to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning in November but inadvertently allowed the list of names to be seen by viewers.

It led to a grovelling apology from ITV and Schofield and a giant settlement with Lord McAlpine's legal team.

MailOnline understands publishers in the United States, France and Germany have also bought the set of Kate pictures for more than £100,000 in total.

Italian gossip magazine Chi, which caused outrage when it published a photograph of Princess Diana as she lay dying, splashed pictures of the duchess and her growing baby bump across its front page.

Speaking about the publication on This Morning, Mail political sketch writer Quentin Letts said: 'The magazine is called Chi, perhaps it should be called cheap, and it is owned by the old groper himself, Silvio Berlusconi, the Bunga Bunga man.

'There are people saying this is an invasion of privacy. I think they may be right.'

Kate, who is about four months pregnant, is wearing a bright blue 
halter-neck bikini with her slightly rounded stomach clearly visible.

Her arm is draped over her husband’s shoulders while William, who is 
wearing blue baggy shorts and sunglasses, has an arm protectively around
his wife’s back.

The headline on the front of Chi, which goes on sale today, reads ‘Kate and William – honeymoon for three’.

The magazine also has pictures of Kate's sister Pippa, who is seen walking hand-in-hand with a mystery man.

The Duchess's sibling is in a striped pink and black bikini and her slim companion is topless, wearing dark swimming shorts emblazoned with multi-coloured stars.

In another shot the couple are seen walking along on the famous Mustique white sands with Pippa's brother James, who is also on the island along with parents Carole and Michael.

Alfonso Signorini, editor of Chi magazine, has defended his decision to print the images.

He told the BBC: 'The photographs, which can in no way be considered scandalous, were bought from an international photo agency, do not harm the image of the protagonists and the reaction of the media seems to me wholly over the top.

'Moreover, the photographs can hardly be considered an invasion of privacy when the subjects are public figures in a public place, in the open air; specifically on a beach surrounded by other bathers.'

He told Italian news website Corriere.it : 'You can't compare it with the media persecution of Lady D (Diana, Princess of Wales). I repeat: the photos were taken in a public place.'

Woman's Day editor Fiona Connolly said she had no qualms about running the pictures, insisting they were taken by a fellow tourist on Mustique – and not a paparazzo.

She said the royal couple are not a ‘protected species’ outside Britain.

'This is not a hard decision. Kate's on a public beach, there are other holiday-makers there and she looks fabulous,' she said, adding: 'As
Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on
the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive 
here'.

The Royal couple are two of the world's most 
recognisable people but it can be a struggle to guard their privacy, 
which is why they headed for the private island of Mustique

Last night, royal sources said William, in particular, still felt ‘very 
bruised’ about the fresh breach of privacy so soon after the same 
magazine splashed topless photographs of Kate across its front page 
beneath the headline ‘the queen is naked’.

The source said William felt very strongly at the time that he had somehow ‘failed’ to protect his wife.

The intimate photographs are thought to have been taken from a boat using a long lens camera.

Chi magazine, which is owned by former
Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, boasts: ‘The extraordinary 
images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their dream holiday in 
the Caribbean.

‘The future mum, now four months pregnant, wore a tiny bikini which showed off her visible bump.’

Tweets: The mistake today prompted people to go on Twitter to express their disbelief at what happened

Australian magazine Woman's Day has also printed the pictures, as well as photographs of Kate's sister Pippa in a bikini, claiming they were taken by a member of the public on a public beach.

Editor Fiona Connolly said the royal couple are not a ‘protected species’ outside Britain adding: 'This is not a hard decision. Kate's on a public beach, there are other holiday-makers there and she looks fabulous.'

However, Mustique is a private island and there is an expectation of privacy for anyone holidaying there because the paparazzi is banned.

Mrs Connolly said: 'As Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here.

'Our readers are going to love these photos. I don't expect any backlash at all really. I think she's looking fabulous and healthy and (with) a beautiful bump, like we haven't seen her before.'

It is not the first time an Australian magazine has published photos of royals against the wishes of the royal family.

Royal storm: Australian magazine Woman's Day has produced this poster advertising their next edition out on Monday

One of the most controversial 
decisions was made by New Idea magazine - engaged in a bitter 
publication war with Woman's Day - which revealed in 2008 that Prince 
Harry had been posted to Afghanistan, putting the royal at risk.

Yesterday a spokesman for St James’s 
Palace said: ‘We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and 
Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas.

‘This is a clear breach of the couple’s right to privacy.’

Today the Palace would not comment further or speculate about whether they would launch any kind of legal action.

A palace source said: ‘It’s violating’. The duke and duchess, who are expecting their first child in July, flew to a £19,000-a-week luxury villa on the island of Mustique last week.

Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and her sister Pippa, flew out at the same time and are renting a villa nearby.

Bikini photographs of Pippa are also being touted for sale, and they are also set to be published.

Mustique,
a private island with just 74 villas and one small hotel, is where 
Princess Margaret once had a holiday home and is frequented by stars 
including Mick Jagger.

Kate
and William, who were accompanied by a team of bodyguards, have chosen 
the island for seven of their last eight holidays because of the privacy
it affords them.

Mustique 
is patrolled both on-shore and off-shore by the island’s private 
security team, but they failed to spot the paparazzi waiting for the 
couple to emerge on the beach.
