Alan Pardew crossed his hands and looked to the heavens as a tearful Ryan Taylor – injured on his first league start in 32 months - made his way down the tunnel holding the same knee which has caused him two years of pain.

The Newcastle boss will have to wait and see if his prayers are answered on that front. But at least the divine and devastating intervention of Moussa Sissoko ensured a fifth win on the spin in the Premier League, lifting them, albeit briefly, to fourth in the table. To give their ascent some context, the Magpies were in the relegation zone just five weeks ago.

Pardew, though, admitted that the victory was marred by the injury to Taylor, who was making his St James’ Park comeback after successive cruciate-ligament injuries.

‘We’re sweating on Ryan,’ said Pardew, who revealed that Dr Richard Steadman, the renowned surgeon who operated on Taylor, was in the stands as a guest of the player.

‘Fortunately, his surgeon was here from America and he went to hospital with him for a scan.

‘So the win was tinged with sadness. Ryan is a person who does not deserve the trauma he’s had already, let alone another trauma. Fingers crossed he’s okay.’

Pardew added: ‘When you’re a manager you live through some of that pain and we've had many chats trying to keep his spirits up.

‘I don’t want to go down that line with him again. I want him to come in and say “it was a bit of a scare, I’m okay.”’

Sissoko’s brilliant winner came 12 minutes from time, forging his way into the penalty area before swapping passes with Sammy Ameobi and hooking beyond Rob Green, who had repelled all thrown at him to that point.

The France international was skippering the side in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini and was the game’s stand-out player.

‘Moussa was the best player on the pitch by some distance,’ said Pardew.

‘We had a long discussion about the captaincy and I wanted to make sure it did not knock him out of kilt. Sometimes it can take your mind off the game.

‘But he grew with the armband. It was a wonderful goal.’

Harry Redknapp, meanwhile, saw his side remain bottom of the table after a sixth straight loss on the road.

The Londoners were without pacey frontman Eduardo Vargas, and that, says the manager, cost them dear.

‘When you play away from home you need pace on the break, and we’re not blessed with that,’ he said.

‘We missed Vargas, he’s done very well. He wanted to be with his wife who was having a baby, and that’s fair enough.’

Pardew’s side, though, had deserved the maximum return.

It was Taylor who dictated the tempo from the centre of the park early on. One cleverly-crafted corner saw Remy Cabella locate Taylor lurking unmarked on the fringe of the area. He used one touch to cushion and the next to draw a palmed save from Green.

Cabella – enjoying his first home start since September – was again the architect behind Taylor’s next chance – a measured curler from 20 yards – but again Green kept it goalless.

Taylor then took aim with a free-kick from range – slamming it into the wall – before succumbing to injury. St James’ – like Pardew – looked to the sky in hope when the 30-year-old plonked himself on the turf and signalled to the bench that he had a problem. But the look on Taylor’s face told its own story and he received a standing ovation as he limped from the field.

The second period did not come to life until just before the hour mark when Sissoko set off on a galloping run from deep inside his own half. Covering fully 50 yards unopposed, he slid Ayoze Perez through on goal but again it was Green who proved United’s nemesis.

It was always going to take an individual effort to break the deadlock and that moment arrived courtesy of Sissoko.

Home thoughts, however, very quickly turned to Taylor.
