Fashion label Marc Jacobs has launched a new collection of S&M-style accessories, including a studded whip, leather handcuffs and a collar and leash.

The collection, which is a collaboration with New York-based leather brand Zana Bayne, was launched online and in select stores earlier this week, with prices ranging from $65, for a pair of leather nipple pasties, to $240 for the heart-shaped riding crop.

No doubt inspired by the upcoming big screen adaptation of best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, the collection is described as the ideal 'cheeky and sexy' gift for your loved one this Valentine's Day.

Giddy up: The collection's most expensive piece is this $240 riding crop

Something for everyone: For those with a slightly smaller budget, this mini whip key chain could be the perfect gift option this Valentine's Day

I want it all: Thus far the collection has received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media, with many praising the designer's decision to take on such a risque project

Close your eyes... The collection appears to be inspired by the upcoming big screen adaptation of erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, however it is not officially connected with the movie

And despite the somewhat saucy nature of the pieces, designer Zana Bayne insists that they can - and should - be shown off outside of the bedroom.

'The best thing about the collaboration is that they are pieces that you can display and show off,' she told Vogue. 

'They make for great conversation starters, and are perfect to wear to a party or a masquerade. 

'Not to mention, they are definitely wicked little gifts.'

Ms Bayne added that the leather collar and cuff could absolutely be worn as accessories in their own right - although she suggested that the wearer might want to remove the chain-metal leash which normally connects the two.

No peeking: Marc Jacobs' collaboration with leather brand Zana Bayne also includes this $150 studded mask, which is available in black and red

For the bedroom - and beyond: Designer Zana Bayne believes that this $200 collar and cuff set could be worn as an everyday fashion accessory, while the key ring is one of the cheaper options from the collection

Valentine's Day gifts: The collection has been described as the perfect 'cheeky and sexy' gift to give your loved ones for the romantic holiday

All about the illusion: The collection's $65 leather pasties are intended to make it appear as though the wearer has had their nipples pierced

And to give the other-wise risque gifts an added dash of romance, each of the accessories come packaged in a more traditional red heart-shaped box, making them the perfect present to hand over to a loved one, no matter what holiday you are celebrating. 

Thus far the collection has had an incredibly positive response on social media, with many suggesting the kinky accessories will be going straight to the top of their Valentine's Day wish lists. 

'The Zana Bayne Marc Jacobs collab is literatlly everything I ever wanted!' one fashion fan tweeted, while another added: 'Wow wow wow, god do I want this [collection].'

Perhaps surprisingly, some Twitter users went as far as to suggest that the collection is disappointingly 'vanilla' for their tastes, insisting that the brands should have taken their collaboration a step further in terms of the risque element.

'Can we discuss the vanilla b******t that is the Marc Jacobs/Zana Bayne collaboration. DO BETTER,' one incensed fan commented. 

A second described the collection as 'interesting' but added that the designers 'could have done better' when it came to the accessories' shock factor. 

While Marc Jacobs' kinky collaboration does not appear to be officially affiliated with the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie, a number of official merchandise collections have already been launched in anticipation of the big screen release.

Earlier this week, UK-based lingerie company Bluebella announced the launch of its Black Label collection, a selection of seductive underwear which was inspired by the upcoming movie release and has even been given the seal of approval by Fifty Shades author EL James. 

The collection features lingerie which appears to cage and harness the wearer and was described by Ms James as 'luxurious, provocative and elegantly erotic'.
