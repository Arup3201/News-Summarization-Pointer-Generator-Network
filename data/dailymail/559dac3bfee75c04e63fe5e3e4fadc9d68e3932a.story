Women are grossly underrepresented in professional football, both in terms of TV coverage of female games and in the number of women working in the male section of the sport. 

Those that do venture into men's football are often subjected to regular abuse - according to the campaign group Women In Football, two thirds of females working in the industry have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment. 

So a female lineswoman who was filmed talking back to the Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro during the Campeonato Paulista match on Sunday has been heralded a hero by fellow members of her sex.

Tatiane approaches Ponte Preta footballer Biro Biro to argue back against a criticism he had about one of her decisions 

During the match between Sao Paulo and Ponte Preta, lineswoman Tatiane Sacilotti is seen to signal a throw-in.

But Biro Biro is not happy with the decision and heads over to Tatiane to give her a dressing down.

Unimpressed with the attack, Tatiane takes it upon herself to follow Biro back down the pitch, arguing back furiously. 

Shocked by the comeback, Biro then walks off with a wave of his hand, so Tatiane heads back to her post with a fuming backwards glance.

The clip has since been shared hundreds of times on social network sites.  

@CANNCDavis wrote on Twitter 'Looool Tatiane Sacilotti has made my day she was not having it.'

Another said: 'Brazilian lineswoman puts abusive player back in his box.' 

Tatiane is furious as she follows Biro Biro up the pitch 

As Biro Biro is shocked into heading back onto the pitch, Tatiane heads back to her post, shooting a glowering look back at her opponent  

It isn't the first time in recent years that a lineswoman has been headline news. 

In January 2011, TV commentators Andy Gray and Richard Keys, who apparently believed their microphones were switched off, were recorded making disparaging remarks about Sian Massey, 25, before Liverpool’s Premiership clash with Wolves.

Commenting on Ms Massey, Mr Keys said: ‘Somebody better get down there and explain offside to her.’

Mr Gray, a former Scottish international footballer, replied: ‘Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’

Mr Keys replied: ‘Course they don’t. I can guarantee you there will be a big one today. 

'Kenny (Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish) will go potty. This isn’t the first time, is it? Didn’t we have one before?’

Gray’s contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon after. 

Name: Tatiane Sacilotti Dos Santos Camargo

Born: Brazil, February 10, 1986 

Age: 29 

Job title: Assistant referee  

Tatiana faced much abuse during her junior years as a referee, including being spat at by fans. 

By 2011, she had graduated to the premier league in Brazil though, where she has stayed ever since. 

Tatiana's dream is to work up the career ladder at FIFA and her idol is the Brazilian referee Luis Flavio de Oliveira. 

To substitute her income as a referee, Tatiane has launched a pancake delivery service with her mother Antoinette called House of Pancake, which sells 29 different recipes. 

The family, who are descended from Italians, run the company together - Tatiane and her mother make the pancakes and her father and brother deliver the produce. 

When she is not busy with one of her jobs, Tatiane is deeply religious and regularly attends church in Cachoeira.

She also exercises daily with a personal trainer, where she does circuit training and runs eight km. 

Speaking of her parents' reaction to her training as a referee, she told refnews.com: 'She supported me at the time. 

'My mother does not even like football but she watches all of my games and requires complete silence in the room and bites her nails. 

'She gets mad when they say I messed up, but she does not know whether it was right or wrong. 

'Her support has been very good.'

Although she is well respected in the game, Tatiane continues to suffer abuse from men in the game occasionally. 

During one incident in 2013, a footballer complained about one of her decisions and assaulted her. 

Tatiane said: 'He complained much of a marking mine. 

'I asked him to calm down and put a hand on his chest. 

'Then he slapped me, but it was light, not reported to the referee.'
