Even for the man universally known as Jaws, it would have been a rather difficult concept to swallow.

Almost three years ago, upon the resignation of Fabio Capello as England manager, Harry Redknapp briefly seemed destined to succeed the Italian in the post.

Fresh from his acquittal of two charges of cheating the public revenue, he seemed - in the public’s eyes at least - a hand-in glove fit.

Scotland beat Ireland and will want to dispatch of England at Celtic Park on Tuesday

Joe Jordan still has the same thirst to see Scotland beat England as he has done all his life

For Joe Jordan - Scotland legend, hammer of the Auld Enemy, scourge of defenders in three World Cups and right-hand man to the then Tottenham manager, a very difficult question appeared to lie around the corner.

John Gorman had famously assisted Glenn Hoddle at France ’98 but, although a proud Scot, Joe Jordan he was not.

In the end, the question was never asked. Just as they had done to Brian Clough back in the day, the FA overlooked the best man for the job, on this occasion in favour of Roy Hodgson.

Looking back now, that decision remains a mystery to Jordan. As much, indeed, as the answer he’d have given Redknapp had he asked him to become England No 2.

‘There was certainly speculation about Harry and I thought he was a certainty,’ said Jordan. ‘I don’t know how things would have gone - and no disrespect to anyone else who was in the running - but I just thought Harry was a stick on. I’ve worked with him for 10 years. He would have been spot on for a national team job.’

So, momentarily stepping into the hypothetical, how would he have answered the question that inevitably would have followed?

‘I don’t really know,’ Jordan smiled. ‘It was never something we discussed. We were in the running for a Champions League place and ended up fourth. Chelsea won the Champions League, though, so that was us out.

‘Would I have gone as his No 2? He’d have needed to have asked me! It would have been a big decision for me. But it never came up.’

Some things are better left unsaid. Ahead of Tuesday’s encounter with England at Celtic Park, it’s evident Jordan’s thirst for defeating the Auld Enemy has never been quenched.

He enjoyed heady days with Leeds, Manchester United and AC Milan but none glossed over those epic encounters with the English.

‘I played in nine Scotland vs England games. The only one I didn’t play in was ’75 because we were in the European Cup final and all the Leeds players were exempt except for Gordon McQueen. He’d been sent off in the semi-final against Barcelona.

‘I made my debut against England in ‘73. It came a wee bit out the blue because Willie Ormond had said I still had a bit to do. But Leeds played AC Milan in the Cup Winners’ Cup and I was called up immediately after that game. That was special. You can’t get away from winning your first cap.

‘But the following year, ‘74, was a great year for me at Leeds and we all travelled up after playing a testimonial at Middlesbrough. There was the story about wee Jimmy (Johnstone) rowing out to sea before the game. I still laugh about it.

‘But on the day, he performed. It was just before the World Cup and we were the only home nation who’d qualified, so there was pressure on us to perform. That was a huge game because it would have been a damp squib if we’d lost to England at Hampden in front of 100,000. But we won and that was a great memory.’

England's 100 per cent start continued with a 3-1 win over Slovenia but Scotland will not fear them

Despite being eliminated at the group stage in Germany that summer whilst unbeaten, mental images of that tournament, together with Argentina ’78 and Spain ’82, remain cherished.

They also serve as a reminder to Jordan as to what reaching a major finals means for the chief protagonists.

‘I remember Billy Bremner - and he was never a bragger, he did it on the pitch. But he wanted to show he was better by doing it on the pitch. He wanted to show he was better than the other guys in the World Cup.

‘You don’t need to do anything else after that, because you’ve done it and you are bracketed up there with those players.’

For the first time in seven years, Scotland’s hopes of qualifying for a first major competition since France 1998 looks to be built on more than just blind faith.

Gordon Strachan has put wind in our sails again. In a section destined to go to the wire, Jordan is reluctant to call the race just yet but there’s no disguising his admiration for how events have turned.

‘I would not like to put more pressure on them by talking about that (qualification). But it’s very encouraging what has happened. It’s very much a Scotland team. The parts are there but when you put it together it becomes a team bigger than the parts. If I was in charge of a team that’s what I’d like to see. You have a growth in experience and in the spirit of the team.’

Wayne Rooney is one player England can rely on, and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at Parkhead

Jordan played in an era when Scotland could afford to overlook a European Cup-winning captain like Nottingham Forest’s John McGovern.

But while we will surely never again see such rich options at our disposal, the QPR No2 feels a sense of strength in depth has at least returned.

‘What’s emerged recently is competition for places. I don’t think it was that intense two or three years ago. Now you have players playing at a better level and they have an eye on others competing for their position. That’s great for the manager.’

Left-back is a prime example. With Steven Whittaker required on the right and Phil Bardsley injured, Andrew Robertson has performed with aplomb.

As a man who once made the trip from Morton to Leeds as a teenager, Jordan is thrilled to see Robertson cope with the transition to Premiership football with Hull as well as the international scene.

‘He’s done really well. He played against us in the opening game of the season. He’s a good player but there’s one thing being a good player - it’s another thing altogether taking on what comes with being an international player. He’s shown great maturity and has taken it in his stride.’

Jordan’s growing confidence in those who now wear the dark blue does not stretch to him predicting what would be a famous win tomorrow. But oh how he’d relish one.

‘It would be an easier place for me to go back to if Scotland win!’ he laughed. ‘The rivalry doesn’t get talked about much as the game doesn’t happen as often but it’s been a conversation in the last few weeks at QPR as I’m sure it’s been at other clubs. I enjoy that. What did the English think? The usual.’

Perhaps it’s best that question was never asked of him.
