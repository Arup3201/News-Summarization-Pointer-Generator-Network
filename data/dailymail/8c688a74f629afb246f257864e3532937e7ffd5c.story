Jesus Navas has warned the Premier League to expect a World Cup backlash from Manchester City's stars this season.

Navas was devastated to be left out of the Spain squad along with Alvaro Negredo, and could only watch as many of his City teammates endured a disappointing tournament in Brazil.

David Silva was unable to prevent the holders going out at the group stage, Joe Hart and James Milner also made an early exit with England, Yaya Toure disappointed for Ivory Coast, and Fernandinho was caught up in Brazil's disastrous collapse.

Even though Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis reached the final with Argentina, it ended in tears with a heartbreaking extra-time defeat to Germany.

'Certainly I think there will be more hunger for us to win things this season now,' said Navas, who modelled City's new away kit which was unveiled in New York on Friday.

'We've got enough talent in the team to win the Premier League again and hopefully the Champions League as well. The quality is there and that will show.

'Winning the title in my first season at City was a dream come true but the downside was not being selected for Spain's World Cup squad. I was extremely disappointed and for me it's very important to have this season to keep playing and be selected for Spain going forward.' 

Navas revealed that the Premier League champions have placed particular importance on Europe this season.

Manuel Pellegrini led City past the group stage for the first time in his first year at the club but they were beaten by Barcelona at the first knockout stage.

'Obviously we need to aim higher and the Champions League is the next step,' said the Spain winger. 'It would be great to win the title again but obviously the Champions League is the target this year. We went past the group stage of the Champions League last season so the aim is to go as far as we possibly can.'

A number of City’s World Cup contingent, including Toure, Hart, Milner and Edin Dzeko, returned to training at the team’s New Jersey base on Friday. City will fly to Pittsburgh on Saturday ahead of their second tour game against AC Milan, although those players are unlikely to feature before the fourth fixture against Olympiacos next weekend.
