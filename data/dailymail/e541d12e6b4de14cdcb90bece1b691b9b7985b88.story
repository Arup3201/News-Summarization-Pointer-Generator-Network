When these conifers were first planted in a front garden on a residential street, the neighbour next door fondly hoped they might be miniatures.

But 30ft later, it’s abundantly clear that the trees are full-size – and after 17 years the dispute between the two homes has escalated to the point where the families only communicate by letter.

Furious Ken Elliott, 55, is at war with Dale Woolley, 59, who has let the trees grow so high they completely obscure his house from the road in Cannock, Staffordshire.

Outrage: Neighbour Ken Elliott, pictured outside his own house, is up in arms about the oversized trees

The roots of the row go back to 1996,
when Mr Elliott asked his neighbours if they could uproot a dividing 
hedge and build a wall to separate the two homes.

Mr Elliott paid for a contractor to 
remove the hedge and offered to buy the Woolleys mini-conifers by way of
compensation, an offer that was turned down.

However, some months later the 
Elliotts noticed that conifers had been planted in their neighbours’ 
garden and it soon became apparent that they were not miniatures.

A laurel tree also in the front garden has been cut back at Mr Elliott’s request but has grown back again.

Feud: The next-door neighbours no longer talk and communicate their anger by letter

Now former miner Mr Elliott is preparing to launch a legal battle to have the trees cut down to size.

Last night he said: ‘It’s an eyesore. We cut it on our side but there’s only so far we can reach.

‘We don’t open our front curtains any more because then we haven’t got to face it.’

But Mr Woolley’s son Tristan, 29,  said: ‘The trees don’t affect their light.’

He added: ‘When I come outside to have a cigarette, it’s like being in your own private forest. The birds love it.’

Cannock Chase Council planning 
projects officer John Heminsley said Mr Elliott has been told he could 
make a formal complaint to the council asking for officers to 
investigate.

He said: ‘Mr Elliott chose not to pursue this matter and the council have had no further contact from him about this point.’
