A factory fire in China resulted in some eye-catching smoke formations, as huge dark rings were pictured rising from the flames.

The fire in the fibreglass factory near Henshui, Hebei province, saw authorities order local residents to remain inside due to the toxic smoke.

The rings seen above the fire are made up of unsaturated resins, which were contained in big round buckets in the factory, an expert said.

More than 200 square metres of buildings went up in flames when the factory was set alight on Tuesday.

An
 eyewitness told Yanzhao Metropolis Daily that there was an explosion 
and a fireball that rose a dozen metres (40ft) in the air, forming a 
huge smoke ring above the factory.

An
 expert consulted by the local newspaper said as unsaturated resins are 
particularly flammable, an instant combustion would see iron ‘blasted’ 
into the air, forming a smoke ring.

The fire was extinguished later on Tuesday, with no human casualties suffered.

An investigation into the cause of the explosion and subsequent fire has been launched.
