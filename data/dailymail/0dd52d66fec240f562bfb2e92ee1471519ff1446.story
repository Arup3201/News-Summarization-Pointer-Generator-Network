He's the robot boy who fights evil with his superhuman strength and now the Australian company behind The Lego Movie is set to make a live-action superhero film based on the popular cartoon character Astro Boy.

With production of the second and third Lego spin-off's set to start later this year in Sydney, animation company Animal Logic has signed on to reinterpret the classic Japanese manga series Astro Boy and producer Zareh Nalbandian has promised they will not disappoint.

Having sold over 100 million manga copies worldwide, Astro Boy is the kind of film an animation producer dreams of and for Nalbandian it's a chance for him to bring a beloved and iconic character to life.

'It is a big challenge but it’s also really exciting. It’s the kind of thing you dream of as a film-maker to be able to bring such a beloved and iconic character to life but in a way that’s never been done before,' Nalbandian told Daily Mail Australia.

Astro Boy, known in Japan as 'Mighty Atom' was created by Osamu Tezuka, who is considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney. 

The boy with the supernatural powers first appeared as a cartoon series from 1951 to 1968, set in a time where Japan was recovering from the atomic blasts during World War II. 

Astro Boy went on to become one of the most-loved cartoon characters ever created. Since his emergence, Astro Boy has been made into a TV animation series twice. He was also turned into feature length animation in Hollywood in 2009. 

Using his superpowers, including strength, jet flight, adjustable hearing and instant language translation, the cartoon character fights evil while possessing the kindness of a child.

Producer Nalbandian admits that there will be high expectations for the film from avid cartoon audiences, but believes he has the opportunity to make Astro Boy as big a success as Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. 

'We have high expectations. We won’t make a mediocre movie, this is a once in a generation opportunity to reinterpret Astro Boy for a 21st century audience,' Nalbandian said.

'Ultimately we've got the passion and we have the commitment but we need to partner with great writers and great film-makers and I think that right combination will empower us to do what we want to do.'

Nalbandian's impressive career spans over decades with films such as Walking with Dinosaurs 3D and Happy Feet under his belt. He knows what it takes to reinterpret a classic icon and bring him to the big screen and believes Astro Boy needs to be taken into the 21st Century to be a success.

The producer believes we are living in 'an exciting time' in film for the convergence of life-action, animation and visual effects and says anything is possible.

Nalbandian produced The Lego Movie last year 

It was a huge shock for Animal Logic that The Lego Movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar this year 

'We can’t stick to the TV series and we’re certainly not going to be referencing the 2009 animated movie. We really want us to reinterpret him in a very contemporary way.'

'If you look at Legend of the Guardians and more recently Lego and before that Walking with Dinosaurs or the Great Gatsby movie they're all very different but they all have one thing in common which is they break new ground,' he said, 

This will be the fist time Astro Boy will have ever been made into a Hollywood blockbuster film. Japan's Tezuka Productions have been very careful about who they let lay their hands on their prized possession.  

'They wanted to make sure that whoever did it would do justice to the property,' Nalbandian said. 

Happy Feet won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year in 2007

Nalbandian produced and worked on visual effects for the widely acclaimed film 

'There has been an explosion in this type of film in the last half a decade particularly and I think it’s a great time to bring him to the big screen as a live action superhero.

'Whether it’s Spiderman or Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy there is just such a love from audiences for this type of property so the timing is perfect.' he said. 

Nalbandian and Animal Logic are in the pre-production stages of the next instalment of the Lego movies. The first one will be called Lego Ninjago, based on a Lego toy line and the second film will go by the name Lego Batman, to be directed by Chris McKay who co-directed the first film. 

The company is also working on a Betty Boop movie, in collaboration with Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment. 

'They’re both (Lego movies) being produced out of Animal Logic in Sydney which is very exciting because it means that the people who worked on the first film will be able to continue to do great work on the second and third,' Nalbandian said. 

Nalbandian produced Walking with Dinosaurs 3D in 2013

The animation film depicted what it was like when dinosaurs walked the earth

'It really supports out animation industry in Australia and it supports long-term creative jobs so it’s not just about the films it’s about the industry as well. We’re really pleased it solidifies the position we’re in in Australia.'

in 2006, Nalbandian's work on Happy Feet contributed to the monumental Oscar win for the penguin film. However, he says he is 'perplexed' that The Lego Movie wasn't even nominated for an Oscar nod this year.

'I feel perplexed and disappointed and that’s being really honest,' Nalbandian said. 

'If you look at the amount of news that was generated when the Oscars were announced there was more news generated around why Lego didn't get a nomination than any other nomination actually announced so we weren't the only ones perplexed.'

Zareh Nalbandian worked on visual effects for The Great Gatsby. The film won over critics and was hailed a success 

Baz Lurhman worked with Nalbandian on the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan were the stars 

From Nalbandian's point of view, The Lego Movie was 'the most ground-breaking and most challenging animated film that was produced last year'.  

'It found the biggest audience in America of any animated film produced last year so all I can think is the Academy maybe was a little bit unsure because it was a toy brand. Perhaps they didn't understand the complexity of the film because we made it look too easy.'

Nalbandian said the Academy like to hold on to traditional methods of film making and believes there are not enough categories at the awards for animation movies.

'There’s not enough slots because if the Academy wants to keep supporting traditional animation and recognise innovative animation and animated story-telling, perhaps five slots is not enough. The funny thing the only bad review we had about Lego was someone actually said that they got sick of laughing so hard in the first 20 minutes.'
