BBC series Top Gear is to be launched in France - a country which banned two of the UK presenters of the show from its roads last year.

A version of the programme is to be made locally by BBC Worldwide France for the broadcaster RMC Decouverte and will begin filming in the next few months for screening next year.

Presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond were pulled over for speeding while filming the programme's Perfect Road Trip DVD, prompting a temporary ban and fines.

The French broadcaster already shows the original UK versions of the programme, delivering some of its highest ratings.

The Top Gear format has been sold to countries such as Australia, South Korea and the US, and a Chinese version will launch later this year.

Adam Waddell, the director of entertainment brands for BBC Worldwide, said: 'The French have some amazing roads and incredible scenery which is why Top Gear UK has often filmed there.

'Now French petrol heads are going to have their own version of the programme and I have no doubt that the hosts will bring their own personality and sense of humour to the new show. I can't wait to watch it develop.'

BBC Worldwide France has produced other formats in the country including The Great Bake Off, The Weakest Link, Antiques Roadshow and Dancing With The Stars, the international version of Strictly Come Dancing.

Clarkson on the Lotus Elise: 'This car is more fun than the entire French air force crashing into a firework factory.'

On the Renault Clio V6: 'I think the problem is that it's French. It's a surrendermonkey.'

On the Peguet 407: 'The 407 is like one of those French films you sometimes find on FilmFour in the middle of the night. It promises much and it delivers plenty of pubic hair. But somehow that isn’t really enough.'

Responding to derogatory comments presenters made about 'lazy' and 'feckless' Mexican car, a BBC spokesman said:  'Our own comedians make jokes about the British being terrible cooks and terrible romantics, and we in turn make jokes about the Italians being disorganised and over dramatic, the French being arrogant and the Germans being over-organised,'

Le Stig? There may be another white-suited driver when the show is produced across The Channel

Top Gear is broadcast in 170 different countries and attracts 350 million viewers per week - making it one of the BBC's most popular programmes and one of its biggest commercial successes.

It started as a conventional motoring magazine show in 1977 but has developed and, especially since its 2002 relaunch, has built a reputation as one of the most comical but controversial shows on television. 

As its popularity increased, so did its international appeal, and the show's global spin-offs have been a huge revenue driver for the corporation.

Versions of the programme have been made in Australia, Russia, the United States and South Korea. 

The UK version of the show is also shown in hundreds of countries in a variety of different languages. 

Its success forms a large part of the £156millon that BBC Worldwide made in the 12 months to March this year and the £1billion the commercial arm has generated since it was set up in 2007.

The magazine is published in 31 countries and even Top Gear Stunt School- a £1.99 iPhone and iPad app - has been downloaded at least 2.4m times.

DVDs produced by the motoring team have also been a big money spinner, with The Perfect Road Trip being named the UK's best-selling DVD in 2013.

In 2012, BBC Worldwide paid £8.4 million for Clarkson’s stake in a joint venture which had owned the commercial rights to Top Gear.

The presenter made more than £14million from the programme as the BBC moved to take full control of the hit series' production company.
