In the summer of 2012, 'young and amazed' British teenager Chijindu Ujah had his photograph taken with Usain Bolt when the Jamaican superstar stopped by Lee Valley Athletics Centre in north London for a training session. 

Two years on, Ujah has already joined the elite club of 100-metre sprinters who have broken the fabled 10-second barrier.

The 20-year-old's astonishing 9.96-second run in Hengelo, Holland, on Sunday made him the third quickest British sprinter.

After he finished sixth in the 2012 world junior 100m final in Barcelona, won by Britain's Adam Gemili, few could have predicted Ujah would be the first of this talented pair to dip below 10 seconds. His rise has come so quickly that Ujah does not have an agent and the €3,000 (£2,400) in prize-money from Sunday's race was his biggest payday.

The invitations will come thick and fast and Ujah is keen to seize the chance to test himself against Bolt when the world-record holder eventually starts his 2014 season after recovering from a foot injury.

'Most definitely,' he said. 'It's every sprinter's dream to get on the line with the best people in the world and compete to the best of their ability. (Bolt) has raised the bar and everybody now feels they can go under the 10-second barrier. 'I don't put any barriers on going sub-10. The times will come, there's still a lot for me to improve on. It seems surreal. When people say to me that I'm among some great guys in history... it hasn't really sunk in.'

It was not long ago that a  16-year-old known as 'CJ' or 'Chinji' stopped playing football in the local leagues to concentrate on athletics. Last year he told a national newspaper he would become a rapper if a career on the track did not work out.

Ujah, whose parents are of Nigerian descent, studied applied sciences at college, spent a year at the University of Hertfordshire and is weighing up starting a degree in business management in September. The interim period promises to be a very exciting time not just for Ujah, but for British sprinting in general. 

Such is the strength in depth over 100m, Ujah will not  represent England at this summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. His 2014 target is therefore to represent Great Britain at the European Championships in Zurich in August.

Ujah is part of coach Jonas Tawiah-Dodoo's promising group of sprinters including Sean Safo-Antwi, 23, and Deji Tobais, 22, as well as Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford, an 'inspirational and motivating' mentor for Ujah.

And with Loughborough-based athletes such as James Dasaolu, Richard Kilty, Dwain Chambers and Gemili also vying for selection this  summer, the men's 100m at the British trials later this month promises to be quite a spectacle.

Ujah said: 'This is what British sprinting has needed for a long time now. Quite a few guys have gone sub-10.2 and are making the trials look very exciting. Things are really hotting up in British sprinting. It could be at the stage where the British trials become harder than getting to a European final.

'It's definitely exciting but I like those moments and hopefully it can bring out the best in me and the other athletes and we can drive each other to superb times and make the world alert.'

Ujah is part of the National Lottery-funded British Athletics World Class Performance  Programme and is set to compete at the Sainsbury's British Championships from June 27 to 29.
