Survivors of the Costa Concordia disaster returned to the scene of the shipwreck to mark the one-year anniversary, defying a request from the cruise company that they stay away.

In the days before the Sunday ceremony, owners Costa Crociere sent a letter to all passengers who survived the capsizing, and asked them not to travel to the Italian island of Giglio for ‘logistical reasons’.

Undeterred, some of the 3,200 surviving passengers, and relatives of the 32 who lost their lives, were taken by boat close to the wreck.

Anniversary: Silence is observed during a Catholic mass to commemorate the Costa Concordia disaster near the shipwreck on the island of Giglio, located off the coast of Tuscany, on Sunday night

They watched as a crane lowered part of a rock that was removed from the hull of the 950 ft long ship into the water. The rock has been carved into a memorial and adorned with a plaque. 

A Catholic Mass was held in memory of the tragedy after which the islanders, passengers and relatives gathered observed a minute's silence at 9.45 - the time of the ship's collision with the rocks off the coast of Giglio.

‘After a year we are still traumatised,’ said Violet Morreau, a survivor from France, who was in the restaurant area with 10 family members the ship hit the rocks before keeling over on its side off the Tuscan island.

‘No one told us what to do. We were scared of dying, like the people who did lose their lives, because of somebody else's recklessness,’ Morreau said.

‘I remember the shock, we weren't able to understand what was happening,’ said Anna di Pavia, who was on the cruise with her husband and 1-year-old son.

In honour: The participants joined in a torchlight procession on Giglio Island close to the wreckage, and placed the torched to light up the commemorative plaque with the names of those who died in the disaster

Close by: The Costa Concordia can be seen in the background as lanterns are lit and sent up in the sky to honour the lives lost

Never forget: The vigil was held near the shipwreck and also saw the unveiling of a commemorative plaque on part of one of the rocks removed from the hull of the ship

‘We are here to thank the inhabitants 
of Giglio, but we are also here to seek answers that never seem to 
arrive. How could something like this have happened?’ she said.

Taking
part in the anniversary commemoration was Captain Gregorio De Falco of 
the Italian coast guard, who became something of a hero to survivors 
after his recorded conversations with Schettino during the evacuation 
were made public.

In them, 
Capt De Falco excoriated Schettino for having abandoned the ship before 
all passengers were off and ordered him to return.

Capt
De Falco said he wanted to go to Giglio to ‘embrace the victims, and 
the relatives of the victims.’ He added that he has shied from media 
attention since the disaster out of respect for the victims.

‘I'm not a hero,’ he told reporters in Giglio on Sunday. ‘I just did my job.’

For them: Islanders, relatives and survivors all gathered at Molo Rosso on the island of Giglio to attend the mass and hold a minute's silence at 9.45pm the moment the accident took place

Indian waiter Russel Rebello was one 
of the two victims whose bodies were never recovered. Kevin Rebello, his
brother, spent weeks on Giglio in the aftermath of the disaster 
awaiting word of the fate of his sibling and said he could not sleep 
ahead of Sunday's anniversary.

‘I
have been constantly thinking it is going to be again the same agony, 
even tonight, because it is going to be the same exact moment when all 
this happened,’ he said on Sunday. ‘So my heart is beating a bit faster I
guess.’

The letter asking 
people not to travel to Giglio for the ceremony, sent by Costa Crociere,
sparked fury among survivors last week.

Anne
Decre, of the French Survivors’ Collective of Costa Concordia 
passengers, says that the company ‘has had an inhumane and unacceptable 
attitude from the start.’

Costa Crociere has asked survivors to
appreciate its position, stating in the letter that they are 'certain 
that you will understand the impossibility – for logistical reasons – of
welcoming you all onto the island that day, and the desire for privacy 
expressed by the families of the victims at such a difficult moment.’

It adds that the company ‘sincerely shares the pain and sadness’ of those who were caught up in the disaster.

Ms Decre has accused the company of 
trying to funnel survivors towards one of several parallel ceremonies 
that will be taking place around the world.

'They tried to buy our silence by offering us €125 (£102) to go to Paris.

'The islanders understand us. We want to come also so we can thank them for what they did that night.’

Loss of life: The Costa Concordia went capsized on January 13 2012 with 4,252 passengers and crew on board, 32 lives could not be saved

Salvage crews are working on 
refloating the wreck in what would be the largest ever operation of its 
kind. U.S. firm Titan Salvage said on Saturday the ship would be removed
by September at the latest.

The
114,500-tonne liner will be pulled upright by cranes, helped by tanks 
attached to its sides filled with air, and the ship will be towed to an 
Italian port and broken up.

The
vessel's owner Costa Cruises, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, now 
expects the removal to cost £248 million, more than its original £186 
million estimate.

A total of 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it sank. Whilst 30 bodies have been recovered, two people are still missing, presumed dead.

Accused: Captain Francesco Schettino

Captain Francesco Schettino became known as Captain Coward and ‘the most unpopular man in Italy’ after he abandoned Costa Concordia after it ran aground with hundreds of passengers still on board.

The transcript of the conversation between him and Captain Gregorio De Falco show that despite Cpt. De Falco demanding that he ‘vada a bordo, cazzo!’ - ‘get the f*** back on board’ - he refused.

Half-an-hour before the accident, the 52-year-old was seen dining with 25-year-old Domnica Cemortan, a Moldovian cruise rep on the ship, reported by several other crewmembers to have been his mistress.

A suitcase containing her belongings, including her underwear, was later recovered by divers from the Captain’s cabin.

At an inquest into the tragedy, Ms Cemortan admitted that she was in love with the captain and that she was on the bridge when the ship struck the reef, but that she was not Schettino’s lover.

Captain Schettino was doing a ‘sail by salute’ and has defended his navigation, saying he was ‘familiar with the seabed’ and that he hit the rocks, known as Le Scole, because they were not on his navigation charts.

Mr Schettino faces accusations of is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.

He has admitted to making mistakes, but says he should not be the only one blamed.

Prosecutors say he caused the accident by sailing the vessel too close to shore, but Mr Schettino argues he managed to prevent a worse disaster by steering into shallow waters after the impact to help the rescue operation.

Investigations
have concluded and prosecutors plan to submit a request by the end of 
January to indict the captain and up to eight others. A judge will then 
decide if there is enough evidence for trial.

Chief Prosecutor Francesco Verusio said in December Mr Schettino faces up to 20 years in jail.

Shortly before a pre-trial hearing held in October, Mr Schettino attempted to sue for wrongful dismissal.
