Queensland beachgoers are being warned to keep a sharp lookout for poisonous sea snakes during this time of year.

The Australia Zoo Rescue Unit found five sea snakes washed up on beaches across the Sunshine Coast this week and were taken to the wildlife hospital.

Four sea snakes including two elegant sea snakes from Kawana, an olive headed sea snake from Coolum and a yellow bellied sea snake from Peregian were spotted on Tuesday.

Sea snakes, also known as coral reef snakes are venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for most or all of their lives. 

Symptoms of envenomation include muscle pain and stiffness, drooping eyelids, drowsiness and vomiting, and a serious bite can lead to total paralysis and death.

Anyone suspected of being bitten by a sea snake should seek medical attention immediately, even if the bite appears trivial (sea snake bites are initially painless and show no sign of swelling or discolouration).

These species has caused fatalities overseas, however none have been recorded in Australia.

The team found another olive headed sea snake from Peregian on Friday.

But before the hospital could treat them, one of the elegant sea snakes and a yellow bellied sea snake died from injuries.

Australia Zoo Rescue Unit manager Toby Millyard told Sunshine Coast Daily that he is encouraging people to be aware that these reptiles were common during this time of year.

'Sea snakes can fall victim to large, strong swells causing them to wash ashore,' said Mr Millyard.

'Sometimes they are found to be ill or injured and require veterinary treatment however those that wash up from exhaustion often require a check-up and time to recover before they're released back to the wild.

'You can tell a sea snake from a land snake due to their paddle-shaped tails and if found, it's important not to pick them up as they are venomous - call the Rescue Unit for assistance,' he said.

Sea snakes are collected and handled by the Australia Zoo Rescue Unit before taking them to the wildlife hospital for treatment
