A U.S. Army veteran believed to be struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder from his time at war threw himself in front of oncoming traffic on Friday night in Texas, a horrifying incident witnessed by his family and law enforcement officers.

Cederick Hill of Killeen, Texas, was traveling with family members along Highway 149 at around 10pm when he began threatening to commit suicide.

The 34-year-old pulled onto the roadside and left the vehicle as his family dialed 911. 

The vehicle above smashed into Cederick Hill after he jumped in front of oncoming traffic on a Texas highway. The Army veteran had been threatening to commit suicide while driving with his family

Hill's family said he was struggling with PTSD from his time at war

Two police units from nearby Lakeport, Texas, arrived on the scene to find Hill walking along the shoulder of the road, KLTV reported. 

He assured the officers that he was fine and simply wanted to walk for a bit. 

But moments later, as the officers began walking to his family's car, Hill suddenly lunged onto the highway and was killed instantly after an oncoming car hit him and he tumbled into the windshield. 

'Hill was calm, he was assuring (the officers) that he was fine, he didn't intend to harm himself or anyone else,' said Lieutenant Kirk Haddix of the Gregg County Sheriff's Office. 'Seconds later, he was dead.'

The driver of the vehicle that hit him, who was unharmed, kept driving for another mile before coming to a halt

'The man that hit him didn't see him walk out in front of traffic,' Haddix said. 'He was basically in a state of shock.' 

Hill's family said he was suffering from PTSD. 

'We will be speaking with the family to get some more information about his previous mental state,' Haddix said. 'There's nothing officers could have done to stop it..'

The Gregg County Sheriff's Office declared the incident a suicide. There will be no investigation or autopsy.
