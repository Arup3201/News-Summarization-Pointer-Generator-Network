As the Everly Brothers, they rewrote the rock ’n’ roll rule book and became one of the most influential acts in musical history. But a heartbroken Don Everly last night said he wanted to mark the death of his brother Phil by remembering the man – not the legend.

In an emotional tribute, Don said: ‘I loved my brother very much. I always thought I’d be the one to go first. The world might be mourning an Everly Brother, but I’m mourning my brother Phil Everly.’

Don, 76, revealed he was listening to one of Phil’s compositions just before he was told that his brother had died at the age of 74.

He said: ‘It was one of my favourite 
songs that Phil wrote. I took that as a special spiritual message from 
Phil saying goodbye.’

brother Phil Everly’

Don said the love he felt for his brother survived any personal difference they had – including an acrimonious split that reportedly lasted a decade.

He said: ‘Our love was and will always be deeper than any earthly differences we might have had.

‘My wife Adela and I are touched by all the tributes we’re seeing for Phil and we thank you for allowing us to grieve in private at this incredibly difficult time.’

Everly died on Friday night. He had been suffering complications from a lung disease and was being treated in hospital in Burbank, Los Angeles. His widow Patti, who blamed his death on a lifetime of cigarette smoking, said: ‘We are absolutely heartbroken. He fought long and hard.’

The Everly Brothers were best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close vocal harmonies and dominated charts on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 60s.

Their biggest hits included Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Bye Bye Love. Their unique vocal style directly influenced The Beatles – who even referred to themselves early in their career as ‘the English Everly Brothers’.

The pair broke up on stage in 1973 and reportedly did not speak to each other for a decade except at their father’s funeral.

They got back together at a reunion concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall in 1983 and three years later were among the first acts to be inducted  into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

However, a family source last night insisted relations between the pair had continued to be strained.

Former model Erin Everly, who is the daughter of Don but says she considers Phil ‘a father figure’, also paid tribute last night, saying: ‘His voice was as pure as his heart. We are all devastated. Phil was a son, a brother, a father, a husband, a grandfather – and the glue that held us all together. He was a selfless man who was always laughing. He is the best man I have known.’

Phil Everly was married three times and had two sons, Jason and Chris, both singers and songwriters.

Some of the world’s biggest stars have paid tribute. Sir Tim Rice, the Oscar-winning lyricist, tweeted: ‘Death of the great Phil Everly – one of the saddest musical exits of all time for me. He and Don were more influential than they ever knew.’

Brian May, the Queen guitarist, posted a tribute on his own website, saying he had learned his craft listening to the Everly Brothers.

‘I could probably write a book on the music of the fabulous Everly Brothers, but you’ll find echoes of their influence in a lot of our old Queen songs, and perhaps that is the best tribute,’ he said.

He added: ‘I never met them.  Wish I had.  But they will always be my heroes.’

Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet  tweeted: ‘If you’re a Beatles fan you owe it all to Phil Everly. A pillar of modern pop music. RIP.’

One of the most poignant tributes came from singer Nancy Sinatra who toured with the duo.

She said: ‘Phil Everly is gone. Touring with Phil and Don was one of the thrills of my life. I love you Philip – God speed.’

English guitarist Albert Lee, who was the musical director for the brothers’ reunion concert, paid tribute to their unique sound.

He said: ‘There was nothing like it. It was a combination of their country upbringing, and when they became teenagers they fell in love with rock ’n’ roll.’

American guitarist Duane Eddy, who produced Phil’s first solo album, described his death as ‘a huge blow’.

Lord Sugar tweeted his three million followers: ‘Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers dies at 74. To all youngsters: Classic example why you must not smoke. His wife said that’s what killed him.’
