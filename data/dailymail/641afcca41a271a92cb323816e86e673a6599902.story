Russian former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has been reunited with his family after being freed from prison and arriving in Berlin

Russia's former richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky has revealed he was stabbed in the nose during a gruelling 10-year prison term.

The 50-year-old oil magnate was freed two days ago from his 'politically-motivated' sentence by the Russian authorities, who many claim are trying to improve their image before February's Winter Olympics.

Today the long-standing rival to President Putin gave an emotional press conference in which he vowed to keep campaigning for political prisoners - but admitted he will no longer be involved in the 'struggle for power'.

He urged the world not to boycott the Games in Sochi, saying it was a time for sport not politics.

Yet he also insisted the global event should not be turned into 'a great party for President Putin'.

Giving his first TV interview to CNN, Khodorkovsky shed light on his terrifying time in jail.

He said: 'When I was stabbed with a knife I was lucky - he tried to get to my eye but he got my nose.

'As a result, the dentist who was there - someone who was also a plastic surgeon - carried out an operation on me, which means it was virtually not noticeable.'

Asked whether he forgave Putin, he replied: 'I would put it differently, perhaps. I
 don't think that revenge would be any rational behavior. And something 
that is rational behaviour I can always deal with.'

The former chairman of the Yukos Oil Company was jailed for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement in 2003 - charges he denied - and was supposed to be released next August, but was freed early two days ago.

Officials insist he was freed on humanitarian grounds because his mother Marina, 79, is ill.

During today's press conference, held somewhat appropriately in Germany's Berlin Wall museum, he thanked media pressure and German officials for 
helping secure the release from his 'political' sentence.

He added he would not be returning to the 
world of business since his financial situation 'did not require it.'

'The time that is left for me is time I
 would like to devote to the activity to paying back the debts to the 
people ...and by that I mean the people who are still in prison,' he added.

Yesterday he was reunited with his family, including his mother Marina, after his parents travelled from Moscow for the reunion.

Suspicions are growing that the oil tycoon had struck a deal with his political foe Vladimir Putin which will prevent him becoming politically active against the Russian President.

Supporters fear he agreed to the pardon after being threatened with new legal action to keep him in jail for another five years.

Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service 
said in a statement that Khodorkovsky had petitioned to be allowed to 
travel to Germany to meet his mother, who is reportedly being treated for
 cancer.

In his 10 years in 
prison, 
50-year-old Khodorkovsky turned from a powerful oligarch into a 
respected dissident, becoming a political thinker who argued for social 
justice and placed the blame for Russia's stagnating economy on Mr Putin.

Compassionate grounds: Vladimir Putin said that Russia's most famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his mother was ill

Mr Putin's announcement of his release, less than 24 
hours before it happened, appeared to catch both 
the public and Khodorkovsky's lawyers by surprise.

The release itself was also shrouded in mystery. Several hours before, 
Khodorkovsky's lawyers and family said they still had no idea when he 
would be let out of the prison colony, Segezha in the Karelia region of northwestern Russia.

Khodorkovsky's
 second wife and three children live in the Moscow region. His eldest 
son from the first marriage lives with his family in New York City.

In a shock remark after his annual 
marathon news conference yesterday, Putin had said that Russia's most 
famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his 
mother was ill.

The Kremlin followed with a swift announcement today that Putin had already signed the pardon decree.Â 

'Guided
 by humanitarian principles, I decree that Mikhail Borisovich 
Khodorkovsky... should be pardoned and freed from any further punishment
 in the form of imprisonment,' said the decree signed by Putin and published by the Kremlin.

Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2005.

Khodorkovsky was then convicted of embezzlement in a second
 trial in 2010 and had been due for release in August.

The tycoon had 
repeatedly said he would not ask Putin for a pardon because it would be 
tantamount to admitting guilt.

The Kommersant broadsheet, citing 
unnamed sources, said on Friday Khodorkovsky had made the decision to 
seek a pardon after a recent meeting with representatives of Russia's 
security services, who had raised the menace of a third trial against 
him.

'This
 conversation, which was conducted without lawyers, forced Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky to turn to the president,' said the newspaper.

Putin told reporters on Thursday that he saw no prospects for the third case.

Economists and political analysts said that while 
Khodorkovsky's imminent release was a watershed moment, it would not 
dramatically change Russia's battered 
international image.
