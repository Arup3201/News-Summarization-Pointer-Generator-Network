When 54-year-old elementary school principal Stephen Paulsen turned to the Internet to find sex, he allegedly was looking for a boy under the age of 16. What he got instead was an undercover detective - and now he's in some serious trouble.

According to authorities in Boynton Beach, Florida, Paulsen began chatting on the Internet with someone he believed to be a boy under the age of 16 on July 12. In a probable cause statement first obtained by KHOU.com, the undercover detective posing as the boy said Paulsen sent him a private message - using the handle 'Tony Texas' - asking what he liked to do with guys.

Paulsen allegedly told the 'boy' that he 'liked newbies - so anxious to explore it all.'

Paulsen, the principal at Morton Elementary School in Arlington, Texas, went on to say he was in Florida visiting his parents, including his father who has Alzheimer's Disease. He also talked about how he was nervous because the 'boy' was younger than 17 years old and he was older than 21.

Then he asked the 'boy' when his next birthday was.

Paulsen then allegedly sent the boy multiple pornographic images of other men over the course of several days. He also sent him multiple sexually explicit text messages.

On Tuesday, Paulsen sent the 'boy' a message saying it was a 'good day to lose your virginity' and asking how long he would be home alone.

The detective then gave Paulsen an address where he and the boy could meet.

When Paulsen arrived at the agreed upon address - driving a white van with Texas plates - he was taken into custody.

'I f**ked up - my wife is going to kill me,' Paulsen told the arresting officers.

At the time of his arrest, Paulsen had two condoms in his pocket.

Paulsen has been charged with transmission of harmful material to a 
minor, online solicitation of a minor and traveling to meet a minor to 
commit an unlawful sex act, all felonies. Bond has not been set and he's due back in court on Friday.
