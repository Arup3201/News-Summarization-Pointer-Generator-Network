A British grandmother on Death Row in Bali for cocaine smuggling has been told she is being listed for execution, in a move that could see her face a firing squad as early as next month.

Prison warders handed 58-year-old Lindsay Sandiford a letter from Indonesian prosecutors on Tuesday which informed her of her fate.

Her execution by firing squad now seems certain to go ahead unless – as the letter also informed her – she urgently files papers for a final legal appeal against her sentence.

Sandiford has no lawyer or funds to pay the £50,000 cost of contesting her death sentence, and has been refused financial help by the British Government.

Her situation is further complicated by the suspension of Britain’s top diplomat in Bali, vice-consul Alys Harahap, 31, over her jail romance with drug lord Julian Ponder, who Sandiford claims coerced her into becoming a drugs mule.

Last night Sandiford told relatives: ‘Time is running out for me. The whole thing is surreal. I just can’t believe it is happening.’

The letter to Sandiford was in Indonesian and was translated for her by prison staff. It read: ‘Unless you file an application for a PK [a retrial based upon new evidence] as soon as possible, you will be listed for execution.’

Last night, former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald called on the British Government to intervene immediately and fund a lawyer for Sandiford. He said: ‘It is completely hypocritical for the UK to argue for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide and at the same to refuse to give proper assistance to a British citizen facing a firing squad.

‘If the British Government opposes the death penalty as it says it does, it should put its money where its mouth is and help this woman.’

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is standing firm on his refusal to fund her legal fight, despite a recommendation to do so by five Supreme Court judges in London who voiced grave concerns over the way her case had been handled.

Mr Hammond was in Jakarta on Wednesday for trade talks with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi. She said afterwards that Mr Hammond had voiced concern about Sandiford but did not lobby for her. Ms Marsudi told him the execution was in line with international law. 

Six convicts, including Dutch and Brazilian citizens and three other foreigners, were executed in January and a second group of 11, including two Australians held in Kerobokan prison with Sandiford, will be executed before the end of the month.

The next batch of executions are expected to take place in March.

A PK hearing is the only legal avenue for Sandiford to avoid the death penalty after president Joko Widodo declared he would ignore all clemency pleas from convicted traffickers and go ahead with executions.

Shocked relatives of the Yorkshire grandmother are now frantically trying to find an Indonesian lawyer to represent Sandiford. Speaking from her prison cell, Sandiford told a relative yesterday: ‘I need a really good Indonesian lawyer now or else I am in desperate trouble.’

She said recent executions had left the atmosphere in the prison ‘very sombre’. But she added: ‘The guards are being incredibly nice to me. The guards and the officers are very caring. I have the full support of everyone including the governor.

‘Everyone is bending over backwards to help me. They are all talking about it [her plight]. When they executed the six prisoners last month some of the guards were actually crying.’

Sandiford admitted smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali from Thailand in 2012 but claims she was pressured into trafficking the drugs by threats made to the lives of her sons by syndicate members, including Ponder.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has refused to fund Sandiford's legal battle, despite five Supreme Court judges recommending to do so

After her arrest she took part in a police sting operation that led to the arrest of Ponder, 45, from Brighton, and three others. Sandiford was sentenced to death in spite of a prosecution recommendation that she serve 15 years, while Ponder was jailed for six years for cocaine possession. The other three received terms of between one and six years. 

Ponder is widely believed to have paid huge bribes to secure reduced charges and lower sentences for all suspects except Sandiford who he admits he detests for taking part in the police sting.

The Supreme Court asked the Foreign Secretary to urgently review Sandiford’s case and consider funding a lawyer because Indonesian courts had ignored ‘substantial mitigating factors’ and because of the ‘remarkable disparity’ of her sentence compared to that of Ponder and the other defendants.

Mr Hammond rejected the judges’ recommendation. In Jakarta he attended a ceremony marking a £100 million deal to supply Rolls-Royce engines to an Indonesian airline and discussed co-operation between the two countries’ navies.

Sandiford’s sister Hilary Parsons was yesterday in Australia seeking help for her through anti-death penalty charities and lawyers.

‘It is very, very difficult for us as a family,’ she said. ‘It’s overwhelming. It’s all day, every day, trying to get help for her and just hoping that the worse doesn’t happen.

‘I’m talking to people in Australia who have offered help and hopefully we can find a competent Indonesian lawyer to help Lindsay.’ 

Ironically, Ms Parsons suggested, Alys Harahap could be asked to give evidence to a PK hearing if lawyers believe she has new evidence from her intimate conversations with Ponder. He claims they spoke by phone up to 50 times a day at the height of their romance.

‘My sister’s life is hanging in the balance,’ Ms Parsons said. ‘If Alys Harahap has any new information about the case from her conversations with Julian Ponder, she should let us know immediately.’

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed Ms Harahap was still suspended but would not comment on whether the investigation had discovered any information that might be of use to Sandiford’s case.

Asked about Mr Hammond’s visit to Jakarta, the spokesperson said: ‘In each of his ministerial meetings in Jakarta, he raised the issue of the use of the death penalty, which the UK strongly opposes in all circumstances without exception.

‘We will continue to raise the subject with the Indonesians.

‘We are closely following Lindsay Sandiford’s case. She had regular contact with British consular officials in Bali until September 2014, at which point she declined to accept any further support.

‘We stand ready to offer her consular assistance and we would, of course, visit her in prison if she changed her mind.’
