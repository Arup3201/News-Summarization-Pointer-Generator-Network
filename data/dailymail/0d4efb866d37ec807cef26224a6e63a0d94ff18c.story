Phil Mickelson raised the temperature between the European and American teams on Wednesday with a carefully pointed comment about the present legal wrangles involving Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell.

The Californian signalled the end of bland pleasantries in the build-up by comparing the spirit of the visitors with that of their hosts, notably the two men from Northern Ireland who have been dragged into protracted courtroom rows over McIlroy's contested management contract.

'Not only are we able to play together, we also don't litigate against each other and that's a real plus I feel, heading into this week,' said Mickelson with a mischievous grin before adding.

‘Ouch,’ said a European Tour press officer sitting next to him, who knew what he was getting at. 'I couldn't resist, sorry.'

McIlroy's representatives were back last week in a Dublin court, where he is suing his former management company Horizon, where McDowell is both a client and a shareholder. The latter has found himself unwillingly dragged into the on-running proceedings.

While Mickelson dressed his comment up as a joke, he probably sees it as having some potential for the Americans to exploit any cracks in the usually harmonious European ranks.

He may also have been riled by recent remarks made about him by the sometimes disarmingly frank McIlory. Two weeks ago he described Mickelson and Tiger Woods as being on the 'closing holes' of their topline careers.

Only on Wednesday morning he made fun of a wayward drive Mickelson struck at the 2004 Ryder Cup, which he joked nearly hit him.

The Californian had been keen to emphasise just how well the Americans have been getting on together, and praised Tom Watson's leadership as 'exceptional'.
