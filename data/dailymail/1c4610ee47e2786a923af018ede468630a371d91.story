Security firm G4S has advertised for a cleaning supervisor who can speak Polish so they can 'communicate with other members of staff'.

The private contractors said candidates who speak both English and Polish would be preferred for the vacancy at Harrogate Magistrates' Court.

In the advert, which was posted on its website, G4S wrote: 'Candidate who can speak both English and Polish is preferred to be able to communicate with the other members of staff.'

Private contractors G4S have advertised for a cleaning supervisor who can speak Polish so they can communicate with other staff members

The advert, posted on the G4S website, says a candidate who speaks both English and Polish 'is preferred' for the vacancy at Harrogate Magistrates' Court (pictured) 

It says a key requirement is that the ideal candidate will also have a GCSE or equivalent in Maths and English, as well as previous cleaning experience, good communication and interpersonal skills. 

The advert offers £7.50 per hour - £1 more than the minimum wage - for the part-time role.  

A stated 'preference' on a job advert is not against employment laws because it can be argued that the preference does not stop those without the quality from applying.

But the advert - which has been branded as 'discriminatory' by one politician - could raise questions over how common it is for low-skilled workers to be required to speak a foreign language.

The advert for the vacancy in Harrogate came to light after a constituent complained to David Simister, the Ukip Parliamentary candidate for Harrogate and Knaresborough, that he felt the advert was discriminatory against those who only speak English. 

Mr Simister told MailOnline: 'This man was an experienced cleaner and thought it would be the perfect job for him. But he has decided not to apply for it - because he feels he will never get the job. 

'What it says to me is that G4S is happy to employ people who cannot speak very good English, meaning they then have to employ a supervisor who speaks Polish.

'It is discriminating against those who only speak English. They are saying someone without having Polish as a language can apply - but who is going to? Last time I checked, Harrogate was an English-speaking part of the world and that should not be the case.'

He added: 'I think G4S do, in the future, need to look at how they advertise jobs. I think the Ministry of Justice should also look at how its supplier is advertising for jobs.  

'It is an issue that needs flagging up. UKIP is not afraid of political correctness.'  

A spokesman for the GMB union, which counts thousands of cleaners among its 700,000 members, said: 'GMB does not like stipulations like this that discriminate against workers. 

'If there are practical communications difficulties in any workplace employers should offer the option of English language training support to existing and prospective employees.' 

The union is currently in a legal wrangle in Northern Ireland over a case in which a worker was allegedly not given an interview for a job on the grounds he could not speak Portuguese.

The advert also says that successful applicants must have a GCSE or equivalent in English 

GMB is representing David Pryle, from Co Meath, who applied for a job as an overhead electricity power linesman in 2009.

The job notice specified that knowledge of Portuguese was a preferred requirement. Mr Pryle did not speak Portugese and was not invited to interview. 

GMB has taken the case to court, claiming it was discriminatory for the firm to request that Portuguese was preferred. 

Meanwhile, TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said the furore highlighted the value of equality legislation.

She said: 'A case like this highlights the value of equality legislation, but if it’s scrapped then a candidate who believes they have been the victim of discrimination would not be able to do anything about it.'

A G4S spokeman said: 'English GCSE is required for this role, other languages are desirable but not essential.

'As with any role, we are looking for the best people with a variety of skillsets.

'Should any candidate feel that they are suitable for a role, we'd encourage them to apply and engage with the relevant resourcing representative.' 

The UK-based group became unpopular with ministers after it overcharged the Government for tagging criminals.

Earlier this year, the embattled firm agreed to repay more than £130m following an audit showing that taxpayers had been routinely charged for tags on criminals who were in jail, living abroad or even dead.

Costs of cleaning up the scandal helped pushed the company - a member of the FTSE 100 index - to an annual loss. 

The controversy came after a string of other blunders by the firm.

In 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over Birmingham Prison Workers and put an electronic tag on a criminal's artificial limb.

A year later, the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave.

And in March 2013, a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive'.
