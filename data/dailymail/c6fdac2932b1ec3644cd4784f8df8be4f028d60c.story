A pensioner who spent two years tidying up a communal garden on a housing estate has fallen victim to health and safety and been ordered to undo his handiwork.

Rodney Cummins cleared away rubbish and hung up hanging baskets in an attempt to cheer up the block of flats where he lives in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

However, the housing association claimed he had damaged the wall with his well-intentioned efforts, and accused him of blocking access other residents' access to the garden.

Mr Cummins, 65, is a retired house builder who has spent much of the past two years working in the communal garden at his block of flats.

He removed rubbish, including hazards such as broken bottles, which deterred youths from littering as the area was suddenly so nice.

The retiree also put up violas, pansies, and marigolds in 37 baskets hanging from the wall above a communal patch of grass, brightening up the view for passers-by as well as residents.

But after housing association First Wessex received seven complaints about the plants, an inspector ordered Mr Cummins to remove them.

Contrast: The garden used to be full of rubbish such as broken bottles but is now a pleasant green area

'I can't understand why the housing association want me to get rid of them,' the keen gardener said.

'I have spent the last two years cleaning up the area - there were broken bottles, cans and rubbish all over the place.

'People say how wonderful the flowers look when they are out. Kids used to drop rubbish here but they don't do it any more because it looks nice. The association's demands make no sense.'

Neighbours have spoken up in support of Mr Cummins - Barry Hillary said: 'Making Rodney remove the flowers is ridiculous. I would much rather look at flowers than a brick wall.

'Before, it was just a wall with bushes and no colour. He has tidied it all up and made it look great by himself.'

David Johnson added: 'Rodney should be left to carry out his hobbies.

'These flowers give pleasure to neighbours - there is nothing wrong with anything he has done.'

Carol Williams, operation director at First Wessex, said the housing association had a duty to ensure communal gardens were 'safe, pleasant, and enjoyable areas' for all residents.

She continued: 'Following seven complaints from local residents regarding the 37 hanging baskets on the side of the block of flats, First Wessex made the decision to ask the resident to kindly remove them.

'The baskets are obstructing access to the communal garden and causing damage to the property.

'We will continue to work closely with residents to ensure that the communal garden remains a pleasant space for everyone.'
