H&M is the go-to high street store for fashionistas on a tight budget.

But with the help of designer collaborations from the likes of Versace, Stella McCartney and Maison Martin Margiela, the Swedish retailer has upped its game over the years - and it shows no signs of slowing down.

To continue their success story, the store have just announced that they will be launching a new and more luxurious line this spring.

Named & Other Stories, the line will be available in the capital's Regent Street store as well as in major European cities such as Barcelona, Milan, Paris and Stockholm.

But for those city dwellers who aren't lucky enough to have the shop on their high street, the website - stories.com - will make the label available in a host of cities from Denmark to Germany.

According to the H&M website, & Other Stories offers women a wide range of shoes, bags, accessories, beauty and ready-to-wear to create their personal style, or story.

The line, which is set to be created by 
mastermind ateliers in Paris and Stockholm, will focus on high quality 
at affordable prices.

The firm said collections will be diverse, ranging from masculine tailoring to feminine chic, and aimed to be 'lasting wardrobe treasures within a wide price range'.
