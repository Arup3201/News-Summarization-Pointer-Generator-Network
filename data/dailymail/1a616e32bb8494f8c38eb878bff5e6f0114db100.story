An abandoned dog whose fur was so badly matted that he couldn't walk when he was found has been adopted by a new family.

Ziggy the Shih Tzu-type dog has been welcomed by the family two weeks after being taken to an animal shelter in Babylon, New York by a man who found him at a vacant home in Lindenhurst.

The 11-pound dog, who is estimated to be five or six years old, struggled to walk when he was found at the house - which had been empty for about a year - on July 17, SPCA officials.

When he was taken to the Town of Babylon Animal Shelter, vets shaved off nearly four pounds of knotted fur and clipped his inches-long nails.

'It took two staff members three hours late into the evening with simultaneous clippers going to get the job done,' a staff member wrote on the shelter's Facebook page.

'We were incredibly disappointed after freeing Ziggy from his suffering, only to find that he was still unable to walk due to the distress his body had endured for such a long period of time.'

Ziggy was then sent to extensive physical therapy - where he quickly improved.

He learned how to walk properly again at the New York Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center by walking on an underwater treadmill, SPCA officials explained. The services were pro bono.

'We were ecstatic to see what an amazing job they have done with his physical therapy and he was even able to get up to a little trot today!' staff wrote on Facebook, six days after he was found.

He was also neutered and microchipped, and staff said he was friendly, although apprehensive.

Looking good! Ziggy has re-learned how to walk with physical therapy and is heading to a new home

On the mend: Vets said he was a friendly but apprehensive dog following his ordeal

He is now going home with a couple in western Suffolk County who do not want to be identified. They have considerable experience with dogs with special needs, Newsday reported.

'I am very, very happy that this dog is 
going to get the home he deserves after the torment he's been suffering 
for many years,' said Roy Gross, chief of the Suffolk SPCA.

Even though the last tenants moved out of the home a year ago, officials do not believe Ziggy had been there for all of that time.

Neighbors said they never saw the dog with the previous tenants.

Authorities are still looking for his former owners. A $2,000 reward is being offered for information about the person who neglected the dog, officials said.

Anyone with information can contact the Suffolk County SPCA at 631-382-7722.
