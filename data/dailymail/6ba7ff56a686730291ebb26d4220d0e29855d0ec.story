With her tiny voice echoing around the silent stadium, players and coaches stood motionless with their hands on their hearts.

A
 policeman also listened intently, clearly moved by the young 
performer. As she reached the climax of her performance, the crowd rose 
and cheered. A woman could be seen wiping tears from her eyes.

The
 toddler, as reported by WebProNews, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia last year and 
is now undergoing chemotherapy as part of a two-year treatment plan.

Before
 the performance, her mother gave an interview to the Jimmy Fund Radio-Telethon. In it, she said her daughter was diagnosed with the illness 
after constantly complaining of feeling tired.

Mrs Holloway explained the moment she was told by doctors her daughter had leukemia. 'I was a sobbing mess that day', she said. 'It was overwhelming just to hear.

'She is dealing with it and we are all dealing with it and we are happier now.'

The youngster was appearing at the stadium thanks to The Jimmy Fund, which raises money for cancer patients in the Boston area.
