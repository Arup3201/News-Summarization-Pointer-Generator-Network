She's known for her straight-talking, no-nonsense manner and Mel B admits she has no qualms about speaking her mind.

In fact, the X Factor judge, 39, famously dubbed Scary Spice when the Spice Girls formed in 1994,  said: 'I'd like to think I'm a bit scary every now and again.'

The mother-of-three told The Times that it was a magazine, not the girls themselves, who coined their nicknames but more than 20 years later after the group formed, 'she wouldn't change it for the world'.

The name fits: Former Spice Girls member Mel B (pictured in September) has revealed that even though she didn't give herself the moniker 'Scary Spice', she does like to think she's 'a bit scary every now an again'

'I'd like to think I'm a bit scary every now and again. I wouldn't change my name for the world. We never named ourselves - it was a magazine, and the nicknames stuck. I don't think you can mess with that, so I'm sticking with mine.' 

She  is also the driving force behind a Spice Girls reunion with Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Chisholm and Emma Bunton but that the others are dragging their feet.

She said: 'I've been wanting this for 15 years. But everyone's doing their own thing and everyone has families to consider.' 

The group reunited for a sell-out tour in late 2007 and early 2008 but have yet to repeat its success. 

Since then Victoria, a hugely successful designer, has had a fourth child and Mel herself has three daughters, Phoenix Chi with ex Jimmy Gulzar, Angel, fathered by Eddie Murphy and Madison, with husband Stephen Belafonte.

Despite recent reports of trouble in her marriage, Mel recently reaffirmed their strength together, saying they are 'madly in love'.

It appears she is keen to put the rumours behind her to focus on her duties as a mother instead and likens the idea of being a working mum to being 'a mini superwoman'. 

Yet she prefers not to call herself a feminist. Instead, 'I try to live by the girl-power motto,' she explained.

'It's about believing in yourself, no matter how bad a day you're having, and lending your support to other women. It's empowering to have that camaraderie with other women.'

She certainly seemed to have it with her fellow X Factor judge Cheryl Versini-Fernandez. She told Grazia: 'I'm a girl's girl and Cheryl is lovely. How can you not love her?'

And she's happy to express her admiration for former bandmate Victoria Beckham. 

'She's witty as hell, very funny and an amazing businesswoman. I love her dresses.'
