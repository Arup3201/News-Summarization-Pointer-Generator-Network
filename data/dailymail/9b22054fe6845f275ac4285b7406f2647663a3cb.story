French cycle race convicts have been told 'no breakaway sprints' when they are let out to complete a stage of the Tour de France race next month.

The prisoners will cycle a gruelling mountain course from Bastia to Ajjacio on the island of Corsica - flanked by the fittest prison guards as outriders.

But the inmates have been instructed not to break away from the main peleton, or pack of riders, in a bid to reach the finish line first.

Captivating course: A selected group of prisoners will be allowed take part in one of the stages of the 100th Tour de France - albeit under the watch of guards

Many of the 40 men taking part are 
serving sentences for crimes linked to the Mediterranean island's 
ongoing nationalist stuggle for independence.

Corsica's
 government official said in a statement: 'They will take on a challenge
 that will see them brave the hills of the Vizzavona pass and cross 
Corsica from north to south.

'The
 prisoners and guards have been training on roads and on home-trainers 
in the jails to develop the the physical and mental qualities necessary 
to achieve this sporting feat.

'But the guards will not let any of them out of their sight.'

Rough ride: The prisoners will take to their bikes on one of the first stages of the 2013 edition of Tour de France on the island of Corsica in June

Corsica is known as the island of beauty but dozens of gangland and separatist killings in recent years have also earned it the title of 'the murder capital of Europe'.

Tour de France is an annual bicycle race considered one of the most prestigious cycling competitions.

The 2013 competition marks the 100th Tour de France, and will start on the island of Corsica on June 29th.

After finishing 21 stages and covering a total distance of 3,360 kilometres (2,088 miles) the winner will be crowned on July 21st in Paris, as is tradition.

Last year Bradley Wiggins became the first Briton ever to win Tour de France.
