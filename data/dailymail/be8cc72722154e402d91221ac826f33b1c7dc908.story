Here's a tip for tipping at a Waffle House restaurant: Use cash.

A waitress working the graveyard shift at a North Carolina Waffle House was told by her manager that because of a restaurant policy regarding tipping she would not be allowed to collect on a $1,000 tip one of her customers left for her last month.

Shaina Brown, 26, is a single mother of three who works two part-time jobs. She also takes classes during the day so she can someday become an English teacher.

Shafted: Shaina Brown was denied a $1,000 tip because the customer who left it used a credit card

On Mother's Day, Brown was working the graveyard shift at a Waffle House in Raleigh when a customer left her with a shocking surprise.

'He said, "I’m going to bless you today,'" Brown told FoxNews.com 
on Tuesday. 'He was just trying to show that there are still good people
 out there.'

It was about 3:30 a.m. when the man - who has chosen to not identify himself - left Brown a $1,500 tip on his credit card, with $1,000 of it to go to Brown and the other $500 to go to a 'haggard-looking woman' at a nearby table, according to the Raleigh News and Observer.

However, the Waffle House manager refused to give Brown the cash, citing a restaurant policy against servers receiving large tips made on a credit card - according to the restaurant, the rule is in place in case a customer later disputes the charge.

'When a guest makes a tip of this size, it is our procedure to refund 
the tip amount and ask the guest to make the tip in either cash or a 
check,' the chain said in a statement to Fox News.

Brown, however, had no way of getting touch with the customer to ask if he would cut her a check - so the unidentified man's generous tip would go unclaimed.

'A lot of servers wait for that day when you get a tip like that, and 
when I didn’t get it, it was very humiliating and heartbreaking,' she 
said.

Brown began calling local media outlets to tell them about the tip she lost, and NewsObserver.com columnist Josh Shaffer tracked him down.

The unidentified man who left Brown the tip was tracked down several weeks later and wrote her a personal check to make up for the money she was denied by her employer

Brown's benefactor, a local businessman who owns several restaurants in the area, was told how she never received the money he had intended on giving her and wrote her a personal check.

Brown says she thinks the man left her such a large tip because he's in the restaurant industry and understands how hard she works - and how well she treats her customers. 

'I try to make them feel as comfortable as possible,' Brown said. 'He knows good service when he sees it.'
