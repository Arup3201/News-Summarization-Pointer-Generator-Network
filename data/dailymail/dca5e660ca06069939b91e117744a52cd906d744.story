Parents have slammed ITV for showing a graphic scene from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes during the semi-final of the World Cup.

Football fans were left shocked after the clip - which showed a computer-animated chimpanzee viciously shooting a man with a machine gun - was screened during a half-time ad-break.

The trailer for the new film was shown after the 9pm 'watershed', but upset viewers said they had let youngsters stay up late to watch Holland play Argentina and thought the advert was 'inappropriate'.

ITV viewers have hit out at the channel after an advert for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, in which a chimpanzee shoots a man, was screened during an advertising break in the World Cup semi-final

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) today confirmed it has received more than 100 complaints from TV viewers.

Many also took to Twitter to criticise the channel for screening the trailer.

Mother Claire Reidlinger posted: 'Furious at @ITV for shocking my children (and me) last night. After 9pm maybe, but during the football?? Poor show.'

Colin Bridgford ‚Äètweeted: 'Is it me? I thought the 1st promo Ad on @ITV of Rise of Planet of Apes was completely inappropriate & unacceptable. Kids watching Football!'

And Sean Cleaver wrote: 'Just seen an ape gun down a man in cold blood in an advert mid-football. I know it's post 9pm but that's horribly misjudged and awful!'

In the clip, the monkey is shown performing acrobatics as it enters a room where two armed men are sitting on a sofa.

After 
drinking with them and smiling, the animal suddenly turns angry, 
picking up a machine gun and firing at one of the men, killing him.

The advert ends with the ape pointing the gun at the other man, who is shown pleading with the creature to spare him.

The advert encouraged viewers to go on Twitter and give their opinions on what they had seen

But the stunt backfired when many hit out at ITV for screening the trailer when children were watching

Many website users said the violent images of a murderous chimpanzee would give them nightmares

Some suggested the footage glamourised guns and should have been banned under advertising guidelines and one woman said her child had difficulty sleeping after unwittingly seeing the commercial.

But other website users backed ITV for showing the advert, joking that it was more exciting than the football, which remained nil-nil for 120 minutes before Argentina won on a penalty shoot-out.

A spokesman for the ASA said today: 'I can confirm that we've received around 100 complaints overnight about the TV ad for the film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which appeared on ITV yesterday at around 10pm.

'Complainants are concerned that the ad shows an ape grabbing a gun and shooting a man with it, during the broadcast of the World Cup semi-finals, which children would have been watching.

'We're logging these complaints, we'll access them before making a decision as to whether we will investigate or not.'

ITV have yet to comment on the controversy.

The trailer was part of a huge publicity campaign ahead of the film's release in cinemas on Thursday, 19 July
