Extreme conditions: Police say Armando Villa appears to have died from heat exhaustion while on a fraternity-sponsored hike in the Angeles National Forest

A California university has ordered a 
fraternity to cease and desist all activities following the death of a 
19-year-old pledge during an initiation activity.

Armando Villa, 19, was in the mountains of the Angeles National Forest during an overnight hike with other members of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity of California State University when they ran out of water around 5:30pm Tuesday.Villa lost consciousness on the trail before his companions flagged down a ranger who called emerged he was taken to hospital where he later died.

The student's family says they believe the hike was a hazing ritual.

'The boys were left out there without shoes and water to kind of find their way out,' Villa's aunt Maria Casteneda told KTLA.

She said that her nephew was left in the forest with no shoes, very little water and no cell phone.

His feet and back were blistered.

'How do you leave somebody out there without shoes in 100-degree weather?' asked one of Villa's distraught cousins.

The sheriff's department says Villa's death appears to have been brought on by heatstroke, but the exact cause of death with be determined by a coroner.

His family says Villa had just completed his first year at the university and planned to eventually study medicine.

Villa had been trying to join Pi Kappa Phi and had participated in two other events, one of which left him with bruises.

Initiation: Villa's family say he and other young men hoping to join the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity were left on a mountain with very little water and no shoes to find their way back overnight

Beloved: Villa (left, pictured with two cousins) was trying to join the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and his family say they believe his death is the result of a hazing ritual

'I 
remember he came back with his elbows bruised, and he was talking to me 
about an event he was excited for, and then when he got back I asked him
 about it, and he was like "It wasn't even fun"', Villa's cousin, 
Christopher Castaneda told ABC7,
 adding that he had decided not to continue with the fraternity but went
 on the hike because he'd already given his word that he would go.

'He
 went to fulfill a promise he made because he was such a loyal person, 
such a beautiful, beautiful person, and they treated him that way,' Mark
 Castaneda said.

The school and the fraternity are cooperating with police as they investigate.

'The fraternity is cooperating fully with the authorities and university to investigate. In the interim, all chapter activities have been suspended pending the conclusion of the investigation,' reads a statement issued from Pi Kappa Phi.
