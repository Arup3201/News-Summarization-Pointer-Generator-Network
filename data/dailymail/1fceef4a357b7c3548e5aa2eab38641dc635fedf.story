Nicky Suddons, 26, was originally jailed for seven sex attacks on women and girls in Manchester carried out during a two month reign of terror back in 2004

A notorious rapist used a knife to launch a savage sex attack on a woman walking her dog – after he was let out of prison for a day on ‘work experience’.

Nicky Suddons was jailed for life aged 17 for a rape and six other serious assaults on women and a girl aged 13.

But granted day release from his ‘open’ jail he assembled a ‘rape kit’ containing a knife, balaclava and rubber gloves.

He even included condoms to stop police tracing him through DNA.

Left unsupervised during his lunch break, he tried to rape a woman in her 50s as she walked her Labrador in woods near Grantham, Lincolnshire.

His victim was only saved because the dog turned on Suddons.

After he was found guilty of attempted rape in just an hour yesterday, the judge described the case as ‘very worrying’.

Judge Sean Morris said: ‘You may  wonder what on earth was going on.

Someone gets life and they are out wandering around Grantham.’

Last night Justice Secretary Chris  Grayling ordered an immediate probe into what happened.

Mr Grayling said: ‘This is a truly horrifying case and one that needs to be investigated thoroughly.

‘I’m determined to get to the bottom of what went wrong and to take forward any lessons learnt from the reviews I have commissioned.

‘In future when people are released on temporary licence I want to see them tagged so we can better monitor where they are and where they have been.’

After his initial crime spree in his teens, Suddons, now 26, became known as the ‘Yellow Brick Road’ rapist, after the area of Manchester where he carried out his attacks.

He committed seven sex attacks on women and girls in 2004. The former lifeguard – who boasted about his attacks on social media sites – said he carried out the knifepoint assaults for kicks and regarded himself as ‘untouchable’.

The judge in the case warned he had ‘an extremely high risk of reoffending’ and described him as a ‘highly dangerous young man’.

Suddons collected together a 'rape kit' including a balaclava, rubber gloves, condoms and a Stanley knife and went on to attempt to rape a middle-aged woman after disappearing from his work placement and going to Queen Elizabeth Park where he lay in wait for a victim

Suddons was given a life sentence with a minimum term of just four 
years, making him eligible for release around four years ago. In 
December last year, the Parole Board ordered he be moved to North Sea 
Camp open prison. It also ordered that, because of his age when  
convicted, he must be given work experience during the day.

From 
March he was let out to do painting and decorating work on a church 
property in Grantham. Each day as part of his work placement, Suddons 
was granted an hour’s unsupervised lunch break. During this time he was 
able to walk unmonitored through the riverside park that is popular with
mothers and their children.

On June 28 during his unsupervised 
break, he walked half an hour to nearby Queen Elizabeth Park to attempt 
his horrific assault in broad daylight.

His victim told Lincoln Crown
Court she turned around to find herself face to face with  a masked man
brandishing a knife. As she fell to the ground and screamed, he stood 
over her and warned ‘don’t scream’.

She told the jury: ‘My eyes were 
fixed on the knife and the mask. His thumb was on the Stanley knife as 
if the blade was ready to be flicked.’ He only backed off as the dog 
lunged – and was caught by a passer-by.

Outlining the contents of the
‘rape kit’, David Outterside, prosecuting, said: ‘What was on his mind 
was rape. This time he was prepared and absolutely determined not to be 
caught. He was caught red-handed.’

Suddons admitted attacking the woman but denied he intended to rape her.

He remains in custody and is due to be sentenced.

He
had an earlier conviction in 2002, when he was 14, for assaulting a 
12-year-old girl. He was jailed for life by Manchester Crown Court in 
2005 after admitting one rape and six sexual assaults on victims aged 
between 13 and 28. Last night local MP Nick Boles said: ‘It is extremely
troubling when convicted criminals are released on some form of 
probation and are in a position to go on committing crimes.

‘I make 
no criticism of the church, who weren’t responsible for acting as 
jailers. But we need to be sure they are properly supervised. There must
be appropriate checks to ensure prisoners are properly rehabilitated 
before they are allowed into the community.’

It is the second recent
high profile case involving a life sentence inmate from North Sea Camp 
in Lincolnshire on work placement.

In October 2012, Lee Cyrus went 
on the run after being let out on day release for work, committing five 
counts of exposure, wounding with intent, unlawful wounding, affray, 
aggravated burglary, robbery and burglary. He is due to be sentenced at 
the Old Bailey this month.
