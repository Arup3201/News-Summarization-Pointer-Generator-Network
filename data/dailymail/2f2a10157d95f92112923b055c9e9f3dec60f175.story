A benefits fraudster who enlisted a sidekick to pose in a wheelchair and pretend to be his sick and bedbound father in order to scam more than £20,000 from taxpayers has been spared jail.

Emilio Brunetti, 54, of Fulham, south-west London, paid 62-year-old Martin Rafferty £80 per time to pretend to be elderly Antonio Brunetti in an attempt to evade detection by a council fraud team.

The son was granted power of attorney for his ailing father in April 2008 and was on housing benefit, council tax benefit and a social tenancy in his father's name, Harrow Crown Court heard yesterday.

Hammersmith and Fulham Council investigators said suspicions were raised when neighbours reported that they had not seen the father for a long time and understood that he was living in Italy.

When fraud officers visited the home to check that the father was living there in 2012, they were greeted by Brunetti and a sleeping man in a wheelchair - now known to be Rafferty.

Brunetti said that he could not wake his father as he had taken strong medication due to a recent operation to remove a brain tumour. But fraud officers did not believe this and rumbled the scam.

The investigators viewed housing association London and Quadrant’s CCTV footage which clearly showed the man posing as Mr Brunetti Snr walking to his car unaided after the visit.

Further undercover surveillance was 
carried out by the Department of Work and Pensions and a further 
residency check was scheduled earlier this year in February.

Spared jail: Martin Rafferty, 62, received a four-month sentence suspended for two years yesterday

This
time fraud officers watched Brunetti arrive by car with an older man 
and walk into the property. Once inside the home, Brunetti showed 
officers a bedbound man who he claimed was his father.

Again,
Brunetti said his father was unable to speak as he was heavily 
medicated. But police officers were called and both men were arrested on
the spot. The older man was later identified as Rafferty.

Brunetti
received a six-month sentence suspended for two years at the court in 
north-west London. Rafferty, of Hammersmith, west London, received a 
four-month sentence suspended for two years.

Greg Smith, Hammersmith and Fulham Council's deputy leader, said: ‘It beggars belief that these two men have avoided jail and there can be no doubt that they have got off very lightly indeed.

‘Paying someone to pose as your dying father to cheat taxpayers is about as low as it gets. This duo did not sleepwalk into committing this crime but they have now been given a rude awakening.

‘If Antonio Brunetti knew the lengths his son went to in order to scrounge benefits he would probably be turning in his grave.’

Brunetti defrauded the council out of £5,988 of housing benefit and £990 of council tax benefit. He also illegally claimed £13,140 of income support. Mr Brunetti Snr has since died in Brazil.

Compared: The case has drawn comparisons to a regular sketch in BBC comedy Little Britain, in which Lou (David Williams) dedicates his life to looking after Andy (Matt Lucas), who does not in fact need his wheelchair

The case has drawn comparisons to a regular sketch in BBC comedy Little Britain, in which Lou (played by David Williams) dedicates his life to looking after wheelchair-bound Andy (Matt Lucas).

It soon transpires in the series - which first aired on TV in 2003 but was previously a radio show - that Andy does not need a wheelchair and performs all sorts of activities behind Andy's back.

In the first ever episode, Lou takes Andy to a swimming pool in his wheelchair - and while his back is turned, Andy jumps off a diving board before returning to his chair, with Lou none the wiser.

Andy's catchphrases were 'Yeah, I know', 'Want that one' and 'Don't like it'. Other characters featured in the hit series were teenage chav Vicky Pollard and transvestite Eddie 'Emily' Howard.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
