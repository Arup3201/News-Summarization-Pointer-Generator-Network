One of the mostly hotly anticipated mobile phones this year could  finally be unveiled to the public today.

A Samsung website entitled 'tgeltaayehxt' - an anagram of 'the Next Galaxy' offered a countdown - although the site is overwhelmed with such demand it's difficult to access.

But solving the word puzzle seems only to unlock a further preview - for an even on May 3 in London, where details of the iconic Android will presumably be released.

Samsung recently surpassed Nokia to become the world's biggest phone company.

Bloggers and other tech fans have already 'leaked' details of the new handset - including a video purported to be of a finished model.

The
Samsung Galaxy S3, expected to rival the iPhone when it goes on sale 
next month, has appeared online in a Vietnamese video posted on YouTube.

The
gadget appears to have  a 4.6-inch display and a 720p display, with the
handset being powered by a 1.4Ghz quad core processor.

The leak comes via well-regarded Vietnamese site Tinhte, which previously revealed the Samsung Galaxy Tab and parts from the new iPad. It reveals footage of the new device for the first time

It is also expected to boast an 8 megapixel camera, 16Gb of storage and NFC technology allowing it to double as a credit card.

Its 720 x1184
4.6-inch screen is expected to have a slightly lower resolution than 
the iPhone 4S, but on a bigger 4.6inch screen compared to the iPhone’s 
3.5inch.

16GB of storage plus a microSD card slot are also mentioned, along with a 2,050mAh battery.

The mystery phone has the model number GT-i9300, expected to be the model number for the Galaxy S3.

The handset is also running Ice Cream Sandwich, the latest version of Google’s Android software.

However,
experts warn that the final phone may look radically different - the 
leaked video is believed to have a ‘fake’ case to guard against leaks 
ahead of the expected May 3rd launch.
