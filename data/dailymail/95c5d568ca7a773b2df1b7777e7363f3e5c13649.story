A young woman today described how she grabbed the blade of a 12-inch kitchen knife and wrestled it away from a crazed woman trying to stab her in an unprovoked attack.

Kerry Clark, 24, told a court that she grabbed the blade with one hand and kicked Nicola Edgington, 32, off her at a bus stop in Bexleyheath, south-east London, in October 2011.

Edgington, who had been released from a secure mental unit after killing her mother Marion, had pinned Miss Clark to the ground and was pointing the knife at her chest, the Old Bailey heard.

Defendant: Diagnosed schizophrenic Nicola Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, to death with a 12-inch meat cleaver in Bexleyheath in October 2011 and the attempted murder of Kerry Clark, 24, right

The young woman had been listening to 
her iPod and rolling a cigarette when Edgington lunged at her, 
screaming: ‘You f**king b***h, you f**king b***h’, before Miss Clark managed to
 disarm her.

Stabbed: Sally Hodkin suffered a fatal cut to the neck when she was attacked on her way to work

She told the Old Bailey: ‘We were 
grappling. I managed to grab the blade with one hand and kick her off 
me. It happened very quickly.’

Miss Clark then said to her: ‘You 
crazy b***h, what are you doing?’ Edgington, who was now 3ft away then 
allegedly retorted: ‘I am not the crazy one. You are the one with the 
knife in your hand’.

She added that Edgington ‘appeared 
quite angry’ as she demanded ‘give me my f*****g knife back’, but Miss 
Clark refused. Then looking ‘bewildered’, Edgington walked off and 
crossed the road.

As Edgington went into a shop, Miss 
Clark dropped the knife as other passengers and estate agents came to 
her aid. She suffered cuts to the heel of her palm and three middle 
fingers during the attack.

Miss Clark recalled: ‘I noticed a big 
girl come towards me. When I noticed the figure was coming towards me I 
quite quickly looked up. I saw the woman lunge at me with a knife.

Danger to the public: Edgington turned up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital demanding to be admitted before she hurt someone - but walked out and went on a rampage, the court heard

‘I suppose it was straight on as I 
turned to face her. She just had the knife in her hand and angling it 
towards my neck and chest.  She was screaming: “You f**king b***h, you 
f**king b***h”.

Manslaughter: Nicola Edgington stabbed her mother Marion, pictured, to death in 2005

‘My instant reaction was to put my 
hands up to protect myself from the knife. I just went straight up and 
tried to cup the blade with my both hands. I held the blade with my 
right hand.

‘But I felt her push me with the knife
 so I went back to try and avoid it. I fell to the floor and she was on 
top of me. It was quite a force, I had to fight a lot. I was looking 
directly at the knife.

‘I had a vague recollection of her of 
her face. It was aggressive. It’s hard to recall to be honest but she 
was on top of me with the knife still at my chest. I still had my hands 
around the blade of the knife.

‘I was trying to get her off me or get
 the knife off of her. This happened quite quickly but I think I managed
 to grab the blade with one hand and kick her off me while she was on 
top of me.’

Earlier the court heard police were 
warned the former psychiatric patient was a danger to the public just 
hours before she launched the knife rampage which left Miss Clark 
injured and minutes later Sally Hodkin, 58, dead.

Psychiatrist Dr Akintayo Idowu dialled
 999 and told police to ‘forcibly detain’ Edgington and bring her back 
to hospital after she allegedly walked off as she was being admitted to a
 secure mental ward.

Attack: Meat Market in Bexleyheath where Edgington is alleged to have taken the knife

Killed: The house in East Sussex where Marion Edgington's body was found in 2005

Dr Akintayo Idowu was processing the paperwork when she simply walked away around 6.30am, the court was told.

Hours later after catching several 
buses she bought a large kitchen knife from supermarket Asda and 
allegedly used it to stab commuter Miss Clark.

Having being disarmed, Edgington, of Greenwich, south-east London, allegedly  then grabbed a knife from a butcher’s shop and hacked grandmother Mrs Hodkin to death.

Edgington denies murder and attempted murder.

She had spent three years in a secure 
hospital after pleading guilty to the 2005 manslaughter of her mother 
but was released into community care in 2009. The trial was adjourned to
 Friday.
