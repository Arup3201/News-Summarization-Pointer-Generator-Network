Audley Harrison has revealed he is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after announcing his decision to retire from boxing.

The heavyweight, who won Olympic gold in 2000, has not fought since he was knocked out by Deontay Wilder in 2013.

And he aborted his latest comeback attempt after undergoing a battery of tests which produced some concerning results.

Harrison says he has tried to focus and turn back the clock to get himself into fighting condition

James DeGale praised his fellow Olympic gold medalist Audley Harrison for putting amateur boxing 'on the map'.

He said: 'He is the one who won the Olympic gold medal and helped boxing get the funding it has today.

'He put amateur boxing on the map and helped the next lot to come through.

'He had a fantastic career, he boxed for a world title and won the European title. All the best to him.'

In a statement, Harrison said: 'I am no longer a professional boxer, and that is good with me. After locking myself away for the last five weeks, I've tried to focus and turn back the clock to get myself into fighting condition.

'I've also seen specialists for my brain, eyes and various other experts to test my body functions in regards to strength, power, speed, reaction time, cognitive function and agility.

'Additionally, I looked at the latest research into concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). After years of denial and sticking to my guns, I'm finally getting out of my own way.

'I've suffered a few TBIs and will have to work hard to reverse some of the effects taking punches to the head has brought about to my overall health.

'I have vision problems, vestibular issues that lead to balance disturbances, and have serious bouts of irritability and moodiness that comes with TBI recovery.'

Wilder inflicted a first-round defeat on Harrison in 2013 which led to his retirement before he went back on it

Harrison initially retired following his first-round defeat by Wilder, who is now the WBC world champion.

But he reversed that decision within days as he struggled to accept his career was over.

Harrison also admitted he has been reckless with his earnings and could face bankruptcy in the UK. The 43-year-old currently lives in California and added: 'I've made many mistakes and learned some tough lessons along the way. I made tons of money and splurged lots of it away with reckless money management, immaturity and a desire to build my empire like Tony Montana.

'Thankfully, my wife Raychel started a hair salon business and threw chunks of money into real estate, but I'll still likely have to file for bankruptcy in the UK. Thankfully, I invested in a pension while living in the UK, so that will be good when I'm much older.

'Without my boxing income, I will not be able to pay the huge tax bill I pay each year to satisfy the film partnership I invested into in 2004, and encashed my investment by 2009. The hefty tax bill each year does not finish until 2022.'

Harrison started boxing at 19 and became the first British boxer to win Olympic gold in the super-heavyweight division when he triumphed in Sydney.

His triumph paved the way for future medalists Amir Khan, James DeGale, Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams through increased funding.

He turned professional the following year, signing a £1million deal with the BBC for his first 10 fights. Six million people watched his debut - a first round knockout of Mike Middleton - but his contract was terminated in 2004 after he had accumulated a record of 17 wins from as many contests.

Harrison suffered his first defeat when he challenged Danny Williams for the vacant Commonwealth title. Although he would later avenge that loss, it was the first of several high-profile bouts in which Harrison failed to produce the goods.

Michael Sprott knocked him out in the third round of their European title clash - although that defeat was also avenged three years later in a rematch for the same belt.

Harrison twice used the short-format Prizefighter to his advantage, first in 2009 when he defeated Coleman Barrett, Danny Hughes and Scott Belshaw. That propelled him into his second clash with Sprott which saw him finally win a major honour.

The world title opportunity he so craved arrived in 2010 when he challenged David Haye for his WBA strap in Manchester.

But Harrison landed just one punch as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds. The British Boxing Board of Control initially withheld some of his purse while a full investigation was carried out but he was later awarded the full amount.

After 18 months in the doldrums, Harrison made a comeback against Ali Adams in 2012, a bout he won with a fourth-round knockout.

And once again he earned himself a high-profile fight, this time against the British and Commonwealth champion David Price.

But yet again, he was unable to walk the walk as the Liverpool giant knocked Harrison out cold after just 82 seconds.

Those who urged him to retire were left disappointed when he again turned to Prizefighter for redemption in 2013.

And his three victories over Derric Rossy, Martin Rogan and Claus Bertino produced his familiar rhetoric of finally being at one with himself and the sport.

But in Wilder he faced another hurdle that could not be overcome. The American hope had knocked out all 27 of his previous opponents added another notch to his record when his right hand sent Harrison to the canvas for one last time after just 70 seconds.

Harrison plans to start an agency to ensure boxers are given the financial advice he appears to have missed out on. He also intends to take out a trainer's license in California in a bid to develop a future champion.

He said: 'If I'm to achieve my goal of becoming a world champion it will now have to be as a trainer and manager to a bright young star, who will hopefully learn from my mistakes, rather than learning from his or her own.'
