The Government has today revealed the top-ten most common nationalities of foreign-born women who gave birth in NHS hospitals in the last year.

The new record level of births to foreign-born mothers is more than double the proportion of 20 years ago, with women originally from Poland topping the list, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Other nations represented in the top ten include Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Somalia.

A total of 184,000 children were born in these circumstances, with almost half of them in London, which has a foreign-born mother rate of 56.7 per cent, far above the national average of 25.5 per cent.

International: Foreign-born women have children every day in the UK, reaching record levels in 2011

According to official figures, the average hospital birth can cost £1,600, meaning the total cost to the NHS of these would have been at least £30million.

Some of the women will have been born abroad and settled in the UK but a number will have visited just to use the NHS.

Boom: Health tourism, including maternity care, is believed to be costing the NHS around £200 million per year

So called ‘health tourism’ as a whole is thought to cost taxpayers as much as £200million a year.

Urgent
 treatment, such as maternity care, is provided regardless of residence 
status or ability to pay but hospitals must take reasonable measures to 
recover debts from overseas patients if they can trace them.

Some trusts are owed tens of millions by foreign patients and have been forced to write-off some of these debts.

It came as it was also announced that net migration to the UK is still at 216,000 a year, which is still double the Government's 100,000 target.

This means that means hundreds of thousands more people every year are coming to the UK when compared to numbers who leave.

Meanwhile the number of foreign-born mothers is rising consistently annually, with the figures now double what they were 30 years ago.

Figures
 compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a 25.5
 per cent of all children born in 2011 had foreign-born mothers, 
compared with 25.1 per cent the year before.

More
 than 20,000 were from Poland, followed by 18,000 from Pakistan, almost 
15,000 from Indian and and more than 8,000 from Bangladesh.

It
 is the highest proportion of births to non-UK born mothers since 
parents' country of origin was introduced in birth registration in 1969.

Growth: Figures revealed today show that the number of foreign mothers giving birth in England and Wales has reached record levels

Arrivals: Official statistics show net migration is down

In Newham, east London, more than three quarters of new mums were born outside the UK but choose to give birth here.

The
 ONS found that a slight rise of 0.1 per cent in the overall number of 
newborn children compared with 2010 was entirely due to foreign-born 
mothers.

Women born in 
the UK had 1,957 fewer babies in 2011 compared with the previous year, 
in a reversal of rising numbers of births to UK-born women since 2002.

Meanwhile mothers born outside the UK 
had 2,702 more babies, in line with a trend since 1995 for the number of
 births to women who came to the UK from abroad to rise year-on-year.

The ONS said: 'This is the highest proportion of births to mothers born outside the UK since the collection of parents' country of birth was introduced at birth registration in 1969.

'This proportion has increased every year since 1990, when it was just under 12 per cent, with a marked rise over the last decade. In 2001 the proportion of births to non-UK born mothers was 16.5 per cent.'

It added: 'The slight fall in the number of births to UK born women is a reversal of the previous trend of rising numbers of births to UK women since 2002. In contrast, the number of births to women born outside the UK has risen every year since 1995.'

Dr Martin Ruhs, director of the 
Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the estimated 
figures were based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS) and 
margins of error meant they could be 35,000 higher or lower than stated.

Regions: The highest number of births last year involved mothers from the Middle East and Asia followed by the EU

So while net migration was put at 216,000 for last year, this was the 
central estimate for the figure which could range from 181,000 to 
251,000, meaning that the apparent drop is not statistically 
significant.

'There is a constant desire among policy makers in all parties, the 
press and other interest groups in having 'hard' facts and specific 
numbers about migration, but the reality is that sometimes these are 
simply not available,' Dr Ruhs said.

'The uncertainty around the official migration estimates means that the 
figures need to be used and interpreted with great care.'

Nigerian-born Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, 
right, travelled to Britain to give birth to quins at a cost of up to 
£200,000 to British taxpayers.

The
 wife of a wealthy businessman had two boys and three girls by Caesarean
 section in April last year and was in Homerton Hospital, East London, 
for almost two weeks.

Mrs 
Ayelabola, from Lagos, who had been taking a fertility drug, said at the
 time: ‘I had already had miscarriages and couldn’t bear the stress 
another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in 
London.

‘I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family.’

Mrs
 Ayelabola claimed her husband left her and returned to Nigeria after 
discovering she had given birth to five babies. She was given a visa to 
stay in Britain which runs out in December of this year.

Long-term immigration fell slightly to
 566,000 from 591,000, similar to the level it has been at since 2004, 
while emigration rose slightly from 339,000 to 350,000.

Study
 was the most common reason for those coming to Britain, with figures 
showing 232,000 came last year, similar to the 238,000 in the year to 
December 2010.

But the 
number of visas issued for the purpose of study, including student 
visitors, were down a fifth in the 12 months to June, the ONS figures 
showed.

There were 282,833 visas issued for study, a fall of 21 per cent compared with the previous 12 months.

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: 'This is an astonishing fact, just slipped out by the ONS.

'It throws a new light on the huge impact of mass immigration on our society and on our future.'

The Home Office told MailOnline that the statistics show their measures are working.

Immigration
 Minister Damian Green said: 'We are now starting to see the real 
difference our tough policies are making, with an overall fall in net 
migration and the number of visas issued at its lowest since 2005.

'At
 the same time, there are encouraging signs that we continue to attract 
the brightest and best and to support tourism in the UK.

'We
 will continue to work hard to ensure that net migration is reduced from
 the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this 
Parliament.

'We are doing this by improving the selectivity of our 
immigration system and increasing enforcement activity to prevent people
 coming into the UK illegally and removing those with no right to be 
here.'
