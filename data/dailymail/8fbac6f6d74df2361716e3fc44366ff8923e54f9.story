The Senate confirmed Janet Yellen on Monday as the
first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, elevating an advocate of fighting
unemployment and a backer of the central bank's efforts to spur the economy
with low interest rates and massive bond purchases.

Ms Yellen, 67, will replace Ben Bernanke, who is
stepping down after serving as chairman for eight years dominated by the Great
Recession and the Fed's efforts to combat it.

Senators confirmed her by 56-26, with numerous
absences caused by airline flight delays forced by arctic temperatures around
much of the country. All 45 voting Democrats were joined by 11 Republicans in
supporting Ms Yellen, while 26 Republicans voted 'no.'

Vice chair of the Fed since 2010, Ms Yellen begins her
four-year term as leader of the century-old bank on Feb. 1. With the economy
rebounding from the depths of the recession but only modestly so far, many
economists expect her to focus on how to nurture growth without putting it into
overdrive, which could risk fueling inflation.

'The big debate will be when the Fed should
tighten and how much, rather than when to step on the gas pedal and how
hard,' predicted Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial
Services, who envisions a growing economy this year.

Under Bernanke, the Fed has driven short-term
interest rates down to near zero and flushed money into the economy with huge
bond purchases, which it has just started to ease. Ms Yellen, a strong Bernanke
ally, has supported those policies and is expected to continue them until
concrete signs emerge of sustained improvement of the economy and job market.

In a written statement, President Barack Obama said
Yellen's approval means 'the American people will have a fierce
champion' who will protect them.

'I am confident that Janet will stand up for
American workers, protect consumers, foster the stability of our financial
system and help keep our economy growing for years to come,' Mr Obama said.

Lobbyists for the banking and financial services
sectors issued statements pledging to work with Ms Yellen. Both industries have
led a fight to water down restrictions imposed by Mr Obama's 2010 law overhauling
how the nation's financial system is regulated.

The big moment:  U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks to members of the press as she is on her way for a vote January 6, 2014 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Janet Yellen was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 56 - 26 to become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve Board

A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Ms Yellen previously
headed the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chaired President Bill
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and has been an economics professor at
the University of California at Berkeley.

Ms Yellen, who as an academic has focused on
unemployment and its causes, is considered a 'dove' who wants the Fed
more focused on creating jobs because unemployment is high and inflation is
low. 'Hawks' on these issues prefer a stronger emphasis on preventing
inflation.

In brief debate on her nomination, Sen. Sherrod
Brown, D-Ohio, lauded Ms Yellen, who was one of the first to warn in 2007 of a
housing bubble that could burst and damage the entire economy.

'She understands how risky financial practices
deep inside the largest Wall Street banks can have a terrible and terrifying
impact on American families,' Brown said.

But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, criticized
Ms Yellen for supporting the Fed's 'easy money' policies of low interest
rates and bond purchases.

'No one can deny that the risks are real and
could be devastating' if those policies continue for too long, Mr Grassley
said.

Ms Yellen's GOP critics have said the Fed has inflated
stock and real estate prices by pumping money into the markets, creating
investment bubbles that could burst and wound the economy anew.

Some also warn that as the Fed starts to trim its
bond holdings, it could spook financial markets, threatening the economy's
recovery by causing stock prices to drop and interest rates to rise.

Last month, the Fed announced that it will start
gradually reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, trimming them
back initially to $75 billion this month and taking 'further measured
steps' as economic conditions improve.

But the Fed also indicated that it will keep
supporting an economy that it considers less than fully healthy. It said it
will continue to keep interest rates low and try to boost unusually low
inflation, which can slow spending and borrowing.

During her November confirmation hearing before the
Senate Banking Committee, Ms Yellen said the Fed's bond buying program has
successfully supported the economy by keeping long-term borrowing rates low.

The Fed's holdings have reached $4 trillion, more
than quadruple their level before the financial crisis hit in late 2008.

The U.S. economy has grown only modestly since the
Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, though it has shown encouraging
signs in recent months.

Unemployment fell to 7 percent last month, down
from a recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. The economy grew at an annual
rate of 4.1 percent from July through September and has added an average
200,000 jobs monthly since August.

President Barack Obama nominated Yellen in October
after considering selecting Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary who
had been a close Obama adviser early in his presidency. Summers withdrew after
opponents complained about his temperament and past support for bank
deregulation.

Mr Obama called Ms Yellen a 'proven leader' and
hailed her frequent focus on the unemployed, saying, 'She understands the
human cost when people can't find a job.'

She will be the first Fed chair newly appointed by
a Democratic president since Paul Volcker, picked by President Jimmy Carter, left
the post in 1987. Mr Clinton reappointed Alan Greenspan and Mr Obama gave Bernanke a
second term, though both were initially chosen by GOP presidents.

Ms Yellen will preside over her first Fed meetings as
chair on March 18 and 19.
