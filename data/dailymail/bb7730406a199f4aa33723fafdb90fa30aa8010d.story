Watched: English teacher Kim Shaw, pictured, was followed by private detectives after taking sick leave as she was suffering stress-related conditions

Council chiefs spent £3,600 of taxpayers’ money hiring private detectives to snoop on an employee who was signed off sick.

Teacher Kim Shaw, 56, was illegally tailed by the ‘Stasi-like’ snoopers for three days after bosses gave them her photograph and address.

Their report included images of her visiting Asda, bending down to look at flowers, and the observation that she was wearing ‘unusual’ kitten heels.

Colin Adkins, of the NASUWT union, compared Caerphilly County Borough Council in South Wales to the Stasi – the former East German secret police.

Now the Information Commissioner’s Office has ruled the council had no business covertly tracking Mrs Shaw, a teacher with 30 years’ experience.

Last night, the mother of two said: ‘My reaction when I saw the covert film was utter revulsion. 

'Then I experienced a range of quite intense emotions, ranging from fear that someone had been almost stalking me to incredulity at the personal details in the report. The whole tone of it was absurd.’

In its report, Conquest Surveillance Services said: ‘On March 18 the subject was seen to be wearing unusual shoes.

'They may be considered inappropriate and flamboyant if there are issues of depression or even in the context of unusual for shopping and walking up steep inclines.

'The shoes were kitten heels with flowers on the front.’

The Information Commissioner’s Office – the body set up to uphold information rights – has ordered the Labour-controlled council to review its use of surveillance, saying it had no reason to have Mrs Shaw followed, and had breached the Data Protection Act.

She said: ‘To think of these agents noting the way I walked, what I was saying, the expression on my face, where I was going – that was really threatening, almost violating.’

Followed: The teacher is then seen walking away from the supermarket with shopping bags in her hands

Illegal: An investigation into the surveillance found the county's decision to follow Mrs Shaw was unlawful

Mrs Shaw, who taught English at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, was suspended in November 2010 for breaching confidentiality after she talked to colleagues about allegations from senior staff of ‘irregularities’ in her GCSE students’ work.

Bosses who suspect staff of taking sick leave on the basis of a fake illness often mount surveillance operations to see if they are telling the truth.

But yesterday’s ruling by the Information Commissioner’s Office has made such snooping more difficult.

Local councils and other public bodies that want to check whether an employee is swinging the lead cannot easily use the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which allows councils to spy on local residents suspected of minor crimes.

It is difficult to use against staff because going off sick is not a crime.

The ruling means employers trying to check whether workers who have been signed off really are ill will now have to show all other options were explored first and any surveillance was undertaken as a ‘last resort’.

She then went on sick leave for stress-related conditions and was placed under surveillance in March 2011. She did not go back and was fired in September 2012.

She took the council to a tribunal, where she learned of the surveillance, discovering it paid the detectives £3,600 to identify whether she was ‘defrauding the sickness absence system’.

Anne Jones, assistant information commissioner for Wales, said: ‘Spying on employees is incredibly intrusive and must only be the last resort.

'Organisations need to be absolutely clear why they need to carry out covert surveillance and consider all other alternatives first.

'If it cannot be completely justified, it should not be done.

'Covert surveillance should be used as a last resort when alternatives which respect the employee's privacy have been considered and determined as not appropriate.'

Caerphilly Council said the snooping was not carried out using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which lets councils carry out surveillance.

Observations: Notes made by the private investigators included comments on Mrs Shaw's (pictured) shoes

Details: The council provided the surveillance company with the teacher's (pictured) address and photograph

A council spokesman said they had stopped surveillance of employees until a full review had been carried out.

He said: 'The authority accepts the findings of the ICO and has signed an undertaking to ensure full compliance in the future.

'The council has publicly stated previously that the surveillance of council employees is on hold pending a thorough review of its policies and procedures. This remains the position.'

Mrs Shaw’s husband, Kevin, 55, said: ‘It was a vindictive act. We were followed at the cost of taxpayers’ money.’
