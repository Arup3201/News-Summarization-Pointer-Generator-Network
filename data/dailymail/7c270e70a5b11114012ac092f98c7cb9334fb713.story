Bill Clinton has given an emotional tribute to an eight-and-a-half months pregnant Harvard graduate who worked for his foundation before she was gunned down in the Kenyan mall massacre.

Speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative on Tuesday, the former president remembered Dutch-born Elif Yavuz, 33, who was killed with her Australian architect boyfriend, Ross Langdon, in the mall used by Westerners in Nairobi.

Yavuz, a malaria specialist, was working for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation at the time of her death and had moved to Nairobi as she deemed it the safest place to give birth.

Clinton, who met Yavuz six weeks ago, remembered her as a 'brilliant young mother-to-be who did everything she could to make the most of her life' and called Langdon 'incredibly gifted and good'.

Struggle: Speaking at the Clinton Global 
Initiative on Tuesday, Bill Clinton became emotional as he remembered meeting Elif
 Yavuz just six weeks before she was killed in Kenya. He called her a 'brilliant young mother-to-be'

Emotional: He said he was 'a little choked up' as he just spoken to Yavuz's grieving mother, who said she was hoping to name the couple's unborn child after a Swahili word for 'life' or 'love'

He recounted the moment he met Yavuz when he traveled to Africa to meet his employees.

'This
 beautiful woman comes up to me, very pregnant,' he said. 'She was so 
pregnant that I assured her that I was a Lamaze father and could be 
pressed into service at any moment.

'She
 and her baby's father, they went to Nairobi because they thought it was
 the safest, best place for her to give birth... and they were just 
walking in the mall that day. And they were killed.'

Struggling
 to keep back his tears, Clinton added that he was 'a little choked up' 
as he had just spoken with Yavuz's mother on the phone. She and her 
family had decided to name the unborn child after a Swahili word for 
'life' or 'love', he said.

He
 added: 'I'm very grateful that this young woman gave so much of her 
life in working with our foundation. I am sorry that she gave her life.'

Loss: Elif Yavuz, who worked for the Clinton Foundation, was killed in the Kenya mall massacre. Bill Clinton and his family called her 'brilliant and dedicated' as they shared their condolences

The former president and his family also paid tribute to Yavuz on their foundation's website.

'Elif devoted her life to helping others, particularly people in 
developing countries suffering from malaria and HIV/AIDS.'

They added that she had previously worked with the foundation's Health Access Initiative as she worked on her doctoral studies before recently rejoining as a senior vaccines researcher in Tanzania.

'Elif was brilliant, 
dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her 
terribly,' the Clintons wrote. 'On behalf of the entire Clinton Foundation, we send our 
heartfelt condolences and prayers to Elifâ€™s family and her many friends 
throughout the world.'

The couple were two of the 62 people who lost their lives in the days-long attack at the mall.

Mr Langdon had been involved with a number of projects across Africa, which included designing an HIV-Aids hospital in Kenya free of charge.

The London-based architect could be seen photographed with Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, in a picture posted on his Facebook profile earlier this year.

Mr Langdon, who studied architecture at the University of Tasmania then the University of Sydney, worked for several companies before founding his own firm Regional Associates Ltd in May 2008.

Born and brought up in south-eastern Tasmania, his work included projects in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania.

Ms Yavuz had lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while studying at the renowned Harvard University.

Esther
 Waters-Crane, a British expat who was an acquaintance of Elif's, 
described her grief at losing the expectant mother, and how Kenya has 
reacted to the unprovoked attack.

She said: 'I'm so, so sad about Elif. We had been in regular contact about her birth her in Nairobi and

I feel sick/angry/furious/shocked by this tragic, tragic waste of lovely people. 'Nairobi is awash with helicopters right now.

'I'm
 at home and the explosions from Westgate are so loud they sound like 
they're on my road. We're all in pieces about this- a very very sad time
 for Nairobi and for dear Kenya.'

The architect's mother told of the 'excruciating loss' she was suffering.

Mr Langdon's mother spoke of her grief on social media.

'We have lost my beautiful son Ross Langdon, his lovely partner Elif Yavuz and their much loved baby just two weeks away from birth,' Mrs Langdon wrote on her son's Facebook page.

'The loss is immeasurable, absurd and excruciating.'

The architectural practice where he worked as a director said in a 
statement: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss our friend and 
colleague Ross Langdon and his partner Elif Yavuz.

'Profoundly talented and full of life, Ross enriched the lives of all those around him. Ross's leadership on projects throughout East-Africa was inspirational.

'Ross was living his dream, greatly 
contributing to the lives of people within highly disadvantaged 
communities and supporting habitat conservation for some of the world's 
most threatened species.

'Ross
 will be very, very sorely missed. Our deepest condolences and thoughts 
are with Ross and Elif's families at this very difficult time.'

Mr Langdon last year gave a talk at TEDxKrakow in Poland. TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is a global set of conferences owned by the private non-profit Sapling Foundation, under the slogan 'ideas worth spreading'.

On a blog for TEDxKrakow, which calls itself an independently organised TED event, tributes were paid to the architect.

The site said: 'It was with great sadness that we learnt of the tragic murder of Ross Langdon and his wife Elif Yavuz in the terrorist attacks in Nairobi on Saturday. They were expecting their first baby in a couple of weeks.

'Ross spoke at TEDxKrakow in 2012 about his work as an architect in Africa. He devoted his life to creating sustainable architecture that is integrated into communities, and he left us with hope for humanity.

'It's impossible to make sense of this senseless and shocking loss of life. We send our condolences to both their families.'

At least 62 people have been killed since the assault began on Saturday and security forces believe the last hostages have now been freed. Somali group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the attack in retaliation for Kenyan military intervention in Somalia.
