Florida woman Cherie Miller set of a chain reaction of good deeds when she decided to pay for the car in line behind her at a Chick-fil-A drive-thru.

The Temple Terrace resident stopped at the chicken restaurant because the franchise was donating proceeds of that night's sales when she spontaneously decided to engage in some charity work of her own.

'It was a way for me to pass on the love of God, and to give someone a surprise,' she told WTVT-TV.

Florida woman Cherie Miller set off a long chain of good deeds when she decided to pay for the car behind her at the Chick-fil-A drive-thru

Unbeknownst to MIller, after she drove away with her order the driver in the car behind her was so surprised they decided to repeat the act of kindness for the car behind them.

Before it ended, 18 cars in a row had repeated the deed.

'She asked to pay it forward and weâ€™ve had that happen before, but 
never have we had it go that far,' said Chick-fil-A marketing director 
Carmen Fisher in an interview with ABC News. 'It was incredible that people just kept going. And some people were paying for meals more than their meals cost.'

Miller then returned after forgetting chicken nuggets for her son, and the Chick-fil-A staff told her what she started.

18 cars in a row followed Miller's example and paid for the customers behind them

An overjoyed Miller decided to try to spark yet another chain, repeating her act, this time leading to 20 new cars paying for another customer's meal.

Miller said this only proves how influential one good deed can be.

'I just did one thing and the rest of the community took it from there,' Miller said.
