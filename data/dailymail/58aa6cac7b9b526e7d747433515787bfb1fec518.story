A three-bedroom flat shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania is to go on the market for Â£2.5million.

The musicians moved into the apartment in Knightsbridge in 1964 - the year of their first world tour. The pair - who shared with Harrison's then girlfriend, model Pattie Boyd - also briefly lived in two other flats in the central London apartment building.

The spacious property, which is listed by estate agents Hamptons International, boasts a reception room, balcony and underground parking.

Spacious: The flat offers 'versatile accommodation' in an apartment building which comes with its own porter, according to the agents, but 'will require some updating'

Famous neighbours: Harrison and Starr, who also lived with model Pattie Boyd, saw the flat on the recommendation of manager Brian Epstein - who lived on the fifth floor

The two bedrooms and en-suite master offer 'versatile accommodation' in an apartment building which comes with its own porter, according to the agents, but the property 'will require some updating'.

Harrison and Starr moved to the London flat at the recommendation of their manager Brian Epstein, who lived upstairs on the fifth floor from December 1963 until 1965.

Epstein hosted a number of parties in his top-floor flat including a legendary gathering in August 1964, which all four Beatles, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Judy Garland, among others, are believed to have attended. The celebrations spread to the roof of the building where a temporary ballroom - complete with red carpet was set up in a marquee.

Harrison and Starr's flat was burgled on 19 April 1964 while the pair were at a recording session and a party - but little was stolen apart from cufflinks, cash and souvenirs from a trip to the U.S.

A year later the Beatles met at the property for a cup of tea before they travelled to Buckingham Palace - less than a mile away - to receive their MBE medals as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours list.

Harrison and Starr also lived with model Pattie Boyd - who was then dating husband-to-be Harrison - until March 1965, when Harrison and Boyd moved to a bungalow in Esher, Surrey. Starr moved on to 
Montagu Square in Marylebon, London.
