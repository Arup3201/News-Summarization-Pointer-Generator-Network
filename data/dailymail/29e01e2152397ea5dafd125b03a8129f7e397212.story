As the summer comes to an end and the nights begin to draw in it's difficult to style the right outfit for that slight Autumnal chill. Here Eliza Scarborough puts together the best transitional outfits for this season.

DRAUGHT PROOF TROUSERS 

Blouse, £75, maxstudio.co.uk 

Trousers, £29.99, zara.com 

Shoes, £175, jimmychoo.com 

Camera with case available at leica.com 

These are snug and elegantly show off a bit of ankle. The stripes will look good with knits when the mercury drops even lower.

NOT SO FLOATY SKIRT 

Sweater, £69, marksandspencer.com 

Skirt, £39.99, zara.com 

Shoes, £175, russellandbromley.co.uk 

Necklace, £145, stelladot.co.uk 

Bag, £95, lkbennett.com 

This skirt looks light but is made from heavy-duty faux leather.

SLEEVES YET STILL SUMMERY

Dress, £39, next.co.uk 

Shoes, £45, riverisland.com

Sunglasses, £15, marksandspencer.com

A midi hemline on a fitted pencil shape will guard you from rogue gusts , while three- quarter-length sleeves ward off the chill.

T-SHIRT WITH A TWIST

Sweater, £69, marksandspencer.com 

Skirt, £98, jigsaw-online.com 

Necklace, £15, accessorize.com 

In stead of a cotton T-shirt, pick one in cashmere. It’s insulating without being bulky and looks great with a fitted pencil skirt.

 DELICIOUSLY SNUG DENIM

Shirt, £35, riverisland.com

Skirt, £29.99, and necklace, £19.99, zara.com

A thick denim shirt is the perfect mix of form and function. It will keep you warm on blustery days,

but still looks light and breezy. 

LOVELY LAYERS 

Cardigan, £79, mands.com 

Dress, £189, self-portrait-studio.com 

Sandals, £60, dune.com 

Drape a sweater over your shoulders for a casual cover-up. A broderie anglaise dress covers the legs without hiding them completely.

BODYWARMER JACKET

Max & Co jacket, £189, Fenwick: 020 7629 9161 

Jeans, £40, topshop.com 

Sweater, £69, johnlewis.com 

Shoes, £50, boden.co.uk 

A sleeveless jacket will keep you snug while streamlining your figure without the bulk of a full coat.
