A festival-goer has died after suffering a suspected reaction to ketamine at Glastonbury.

The 26-year-old man, from Reading in Berkshire, died this morning as the first official day of music got under way at Worthy Farm in Somerset.

He was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary in a 'life-threatening condition' on Wednesday.

The tragic: A 26-year-old man has died today after suffering an adverse reaction to the illegal drug ketamine when he arrived at Glastonbury festival on Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset, on Wednesday

Avon and Somerset Police tweeted: 'Unfortunately the man taken ill after a suspected reaction to ketamine has died this morning.

'His family are aware and being supported.'

Police said it is not thought that the batch of the Class B drug the man took was contaminated, but that he suffered an adverse reaction to it.

Reaction: Police said the batch of the drug was not believed to be contaminated but the festival-goer, from Reading, suffered 'an individual reaction'. He was taken ill overnight and died at Bristol Royal Infirmary

Ketamine is a powerful general anaesthetic that can cause the sensation of a near-death experience, but deaths linked to the substance are rare.

Legally used for operations on humans and animals, it gives recreational users a 'floaty' feeling but can also lead to a bad trip known as the 'K-hole'.

Costing around £20 a gram on the street, it can be addictive and includes among its effects paralysis of the muscles, loss of feeling in the body and a distorted sense of reality.

It can also cause hallucinations, agitation, panic attacks and impairment in short and long-term memory, and frequent use has been associated with depression.

The drug was regraded from a class C to a more serious class B controlled drug earlier this month amid growing concern over its impact on the health of long-term users.

Physical damage from long-term use includes serious bladder problems, with some heavy users even having to get their bladders surgically removed.

A spokesman said: 'The family of the man had been informed of his condition yesterday. His death is not considered suspicious.

'At this stage we believe this was an individual reaction to ketamine and was not from a bad batch of the drug.'

A 67-year-old woman died at the site on Wednesday night from natural causes.

Her death is not being treated as suspicious.

Kicking off the official music today, a 17-piece Japanese orchestra made an enthusiastic effort to banish the bad weather.

Turtle Island got proceedings off to a
 rousing start on the Pyramid Stage, drawing a small crowd to their 
pulsating punk-rock beats.

As
 steady rain fell on the site, many appeared reluctant to leave the 
relative comfort of their tents, while others tentatively ventured out 
in wellies and anoraks to see just how much mud they might have to 
contend with.

Although the rain - expected to continue throughout the day - was not welcome to many, stall holders charging £15 a time for wellies and waterproofs were enjoying a roaring trade.

Also performing on the Pyramid Stage later today will be Elbow, Lily Allen and Rudimental, while acts on other stages include Haim, MIA and Jurassic 5.

Police said 85 crimes were reported within the first 48 hours of the festival opening its gates on Wednesday morning, a 30 per cent decrease on last year.

About half of these were property thefts, with 30 people arrested so far.
