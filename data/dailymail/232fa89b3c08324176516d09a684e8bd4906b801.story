Police in Texas have released a sketch of a man suspected of shooting a TV weatherman multiple times as he left work on Wednesday morning.

The sketch was drawn  during a hospital bed interview with KCEN-TV meteorologist Patrick Crawford, 35, who is recovering after being shot in the stomach and shoulder.

The suspect, who managed to escape the scene in Bruceville-Eddy on foot on Wednesday morning, is described as a white male, 30 to 35 years old, with a medium build and a receding hairline.

'We are actively looking for [the suspect],' Trooper D.L. Wilson of the Texas Department of Public Safety told ABC News. 'We had troopers out overnight, but we didn't get any calls of suspicious people. We can't rule out that he's not in the area, but more than likely, he's left the area.'

Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN, was shot after he climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday. An unknown man approached him in the parking lot and they exchanged words.

The weatherman managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911.

Doctors at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple said that Crawford was recovering and in fair condition after surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

From his hospital bed, he spoke to investigators and told them he had never seen the man before.

Police have not yet found a motive for the shooting.

KCEN also reported that police were at the station on Thursday, checking IDs of everyone driving in the parking lot.

Crawford's wife, fellow KCEN meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, also revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life.

'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night.

'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.' 

Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. 

KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page.

Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012.

He  married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year.

The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday.

'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN.

'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting.

'The shooter, as of this note, has not been caught. We do not know who the shooter was or if he is connected in any way to KCEN or its employees.'

Concerns: Law enforcement officers set up near a command post and look for the gunman on Wednesday

Response: Texas Department of Public Safety officers go in a pickup to a command post while other officers look for the gunman accused of shooting Crawford outside the station on Wednesday

He added that Brinkmann was by her husband's side in the hospital.

'He is a loved member of the KCEN family and our thoughts and prayers go out to him, Heather and their family,' he wrote.

On Wednesday morning, just hours before he was shot, Crawford showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy.

The town is about 75 miles north of Austin.
