China yesterday sent warplanes into a disputed region of the South China Sea it has claimed as within its air defence zone - days after America, Japan and South Korea flew through the area.

State media reported that the country plans to take ‘defensive emergency measures’ if any aircraft flying through the zone fail to identify themselves.

China’s air force sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft on normal air patrols into the area, air force spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke told the Xinhua agency.

The report did not specify exactly when the flights were sent or whether they had encountered foreign aircraft.

It happened after the United States, Japan and South Korea said they have sent flights through the zone without encountering Chinese response since Beijing announced the creation of the zone last week.

The zone includes an area of sea where gas had been discovered, which previously was only in an air defence zone marked out by Japan.

Both countries regard any land there as within their economic zones, meaning they claim the exclusive right to any income to be made from the territory.

The row centres on airspace to the north east of what the Japanese call the Senkaku islands, and what China calls the Diaoyu.

Taiwan also lays claim over the Senkaku islands, and South Korea maintains claims over a submerged rock in the northern part of China’s new air defence zone.

China’s reassertion of its sovereignty over the area yesterday marked a worrying escalation of the dispute.

Col Shen described the flights as ‘a defensive measure and in line with international common practices.’

He said China’s air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country’s airspace.

China says the establishment of the zone was ‘completely justified and legitimate’.

Without prior notice, Beijing began demanding on Saturday that passing aircraft identify themselves and accept Chinese instructions or face consequences.

The move has been widely condemned, however, with America describing it as a ‘destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region’.

Concerns have grown over an escalation in tensions because both China and Japan have large naval fleets in the waters around the South China Sea.

Some experts believe the spark for the latest action is thought to have been Japan’s threat last month to shoot down drones China says it will send to the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands for mapping expeditions.

While China’s surprise announcement last week to create the zone initially raised tensions in the region, some analysts believe Beijing’s motive was not to trigger an aerial confrontation but a more long-term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own.

China’s lack of efforts to stop the foreign flights - including two U.S. B-52s that flew through the zone on Tuesday - has been an embarrassment for Beijing. Even some Chinese state media outlets suggested on Thursday that Beijing may have mishandled the episodes.
