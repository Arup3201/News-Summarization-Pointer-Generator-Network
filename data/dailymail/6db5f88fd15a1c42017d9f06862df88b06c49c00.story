Once an annual round of exclusive balls, refined dinner parties and other polished social events, the London season – the highlight of which was the debutante ball- was an important way for the elite to match make the younger generations. 

Today however, not only has the ball has lost its royal patronage, but is barely recognisable from its aristocratic origins.

Held this year in Highclere Castle, which plays host to popular ITV drama Downton Abbey, the ball is increasingly popular among affluent foreigners and  mega-rich Britons looking to experience a piece of Britain's cultured past while simultaneously putting their wealth on display.

Each ticket to the ball cost thousands, with a table costing £2,500, meaning nearly all of the debutantes hail from ultra-rich families

In the past, young women from the very best landed gentry stock would be presented to the monarch at Buckingham Palace in a virginal white gown at the Queen Charlotte's Debutante Ball to announce their ‘coming out’ into society.

No longer an event for an elite group of the British aristocracy, the Queen Charlotte's Debutante Ball, this year held at Highclere Castle, near Newbury, is now open essentially to anyone who can afford it.

This year the excited debutantes  also had the opportunity to play at being the Lady Grantham as they spent hours preening in the now famous castle before their sweeping entrance into the ball.

The historical ball is steeped in traditions, but many claim is barely recognisable from its aristocratic origins

Each debutante will have been selected – and paid thousands of pounds- for the privilege of taking months of etiquette classes and dabbling in carefully chosen charity projects

The  ladies being ‘presented’ are still a rather spectacular vision in a sea of cream silks, chiffon and lace

With tables starting at £2,500 and run by a partnership of corporate sponsors and companies based in the United Arab Emirates, attendance is strictly for the well-to-do, with many traditionalists bemoaning the loss of the balls gentile and refined roots. 

And while the young ladies being ‘presented’ are still a rather spectacular vision in a sea of cream silks and lace, their place at the Ball will have been purchased, rather than a birth right.

Apparently celebrating their year of charity fund raising, etiquette classes and ‘debut’ on the dating scene at The Queen Charlotte's Ball, most young ladies take the opportunity to have a bespoke designer dress made for the night.

The young ladies, usually aged between 17 and 20 then finish their debutante experience by attending the grand ball where they are presented to guests and curtsey to the Queen Charlotte Cake.

Prior to the event older debutantes are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress, dancing and pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and make-up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing, setting off perfectly coiffed up 'dos with diamond studded tiaras and precious jewellery.

The 'deb of the year' is chosen according to 'who has worked hardest’ during fund-raising activities throughout the season and shown the most enthusiasm.

The Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret famously said of the end of the royal patronage of the ball: ‘we had to put a stop to it . . . every tart in London was getting in!’

After the ceremony the ladies are allowed to change into a dress of their choosing for the after party- with most years leading to tales of debauchery and behaviour most unfitting for a lady. 

The ball has been running almost every year since 1780, when King George III first organised the Queen Charlotte’s Ball as a way to celebrate his wife’s birthday.

The ceremony remained unchanged- with debutantes paying respects to a large iced cake at Buckingham Palace, overseen by the monarch- until 1958, when Prince Philip persuaded the Queen to stop receiving each year’s crop at Court.

Philip is said to have complained that the annual Ball, at which girls aged 17 and 18 were expected to meet their suitably-moneyed future husbands, was ‘bloody daft’.

The Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, was even more forthright, saying later ‘we had to put a stop to it . . . every tart in London was getting in!’

Since 1958 the ball was held sporadically at various exclusive venues in the capital to varying degrees of success before being relaunched in 2009 and held annually since, albeit without its royal seal of approval.
