Shocking footage has emerged of a truck's back trailer rolling over on its side on a motorway.

The footage shows a vehicle driving along Sydney's M4 motorway on Thursday morning before capturing the terrifying moment of the single-truck crash on a dashboard camera.

Driving under wet conditions, the truck’s dog trailer can be seen losing control as it wobbles from left to right – lifting one side up in the air before it landed back down but ends up flipping over.

Within seconds, the trailer ends up scrapping on its’ side along the freeway but luckily the surrounding vehicles managed to avoid any collision with the truck.

The driver with the dashcam, believed to be Mat Wake, can be heard stepping on his brake, as he slowly drives towards the incident while smoke and dust started appearing from the trailer.

When the trailer stopped sliding across the road, other motorists are seen driving around the truck but they continue off in their journey.

It is unclear what happened after the incident but one motorist posted a photograph of the accident scene on the video, showing a tow truck, road officials and police officers surrounding the empty trailer.

The video was posted onto Dash Cam Owners Australia on Thursday morning. A caption along the video explained: 'A Dog trailer of a truck develops a tank slapper ans [sic] flips on Sydney's M4 motorway. Luckily Police were just down the road and started reversing up as it happened.'

Since it was last uploaded, the video has received more than 55,000 views and a significant amount of comments about the incident.

Damean Frost said: ‘First thing my 6 year old asked why isnt anybody stopping to help..’

Dave Cowan posted: ‘Nice Work , How About Stopping and at Least Seeing if the Driver Was Alright, Were You Late for a Hair Appointment !’

But the driver who caught it all on camera, Mat Wake has defended why he didn’t stopped, saying ‘To all commenting about me not stopping… There were already 2cars [sic] pulled up behind him and a cop 100m away reversing to the situation.’
