Britain was warned six months ago that US snooping laws were being used to spy on our communications.

The revelation comes as MPs prepare to fly out to Washington to raise concerns about US spies passing on internet data to the UK’s intelligence gathering centre, GCHQ in Cheltenham.

Yesterday, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the intelligence watchdog, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), said he expected a response from GCHQ over claims that it had gathered data from US internet companies which had been obtained under a new US law.

Concerns: Spy centre GCHQ, Government Communications Headquarters, in Cheltenham

Sir Malcolm said: ‘The ISC is aware of the allegations. The ISC will be receiving a full report from GCHQ very shortly and will decide what action needs to be taken.’

But a report commissioned by the European Union warned in January that the law allowed US security agencies to demand to read our emails or see social media pages if they could show that the information might be of value to US interests. The report said that the draconian powers, which apply to all US companies, are a ‘grave risk’ to the rights of EU citizens.

The report authors, who included Caspar 
Bowden, a former head of privacy at Microsoft, say data held by US 
internet companies ‘becomes liable to mass-surveillance – for purposes 
of furthering the foreign affairs of the US’.

Police have stored details of 15 billion journeys made by motorists on a ‘Big Brother’ database that even chief constables admit raises privacy concerns.

As many as 8,000 cameras are automatically taking photos of 26 million number plates every day in a bid to track criminals. Officers can keep the images taken on the Automatic Number Place Recognition (ANPR) system for two years.

But following pressure from the Home Secretary and data watchdogs, police chiefs concede that blanket use of the cameras ‘impacts significantly on the privacy of law-abiding citizens’.

Now the Association of Chief Police Officers has set out 14 ‘golden rules’ to ensure use of the cameras is lawful, which could mean fewer journeys being stored.

Nick Pickles, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘If police forces are abusing their access to ANPR data by ignoring data protection law then officials have some serious questions to answer.’

The document says EU citizens should be warned that the information will be freely accessible to the US authorities and calls for EU citizens to be given the same rights as US citizens in American courts.

Leaks last week claimed that GCHQ accessed data on the internet activity of Britons obtained by a US spying programme called Prism.

America’s National Security Agency is able to access the internet data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendment Act which is designed ‘to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-US persons located outside the United States’. It is claimed that the NSA and the FBI have accessed the systems of nine of the world’s top internet companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype.

According to the leaked document, ‘special programmes for GCHQ exist for focused Prism processing’ – suggesting the British agency may have been receiving material from a part of the programme specifically designed to meet its needs.

MPs expressed concern. Senior Tory David Davis said it was difficult to reconcile GCHQ’s statement that it was subject to proper scrutiny with the fact that Parliament had no knowledge of the activity. ‘Since nobody knew it was happening at all there is no possibility of complaint,’ he said.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘It is important for the UK intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad, particularly in vital counter-terror work. However, there also have to be legal safeguards in place.’

Shami Chakrabarti, of civil rights group Liberty, said: ‘These reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale.’

But Tory MP Ben Wallace, a former British Army intelligence officer, said: ‘I cannot see what all the fuss is about. Communications data is an essential tool in countering terrorism.
