A six-year-old boy has been left orphaned after his parents and seven-month-old sister all died in a car crash as they made their way to a church retreat in Oregon.

Tiffany Fefelov, 27, was driving her husband Fred, 34, and their daughter Mila on U.S. 20 Saturday morning when she lost control of their Dodge Caliber on the wet road, the Oregon State Police said.

The vehicle crossed into oncoming traffic and smashed head-on into a 2001 Chevy Suburban towing a 32-foot trailer. The couple inside the SUV were unharmed but the Fefelovs  all died.

The Fefelovs' six-year-old son Ewan was staying with a relative at the time. Tiffany's large family - she was the oldest of seven children - now plan to raise the boy.

Devastating: The young family was devoted to their church and each other, Tiffany's relatives said

'Everybody's just very devastated for their son and what's going to happen to him,' their pastor Ricky Challinor told KOIN6. 'His entire life changed in one day. He lost his immediate family. I can't even imagine what that would be like.'

The family, from Tigard, were heading to a church retreat hosted in Deschutes County by the Portland International Christian Church when the crash occurred at 10am on Saturday.

Challinor said several people tried calling the couple throughout the day to find out where they were but they received a call from Tiffany's mother with the devastating news later that afternoon.

'It didn't even seem real,' Challinor told the Oregonian. 'My heart sank.' 

The couple had been part of the church for at least two years and helped lead its marriage ministry, providing a source of encouragement for other couples, Challinor said.

Loving: Tiffany, a registered nurse, was a doting mother to baby Mila, pictured, and her son, family said

Happy: They led their church's marriage ministry and were a source of encouragement for other couples

Doting: Fred, a maintenance manager at an assisted living facility, had a great sense of humor, relatives said

'They were a friendly face that a lot of people here knew,' he said. 'They touched a lot of people's lives, and this is a tremendous loss for all of us.'

A relative of Tiffany's who worked with Fred at a Space Age gas station had introduced the pair, and they quickly began dating. They would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary in March.   

'Tiffany, Fred and Mila were such a huge part of this family,' Tiffany's sister-in-law Rachelle Burgess said. 'Now they're gone, and it's so sudden. The loss here is absolutely devastating.'

Family members told the Oregonian that Fred, who was born in Alaska before moving to Oregon to study art, would be remembered for his boisterous sense of humor and thankful, humble nature.

The dad worked in Afghanistan as a contract field service technician and was employed as a maintenance manager at an assisted living facility at the time of his death, the newspaper reported.

Tiffany was a licensed practical nurse and would be remembered as devoted and caring, while their baby daughter was good-natured and always a delight, family said. 

Crash: Mrs Fefelov lost control of their car on a wet road and hurtled towards oncoming traffic, smashing head-on with this SUV pulling a trailer. The Fefelovs all died but the couple in the SUV were not harmed

A Gofundme memorial fund has been sent up for the family and a memorial will be held next Sunday at the DoubleTree Hotel in Portland. 

'Everyone that knew Tiffany and Fred knew they shared their contagious laughter, loving nature and generosity for all those around them,' their memorial page reads.

'They loved to celebrate all that life has blessed them with each and every day.

'The family is beyond devastated and at a loss for words to express their extreme sadness of the loss of such a beautiful family.'
