the Bridle Path area of Simi Valley. Still armed, he was riding the 
tractor at the bottom of the city’s foothills.

Cops have responded to multiple mental health-related calls in the past, the most recent one having been in 2008, according to the New York Daily News. It is not clear if his mental health issues were related to his military service, Ryan Carnan had no prior criminal record.
