A French mayor was accused of 'racism and xenophobia' today after refusing to allow a dead Roma gipsy baby to be buried in a municipal cemetery.

It follows the country's Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, infamously calling for entire Roma communities to be deported because they 'cannot integrate'.

This time it is Christian Leclerc, the conservative mayor of Champlan, the Paris commuter town, who has sparked a nationwide controversy.

The Roma baby was refused burial at Champlan's municipal cemetery (pictured) after the town's mayor said the few available plots were reserved for those who paid their taxes

When a Roma family living in an illegal camp said they wanted to give their two-and-a-half month old child, identified as Maria Francesca, a proper burial, he said no.

Mr Leclerc insisted his local cemetery had 'very few available plots' and that 'priority is given to those who pay their taxes.'

But Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France.

'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day.

Maria Francesca's parents are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools.

Now the mother and father are hoping to see their child buried in Wissous, another town nearby, after Richard Trinquier, the local major, said it was a 'question of humanity'.

Mr Trinqueir said: 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened.'

Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water of electricity in Champlan, and there are frequent calls for their camp to be razed.

They are part of community of some 20,000 mainly Romanian and Bulgarian gipsies in France who are regularly linked with crime and anti-social behaviour.

Mr Valls, the notoriously reactionary Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who want to see them deported.

As Interior Minister, he regularly approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families, saying: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.'

In August, Gilles Bourdouleix, another French mayor, was fined after saying that Adolf Hitler 'maybe did not kill enough' Roma during the Second World War.
