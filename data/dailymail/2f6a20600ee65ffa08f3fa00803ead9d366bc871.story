Felipe Massa has described last week’s Japanese Grand Prix as the ‘worst race of my life’.

The Williams driver was speaking at a sombre press conference ahead of Formula One’s inaugural visit to Russia which came only five days after Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at Suzuka.

The 25-year-old Frenchman remains in a stable but critical condition at Mie University Hospital after he suffered a severe head trauma following his freak collision with a recovery vehicle during the closing stages of Sunday’s rain-hit race.

‘For me I think it was the worst race of my life,’ said Massa, who finished seventh, but revealed afterwards that he was ‘screaming’ about the difficult conditions in the laps leading up to Bianchi’s accident. 

‘It was a really bad race, worse than the race of my accident - because I didn't remember,' he added. 

Massa was alluding to his life-threatening crash during qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Driving for Ferrari, he was struck on the helmet by a spring which had fallen off Rubens Barrichello’s Brawn.

The Brazilian had surgery on a fractured skull and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2009 campaign. But he made a full recovery and returned to fitness in time for the opening race of the following season.

‘It's a very difficult weekend for all of us,’ Massa added. ‘Maybe tomorrow it will get a little bit better because at least you are working, at least you have something to think about, some issue to put inside your brain.’

Still trying to cope with Bianchi's accident, the majority of the grid said they had to be professional and focus on the race, despite the dark cloud hanging over this weekend's event in Sochi.

‘All our thoughts are with Jules,’ said Fernando Alonso, whose Ferrari team will carry the words ‘Forza Jules’ on their car this weekend.

‘I have a huge respect for our sport but when big accidents happen, there are no words to describe the feeling.

‘It's going to be emotionally very difficult, we will race for him, in our minds we are with him, praying.’

Bianchi, a graduate of the Ferrari academy, was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury after his Marussia slid off the track in rainy conditions and ploughed into a crane picking up the Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had crashed out at the same spot only minutes earlier.

Sutil, who witnessed Bianchi's accident, said: ‘We have to pray, that's all we can do. Although there is a grey cloud over us, we have to try to be professional and race for him.’
