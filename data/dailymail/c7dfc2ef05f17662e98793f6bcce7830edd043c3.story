A 79-year-old Belgium fan was given the surprise of a lifetime by Eden Hazard after the football star sent her a signed shirt and video message.

Meme Francine may claim to only know the players' names thanks to her son-in-law, but the elderly woman's Red Devils merchandise proves just how much of a fan she is.

Hazard sat down for the Belgian Red Devils YouTube channel to read a good luck message from Francine before signing a shirt and saying, 'Nana Francine, for you, signed.'

Upon receiving the signed shirt, Francine could hardly hold back her tears as she claimed, 'you don't expect this at my age.'

Francine will be 80 later this year and has a house full of merchandise dedicated to the national team from beer glasses to badges.

Luckily for the super fan, Hazard is 'the big one' in her eyes, so it's just as well he was the player to put pen to shirt.
