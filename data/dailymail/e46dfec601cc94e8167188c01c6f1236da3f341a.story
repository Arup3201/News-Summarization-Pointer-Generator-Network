Facing jail: RSPCA inspectors found the second rabbit with a broken spine in the home of Bilal Yilmaz (pictured), 23, in Hull, East Yorkshire

A takeaway driver killed a rabbit by hurling it from a 40ft balcony - and smashed another against a brick wall, a court heard.

RSPCA inspectors found the second rabbit with a broken spine in the home of Bilal Yilmaz, 23, in Hull, East Yorkshire - after it had been dragging itself around the home using just its front legs.

The animal was so badly injured that its back legs had started decomposing while it was still alive, Hull Magistrates’ Court was told.

Inspectors said the decomposing flesh smell was so strong on the living rabbit that they had to move away to avoid being physically sick before rescuing the animal, when it was put to sleep.

Yilmaz - who will soon be sentenced for animal cruelty and also for assaulting his pregnant wife - laughed at police when they asked if he had hurt the animals, the court was told.

One of the pets had been unable to walk for more than month due to a broken spine and femur after being thrown against the wall - and had not been taken for any treatment.

RSPCA inspector Hannah Bryer said: ‘This is an horrific case. Inflicting violence on any animal is completely unacceptable. It was an appalling, callous and cruel act.

‘This young rabbit would have been powerless to do anything to protect itself and she was then left untreated for weeks before she was found.

'Doing this job, I have seen some horrendous consequences of cruelty and neglect - but this one will stick in my mind for a long time to come.

‘My heart sinks when I think about the immense suffering this rabbit will have endured at the hands of her owner - the very person who was meant to care for her.’

The second rabbit was found emaciated and 
immobile inside a cardboard box covered with a plastic carrier bag after
they were called to the flat after a dispute with his partner in 
February.

Philip Brown, prosecuting, said: ‘The rabbit was emaciated and underweight. It was unable to move its hind legs and could only move by dragging itself along on its front legs.

‘Its flesh was decomposing and there was a strong, foul smell. The inspector felt physically sick and had to move away before she recovered it.’

Yilmaz claimed to have only ‘flicked’ the rabbit against a wall inside the flat after it bit him. However, a vet concluded the rabbit must have been forcefully thrown to inflict the injuries.

Mr Brown said: ‘The vet said he was horrified by the degree of suffering this animal endured, especially considering the owner had inflicted the injuries and didn’t make any attempt to alleviate the suffering.

'This was a deliberate act of cruelty by the defendant, which resulted in the animal suffering for a prolonged period of time.’

Aside from the animal cruelty, Yilmaz was also said to have tried to drag his wife - also his cousin - into a car to convince her to have an abortion and also assaulted a toddler. He admitted ‘accidentally’ slapping a toddler across the face and will remain in custody until he is sentenced later this month.
