A jury heard today that Jodi Arias called her ex-boyfriend's cell phone four times after sheÂ  stabbed him to death in his shower.

Prosecutors say the latest evidence in the ongoing trial about the murder of Travis Alexander shows that Arias was trying to cover up her tracks by listening to- and potentially deleting messages on his phone- after she killed him, which Arias admits to committing but says that she stabbed him 27 times in self defense.

An expert from phone company Verizon took the stand in Phoenix, Arizona, saying that Arias placed a call at 11.37pm- just six hours after Alexander was killed.

The she made her last call on June 15- a week after she killed Alexander. Prosecutors argue that she left the voicemail messages in an effort to cover her tracks.

The phone expert said that one call shows that Arias dialed into Alexander's voicemail system after his death and stayed on the line for 16 minutes.

Because she did not leave any message, prosecutors argue that she was listening to and potentially deleting messages from the dead man's cell phone.

On the opposite end, the defense attorneys suggested that she didn't actually delete messages but she was simply recording and deleting her own message that she was going to leave for her dead ex before finally giving up and not leaving one in the end.

'On Verizon, is it possible to change your voice mail, to erase it and do it over again? Could someone have been doing that for a 16 minute phone call?' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said.

'Yes,' Verizon Wireless records expert Jody Citizen testified in court.

Different versions: Arias has changed her story a number of times, and is now pleading not guilty saying that she killed Alexander in self defense even though she initially said she was never in his apartment on the day of his death

Throughout the day on Tuesday, the jury was shown hours of footage of Arias in the interrogation room with the lead detective over the course of multiple interview sessions in 2008.

At one point- clearly before she admitted that she killed Alexander- she pleads with the detective, saying: 'If I killed Travis I would beg for the death penalty.'

'I have to maintain my innocence but I can't admit to something I haven't done,' she said at another point.

During one of the earliest questionings, she asked the detective how many times Alexander was stabbed, and Detective Esteban Flores said 'more than I want to remember'.

In the courtroom, Arias was visibly moved by the footage and had to cover her face at points as she cried.

The footage showed the vast series of different stories that Arias told in the months following Alexander's brutal June 2008 murder, including one where a male and female attacker were the ones who killed Alexander while they were together in the shower.

At another point, she explained her reticence of telling the detective any details came because she 'has seen the Sopranos' and feared that Alexander's supposed killers would come after her mother and younger brother as retribution if she talked.

The review of the interrogation footage signals that the prosecution is winding down in terms of their evidence before the defense takes their turn.

Arias is expected to testify, if nothing else than to simply clarify why she would need to make up so many stories her claims of self defense are true.

She faces the death penalty if found guilty.

Arias hid her face and wept in on Monday as the court was shown sexually 
explicit photos of her with ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander just hours 
before he was brutally murdered.

Detective Michael Melendez told the Phoenix court on Monday that he had recovered the deleted pictures from the victim's camera.

shielded her face with her hair and touched her eyes with a tissue as 
the prosecution showed jurors naked photographs of the pair taken around
1.45pm on June 4, 2008.

Several hours later, at 5.30pm, a series
of photographs show 30-year-old Alexander in the shower with the water 
running. The images appeared to have been taken by someone else.

Around 45 seconds later, according to
the picture's time stamp, jurors were shown a photograph of the 
bathroom ceiling that appeared to have been taken unintentionally when 
the camera dropped.

Less than a minute later, a grisly photograph  was taken which apparently depicts the back of Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck.

It is alleged that it was mistakenly taken as Arias dragged her ex-lover's body through his Mesa home after stabbing him 27 times.
