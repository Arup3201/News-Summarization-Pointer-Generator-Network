A hungry bear in the mood for food ended up in a Pooh situation after getting its head stuck in a jar, just like A.A. Milne’s famous honey-loving teddy.

Police had to be called to the scene in Ontario, Canada, after the bear was spotted walking down a street with the large white container on its head.

The Winnie-the-Pooh-a-like had been looking for a snack, discovering the plastic jar which had been used to store birdseed.

Greater Sudbury Police responded to a call around 5.30am on Sunday after the unfortunate bear had been sighted by a member of the public.

The poor bear could not get the jar off its head and ended up wandering down the street, bumping into things as it went - including a police cruiser.

Officers from Greater Sudbury Police called the Ministry of Natural Resources who tranquillised the bear.

They were able to cut the container to remove it, and the real life Winnie-the-Pooh is set to be relocated.

Children's favourite Winnie-the-Pooh, was created in the mid-1920s by author A.A. Milne, who wrote several books about Pooh Bear, his best human friend Christopher Robin and the animals of Hundred Acre Wood including Rabbit, Piglet and Eeyore.

Their adventures often see the honey-loving teddy bear get his head stuck in jars in his quest to eat all the ‘hunny’.

In the 70s, Disney released the first animated movie about Winnie The Pooh (sans hyphens), a franchise which was to become one of the most successful in the company's history.
