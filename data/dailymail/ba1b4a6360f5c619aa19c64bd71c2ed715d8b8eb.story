It has been a tourist attraction for thousands of U2 fans since 1987.

But the tree that adorned the cover of the band's album, Joshua Tree, is now a shadow of its former glory.

The revered landmark died in 2000 and collapsed into a mound in California's Mojave Desert.

Now it has apparently been deliberately vandalized and is missing a limb.

Vandalized: This is a picture a fan took of the band's famous Joshua Tree apparently hacked by someone

'Iconic': The tree, which died in 2000, appeared on the cover of U2's 1987 hit album Joshua Tree

A fan discovered the situation during his annual hike to the tree near Darwin, California, with his dog on Sunday.

Going by the name Hwy 190, the fan wrote on a U2 message board: 'I’ve been visiting U2’s Joshua Tree in the California desert for nearly 20 years now the Mojave is my home. 

'This past Sunday, I made my proverbial yearly hike out to the Tree with my dog to reminisce only to find that some hack and I do mean hack, decided it was a bright idea to take a hacksaw to one of the Tree’s limbs - evidently to remove an inch thick cross section as a souvenir.

'I won’t even elaborate as to how pathetic this is. Let’s just say It was a good thing I didn’t happen upon this ignorant low-life degenerate in his course of action.

'In short, leave the damn Tree alone, so that future fans can enjoy it. Left alone, the Tree will be there for many, many decades to come.'

It stood in the Mojave Desert of California and was picked by the band to represent their American experience 

Collapsed: Although it fell in 2000, many fans still pilgrimage to the site

Tributes: Signs adorn the tree. The fan who discovered the vandalism believes somebody took a piece home

The image of the tree was shot by photographer Anton Corbijn, who traveled with the band for three days in December 1986 trying to find the right spot for a photo. 

The album was designed to represent their band's experience of America.

It is billed as the record that sealed their worldwide success, with record-breaking sales across the world.

Some of their best-selling songs were featured on the album, including With Or Without You, and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.

The group landed Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Group Rock Performance that year.
