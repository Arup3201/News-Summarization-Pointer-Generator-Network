Council officials have been left red-faced after a spelling blunder was printed on the side of a mobile library.

The bus, which delivers books to children, was meant to bear the slogan 'Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body'.

But 'exercise' was misspelt on the yellow van as 'exersice'. 

Council officials at Somerset County Council were left red-faced after the word 'exercise' was spelled incorrectly on the side of a mobile library (pictured)

The error was spotted by Robert Colledge when the vehicle pulled into the village of Isle Brewers, near Taunton.

The 65-year-old said: 'I did think it was quite ironic. I asked the driver if the misspelling was a deliberate attempt to attract people to the library.

'He said it wasn't a deliberate typo, and that I was the first person to mention it. He'd spotted it himself, but hadn't been able to correct it.' 

A Somerset County Council spokesman said: 'We are aware of the mistake on this particular mobile library and as far as we are aware this is the only vehicle with the mistake.

'It will be corrected at a minimal cost.'
