Rear Admiral Carlos Busser who led the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands has died of a heart attack

The Argentine commander who led the invasion of the Falklands Islands has died of a heart attack in Buenos Aires.

Rear Admiral Carlos Busser commanded the Argentine Marines Fifth battalion during 'Operation Rosario' to capture the Islands In April 1982.

As the 
highest ranking officer to set foot on the Falklands he ordered his troops to surround Government House in Stanley before demanding the surrender of the then governor Sir Rex Hunt.

Outnumbered Royal Marines shot dead an Argentine navy officer during a brave attempt to
 defend the disputed territory shortly before the April 2 1982 
surrender.

Busser, 84, died after suffering a heart attack at his home in the Argentine capital on Saturday night.

He had been under house arrest since 2009 over alleged human rights abuses at Argentina's main naval base Puerto Belgrano in the 1970s.

Prosecutors had accused him of involvement in the torture and disappearance of three men including an ex-intelligence officer said to have been tortured into confessing he was a Chilean spy.

Sir Rex Hunt summoned Rear Admiral Busser 
to negotiate after the Argentines took control of the island airstrip 
and surrounding Government House.

He
 told him: 'This is British territory. You're not invited. We don't want
 you here. I want you to go now and take all your men with you.'

Busser replied: 'I've got 800 men ashore and another 2,000 waiting to land.

'We didn't think you'd resist. Tell your men to lay down their arms before we cause casualties.'

The following day Argentina sent troops to capture and occupy South Georgia and the uninhabitated South Sandwich islands.

Governor
 Hunt and officials from the Foreign Office were forcibly evicted from 
the Falklands by the Argentine forces and sent to the Uruguayan capital 
Montevideo.

Britain recaptured the disputed territory on June 14 1982 following the death of 649 Argentines and 255 Brits.

Busser, speaking of the Falklands in an interview with an Argentine newspaper several years ago, said: 'I think the decision to recover the Falkland Islands was correctly adopted by the Argentine government.

'If we subsequently committed errors and lost the war, that doesn't detract from the message Argentina always sent the British government about our determination to capture the islands.'
