An advert for Russian brides showing a woman exposing her cleavage on the Radio Times website has been banned for being ‘overtly sexual'.

Three readers complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after spotting the saucy image, which showed a brunette wearing only a ‘low-cut bra’.

She was pictured lying down and pouting at the camera, along with the wording: ‘Sexy Russian Sensations... Free membership... Flirt now.’

'Overtly sexual': A screengrab of the advert as it appears on the Russian brides website. Three readers complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after spotting the saucy image

The ASA said the advert appeared on a general TV listings website.

Speaking on the ban, the ASA said: 'We noted that the ad featured a woman in a 
provocative pose that focused on her cleavage, and her pursed lips 
appeared seductive in nature.

‘Because the ad was overtly sexual and could also be seen by children, we concluded it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.'

It added that the advert must not be allowed to appear again.

Bosses at Anastasia International, parent company of russianbrides.com did not response to the ASA.

A spokesman for Immediate Media Company London Ltd, the publisher of Radio Times, said that the ad put directly put on its website by a ‘trading partner’.

Offensive: The Advertising Standards Authority concluded that because children could see the advert on a general TV listings website, it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence

It said that ‘despite an automatic block on ads of an adult, provocative or suggestive nature’, the ad was put up on its website, but that it has taken steps to stop it happening again.

It said additional blocks had been put on ads on its website, adding that ‘an additional block on ‘dating’ ads’ had been put in place ‘to ensure another layer of protection was in place’.
