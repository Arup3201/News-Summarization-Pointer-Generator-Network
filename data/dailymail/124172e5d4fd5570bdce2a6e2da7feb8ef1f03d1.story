Thousands of people have descended on a frozen river in South Korea to take part in one of the country's most popular events - an annual ice fishing competition.

Anglers young and old drill holes in the ice, which is around 16inches (40cm) thick, and attempt to land as many trout as possible using rods, traditional lures or even their bare hands.

The Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival takes place every January on the Hwacheon river in Gangwon Province which is the first part of South Korea to freeze over due to its fresh water and cold winds.

Organisers expect more than a million people to have taken part by the end of the three-week long event.

To make sure there are plenty of fish, around 32 tons of fresh trout are added to the river every day.

Competitors can then cook up their catch at special centres around the site unless, like many, they prefer to eat it raw as sushi.

The festival, which closes on January 26, also features activities such as ice and snow sledding, snow sculpture and ice football.

It takes place just 12 miles from the demilitarised zone that separates South Korea from North Korea.
