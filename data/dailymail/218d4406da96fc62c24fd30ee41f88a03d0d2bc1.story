Touchscreens on smartphones are great most of the time, but sometimes fingers get in the way if you are trying to play a game or look at a detailed document.

But now inventors in Minneapolis have solved this problem by transforming the back and sides of a smartphone case into pressure-sensitive pads to enable the whole phone to react to touch.

The Sensus protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case, so they will get a clear view of the screen and effectively increase its area.

Inventors in Minneapolis have created the Sensus case (pictured) which promises to transform the back and sides of a smartphone case into pressure-sensitive pads to enable the whole phone to react to touch

The case made its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and claims to combine ‘the best of protections and functionality’ while still being relatively slim.

A version for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S is set to go on sale in summer for $99 (£60). No release date or price for the UK has been announced yet.

The Sensus protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case

It is designed to be used by gamers, 
social media butterflies and business people and could even make 
smartphones easier to use for some people with disabilities, according 
to Canopy, the company behind the case.

The case could be used to take selfies by squeezing its sides, or to play games using the back of the case to execute different manoeuvres.

It works by using two different types of sensors - capacitive and resistive - which are already used in most mobile device screens.

The capacitive sensor picks up upon electrical current in an individual's skin to indicate where a person’s finger is located, while the resistive sensor detects the level of pressure applied.

Together they make the case as sensitive as a phone’s screen.

When a person touches the sensors on the back and sides of the prototype case, the built-in processors in Sensus translate that data into information that interacts with compatible apps on the smartphone.

The start-up said the case ‘gives interaction with apps a whole new variable and dimension that developers and users alike have never experienced before’.

It will work with a number of apps – although only three are confirmed at the moment, - with an increasing number set to become compatible as the case becomes more widely adopted after its release.

The start-up claims it will not drain a phone’s battery quickly and will protect a phone from 'bumps, drops and scratches'.

A version of the case for the iPhone5 and iPhone 5S will be the first to go on sale, with a larger type for the iPad Mini following closely behind.

Owners of an iPhone 5C or iPod Touch will be the next to get the cases and the company said it might develop them for use with Android and Windows Mobile smartphones too.

An iPhone case called Yellow Jacket that comes with a 650K volt electrode, is capable of 'halting an aggressive adult male,' according to the firm that makes it.

The case is fitted with a safety catch to make sure the electrode doesn't accidentally activate in a pocket, for example. The electrode is also protected by a cover.

In addition to being used as a weapon, Yellow Jacket has its own battery and can charge a phone for up to twenty hours.

The case can keep up to 10 per cent of this power in reserve to make sure that the stun gun can be used in emergencies, even if the phone's battery is dead.

The Yellow Jacket case is sold in the U.S., where it is legal in 42 of the 50 states. Stun guns can only be bought by over 18s without a felony record and must also only be bought for self defence.

Stun guns are illegal in the UK and considered to be firearms, which can carry up to a five-year jail sentence. Yellow Jacket does not offer international shipping.

To discharge the stun gun, users need to pull the top corner of the case back and push the safety switch up.  To fire the gun, users must press and hold the blue button.

Once the electrode is no longer needed, users must pull down the safety button and replace the corner of the case so the device isn't accidentally activated in their pocket.

The original iPhone 4S case went on sale in the U.S. last year, and the firm recently unveiled a redesigned iPhone 5 and 5S model at CES.
