With her long blonde hair, glowing skin and elegant sense of style, Beverley, from Kent, looks far younger than her 64 years.

But there's more to the Kent grandmother than meets the eye. Although she looks like any other retiree, Beverley, or Bev as she likes to be called, is a working escort.

One of a growing number of pensionable prostitutes, Bev is part of a select group of elderly sex workers that counts the likes of Amsterdam's Fokkens sisters and Katie Waissel's grandmother, Sheila Vogel, among their number.

Glamorous: 64-year-old grandmother Beverley still works as an escort, which, she says, pays her bills

Bev's career in prostitution began more than 30 years ago when her husband, a compulsive gambler, played one round too many and left Bev and her children destitute.

Although financially stable now, Bev says she will continue to work as an escort for as long as she has bills to pay but adds that she would give it up if she could.

'I started out because my husband was a 
gambler and we lost everything,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'Then I saw an advert in the paper for
 escorts so I went for an interview and they told me to start right 
away.

'I thought it was just going to be dinners and things but I got 
into the car and this man enlightened me on what was actually going to 
happen.'

Bev, who says she has never worked as a street prostitute, says the career did take some getting used to but says there are some benefits.

'It does take some getting used to,' she reveals.' Essentially you are using your body and it is a bit like selling a piece of 
meat.

'It's just a job like working in a post 
office. It's a bit like social services in the way that you have to analyse 
people.'

According to Bev, who appears on Channel 4 documentary, My Granny The Escort, analytical skills prove particularly useful when deciding which men to take on as clients.

'I have had some really lovely clients 
and most of them are single, although there are a few that are married,' she explains.

'I have 
never suffered any violence - I won't have it. You just have to look 
at the client and watch out for drink and drugs, you just have to be 
aware.'

Making sure you're aware of what's going on is something she regularly says to younger escorts, many of whom she takes under her wing.

Still working: Katie Waissel's granny, Sheila Vogel, continues to work as an escort despite being 85 years old

'I tell them to just be careful 
because you are very vulnerable,' she reveals. 'There are lots of things I won't do 
that these younger girls will, I won't put myself or my family in those 
situations. I always do things my way.'

Bev's clients, many of whom are in their 20s, also prefer a gentler approach with few asking for anything extreme.

'I
 asked a guy the other day why he wanted to see an older woman and he 
said it was all to do with the fantasy,' she explains.

'They say they like an older lady
 because she knows what she's doing and they know that they are in safe 
hands and won't grab hold of them too hard. They don't want me to be 
naughty.'

Perhaps that's why, for now at least, Bev says she's happy to carry on with her escort work. 'I still enjoy my job,' she reveals.

'I
 enjoy meeting people. Everyone always says that the sex must be the 
best part but not everyone has sex because they don't want to commit 
adultery. I would say that around one in five clients have sex.

'Everyone has bills
 to pay so that's why I still do it but I do enjoy it.' She adds, smiling broadly: 'I could go back 
to lorry driving, I did do that for a while.'
