Arsene Wenger has revealed Arsenal duo Francis Coquelin and Chuba Akpom have signed new four-and-a-half-year deals.

Coquelin has been in impressive form since being recalled from his loan spell at Championship outfit Charlton in December, while Akpom has made four first-team appearances since the start of the year.

Both Akpom and Coquelin were set to become free agents in the summer, however Wenger has tied both Coquelin and Akpom down to new long-term contracts.

Gunners youngster Chuba Akpom has also put pen to paper on a new four-and-a-half year contract 

Wenger, speaking before Arsenal's Barclays Premier League derby match against Tottenham, said: 'I am very happy because for me the target during this transfer window was on two fronts.

'The first was to get a defender in and we did that. The second is as well to extend the contracts of Coquelin and Akpom.

'That's what I did as well so we are very happy with what we did.'

Coquelin recently said he was surprised by his 'sudden' move back to the Emirates Stadium.

Speaking to Arsenal Player, Coquelin said: 'It’s weird because the way it happened was so sudden, so I didn’t expect it.

'I trained with the team all week and on Monday I was going to see the Charlton manager with a few other people about a change of formation.

'I felt a little bit bad about Charlton because we had trained all week, were ready for the game and it was so sudden.'
