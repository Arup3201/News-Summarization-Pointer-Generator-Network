An angry University of Queensland student has written a hilarious petition after she was snubbed for a meeting with US President Barack Obama.

Ashley Chandler posted a lengthy letter to the university, which hosted a speech by Obama on Saturday, on Change.org.

She called their decision not to invite her to the talk ‘a scandal that would rank somewhere between Watergate and the 2011 Greenfield incident’.

The 21-year-old explained to Daily Mail Australia that while her letter was a work of satire she is genuinely angry about how UQ allocated the tickets to students.

‘The letter that I wrote is satire but it is being ridiculous as it points out how ridiculous their conduct has been,’ she said.

The fifth year law and political science student wrote: ‘I am, naturally, upset/outraged/hurt/offended/aggrieved by UQ’s decision not to invite me.’

Listing the reasons she believes she should have been invited, Ms Chandler said: 'I hold a leadership position in the university, I am a scholarship student, I have represented UQ internationally, was once on Millionaire Hot Seat, have seen all seven seasons of the West Wing, and hell, I even went to College.'

Ms Chandler said she was not the only student who was disappointed not to receive an invite.

'There are many, many students who have contributed much to the UQ community who should have been offered the opportunity to attend, some even more deserving than me (maybe),' she wrote.

Ms Chandler hinted that she thought the university didn't invite her because she is a woman. 

And added: 'Perhaps the worst thing about this entire process is that it seems to fly in the face of everything Barack Obama stands for. He was the one who told us all that "Yes, we can", but, literally, we can’t.'

She highlighted that the other two Brisbane universities that handed out invites – Griffiths Uni and QUT – had a much better system than QU.

‘400 tickets were given to one small portion of the student body… some of whom aren’t even interested in politics and are just going for the hype of it,’ Ms Chandler said.

She argued that there was a lack of transparency in the way the tickets were handed out.

‘There was a message from vice chancellor; he said tight timeframes meant the tickets were given away to students that live on campus.

Hundreds of students from Brisbane's three main unis were invited to the speech

‘But I don’t think that really stacks up when students from other unis came to the speech,’ she reasoned.

After watching Obama’s speech from her living room she said: ‘I thought it was OK but he was telling people what they wanted to hear. To be honest it wasn’t groundbreaking.’

Ms Chandler said students are in the middle of their final block of exams and have not been told if they can even access the library this weekend while Obama is in town.

One student told her he was turned away by security when he tried to hand in his work and told ‘sorry it’s going to have to be handed in late’.

Ms Chandler reasoned she was once on Millionaire Hot Seat

She wrote on her Facebook page: 'I have written this open letter to UQ to express my concern over their handling of the Obamagate affair'
