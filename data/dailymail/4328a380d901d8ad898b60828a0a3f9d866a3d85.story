From making babies to being struck by lightning, a new map has revealed the surprising things that countries are best at.

The map is based on statistics gathered from across the internet - ranging from sources as diverse as the World Bank to the Guinness World Records.

Created by online comic and website DogHouse Diaries, the map shows what each country leads the rest of the world in and the words picked - which are written across the country's geographical territory - are in many cases surprising.

While Peru might make evoke images of Inca monuments and panpipes, according to the map, the country leads the world in sandboarding, a sport that involves surfing mounds of sand.

Other surprising world leaders include Spain and its cocaine use as well as Algeria who leads the way in middle Paeleolithic flake tool techniques.

However, some statistics confirmed stereotypes such as New Zealand being the best at sheep farming and rugby.

The map, created by three friends based in Washington DC, also shows the Netherlands has the tallest people on average, Canada leads the way in the production of maple syrup and the U.S. eats the most hotdogs.

People in Chile are best at staying married, while those in Chad are the most efficient at not wasting electricity, according to the map.

It also shows that Costa Rica leads the way in happiness, while people living in Ireland have the best quality of life.

More sinister findings reveal that Turkmenistan is a world leader in corruption and the UK leads the world in fascist movements.

The makers of the map came to their conclusion about the UK by looking at the number of distinct fascist groups that have existed over the years, with 34 groups having existed in the UK according to their source, although the vast majority have dissolved.

In terms of natural disasters, Mexico also has the most people who have been struck by lightning, while Canada has endured the most asteroid impacts and Cameroon has the deadliest lakes in the world.
