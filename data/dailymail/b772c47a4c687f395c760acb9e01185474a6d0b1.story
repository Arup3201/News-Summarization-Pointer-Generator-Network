Always expect the unexpected with Australian prodigy Nick Kyrgios as just when his fourth-round clash against Andreas Seppi at his home Grand Slam hit an incredible climax, the teenager caught spectators leaving.

The intense last-16 match saw Kyrgios comeback from two sets down and save a match point before booking a quarter-final spot against Andy Murray on Tuesday.

The Hisense Arena was packed to the rafters to witness their new national hero, appropriately on Australia Day, but the 19-year-old failed to entertain three fans with his exploits, who attempted to leave the stands at 2-0 in the final set.

Nick Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to advance to the last eight with a 5-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(7-5), 8-6 win

And in the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed.

With the roaring crowd yelling out 'boo' at the three fans, they immediately seated themselves back down as they giggled and appeared humiliated.

Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian, who had upset Swiss superstar Roger Federer in the third round.

Last Australian standing at the tennis tournament and the first to reach the quarter-finals since a decade ago by Lleyton Hewitt.

Making his way into the history books, Kyrgios battled his own demons to progress into a last-eight showdown to become the youngest player in the men's quarter-finals since Andrei Cherkasov in 1990.

Contesting just his seventh grand slam event, the Canberra excitement machine is also the first teen to make the last eight of two majors since the great Federer.

'It feels so good,' Kyrgios said after the match. 'The crowd was unbelievable. 

'I honestly didn't think I was going to come back and win that match. I was just going to hang in - this is incredible.

'This is my favourite court I've ever played on.'

When asked about his little flirtatious moment on Twitter with Victoria Azarenka from Friday night, cheeky Kyrgios laughed and said: 'No comment'.

Kyrgios' dad made an appearance after the match, saying how proud he was of his son.

'Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I just want to thank all the crowd - it's just unbelievable. They just got him over the line - kept him motivated,' Mr Kyrgios said.

'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more.

When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again.

'You got one more point to play I'd say. Just give it the best shot and it seems to be working for him so unbelievable.'

The pressure got to the 19-year-old as his smashes his racquet onto the court during Sunday's match

His mobility restricted and explosive power diminished, Kyrgios obliterated a racquet at one point, such was his frustration at being unable to compete at full capacity early on.

Seppi won the opening set after breaking Kyrgios to love in the 11th game.

Kyrgios grew more and more frustrated as he squandered multiple break points in the fourth game of the second set, almost apologetically telling spectators: 'I'm trying man. I can't walk, though.'

After fending off a break point in the fifth game, Kyrgios couldn't hold the Italian out again and found himself in a deep, deep hole after dropping serve for a second time in the ninth game - and then the second set.

But Kyrgios began to mount his stirring fightback as his back appeared to free up in the third set, which the Australian claimed after breaking Seppi for the first time.

Games in the fourth set went to serve before Seppi earned his match point in a tension-filled tiebreaker.

Showing ice-cool nerves, Kyrgios thundered down a 201km/h ace to keep his Open hopes alive.

Kyrgios then unleashed a withering backhand winner down the line on his first set point to force the decider.

Australia's last hope followed up with a vicious down-the-line forehand winner to break Seppi again to seemingly have the veteran on the ropes.

But he inexplicably dropped serve to love in an alarming run of 12 straight points to Seppi, who drew level at 4-4 and then had a break point to give himself the opportunity to serve out the match.

Kyrgios again crunched an ace under untold pressure.

Kyrgios completed his second win from two sets down - after famously staving off nine match points against Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon last year - after three hours and 34 minutes when Seppi wilted and dropped serve to love in the 14th game of the epic final set.

Despite Seppi being ranked only five places above him, Kyrgios's victory ranks as one of the finest of his burgeoning career.

A one-time world No.18, Seppi sent Federer packing from the Open on Friday and also eliminated Lleyton Hewitt last year.

Kyrgios had beaten Italy's now-world No.46 in straight sets in their only previous encounter, at the US Open in September last year.

His victory over Seppi in New York, though, proved to be his last ATP success of 2014, with Kyrgios calling a premature end to his maiden pro season in October, citing fatigue.

Kyrgios's aching back then forced his withdrawal from this month's Hopman Cup before he lost a tight season opener in Sydney to Jerzy Janowicz.

Incredibly, after arriving at Melbourne Park without a tour win in four months, Kyrgios is now three wins away from hoisting the trophy.
