Canadian-Australian author and model, Tara Moss, has opened up about being raped 20 years ago to highlight violence against women.

The 41-year-old sat down with Tracy Grimshaw on Wednesday night's A Current Affair, a year after she first discussed the issue in her book, to speak candidly about the sexual assault in Vancouver by 'a friend' who she felt like she 'trusted'.

'About 20 years ago, I was sexually assaulted by a person giving me a ride home from an acting class,' Moss starts off.

Canadian-Australian author and model, Tara Moss, opened up to A Current Affair's Tracy Grimshaw on Wednesday night about being raped 20 years ago to highlight violence against women

On the Channel 9 show she spoke candidly about the sexual assault in Vancouver by 'a friend' who she felt like she 'trusted'

'It's a person that I trusted, in so much as they were a new friend, in amongst other new friends in this class.

'When I did go forward to the police, I didn't feel I got the support I would have liked, I think that  is a fairly common situation for many people.

'As time went on it became clear that there were other charges that had been put forward in the past and another several women came forward, in fact, there were about a dozen in total,' she explained.

Moss, who was just 21 at the time of the attack, said he drove her to his house and invited her in for a cup of tea. He then threw himself on her and would not take no for an answer.

'This sort of trauma is a complex trauma and the impact it had on me was massive,' she opened up.

The man was jailed for two years, but not for the assault on Moss. He was found guilty of rape against another woman when one of his friends testified against him. 

'I think it's very telling that the case he was convicted on, he was convicted on because one of his mates was happy to testify against him,' she said.

'We needed the testimony of a man to put this man away.'

At the time she said didn't feel like she was supported by police

Opening up: Moss decided to come forward once more with her personal experience to help highlight the issue of domestic violence, which takes the lives of one Australian woman ever week

Moss decided to come forward once more with her personal experience to help highlight the issue of domestic violence, which takes the lives of one Australian woman ever week.

'This kills more women than cancer,' she said.

Moss, who is a patron of the Full Stop Foundation that offers support services and criminal justice responses to victims, is calling for more help for women who are brave enough to come forward.

'We need to actually listen and take it seriously all the way through the process from that first interaction, when we hear about it through to the courts and the sentencing.

'We need to take this stuff seriously and sadly, that is not always the case.

'Unfortunately, the message that that sends is that this sort of violence is OK.'

Moss first broke her 20-year silence in her first non-fiction book, The Fictional Woman, which was published last year. She lives in the Blue Mountains with her Australian poet husband Berndt Sellheim and their three-year-old daughter Sapphira.
