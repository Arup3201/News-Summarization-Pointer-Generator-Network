A woman who was last year told she had only a week to live has just celebrated her first wedding anniversary.

Kelly Bainbridge-Flor, 28, from Silksworth, Sunderland, had been so sick with brain cancer that doctors feared she would never be able to celebrate the milestone with her husband Dino.

After doctors last August told her she had only days left the couple brought forward their wedding amid fears they may never be able to tie the knot.

Happy couple: Kelly Bainbridge-Flor and her husband Dino Flor, who have just celebrated their first anniversary despite doctors telling Kelly a year ago she had just a week to live

They were married at St Benedict's Hospice in Monkwearmouth on August 18, 2011.

Miraculously, Mrs Bainbridge-Flor's health then improved
allowing the couple to enjoy a second ceremony the following week at St
Paul's church, Ryhope.

She said: 'It has been a really, really tough year for both of us, but we're looking forward to celebrating our anniversary.

'We're so grateful for the time we've had together - time we never thought we'd have.'

Mr Flor, 31, who is originally from Portugal, said: 'We are making the most of every second we have together.

'We know every moment is precious.

'Some people thought having to return 
to the hospice after the church wedding must have felt depressing, but 
they couldn't be more wrong.

'It is a place of warmth, comfort and support. The staff and volunteers are amazing.'

Tying the knot: The couple at their second wedding day at St Paul's Church in Ryhope, Tyne and Wear

Mrs Bainbridge-Flor was diagnosed with
breast cancer to years ago. After being treated with a course of 
chemotherapy, she moved to Madeira, Portugal, where she met Mr Flor, a 
hospital technician.

As their relationship blossomed, she returned to the UK to have a double mastectomy to prevent the cancer returning.

Although she was then given the 
all-clear, Mrs Bainbridge-Flor soon began suffering excruciating 
headaches. A scan revealed that her cancer had spread to her brain.

Portuguese medics advised Mrs 
Bainbridge-Flor, a manager in a call centre, to return to the UK for 
treatment, but warned her that travelling on a normal plane could kill 
her because of the pressure.

Thanks to the generosity of her 
employer, she was able to travel home on a private low-flying jet for 
treatment at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

Four days after being given a week to 
live, Kelly and Dino had their dream wedding, followed by a reception at
the Roker Hotel in Sunderland.

According to one of Mrs 
Bainbridge-Flor's dying wishes, the newlyweds spent their honeymoon at a
luxury hotel, after arriving in style in a vintage wedding car.

'We often go away together for short breaks, but it is difficult sometimes,' said Mr Flor.

'We've managed to tick quite a few 
things off Kelly's list, but one of her last wishes is to travel to 
Portugal to have a blessing in a church with my family.

'We know it is almost impossible 
because she isn't allowed to fly, but we're hoping we'll somehow be able
to manage it. It's her dream.'

Staff and volunteers at St Benedict's paid tribute to the couple.

Sylvia Stoneham, a fundraiser for the 
hospice, said: 'I became quite close to Kelly and Dino whileÂ  they were 
in St Benedict's Hospice last year and was able to secure a night away 
in a local hotel for them for a belated honeymoon.

'Staff and volunteers at the hospice 
wish them all the best as Kelly and Dino celebrate a milestone they 
thought they'd never achieve.

'I'm also thrilled to confirm the charity is funding another overnight stay in their honeymoon hotel.

'We're so pleased they've made it this far and that we're still able to support them.'
