A tiny wooden hut where one of Britain's best-loved nature authors penned some of his greatest works is today up for sale - after lying untouched for nearly 40 years.

Henry William Williamson built the remote moorland cabin in 1929 with the profits from his most famous book, Tarka the Otter.

Williamson, a naturalist, farmer and prolific writer, spent up to 15 hours a day inside the one-room hideaway working on his acclaimed natural history and social history novels.

For sale: This tiny wooden hut, where one of Britain's best-loved nature authors penned some of his greatest works is today up for sale - after lying untouched for nearly 40 years

Immaculate: Henry William Williamson,a naturalist, farmer and prolific writer, spent up to 15 hours a day inside the one-room hideaway working on his acclaimed natural history and social history novels. The hut has been left almost exactly as Williamson left it around four decades ago

Auction: The Henry Williamson Trust, which is administered by direct descendants of Williamson, has run and maintained the hut since the author's death. They have now decided to put the hut up for auction and the sale is set to take place on May 23

Since his death in 1977 it has been left virtually untouched with books, clothes, reading glasses and a gramophone record all remaining just as the reclusive wordsmith left them.

The remote hut is close to the pretty village of Georgeham near Woolacombe in North Devon and is made from oak and elm with slate roof tiles with a brick fireplace.

The Henry Williamson Trust, which is administered by direct descendants of Williamson, has run and maintained the hut since the author’s death.

Acclaimed: Henry William Williamson passed away in 1977. He won the Hawthornden Prize for literature in 1928 for his novel Tarka The Otter

However the trust has now decided to auction off the hut and land, as well as a substantial detached 1950’s studio nearby, on May 23.

Colin Thorne, of Webbers Property Services, said: 'I have done this job for 30 years, and I have never ever had this sort of experience where you feel so connected to such a well-known person.

'It’s like he just popped out for a walk and would be back any minute. It’s a complete and utter privilege to be a part of it.'

In 1999, a former cottage owned by Mr Williamson sold for £98,000 - despite being valued at around £60,000.

However, Mr Thorne, who conducted the
 previous sale, said it would be impossible to predict how much the 
writing hut would sell for.

He said: 'I have no idea what it’s going to go for. How do you put a value on a place like this?

'If someone wants to by a piece of history, they may pay a lot more than someone who wants their own piece of North Devon.

'It would be wonderful if the next stage of its life is in some way related to its former use. It’s too special to be let go.

'I just want to see it go to somebody who loves it for what it is.'

Henry Williamson won the Hawthornden 
Prize for literature in 1928 for Tarka the Otter, which describes the 
life of an otter and details its lush habitat along the River Taw and 
River Torridge in Devon.

The name 'Tarka' was said by Williamson to mean 'wandering as water'.

It
 is often described as a children’s book but Tarka the Otter influenced 
literary figures including Ted Hughes and Rachel Carson and has never 
been out of print since its first publication.

Historic: Colin Thorne, of Webbers Property Services, said: 'I have done this job for 30 years, and I have never ever had this sort of experience where you feel so connected to such a well-known person. It's like he just popped out for a walk and would be back any minute. It's a complete and utter privilege to be a part of it'

A labour of love: The remote moorland cabin was built by Williamson in 1929 in a village in North Devon, with the profits from his most famous book, Tarka The Otter

Award-wining: The novel traces the life of Tarka an otter, living on the River Torridge

Tarka the Otter was written by Henry William Williamson and was first published in 1927.

A year later the novel won the Hawthornden Prize for literature.

The book, which remains Williamson's best-known and most popular work, has never been out of print since first publication.

It tells the tale of an otter, Tarka, and his life on the River Torridge. 

Divided into two parts - The First Year and The Last Year - the novel follows Tarka learning to swim and hunt, deal with losing a sibling in a trap and surviving after he is separated from his mother. 

In his second year Tarka fathers a litter of cubs with his mate White-tip.

Throughout the novel Tarka is pitched against his main enemy, another local otter Deadlock.

The book ends with a climatic nine-hour hunt of Tarka by the pack, and a confrontation between Tarka and Deadlock.

Williamson was born in London and moved to Georgeham in Devon in 1921.

He began making notes for Tarka the Otter two years later, while the book took four years to complete.

The author often claimed he was inspired to write the novel after rescuing and raising an otter cub, but the truth of the story remains shrouded in mystery.

The original edition feature illustrations by Charles Tinnicliffe.

While popular with children, the novel was not intended for a young audience. 

The novel was adapted into a film, which was released in 1979 - two years after Williamson passed away. One of his sons, Richard, and his daughter-in-law, star in the film.
