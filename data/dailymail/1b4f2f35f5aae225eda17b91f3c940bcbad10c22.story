A Texas man is hoping the make the dreams of many Americans come true by offering a lifetime supply of beer - but there's a catch.

Cary Hodson, of Garland, Texas, is hoping to open a storefront for his new brewing company, Intrinsic Brewing, and is raising money to make this happen on an ale-centric crowdfunding site, Crowd Brewed.

And one of the perks for anyone who donates $2,000 is a lifetime supply of beer.

Making it happen: Hodson has a dream of turning this abandoned storefront (above) into his brewery

According to the site, that amount gets a person, '2 house beers a day for you or to share with a friend +  32oz growler + 25 free fills once we open + 2 Swag Packs + Handcrafted Bottle Opener.'

And, as Hodson points out, '2 beers a day for 4 days a week at $5 a pint = $2,080 at 1 year, $10,400 at 5 years, $62,400 at 30 years.'

Hodson is trying to raise $30,000 to make this happen, and currently has a little over $9,000.

There is no word what happens if his goal isn't met, or should his company ever go out of business.

One good sign is that Hodson has already successfully bottled one beer, a Basil Hefeweizen, as he looks to expand.

ABC 7 also points out that for those who don't want to throw that much money but ill still like to contribute to this young man's dreams, donations on the site start as low as $10.
