QPR striker Charlie Austin believes the experience new signing Rio Ferdinand has in his locker will be invaluable for the newly-promoted west Londoners this season.

The former Manchester United defender penned a one-year deal with Harry Redknapp's men yesterday, and in doing so became the club's first signing of the summer.

Austin heaped praise on the former England international when speaking at the club's training base in Harlington on Friday morning.

Happy: Austin is delighted Ferdinand has become QPR's first summer signing

He said: 'It's exciting to be playing with someone like Rio and learning from him. To work with someone like that will be great for me and for the team.

'His experience is second to none. He's won the Premier League and the Champions League and played for his country, so for him to come in with that experience is brilliant. From what I've heard he's great with the young lads too.

'It's exciting times at QPR. We are a club on the up, just been promoted and we feel like we can carry on what we created last season. There's no reason why we can't.'

The signing of Ferdinand comes after weeks of speculation linking the 35-year-old with a move to west London, and will be seen as quite the coup considering the vast amount of experience he has.

The move sees Ferdinand return to the club he first joined as a boy, with his younger brother Anton and cousin Les also having played for the Hoops.

Elsewhere, Redknapp remains hopeful of securing deals to take Cardiff captain Steven Caulker and Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson to Loftus Road.
