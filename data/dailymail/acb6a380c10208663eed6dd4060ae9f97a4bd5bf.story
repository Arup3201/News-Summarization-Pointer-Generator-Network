He is known as one of Britain's most hardened gangsters with a penchant for gangland violence and teeth-shattering boxing. 

But while locked in Wayland Prison in Norfolk, where he spent 31 years for the murder of a friend, Reggie Kray honed another talent.

During his time behind bars, the criminal completed sinister and erotic pencil drawings of naked women and eyeballs, the finished works only revealed for the first time recently.

Bizarre drawings completed by Reggie Kray in Wayland Prison in Norfolk in 1999 are due to be sold at auction. Among them is a depiction of the kung-fu actor Bruce Lee (above)

The images, all signed by Kray, are thought to have been completed a year before his release in 2000 

The drawings, which include a detailed portrait of kung-fu star Bruce Lee, have been revealed before going on sale at an auction in the Cotswolds. 

Kray is thought to have completed the drawings in 1999, a year before his release. He was allowed to leave the prison by the then Home Secretary Jack Straw due to deteriorating health. 

The following year he died at the age of 66. 

The drawings will be sold by Moore Allen & Innocent in Circenster, Gloucester, in two weeks. Each is stamped by prison authorities and signed by Kray.

Last week the auctioneers sold a boxing glove presented to the gangster by Rocky Marciano for £580. 

The collection of drawings is expected to fetch £100 and £150.

Kray was jailed for life in 1969 alongisde his brother, Ronald 'Ronnie' Kray, for the murder of their friend Jack 'the Hat' McVitie at a flat in Stoke Newington. 

Ronnie Kray died in prison in 1995. He was serving a life sentence for the murder of George Cornell when he suffered a heart attack. 

In 2000, Reggie, whose real name was Reginald, was released from prison on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with cancer. 

He took up a room in Beefeater Town House Hotel in Norwich after being discharged from the Norwich Hospital. 

On October 1, with his wife Roberta at his bedside, he died peacefully in his sleep. 

Considered the softer of the two twins, Reggie married twice in his life. His first wife, Frances Kray, died in 1967.

While some claimed the young bride killed herself, others suggested Reggie's twin, Ronnie, had a hand in her death.

The Krays were almost born to a life of crime. 

Their father, Charlie senior, was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was called up to join the Army, but deserted.

Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father.

It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition.

However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. 

When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. 

They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. 

Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot.

In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder.

Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept.

Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair.

Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear.

In the middle of 1968, the twins’ older brother Charlie was arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders.

Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. 

 Ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and Reggie died in 2000 aged 66.

The twins had an older brother, Charlie (centre), jailed alongside them in 1968. He was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of Jack McVitie
