Following on from singer Cher's damning statement about Miley Cyrus' VMA tongue-wagging antics, oral hygiene experts say it's evidence that she is stressed.

The pop legend, 67, told USA Today: 'Chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated.'

Now, Get The Gloss writer Emma Gunavardhana gets the lowdown on what the tongue can reveal about our overall health...

Miley Cyrus, pictured at the NY release party for her new album Bangerz 
on Tuesday, shows off her tongue

Some of Miley Cyrus' recent antics 
may have left you feeling like an amateur gynecologist – that VMA 
performance, those Terry Richardson pictures…

As
it happens such intimate access and some close inspection has given 
away something about her health, you just have to look two feet higher -
at her tongue.

We weren't 
the only ones to notice something was a little 'off' but perhaps Cher 
said it best: 'Chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated.'

Agreeing with Cher is Shabir Daya, 
co-founder of victoriahealth.com: 'Your tongue is a window into what's 
happening in your body; colour, coating and cracks are all indicators of
the state of your health.' 

Cara Delevingne has been at it too choosing a protruding tongue and rock sign as her pap-pose of choice.

They may think their tongue-poking gives nothing away but actually they couldn't reveal more.

At one point Miley 
licks a sledgehammer in the Terry Richardson inspired video for Wrecking Ball

Daya reveals: 'A healthy tongue has a thin, white and moist coating and any deviation from this indicates possible problem.'

Oral
B Smile Director Dr Uchenna Okoye agrees: 'A thin coating is normal but
a thick white coating could indicate candidiasis or oral thrush, which 
is a fungus.' 

Chinese 
medicine actually uses the tongue as a matter of course to diagnose the 
state of someone's health and given that the mouth harbours anywhere 
between 300-400 species of bacteria, it's vital to have a dental hygiene
routine that includes cleaning the tongue.

Maybe Miley wasn't making out with that sledgehammer in her Wrecking Ball video, but cleaning her tongue on its rough surface instead?

You may brush your teeth morning, noon and night but according to Daya that might not be enough.

'Small protrusions in the tongue can harbour food allowing bacteria and fungi to thrive and this results in a whitish tongue,' she says.

Essentially clean teeth can be almost immediately 'reinfected' by a dirty tongue. 

Miley was in the midst of her break-up with Liam Hemsworth when she took to the stage with Robin Thicke in August and interestingly the tongue is a sound stress indicator.

'Stress, particularly on-going stress, can cause deeper cracks in the tongue since stress releases inflammatory hormones,' says Daya.

The former child star loves to play up to her bad girl image, especially at her MTV VMAs appearance

Okoye recommends using a mouthwash twice a day and Daya suggests the Peri Gum Mouth Wash Concentrate, £17.95, which contains seven herbal extracts that'll naturally improve any gum and mouth disorders.

Alternatively there are more and more products available to help keep your oral health tip-top, including the Dr Oliver Mouth Cleanser, £16, available at Space NK that normalizes pH levels in the mouth.

While a slightly more old-fashioned but no less effective option is the OraBrush Tongue Cleaner, £5.10 available from Boots that you simply draw from back-to-front along your tongue to scrape off unwanted nasties - for tackling bad breath it's a winner.

We may know more about Miley than we'd care to but thanks to her tongue-poking she may have helped us know more about ourselves.
