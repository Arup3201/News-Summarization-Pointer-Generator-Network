A Minnesota man came forward Thursday to claim his share of a $448 million Powerball jackpot, one of the largest in history.

Paul White, father of two from Ham Lake, strode into a Minneapolis press conference, along with beaming girlfriend Kim VanRees, to receive a giant replica check made out for $149 million, the pre-tax amount he'll receive after the jackpot is split three ways.

The sum comes to $86million each, if taken in a lump sum.

One of the other winning tickets was revealed to have been purchased by 16 employees of Ocean County, New Jersey, who all chipped in money for a lottery pool.

The Asbury Park Press reports that members of the Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Department in Toms River bought their tickets at the local Acme supermarket.

None of the employees have yet come forward, but Freeholder Director John P. Kelly told the newspaper that he is happy that they won - even if he might have to hire an entire new crew of mechanics.

'We are thrilled. We consider county government a family,' he said.

'It’s good to see these hard-working, blue-collar employees win this money that’s really going to be a life-changer for them.'

Split 16 ways, the lump sum comes to about $5.4million per person after taxes.

Mr White, the divorced Minnesota father, has a chance to keep his portion of the winnings to himself.

Purchases in mind: White, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son said he plans to help out his parents and buy his son the car of his dreams

‘It's crazy,’ said the 45-year-old. ‘I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times. You almost feel like it’s coming true.’

The project engineer opted for a lump sum and will therefor take home $86 million after taxes.

The
divorced dad made no mention of his ex-wife, nor has the mother of his 
son and daughter come forward with her own feelings about her ex's win.

While
White's new partner VanRees appeared overjoyed, his boss Ron Bowen was 
also on hand and White joked he 'is going to end the day as my 
chauffeur.'

White told reporters he intends to pursue charitable endeavors, help out his parents, and buy his son the car of his dreams.

As
surprised as he was with the huge news he is a newly crowned 
millionaire, White said he always had a hunch he'd be a winner one day.

The father of two teens said he played the lottery around once a month or when the the jackpot was especially big, though he said he was always 'more of a scratch-off guy.'

He also said he nearly forgot to get tickets this week.

Lucky for him, he remembered and bought $10 worth.

White said he checked the 10 tickets he bought and realized he had nailed all six numbers on one of them. The ensuing hours, he said, had been a blur.

Lump sum: Before taxes, White's share of the $448 million jackpot is $149.9 million. He took a lump cash sum and will get $86 million before taxes, or $58.3 million after taxes

'It's just surreal at this point. I don't think you guys can understand — it's crazy. No worries anymore. It's crazy,' he said.

He specified that no longer worrying about paying to send his 16-year-old and 14-year-old children to college or for his family's medical needs.

He also said he intends to buy several cars: a 1963 Chevy Impala for his 80-year-old dad, a car for his newly licensed 16-year-old son, and a rare 1991 Acura sportscar for himself.

White said he worked for a Minneapolis electrical contractor that had worked on major projects around the area including the Twins' Target Field and the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank Stadium. He said he's help his company finish a few things up, but that after that his working days would be over.

'I think a lot of good things are going to come out of this for not only my family and friends but for random people,' he said. 'I don't want to work for anybody else for the rest of my life for a paycheck.'

Three winners: One of the two other tickets was sold at this Stop & Shop in South Brunswick, New Jersey. Winning numbers for one of the largest Powerball jackpots ever were: 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32

White said he intends to stay in his small Minnesota town, though.

'We’ll stay in that area, maybe just not in the same house,' he said.

The other two winning tickets were 
sold in New Jersey, including at a store in Little Egg Harbor, which is 
still recovering from the damage wrought by Superstorm Sandy, which made
landfall just a few miles away.

'Hopefully,
it's somebody who lives in the area, and this is their reward for 
having gone through this,' said Carol Blackford, a retiree whose home in
Little Egg Harbor was flooded with knee-high water during last 
October's storm. 'And if they want to share, we're here.'

But even if the winner wasn't someone devastated by the storm, the community will benefit from the jackpot.

Luxuriating: White and his partner Kim VanReese, of Ham Lake Minnesota, revel in the news of White's massive Powerball win. He opted for the lump cash sum and will take home $86 million before taxes

Phil Weber, director of the Acme 
Markets store where the winning ticket was sold, said Thursday that the 
store would donate $10,000 in gift cards to local charities. Weber said 
some of the store's employees are still out of their homes more than 
nine months after the storm. The store itself has been making donations 
since Sandy, Weber said.

The other tickets were sold in a Super Stop & Shop store in South Brunswick, N.J.

The winning numbers drawn Wednesday night were: 05, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball 32.

The odds of winning the jackpot were around one in 175 million.
