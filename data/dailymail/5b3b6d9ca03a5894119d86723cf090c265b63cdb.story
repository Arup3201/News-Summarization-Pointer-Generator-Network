A wonderful opportunity is opening up for Danny Welbeck over the next few weeks. At last, he can play where he has always wanted. 

It’s very unfortunate that Olivier Giroud is injured for Arsenal and Daniel Sturridge is out for England.

For Welbeck, though, these circumstances have presented him with the chance to establish his credentials. For both club and country, it is all finally coming together for the 23-year-old striker.

And now he really is a striker: a centre forward, not a wide player and his hat-trick against Galatasaray showed that he is absolutely making the most of the chance given to him.

He also did well down the centre for England against Switzerland last month by scoring twice and now he has two games coming up against San Marino and Estonia, when you would expect him to score more goals. By the time he comes back from international duty, his confidence should be sky-high.

There is a parallel to be drawn between Welbeck’s development and Sturridge, who also always craved the central position but was confined to wide roles at Manchester City and Chelsea. Only when Brendan Rodgers gave him his head in the centre at Liverpool did we really see how good he is.

Roy Hodgson must be as delighted as Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. Now the England manager has a growing number of attacking options. 

When Sturridge is back, maybe he will consider pairing him with Welbeck and playing Wayne Rooney behind them, as Rooney has been doing for Manchester United. With Raheem Sterling as well, England look strong going forward.

He could use it as an opportunity to usurp Daniel Sturridge for his country

It is probably right that Sturridge is not part of this international squad. If he wasn’t fit enough to be on the bench for Liverpool on Saturday, then he probably is not fit to play a significant part against San Marino and Estonia. 

Had he been on the bench in the 2-1 win over West Brom, I would have probably taken a different view. When it’s international week, the clubs have to abide by that.

But communication between the FA and clubs over injured players is much better than when I was England manager and brought in Gary Lewin, who is now a full-time physio with the national team. 

I understand medical staff went to Liverpool to discuss Sturridge’s fitness and he is a week or so away from returning.

Welbeck’s performance on Wednesday was very different from the past. Then, when he had time to linger on a chance, he seemed to struggle. 

An example that stands out was at Old Trafford against Bayern Munich last season when he tried to lift the ball over keeper Manuel Neuer at 0-0. It was a wonderful chance to take control of the tie and yet Neuer simply plucked the ball from the air. Even last month against Manchester City, he hit a good early chance wide.

But on Wednesday, he was clinical even when he had time to think. Part of that is clearly his confidence. He has a manager who believes in him and he is responding. But it’s also because he’s playing in better areas that are suited to his game.

I love the way he runs off the back of defenders and stretches teams with his pace. He couldn’t do that on the flanks. Wide players do so much work they are almost like full-backs and because he is so hard-working and disciplined, he covered miles in that shift. 

Arsenal's other senior striker Olivier Giroud remains absent for the foreseeable future

Welbeck was criticised at Manchester United for not being clinical enough in front of goal at times

The downside of such honesty is that he is not in the areas where he is most dangerous. Now he’s making darting runs in areas of the pitch that hurt the opposition.

But I also think that he is the right player in the right team, by which I mean he suits Arsenal’s style. They will create chances through the middle, they don’t go down the wings that often and send in crosses.

Though I like Giroud, he thrives more off crosses, while Welbeck seems more suited to their natural game. He appears to be a missing link for them and gives them another dimension. Now, if you’re playing Arsenal and you want to squeeze up the pitch, maybe to protect a lead, you certainly have to be careful because he can get in behind you with his pace.

Of course, Sunday’s match comes a real test against what looks to be the best defence in the Premier League.

Chelsea have the meanest and most solid back four. But if Welbeck can stretch Gary Cahill and John Terry and find some weaknesses, then he really will go into international week feeling he really is in the best form of his life.

Arsene Wenger was a hugely important manager in my career at Monaco but there is one thing that has puzzled me about his Arsenal teams in recent years.

At Monaco he was very clear about how we would play. We had two strong midfielders in Marcel Dib and Jean Philippe Rohr: solid players who were fierce in the tackle. They were good players but they also made sure our back four were protected.

When he went to Arsenal, he did exactly the same with Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, and then Gilberto Silva.

Which is why I’m scratching my head a little when I see the players Arsene selects in midfield these days. Last March, in that infamous 6-0 loss to Chelsea, he played Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. They’re all fine players but none of them is quite like those midfielders he used to favour.

When I played, the full-backs didn’t bomb on as much as they do now, so now there is even more reason to have a shield in front of your back four. There are different kinds of holding midfielders, those who can play the ball out and those who will scrap for you. Mikel Arteta is more of the former, and Mathieu Flamini more of the latter.

Maybe when Wenger brought Flamini back to the club last season, there was recognition that they he had got the balance wrong. Flamini will play today because Arteta is injured, and it will be fascinating to see whether he can make a difference to Arsenal’s vulnerability against Chelsea.

Cesc Fabregas will be the centre of attention on Sunday against his former club. He has been outstanding since he came back but there is another player who has been just as good and is not as lauded. That’s Nemanja Matic. 

He brings balance and solidity to Chelsea and their improvement is as much to do with his arrival in January as the more celebrated signings, such as Fabregas and Diego Costa.

When you talk about a midfielder in the mould of Vieira and Petit, then Matic is your man. He has that same rangy ability to tackle, the height to give you some presence and an ability to pass well. 

Perhaps Arsene Wenger will feel a little wistful watching him at Stamford Bridge.
