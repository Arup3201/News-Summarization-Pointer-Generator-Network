Spurs midfielder Erik Lamela celebrated scoring his third goal in as many games by meeting up with a former team-mate in a posh London suburb.

Lamela bagged Tottenham's first goal in the 2-0 win over Brighton on Wednesday night, before spending Thursday evening with Sandro in Richmond.

The Argentine star posted a picture with his Brazilian former team-mate to his Instagram account, and added the message 'Nice to see you again'.

Sandro left White Hart Lane to join QPR on transfer deadline day after four years with Tottenham, the last of those alongside Lamela.

While Lamela didn't say how the pair spent their evening together in South West London, Richmond is well-known as one of London's most affluent suburbs.

The South American pair could have used their time away from the pitch to enjoy one of the town's two theatres, many pubs and restaurants, or even taken the short trip to Richmond Park, famous for being the second largest park in the capital, and home to hundreds of deer.
