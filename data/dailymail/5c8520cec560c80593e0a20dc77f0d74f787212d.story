Controversial: The Countess of Wessex has accepted two lavish sets of jewels from one of the Arab region's most bloody regimes, it has emerged

The Countess of Wessex has accepted two lavish sets of jewels from one of the Arab region’s most bloody regimes.

Sophie, wife of Prince Edward, was handed the fabulous ‘suites’ of gems in December by the Bahraini royal family.

The jewels, revealed in a list of royal gifts obtained yesterday by the Daily Mail, provoked furious criticism.

Former Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane said: ‘Given the appalling suffering and repression of the Bahraini people, it would be a fitting gesture for the Countess of Wessex to auction these trinkets and distribute the proceeds to the victims of the regime.’

Bahrain’s rulers have been accused of using brute force and torture to crush  last year’s pro-democracy protests which resulted in the death of more than 40 campaigners.

The gifts to Sophie, handed over during an official pre-Christmas visit she made to the Arab kingdom on behalf of the Queen, throws an uncomfortable spotlight on the Royal Family’s close links with many hard-line rulers in the Middle East.

The Crown Prince of Bahrain has been seen with the Queen in the Royal Box at Ascot and has hosted visits from both Prince Charles and Prince Andrew.

He was invited to last year’s royal wedding but, after a public outcry, declined to attend to spare Kate and William embarrassment.

Buckingham Palace refused to reveal any details of the jewels, apart from confirming their existence.

But a suite of matching jewellery includes three or more pieces – usually a necklace, bracelet and earrings and then, possibly, a belt or a brooch.

It is not known how much the 
countess’s gems are worth but when the Duchess of Cornwall was given 
three suites – or parures – of jewellery by the Saudi royal family in 
2007 they were estimated to be worth more than £2million.

Sophie, 46, spent a day in Bahrain with her husband following a morale-boosting visit to British troops in Afghanistan four days before Christmas.

One set of jewels came from the king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the other from the prime minister, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, who also happens to be the king’s uncle – and the only prime minister the country has ever had.

And the generosity of the Bahraini ruling family did not end there.

For mother-of-two Sophie, who suffered public humiliation at the hands of the News of the World’s so-called ‘fake sheik’ when she boasted of her royal connections while running her own PR business – also received an exquisite silver and pearl cup from the country’s crown prince.

He also gave her husband, the Earl of Wessex, a silk rug during an extravagant banquet at the King’s palace on December 21.

Edward also accepted what are described as ‘a pen and a watch’ from the king.

The uprising in Bahrain began in February last year, as part of the wider Arab Spring revolt.

It
was suppressed with brutality by the country’s Sunni Muslim rulers 
after protests from the Shia majority for greater political freedom and 
equal treatment.

More than 50 people have been killed and almost 3,000 detained and tortured, many of them ordinary civilians.

Ann Clwyd, a member of the Commons 
foreign affairs select committee, said: ‘The way the Bahraini government
has been arresting, imprisoning and torturing protesters is to be 
condemned, and people need to be very careful of their links with the 
Bahraini royal family.’ 

Labour
MP Paul Flynn said: ‘It is difficult to imagine what the justification 
can be for something like this, and it looks like Bahrain is trying to 
buy favours from us.’

The fundamental principle governing the acceptance of gifts by members of the Royal Family is that none should be accepted which would, or might appear to, place them ‘under any obligation to the donor’.

Buckingham Palace guidelines state: ‘Before accepting any gift, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gift and the nature of the gift itself.’

Campaigners have called on the Duchess of Cambridge to put pressure on one of her favourite High Street stores to improve the lives of its workers.

Zara has been hit by a string of ‘slave labour’ scandals, and last month two workers died at a Bangladeshi factory which supplies the Spanish chain.

Kate is regularly seen shopping at Zara and has worn two of the firm’s outfits on high profile public occasions since becoming a member of the royal family.

The first was a cornflower blue dress worn the day after her wedding, and the second a black and nude lace dress she sported at a charity concert last month. 

Both sold out in hours, and the publicity was a huge coup for the firm. But it has been heavily criticised over standards in the factories used to produce its clothes. 

This week hundreds of workers took to the streets of Dhaka, in Bangladesh, demanding compensation for the families of victims of a blaze at the Eurotex factory in December.

A spokesman for charity War on Want said Kate should ‘call on the British Government to enact legislation to protect overseas workers for UK retailers’.

Zara was yesterday unavailable for comment, as it was a public holiday in Spain. In the past, it has said poor conditions had occurred in factories where work was outsourced.
