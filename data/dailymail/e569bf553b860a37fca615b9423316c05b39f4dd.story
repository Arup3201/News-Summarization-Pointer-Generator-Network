Diego Simeone has long been lauded for his motivational skills in charge of Atletico Madrid - and whatever he said to his charges at half time against Malmo certainly did the trick as they ran out 5-0 winners with five second-half goals.

Atletico were sluggish in the first half at the Calderon but eventually ran out big winners to put them in a great position to qualify from Group A at the half-way stage.

Koke, Mario Mandzukic, Antoine Griezmann, Diego Godin and Alessio Cerci all scored after the break to give them six points from their first two games.

But the first half was a different story, with dead ball opportunities uncharacteristically wasted and Griezmann hitting the bar when clean through. Simeone looking frustrated on the touchline.

The second period was a different story though, and Koke unlocked the Swedish side's defence to break the deadlock within three minutes of the restart after latching onto Arda Turan's cross.

Summer signings Mandzukic and Griezmann scored a quick-fire double after the hour mark.

First Mandzukic turned in a cross with a poacher's finish, then Griezmann was perhaps a little lucky to see his shot take a touch off the keeper before dropping just under the crossbar and into the back of the net

And captain Godin added the fourth when he headed home a corner with three minutes left.

Cerci made it five in injury time, knocking home his own rebound from a curling effort to add even more gloss to the result.

That result leaves Atletico on six points in the group, although they sit behind Olympiakos on their head-to-head record despite a five-goal superior goal difference, with the Greeks still to travel to Madrid.

Juventus and Malmo sit three points behind that pair in what is one of the tightest groups in the Champions League at the half-way stage.Â 

Atletico face Getafe in La Liga on Sunday - a game that should pose a good opportunity to gain ground on their main title rivals with Real Madrid and Barcelona meeting in El Classico.
