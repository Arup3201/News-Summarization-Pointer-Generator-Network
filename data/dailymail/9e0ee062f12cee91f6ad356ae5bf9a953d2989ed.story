Some people may have dismissed it as pillow talk, but an Ohio furniture and bed company that said it would wipe customer debts if Ohio State won the college championship is making good on its promise.

Morris Furniture Company, based in Dayton, declared that if the Buckeyes beat Alabama in the College Football playoff and then won the national championship by at least seven points, anyone who bought $1,999-worth or more of furniture between December 17 and January 1 would get a refund.

The firm, which ran the promotion at its 15 Ashley Furniture HomeStore and Better Sleep Shops in Ohio and northern Kentucky, might have thought its money was safe, as Alabama was the No1 seed.

On January 1 the Buckeyes claimed victory - but they were then left facing the favorites, Oregon.

On Monday, however, the team and its fans, along with the 500 people eligible for the promotion, celebrated as the Oregon Ducks slumped to a 42-20 defeat at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Morris Furniture won't have to pay up directly, though.

Rob Klaben, vice president of marketing and advertising at Morris Furniture, told ABC News: 'We did work with a third-party company that underwrote the promotion. So we're excited to see a win.'

He added: 'It's not inexpensive to have this kind of promotion.'

Customers can choose between having their debt for the furniture they bought wiped – or the product refunded - or claim a store card loaded with 110 per cent of the total.

Mr Klaben revealed that the promotion gave them a huge boost in the normally sluggish sales period in the week before Christmas.

He added: 'It created some great conversation points in our stores.'

Last year a chain of furniture stores in Texas promised customers who spent at least $6,000 in the two-week period before the superbowl game between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks would get a refund if Seattle won.

Seattle didn't just win, the Seahawks embarrassed the Broncos in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history.

And in a similar promotion, a car dealership in Missouri lost more than $300,000 in last year's Super Bowl. 

As part of a promotion, the Hutcheson Ford dealership in St. James, Missouri, offered potential customers the deal of a lifetime in its 'Super Weekend Sale': If a player returns an opening kickoff for a touchdown in the first or second half of the Super Bowl, anyone who bought a vehicle between January 29 and February 1 would receive a refund of the purchase price of the vehicle.

Unfortunately for the dealership, 12 people bought vehicles between the 29th and the 1st - and one returned the opening kick-off of the second half 87 yards for a touchdown.

'We're like "Oh, my gosh," there's this five percent chance of this happening, and it just blew up in our faces,' Kathleen Frazier, marketing manager for the dealership, told ABC17News at the time.
