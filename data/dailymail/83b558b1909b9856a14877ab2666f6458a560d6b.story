British warships headed to the Mediterranean yesterday, as David Cameron prepared to sue Spain over its treatment of Gibraltar.

The Prime Minister has ordered government lawyers and Foreign Office officials to draw up plans for legal action.

He has finally lost patience with the Spanish after they continued to impose what he sees as illegal border checks, which break European Union rules on the free movement of people.

Taking the case to the European Court of Justice would mark the first time Britain has taken a fellow EU nation to court.

The plans emerged as a Royal Navy taskforce, including the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and two frigates, set sail for Gibraltar. The journey is part of a long-planned exercise – but government officials say the show of force may help ‘focus minds’ in Spain.

Britain’s ambassador Giles Paxman, brother of Newsnight presenter Jeremy, informed the Spanish of the intention to go to court yesterday afternoon.

Government lawyers were last night deciding whether to lodge a case with the ECJ, or call for the European Commission to take action itself; senior sources told the Daily Mail that Mr Cameron demanded answers from the Foreign Office ‘by the end of the day’.

Unprecedented: Prime Minister David Cameron is threatening Madrid with legal action over delays at the Spain-Gibraltar border

He is expected to consult with the attorney general Dominic Grieve today, and could make a formal announcement tomorrow.

Officials are also drafting plans for political retaliation to hit Spanish interests if Madrid fails to back down.

Ministers believe the Spanish have engineered the controversy to distract attention from the parlous state of its economy, and a corruption scandal engulfing the govern

A Downing Street spokesman said:  ‘Clearly the Prime Minister is disappointed by the failure of Spain to remove the additional border checks this weekend. We are now considering what legal action is open to us. This would be an unprecedented step so we want to consider it carefully.’

They said the action by the Spanish was ‘politically motivated and totally disproportionate’, and illegal under EU law. ment of prime minister Mariano Rajoy.

A Whitehall source added: ‘We’re also exploring whether there are other political options we could pursue to make clear to the Spanish that the issue is putting our bilateral relations at risk, and persuade them to de-escalate the issue.’

The European Commission said it will send monitors to the border to assess the situation – but sources said these monitors would not arrive until next month at the earliest, because they are on holiday.

The stand-off began when the government of Gibraltar started building an artificial reef in the waters off the Rock last month to deter Spanish fishermen, who were damaging the marine environment.

Spain responded by imposing draconian border checks, and threatening to slap tolls on travellers and ban Gibraltar-bound flights from Spanish air space.

Spanish media reports suggested that the case could be taken to the United Nations, with Spain and Argentina joining forces to demand sovereignty over Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands.

Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo will sound out his Argentinian counterpart, Hector Timerman, at a meeting in Buenos Aires next month.

Ignacio Ibanez, the director general for foreign affairs at Spain’s foreign ministry, said his country was ‘not worried’ about legal action. 

‘We are not worried because we are convinced about what we are doing, and we know that the right is on our side,’ he said, adding that it was ‘normal’ that Spain would talk with Argentina about Gibraltar and the Falklands.

Spain wants Britain to hand over Gibraltar – but it has no intention of letting go of Ceuta and Melilla, two enclaves it holds on the coast of North Africa.

The tiny territories on  the Mediterranean are the subjects of a long-standing dispute with Morocco.

While Britain calls Gibraltar an overseas territory, Spain claims that the cities are actually part of mainland Spain.

Spanish officials say their historical claim on the areas predates the modern country of Morocco, and so refuse to give them up. Like Gibraltar, they are duty-free havens that attract smugglers.

Juan Jose Improda, the regional president of Melilla, stressed that Gibraltar is classified as a ‘non-self-governing territory’ by the United Nations, meaning its status is discussed by the UN Committee on Decolonisation, while Morocco has done nothing to include Melilla and Ceuta on that list.

Maria Leon, a 30-year-old born in Ceuta, said: ‘We are as Spanish as people from Madrid or Valencia.’ However, she added: ‘I do feel sympathy with the people of Gibraltar. So what if our land is at the tip of another country? I think the politicians should just leave things alone and let us get on with our lives peacefully.’

Ten British vessels with a capacity of 3,000 personnel have headed to the waters off Gibraltar. The frigate HMS Westminster and two support vessels will call in at the British base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19. 

Longstanding Spanish rules mean that once they call at the Rock they cannot sail directly to any Spanish sea port.

London mayor Boris Johnson said the deployment should send a clear signal to the Spanish.

‘Perhaps it really is a coincidence – as the Foreign Office claims – that we have just sent a fleet of warships to Gibraltar,’ he said. ‘But I hope not. I hope that one way or another we will shortly prise Spanish hands off the throat of our colony.’
