A sexist note left in a plane for a female pilot by a passenger has caused outrage, after it suggested the cockpit 'is no place for a woman'.

The letter, scrawled in pen on the back of a napkin, was found addressed to WestJet captain Carey Smith Steacy after she completed a flight from Calgary to Victoria in Canada.

The passenger has been identified only as 'David' from seat 12E, who reportedly also told flight attendants safety was important to him, and asked whether the pilot had enough hours to be the captain.

Sexist letter: The note written by 'David' was left in seat 12E on the WestJet flight

Carey, a mother-of-two from Surrey, British Columbia, who has been a pilot for 17 years, posted the note on her Facebook page, and it made its way to online chatrooms and Reddit.

It read: 'Dear Capt/ WestJet. The cockpit of airliner is no place for a woman. A woman being a mother is the most honor [sic], not as "captain". We're short mothers, not pilots WestJet.'

He then references Chapter 31 from the Book of Proverbs, which includes a description of what makes a virtuous woman.

The letter continues: '(Sorry, not PC) PS: I wish WestJet could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so I can book another flight!'

Posting it on Facebook, Carey wrote: 'To @David in 12E on my flight #463 from Calgary to Victoria today. 

'It was my pleasure flying you safely to your destination. Thank you for the note you discreetly left me on your seat.

'You made sure to ask the flight attendants before we left if I had enough hours to be the Captain so safety is important to you, too. 

'I have heard many comments from people throughout my 17-year career as a pilot. Most of them positive. Your note is, without a doubt, the funniest. It was a joke, right? RIGHT?? I thought, not. 

'You were more than welcome to deplane when you heard I was a “fair lady", You have that right. Funny, we all, us humans, have the same rights in this great free country of ours. 

'Now, back to my most important role, being a mother.'

She told Metro News: 'I just couldn’t believe there are still people in this country that think like that.'

WestJet said it has 1,118 male pilots and 58 female pilots, adding: 'We have captains and first officers among our female pilots and always have since we launched in 1996.'

A statement added: 'We are enormously proud of the professionalism, skills and expertise of our pilots and we were disappointed to see this note.'
