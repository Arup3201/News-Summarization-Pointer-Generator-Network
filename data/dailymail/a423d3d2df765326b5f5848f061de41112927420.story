David Cameron is facing a major backbench revolt, with 100 of his MPs demanding an end to the scandal of foreign criminals claiming they have a right to a 'family life' in the UK

David Cameron is facing a major backbench revolt, with 100 of his MPs demanding an end to the scandal of foreign criminals claiming they have a right to a ‘family life’ in the UK.

Last year, 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully challenged their removal by citing Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights Act.

Ministers are promising to tighten the rules using the Government’s Immigration Bill, which will be debated by MPs next week. But, in the latest challenge to the Prime Minister’s authority, 100 MPs say the Government’s proposals do not go far enough.

They are backing a rebel amendment, tabled by Tory Dominic Raab, that would make it all but impossible for foreign criminals to exercise their Article 8 right to a ‘family life’.

Ministers have been resisting the amendment, which they claim is so strict that it could flout the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. It could lead to a humiliating split in the Commons.

Backbenchers already want to use the Immigration Bill to reinstate controls on workers from Romania and Bulgaria, leaving No10 fighting fires on two fronts.

There are currently about 4,000 overseas convicts living in the UK that the Government wants to remove but is blocked from doing so by human rights laws.

Two years ago, Home Secretary Theresa May issued new instructions to the courts to say that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances. But immigration judges defied her on the grounds that the guidance was not primary legislation so did not carry the same weight as the Human Rights Act.

Mrs May is now seeking to change the law to state that Article 8 should no longer normally be a bar to deportation. But Tory MPs say her proposals still leave too much discretion in the hands of the courts, which could block deportation if the criminal can prove a ‘genuine and subsisting’ relationship with a partner or child.

The backbench amendment removes the discretionary element, so courts would have to order deportation of a foreign criminal jailed for a year or more, unless he faced torture or death on removal. The only exception would be if the Home Secretary thinks halting a deportation ‘is in the overwhelming humanitarian interests of the offender’s children’.

Mr Raab said the courts need to be told to deport in unequivocal language. ‘This amendment will cut the spurious human rights challenges lodged by convicted killers, rapists and drug dealers to evade deportation, and restore some common sense to our border controls,’ he said.

‘Having talked about reform for the last three years, it’s time we delivered – that’s what this amendment will do.’

The amendment is a massive new headache for No10. Up to 70 Tory backbenchers are already planning to use the legislation to call for the re-instatement of controls on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania, which the Government says would flout EU law.

The Immigration Bill has already been withdrawn once to avoid a confrontation with rebels. But Mr Cameron has been warned that unless the Bill returns next week, it would run out of time to get through the House of Lords in this parliamentary session and could be lost altogether.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Those who abuse our hospitality by committing serious crimes have no place in Britain and we are determined to see more of them kicked out.

‘We are passing legislation to ensure judges don’t regard the right to a family life as an absolute and unqualified one.’

A Somali rapist, who held a knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a right to family life.

Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home.

He was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law.

But in December last year he was deemed to have a right to a family life under Article 8 and released.

Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here.

The judges gave him credit for having put his criminal behaviour ‘behind him’.

They also concluded he posed a ‘low risk’ of offending again, based on evidence from a psychiatrist who saw him for only a couple of hours.
