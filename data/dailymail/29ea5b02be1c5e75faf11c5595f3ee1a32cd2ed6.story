Marco Reus' future at Borussia Dortmund is becoming increasingly unclear but Franz Beckenbauer believes the German club would be able to survive without the 'extraordinary' forward.

Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester City are just some of the clubs touted as possible destinations for Reus, who has scored 47 goals in 99 games for Dortmund.

But Beckenbauer, a legend of Dortmund's great rivals Bayern Munich, is adamant the club would be able to cope without Reus - although he does believe the forward makes them stronger.

The two-time World Cup winner - once as a player and once as a manager - told TZ: 'Would Reus' departure be the end of Dortmund's ambitions? There's more to Dortmund than just Reus.

'They still have plenty of other great players, although Reus is obviously an important player for Dortmund.

'When there's so much talk about a player, it means that he is an extraordinary player and that's most certainly the case with Reus.'

Reus has been courted by a number of Premier League sides and looks certain to leave Dortmund next summer. 

The 25-year-old has been capped 23 times by Germany, scoring on seven occasions.
