A Royal British Legion chief has quit his position after being caught boasting that he could abuse his position to help arms dealers win lucrative defence contracts.

Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely, the national president, fell on his sword after being embroiled in the ‘top brass for hire’ scandal.

The retired officer bragged he could use his role at the charity to help defence companies lobby ministers and senior figures in the British military.

The shamed Falklands hero even described the Legion’s annual Remembrance events - which honour men and women killed and maimed serving the country - as a ‘tremendous networking opportunity’.

Sir John’s remarks were filmed by reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean weapons manufacturer looking to recruit him to help sell unmanned drone aircraft to the UK Government.

He resigned in disgrace yesterday after admitting that it would be ‘inappropriate’ to remain as the Legion’s president.

In a letter to the national chairman John Farmer, the former head of the Defence Academy said he had made ‘exaggerated and foolish claims’ about his involvement in bidding for defence contracts.

But he insisted he had kept his position with the Legion ‘entirely separate’ from his business interests. He denies breaking lobbying rules.

Sir John, 64, was one of several retired military officers secretly filmed by the Sunday Times allegedly claiming they could influence decision-making over arms deals.

He made his boasts after being offered £110,000 a year from journalists.

In the covert footage, Sir John is shown saying he could push the fake firm’s interests with the Prime Minister in a private box at the Festival of Remembrance next month at the Royal Albert Hall.

He also claimed he could use Remembrance Sunday to lobby the Defence Secretary.

‘You are standing there waiting for the Queen with nothing else to talk about to Philip Hammond than whatever,’ he said.

The general boasted his role at the respected services body gave him top-level access at ‘various extremely boring affairs’.

He explained: ‘If I tried to book in to have a meeting on behalf of a company, I probably wouldn’t get past the door.’

Sir John claimed he could get his friend Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan to consider bids by defence companies selling weapons to the government.

He said: ‘I would get into his office by saying, “As president of the British Legion, you know, it’s time”... and that’s when you sow the seed.’ This was denied by the Ministry of Defence.

Sir John, who advises defence firm Babcock International, also boasted about lobbying for a £4.3million contract during the ‘purdah’ period when the MoD is banned from discussing bids.

In his resignation letter, Sir John said he always kept his ‘role of national president completely separate from any business interests’.

He added he had ‘never used any access gained as president to raise the subject of, or discuss, any business interests whatsoever, let alone to make representations on behalf of clients.

‘But I made exaggerated and foolish claims to the contrary, incompatible with my position.’

Due to step down in December, Sir John said it was ‘in the Legion’s best interests’ for him to quit immediately.

Royal British Legion director general Chris Simpkins said Sir John remarks were ‘out of character’.

But he added: ‘The Legion’s work, including Remembrance events, must be kept free of any suggestion that they could be used for commercial or political gain. Sir John’s remarks suggested otherwise.’

Mr Hammond has launched a review of rules governing access to ministers and serving officers and vowed to ‘shut down’ meetings that could be seen as inappropriate.

He insisted no contracts had been awarded as a result of outside influence.

He accused some former officers of ‘bigging up their capabilities’.

The other retired officers who boasted of their influence were former MoD procurement chief Lt Gen Richard Applegate; Admiral Sir Trevor Soar, until this year commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy; ex-Army heads General Lord Dannatt and General Sir Mike Jackson; and former head of the Armed Forces Lord Stirrup. All denied any wrong-doing.
