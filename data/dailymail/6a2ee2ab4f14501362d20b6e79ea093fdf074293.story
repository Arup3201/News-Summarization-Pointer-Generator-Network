Dedication: Luo Siqi spent two months at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport wearing a China Southern Airlines uniform

A 13-year-old girl dressed up as a flight attendant and spent two months in an airport before she was spotted by security, it has been revealed today.

Luo Siqi has been at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, Guangdong province, China, since July dressed in a China Southern Airlines flight attendant uniform.

No one noticed the schoolgirl - who was also carrying airline documents - until August, when she was questioned by police.

Officers have twice escorted her from the airport to a children’s welfare centre in Guangzhou, but she insists on returning to the airport.

On her return, the girl reportedly told police: 'I am truly in love with the sky. Let me go to the airport.'

The girl’s wishes have baffled her 
adoptive parents, who want police to investigate further as they think someone has been telling her how to act.

Luo was 
abandoned by her biological parents shortly after she was born and has 
since been adopted and re-homed more than once.

The girl now lives in the nearby city of Luoding with her cousin, a relative 
of her adoptive father who now lives in an elderly care centre.

She left home for Guangzhou Airport in July after deciding to 'take a look at the big city.'

She bought all of her outfits online for between 280 (£38) and 3,000 (£304) yuan.

According to the South China Morning Post, Luo said: 'I
love blue sky, and have always dreamed of flying. By doing this, I am a
bit closer to my dream.

'I once bought four suits at the same time, [to accommodate] four different seasons.'

Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport was unavailable for comment.
