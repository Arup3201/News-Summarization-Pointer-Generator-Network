BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan yesterday insisted she acted in ‘good faith’ when investing in the same tax-avoidance scheme as Take That star Gary Barlow.

The 41-year-old said she had believed she was funding new acts in the music industry when she ploughed money into Icebreaker LLP, and insisted she would pay back any money she owes HM Revenue and Customs.

The firm had purported to put the cash into creative industries, but instead it moved it around to build up huge losses that wiped out large tax bills its investors would otherwise have been expected topay.

Speaking out: BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan yesterday insisted she acted in 'good faith' when she ploughed money into Icebreaker LLP. She said she believed she was funding new acts in the music industry

Earlier 
this month a judge ruled it was not a genuine investment scheme and that
 it had been set up solely to allow the wealthy to avoid paying tax.

The
 scheme had about £336m invested by a number of celebrities, including 
£66million from three members of Take That who could now face a tax bill
 of £20million.

Other
 celebrities who ploughed money into the scheme included former Olympic 
hurdler Colin Jackson and ex England football manager Terry Venables.

Mrs Logan released a statement on her website, in which she claims that she had invested 'in good faith' and revealing 
that she had not been involved in the scheme since 2012.

Mrs Logan released a statement on her website, in which she claims that she had invested 'in good faith' and revealing that she had not been involved in the scheme since 2012

She said: 
'I was advised about a business opportunity 6 years ago (2008) and I 
invested in good faith. It was explained to me as a way of funding new 
acts in the music industry.

'Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.

'With new professional help and advisors, I have for some time been working to resolve the issue and I fully intend to pay any tax which should have been paid, had I not entered the business.

'I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything.'

A tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment 
scheme earlier this month. Instead it was found that it had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim 
income tax relief.

The ruling means Mrs Logan and the other investors could now be forced to pay back millions to HMRC.

She joined an Icebreaker partnership called 
Ivancroft in 2008, which claimed to be a creative industries investment scheme.

Ivancroft made a loss of £11.7million.

Its real purpose was to allow its members to offset their investments against the tax they owed on their other earnings.

It
 is thought Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, 
and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back 
HMRC.

For years,
 HRMC has been trying to shut down Icebreaker Management, which claims 
to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative 
and artistic material and taxable profits’. In 2012, it was revealed that the three Take That members had invested £26million into an Icebreaker partnership.It is claimed the musicians were able to avoid tax on about £63 million from world tours and CD sales.They were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships.But
 a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker partnerships, which were 
formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit - despite 
investigating in a range of musicians.

A tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment 
scheme earlier this month.

Instead it was found that it had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim 
income tax relief.

They put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman.

Other
 well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired 
Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry
 Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of 
Charles Tyrwhitt shirts.

It
 is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into 
joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme.

Both Jackson and Venables have insisted their tax affairs are in order and have denied they joined Icebreaker to avoid tax.

However, judge Colin Bishopp ruled Icebreaker ‘is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.’

Prime
 Minister David Cameron has said he is ‘opposed to all aggressive tax 
avoidance’ but refused to join calls for Barlow to be stripped of his 
OBE.

MailOnline has contacted Mrs Logan’s spokesman for comment.

A
 year before joining Ivancroft the mother-of-two – who is married to 
former Scotland rugby player Kenny Logan - gave an interview about her 
finances.

Asked
 about saving for retirement, she said: ‘Property and the odd 
speculative investment. As well as property and Isas, I have 
occasionally bought shares and invested in businesses.’
