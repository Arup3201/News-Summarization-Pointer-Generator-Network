Sudden death: Tourism boss David Hunter died from a fatal 
blood clot days after twisting his ankle on holiday in Turkey

A tourism boss and grandfather died from a fatal blood clot just days after twisting his ankle while on holiday in Turkey. 

David Hunter - a founding director of the Northumberland Tourism Organisation - collapsed last Sunday at his home in Amble after injuring his ankle at the holiday resort of Icmeler.

Mr Hunter was rushed to hospital where specialists carried out scans before discovering a blood clot on his lung. Despite receiving emergency treatment, Mr Hunter suffered a heart attack on Monday morning and died in hospital the next day.

'He had sprained his ankle in Turkey the week before when he just missed the last step and twisted over,' said his wife Sue Hunter, 59.

'We bandaged it up the next day and he went to hospital when he got back but we didn't think it was anything serious. You just wouldn't believe it.'

'It's such a shock - this time last week he was still here,' added Mrs Hunter, who is being comforted by the couple's two children, Rebecca, 30, and James, 24.

'He was so fit and so active. Last Sunday, we got up as normal and I heard a bang on the bathroom floor and he had collapsed.'

She said when he wouldn't respond, she feared the worst and called an ambulance.

'At that time, we didn't have a clue what was wrong,' she said. 'After a CT scan that's when they found the clot on the lung.'

Mr Hunter was a local hotelier who helped set up the Northumberland Tourism Organisation.

The couple spent decades travelling 
around the country managing hotels before returning to the North East, 
where Mr Hunter helped form the Northumberland Tourism organisation and 
develop the region's tourism industry.

He spent his career working for some of 
the UK’s foremost hotels including the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland and 
the Grand Hotel in Eastbourne.

He spent eight years at Matfen Hall 
Hotel, during which time the hotel was awarded both Best Large Hotel in 
the UK and Most Considerate Hotel in England.

Giles Ingram, chief executive of Northumberland Tourism, praised Mr Hunter for doing 'wonderful things for the region'.

'He
really put the North East on the map. More than that though, he was a 
lovely man and everyone who he worked with had the utmost respect for 
him.

'They were genuinely fond of him and he was a particularly warm individual.'

Mrs Hunter described her husband of 32 years as a 'loving family man'.

'It
was just so sudden and that's why it's so shocking. He was just the 
kindest person you could possibly meet. He never panicked about anything
- he was so calm.

'He was a fantastic grandfather and father. For
32 years we've been married and I couldn't have asked for anybody 
better. I don't think we've had a major row in all that time. I couldn't have asked for a better person to be with, he was just my best friend.

'Anybody
who has ever come across him is just totally devastated. It's dreadful 
for me but I know how hard it is for all my family and friends. We are 
still all trying to come to terms with it - I keep thinking he might 
still come through the door.'
