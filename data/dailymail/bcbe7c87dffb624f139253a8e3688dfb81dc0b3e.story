Twin brothers have been charged over the fatal drive-by shooting of a 22-year-old man outside a Florida Best Buy store yesterday afternoon.

Police said Christopher and Manuel Rodriguez, 19, opened fire  on Tevin Demetrius Davis, 22, 'as if it was a gun range' as he walked with a friend on State Road 436 in Altamonte Springs about 1.45pm.

The brothers fled the scene in a tan Chevrolet, leaving Davis dead in a pool of blood on a busy shopping strip. Davis's friend was not injured.
