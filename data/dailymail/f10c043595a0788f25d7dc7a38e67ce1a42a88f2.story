AC Milan striker Fernando Torres features in our top five howlers... but where does the Chelsea misfit rank?

5th place

Austin Ejide’s disallowed own goal

Everyone has their opinion on Austin Ejide's bizarre disallowed own goal against Scotland. The Nigerian goalkeeper appears to throw the ball into his net only for the referee to disallow it.

4th place

Junior Malanda’s open goal miss

With Bayern Munich leading Wolfsburg 2-1 with 10 minutes to play in the Bundesliga curtain-raiser, Junior Malanda was presented with a glorious chance to earn his side a point against the champions but somehow managed to miss an open goal from one yard out.

3rd place

Fernando Torres vs Pepe Reina

Fernando Torres has a torrid time trying to score past Pepe Reina in Spain training at the World Cup. Got to admire his persistence though. If at first you don’t succeed...

Runner-up

Milan Gajic’s own goal screamer

Young Boys midfielder Milan Gajic scores one of the best own goals you'll ever see as he accidentally lashes a 20-yard volley past his own keeper giving St Gallen a 2-1 lead.

Winner 

Fernando Torres’ two yard fumble

Torres, then at Chelsea, manages to miss from two yards in a 2-1 pre-season friendly victory against Olimpija Ljubljana. New signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas later combined to show the unlucky Spaniard how it should be done.
