Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England 

If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop 

Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016

In decades gone by, top clubs would raid the lower divisions for players. Ian Rush arrived at Liverpool from Chester and became a European champion.

Stuart Pearce was a non-League player and ended up in a World Cup semi-final. These are a couple of examples – there are many others like John Aldridge, Kevin Keegan, Garry Birtles, Alan Smith, Ian Wright – the list goes on.

Most of the examples of players plucked from the lower leagues these days are of talented youngsters who haven’t played many first team games, but have standout talent and potential that takes them to a top club – look at Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Hart as two examples.

But I would love to see one of these over-hyped top managers do the dirty work of finding a gem from the lower divisions and polishing him up into a top player.

I watched Barnsley beat Bradford 3-1 in League One at the weekend and I saw a striker – Sam Winnall – star for Barnsley. 

He was superb – his running was clever, he bullied defenders, he found space, he finished, he was aware of his team-mates’ runs, and his work rate was phenomenal. He was the difference between the two sides.

He was the top scorer in League Two last season, he can score tap-ins and long range goals (check out his beauty at Oldham in the the Johnstone's Paint Trophy this season).

My point is not that he’s a world-beater but he has the raw ingredients, that’s for sure.

Sam Winnall made the difference for Barnsley in their 3-1 win over Bradford City on Sunday

The real test of a manager like Jose Mourinho at Chelsea would be to find and develop a lower league gem

Louis van Gaal has spent in excess of £150m at Manchester United seeking a quick fix 

No, my point is that if you are Jose Mourinho, Arsene Wenger, Manuel Pellegrini, or Louis van Gaal – surely one of the qualities needed to qualify as a top coach must be to spot talent in the lower leagues and turn that talent into a top player?

Were any of those four coaches at Oakwell to watch him on Sunday?

No, of course not.

It’s easy signing players for anything from £10m to £60m and putting them in the first team. What about coaching a player? Isn’t that part of their job, too? I wonder if any of them have ever heard of Winnall, let alone watched him.

I don’t know if he could make it at the top level. But these coaches will never know because they don’t even bother watching him.

In the past, top clubs would scour the lower leagues for talent and polish these gems into world class players

Ian Rush, Stuart Pearce, Kevin Keegan and Ian Wright are  examples

Over-hyped managers should do their own dirty work and coach a player plucked from Football League or non-league into a star

Sam Winnall, for example, inspired Barnsley's victory over Bradford
