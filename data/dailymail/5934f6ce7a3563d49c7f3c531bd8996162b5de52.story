West Ham manager Sam Allardyce stands by his comments about Louis van Gaal playing long-ball football, but insists they shouldn't be taken as an insult.

The 60-year-old boss made the claim after the Hammers 1-1 draw with Manchester United at the Boleyn Ground.

But a clearly-riled Van Gaal reacted angrily to the suggestion, using diagrams and statistics to prove the opposite was in fact true at a press conference.

Allardyce has since revealed that he stands by his statement, but suggested it had been misinterpreted.  

‘It was, to a certain extent, tongue in cheek,' he wrote in his column in the Evening Standard. 'But I believe I was also making a factual point.

‘The fact was I saw United play, for a time against us last weekend, in a way I have never seen them before.

‘What I didn’t say afterwards was that we played fewer long balls than them — my comment was that United played long-ball football more than I have ever witnessed from them in the past.’

Van Gaal's press conference tactics lesson stunned many supporters, but Allardyce claimed he never meant to offend the Dutchman.

‘Dare I make those comments because it’s Manchester United? Yes, I dare because it was a fact. Louis’s response created a bit of a furore and he obviously felt he had to protect himself by responding to my comments.’

He added: ‘Louis might have felt I was criticising him but the opposite was true. In fact I was praising the way he changed his team to escape from the predicament they were in against us.’
