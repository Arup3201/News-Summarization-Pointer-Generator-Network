Families setting off on a road trip this summer might want to take some ear plugs.

New research reveals most rows in the car kick off just 22 minutes after leaving the house.

Tensions will rise in one in four families, with the majority of arguments taking place between 10am and 1pm on London’s M25, according to a survey.

Music, children distracting the driver and squabbles over who sits where are top three reasons for family rows

Music being played, children distracting the driver and squabbles over who sits where are the top three reasons why arguments break out en route to a summer holiday.

Family members passing gas in an enclosed space is responsible for five per cent of rows.

The quiz of 2,000 British parents found 15 per cent of people had been in family rows so bad on car trips that they abandoned their holiday plans and went back home.

And 21 per cent of parents say they have stopped the car and threatened not to drive any further after a row.

More than 2.9 million Brits are planning a driving holiday this year, with the average distance travelled over 142 miles.

Today – July 23 – sees more in-car arguments than any other time over the summer, as Brits set off for their summer breaks.

The M25 sees the most arguments, according to the research, with one in five families having a fracas on the London orbital.

One Poll carried out the research to mark the Digital HD release of Rio 2.
