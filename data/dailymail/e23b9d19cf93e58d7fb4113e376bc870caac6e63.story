An unfolding murder that started in Tennessee and traces back to more deaths in Alabama now has police trying to explain how three women, an 18-month-old boy, the man wanted for questioning and his friend all ended up dead.

The discovery of six bodies in two states Monday and Tuesday presents a puzzling case for authorities as they began searching for clues to confirm that the deaths were somehow linked.

Three women and an 18-month-old boy were killed in Tennessee, about a mile away from the state line. An infant and toddler are spared inside the home.

Children: The three-year-old boy (left) called his relatives saying that he could not wake anyone in his house up, including his 18-month-old brother Rico Ragland (right)

Victim: They were the sons of Chabreya Campbell (in both above), who was six-months pregnant when she was killed in her home and police wanted to speak to her ex in connection to the murders

A man wanted for questioning in the homicides is found dead in the Alabama woods near the Tennessee border, while one of his presumed acquaintances is found shot to death.

The mystery began Monday when a 3-year-old boy called relatives from a house outside Fayetteville saying ‘I can’t wake them up’.

Third woman found: Amber McCaulley was also found dead and is thought to be related to this case

Family members arriving at the house, about 100 miles south of Nashville, Tennessee, found all the doors and windows locked, but were able to coach the child into opening a garage door.

When they reached inside to pull him out, they saw blood and called police.

When authorities got there, they found the lifeless bodies of 22-year-old Chabreya Campbell, and her 18-month-old son, Rico Ragland. Campbell was six months pregnant.

The body of 21-year-old Amber McCaulley of Huntsville, Alabama, was also inside the home.

'I cannot imagine. I cannot imagine. ... There's no reason for anyone to have done something like this,' the surviving 3-year-old’s godmother, Constance Winston said.

At the start of the investigation, police wanted to speak to the father of the 3-year-old survivor, named Warren Vincent Crutcher.

They released Crutcher’s photo, name and car description to the public in hopes of finding him, saying that he was considered to be armed and dangerous.

Questionable: Warren Vincent Crutcher (left) was the father of the 3-year-old survivor, and both he and his acquaintance Jeffrey Pope (right) were found dead as well in a different location

Emotional: Friends and relatives were visibly distraught at the scene, including one woman who collapsed

A short while later, Crutcher was found dead in the Alabama woods, just across the Tennessee state line, with no further explanation except to say that his death did not look like a suicide.

Jeffrey Pope, who was identified by local news media as an acquaintance of Crutcher, was fatally shot in Huntsville and was found by utility crews in the woods, police said.

Authorities did not confirm the connection between the two men, but they are investigating whether Pope's death could be linked to the other five.

Hours later, the body of 21-year-old Jessica Brown was found in her home in Fayetteville but her 2-month-old child was found unharmed. Brown’s connection- if any- to the case is unknown.

The Tennessee Department of Children's Services had no prior involvement with Campbell, Crutcher or their children, spokeswoman Molly Sudderth said Tuesday. She said the slayings would lead DCS to open a case and, if needed, take the 3-year-old into state custody until permanent arrangements could be made for him.
