Some final tactics were given to the Liverpool striker, who went into the  match searching for his first goal in the Barclays Premier League since making his £16million move from AC Milan.

Balotelli had the ball in the back of the Chelsea net less than 20 minutes in, but the former Manchester City striker was rightly given offside.
