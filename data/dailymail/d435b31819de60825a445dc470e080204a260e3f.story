'Tragic loss': Brigadier General Terence Hildner is the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to die in Afghanistan. He passed away on Friday of apparent natural causes

Fort Hood announced Brigadier General Hildner's death in a statement posted on its website.

The Army said his death was under investigation, although it appeared natural.

Lt
Gen Don Campbell Jr, Fort Hood's commanding general, said: 'This is a 
tragic loss for the Army, III Corps and for our Central Texas community.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.'

The 13th ESC led by Hildner supports 
other units, handling the distribution of everything from clothing to 
ammunition and performing maintenance on equipment, according to its 
website.

It includes the 1st Medical Brigade, which provides health care and combat medical service.

Hildner
served in Iraq during both Operation Desert Storm and the 2003 U.S.-led
war. He also served in Kuwait and was part of the last U.S. patrol 
along the East-West German border before reunification.
