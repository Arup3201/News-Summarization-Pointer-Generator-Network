A very curious cat which vanished without trace two years ago has been found - 1,100 miles away.

Cree Cantrell thought he would never again see three-year-old Jacque after the cat disappeared from his houseboat in Biloxi, Missouri.

But Jacque spent two years on the run, reappearing mysteriously in a veterinary surgery in Denver, Colorado.

Feline fantastic: Cree Cantrell has been reunited with his pet Jacque - found 1,100 miles away - after two years

Mr Cantrell recalled the moment his mother called him after the Colorado vet checked Jacque's microchip.

He told Missouri's WLOX News: 'I'm like, "What do you mean you found 
Jacque? This has been two years now." So I didn't really know what she 
was talking about, but she explained to me that he was in Colorado. I 
couldn't believe it. How's a cat get up there?'

If Jacque had driven to Denver in a car he would have passed through five states and taken more than 20 hours.

Mr Cantrell added: 'I came home from work one day and he 
just wasn't there. Looked for him obviously for a long time and just 
kind of gave up hope.

'I
always assumed that either he fell in the water, which he had done 
before, or maybe a tourist or something walking on the beach picked him 
up.'

Got the cream: Jacque looks contented now he is back... but where did he spend all that time?

Staggering: The distance the cat had to travel back to Biloxi from Denver after mysteriously ending up there

Mystery: Mr Cantrell, pictured, told WLOX News: 'I couldn't believe it. How's a cat get up there?'

1. Pablo, a nine-year-old silver tabby, was reunited with his owners his London after he wandered into a Scottish bank 450 miles away.

2. Vanilla, from San Francisco, is thought to have crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and was discovered eight years later after a kindly man with dementia adopted her.

3. Poppy, a two-year-old tabby from Great Yarmouth, England, stowed on board a ship bound for an oil rig and managed to travel more than 30 miles before she was found

4. Dallas, a black cat from Petaluma, California, was discovered near-death 13 years later and was gladly taken back in by his owner - who had only been 21 when she adopted him.

5. Salem, a black cat from England's West Midlands, was found by animal welfare officers 11 years after she slipped through an open door - reappearing on Christmas Eve.

The vet was able to contact Mr Cantrell after he scanned Jacque's microchip, which was the size of a grain of rice.

It was a lucky find, as the pet owner said he never planned to have Jacque microchipped - he was offered the service when he took Jacque in to get neutered.

The chips have helped reunite countless owners with their furry friends, and Jacque is not the only cat who has gone walkies across the country.

Today a family from Scotland revealed they have been reuinted with their black cat Murphy - three and a half years after he vanished while they were on holiday.

His owner Julie Maloney told STV News: 'Murphy has been really clingy these past few days so we think he's glad to be back after such a long time apart.'

And last year, a family in Munich, Germany, were reunited with their pet cat Poldi after an incredible 16 years.

But Poldi was less adventurous than Jacque - he was found just 20 miles from home in a forest.
