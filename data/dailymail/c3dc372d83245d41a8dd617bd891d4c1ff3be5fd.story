A woman who wanted to make a family trip to show her family the grave of her late military hero husband, got a terrible shock. Instead of her own name, on the reverse side of her husband’s headstone is a strange woman’s name.

Edna Fielden took her grandchildren from their home in Minnesota to the Ft. Logan military cemetery where her late husband Air Force Sergeant Billy Fielden is buried in Denver, Colorado.

Fielden was buried there 25 years ago after dying of cardiac arrest at age 58. Edna had hoped for the trip to be a special one, but it quickly turned nightmarish.

Betrayal? Edna Fielden hadn't visited her beloved late husband's grave in several years. But when she did, she was shocked to find another woman's name engraved on it

‘A piece of my heart broke off,’ Fielden told WKYC.

Who was this Dolores, whose name was etched on her husband’s grave marker?

‘I gasped and said who is this,’ Fielden said, choking up. ‘I thought this woman was in this grave with him as I want to be.’

Fearing the worst for an entire weekend, Fielden waited for the cemetery office to open that Monday.

Mysterious: Air Force Sergeant Billy Fielden was a devoted husband and father, said Edna, and he died 25 years ago. So why did his tombstone have some other woman's name now?

'I gasped and said who is this?': Edna Fielden wanted the trip she took with her family from Minnesota, to see her late husband's grave in Denver, to be special but it turned nightmarish

That’s when cemetery director Joe Turnbach informed her that she needn’t have worried. Dolores is not burred with Edna’s husband.

But a mistake was obviously made.

‘I do want to apologize to the family and somehow we want to make this right,’ Turnbach said.

Turnbach believes a headstone engraver mistakenly engraved two markers for Dolores some ten years ago but never divulged his flub to the cemetery administration. He believe Dolores is buried elsewhere, with her husband, in the cemetery.

Sorry: After a weekend of waiting, apologetic cemetery director Joe Turnbach revealed to Edna the engraving was just a mistake made years ago but never uncovered. An appalled Edna wants her husband relocated as soon as possible

Edna Fielden remains distraught over the mistake and says her trip was ruined. She wants her husband moved to Minnesota as soon as possible.

Turnbach says he’d like to comply with the request, saying the mistake is absolutely the cemetery’s fault, but there are fears red tape will make the move a lengthy process.

But Edna remains adamant.

‘I don’t want him here anymore,’ she said.
