Surrounded by smoke and flames from Luftwaffe bombs, the image of St Paul’s rising above the scarred London skyline became a symbol of the nation’s Blitz Spirit.

But on Friday a rag-tag group of anti-capitalist protesters camping on its doorstep achieved what even Hitler’s bombers only once managed to achieve – and forced the cathedral to shut.

Dean Rev Graeme Knowles said the decision to close until further notice was made with ‘heavy hearts’ after the makeshift camp on its steps doubled in size during the past week.

The protesters couldn't stop a wedding taking place at St Paul's today.

Natasha Ighodaro arrived at the cathedral to marry Nick Cunningham - against a backdrop of dozens of tents and a banner reading 'capitalism is crisis'.

The bride, a University of York graduate, appeared to put on a brave face and smiled at onlookers as she walked in through a side entrance as police stood by.

Just yards away, the front steps of St Paul's were teaming with protesters who have vowed to stay put for the immediate future.

Earlier, bride and groom were forced to reassure their guests that the ceremony would go ahead despite the action.

In a message posted on Facebook, they wrote: 'We're looking forward to seeing friends and family at the wedding today, and are pleased that it is going ahead as planned. love Nick Cunningham and Natasha Ighodaro xxx'.

This followed an upbeat message last night which stated: 'For anyone who is worried about tomorrow - don't be. The recent announcement doesn't affect us; it just means that we have run of the house :) xxxx.'

Ahead of the service, ushers insisted Miss Ighodaro, an account manager for a PR company, was not concerned by disruption.

'She just wants to enjoy her day - if she ever gets here,' one joked.

He blamed ‘health and safety’ concerns 
caused by the Occupy London Stock Exchange movement, which has been 
located in Paternoster Square since Saturday after being barred from the
Stock Exchange.

And he begged the activists – who include teachers, social workers, 
mothers with  children and an extra from Downton Abbey – to leave what 
has become known as ‘Camp Crusty’.

The continuing disruption has seen the cathedral’s earlier act of 
charity backfire.

On Sunday, defending the rights of the protesters, 
Canon Chancellor the Rev Giles Fraser had asked police to leave and even
invited the demonstrators in to worship.

On Friday night religious leaders described the decision to close the cathedral as a ‘tragedy’.

But as the doors were locked after Friday's 3.30pm service, 
protesters remained defiant – and thousands more are expected to descend
on the site on Saturday.

St Paul’s was shut for just four days during the Blitz while Royal 
Engineers defused a time-delayed bomb that had hit the cathedral.

Mr Knowles, who has been forced to cancel a visit to America, said the decision to close it again was ‘unprecedented’.

He said: ‘I have written an open letter to the protesters this afternoon
advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close St Paul’s
Cathedral until further notice.

'Health, safety and fire officers have 
pointed out that access to the cathedral is seriously limited.

'With so 
many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around, there 
is a very clear fire hazard.

‘Then there is the public health aspect which indeed speaks for itself. 
The dangers relate not just to cathedral staff and to visitors but are a
potential hazard to those encamped themselves.

‘We have done this with a very heavy heart, but it is simply not 
possible to fulfil our day-to-day obligations to worshippers, visitors 
and pilgrims in current circumstances.

‘I am asking the protesters to recognise the huge issues facing us at 
this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that 
the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible.

‘I hope that the protesters will understand the issues we are facing, 
recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard, and withdraw 
peacefully.’

He said the cathedral defended the right to protest but would like to use the building for its intended use.

The cathedral is one of London’s best loved tourist attractions and draws up to 3,000 worshippers each Sunday.

Canon Peter Bruinvels, a member of the Church of England’s 
parliament, the General Synod, said: ‘This is a tragedy. Clearly now the
demonstrators should pack up their tents and go. St Paul’s is a greater
cause then theirs and they should acknowledge that.

‘The cathedral is losing £20,000 for every day it is shut. It gets no state support. It cannot afford to be shut.’

Clergy at the cathedral have insisted that no welcome was given to the 
demonstrators and that their aim when the Occupy London Stock Exchange 
movement arrived – targeting the nearby Stock Exchange rather than the 
cathedral – was to avoid confrontation and violence.

The St Paul’s protest is already bearing the hallmarks of a more 
permanent set-up and is now home to a mobile library, a meditation 
centre and even solar panels.

A delivery of portable toilets is expected
in the next 24 hours.

Protester George Barda said: ‘I think this is an appallingly unchristian
decision and I personally think it would be a big mistake for us to 
leave here.

'This is completely unnecessary and I believe a commercially 
driven decision.’

The Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, issued the following statement today

Thank you for coming today.

It seems a very long time since the protestors arrived around the Cathedral last weekend and I want to stress at the outset that we have listened to them and indeed developed a conversation with them.

We are delighted that the London protests have been peaceful and indeed there has been a good atmosphere generally between Cathedral staff and those dwelling in the tents around St Paul’s.

There is something profound about protest being made and heard in front of this most holy place: a gathering together of those concerned about poverty and inequality facing the great Dome of this Cathedral Church.

You actually have to be here to witness it for yourself because the extent of feeling and protest is not easily translated via media in that sense.

But it is about the practical and safety issues which this peaceful protest has raised which I need to address with you today.

It should be obvious to anyone approaching the Cathedral that the size of the camp and the consequent compliance issues which it inevitably raises, has increasingly put us in a difficult position.

Last night, I met with members of the Chapter to discuss some of these key issues. As the week has gone on, and in a statement we issued earlier this week, we intimated how difficult the situation was becoming.

As a result of that meeting, and reports received today from our independent Health, Safety and Fire officers, I have written an open letter to the protestors this afternoon advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close St Paul’s Cathedral until further notice. I have here copies of the letter clearly outlining the reasons we have had to take this dramatic course of action which I will ask my colleagues to distribute.

The Health, Safety and Fire officers have pointed out that access to and from the Cathedral is seriously limited. With so many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around, there is a clear fire hazard. Then there is the public health aspect which speaks for itself. The dangers relate not just to Cathedral staff and visitors but are a potential hazard to those encamped themselves.

The decision to close St Paul’s Cathedral  is unprecedented in modern times and I have asked the Registrar to implement emergency procedures whereby the building remains closed but fit for purpose until such a time that we can open safely. Our 200 staff and 100 volunteers are also being informed of this decision this afternoon.

I want to say two simple things at this point.

1)    We have done this with a very heavy heart, but it is simply not possible to fulfil our day to day obligations to worshippers, visitors and pilgrims in current circumstances.2)    That all of the Chapter are at one on this and recognise the complexities of the issues facing us at this time.

As you can see in the open letter, I am asking the protestors to recognise the huge issues facing us at this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that the Cathedral can re-open as soon as possible. So many people who visit this great Cathedral come here, of course, because they love the Gospel of justice, peace and reconciliation [which some of the protestors are embracing for a whole host of reasons] , but also because they want to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of a place of prayer and pilgrimage.

Some will rightly say that the Church should be alongside those seeking equality and financial probity. We are. The debate about a more just society is at the heart of much of our work at St Paul’s and indeed we hope to contribute to the wider debate in the very near future through a Report from the St Paul’s Institute.

But today is about our ability, practically, to carry on our mission with free and open access to this public space and treasured place and I hope that the protestors will understand the issues we are facing, recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard, and withdraw peacefully.
