Carlo Ancelotti believes Real Madrid can make history by becoming the first team to retain the Champions League.

Real finally won their tenth European crown last season after a 12-year wait, beating rivals Atletico Madrid in the final, and the Italian manager is aware of the difficulty of repeating the feat.

'The statistics suggest that we are not favourites as no team have won the Champions League twice in a row,' Ancelotti told Corriere dello Sport.

Real Madrid won their ninth Champions League in 2002, it took them another 12 years to get the tenth

'But we can repeat last year's success, that would be great. The Decima was a dream for Madrid followers everywhere. The 11th would be the dream of all dreams.

Ancelotti has now won the Champions League three times, a figure only Bob Paisley can match, but the former AC Milan boss admitted that Madrid's European rivals had not been idol this summer.

He said: 'Chelsea are the team which have strengthened most this summer. They signed the phenomenon that is Diego Costa, then brought on board Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and Thibaut Courtois. They've improved a lot.'

'Bayern Munich, however, remain as good as they were last season.'
