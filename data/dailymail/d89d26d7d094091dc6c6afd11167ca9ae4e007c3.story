Remarkable: Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick, 38, has survived 17 bomb blasts, escaping with only cuts and bruises 

He's known as ‘the Bomb Magnet’ after surviving 17 explosions in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Remarkably, Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick Hyde is virtually unscathed, having suffered just a few cuts and bruises.

And no matter how close the call, the 38-year-old has written off every roadside bomb and rocket as an ‘occupational hazard’.

Yesterday the unflappable Warrant Officer Class 1 received a gallantry medal for saving his colleagues’ lives while he lay wounded after his 17th brush with death.

The soldier, who serves with the 4th Battalion The Rifles, was presented with his Military Cross by the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.

He received the award for helping to co-ordinate the evacuation of troops injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) that had knocked him to the ground in Helmand on July 19 last year.

Speaking after receiving his medal, WO1 Hyde said: ‘There are no lucky charms. When you operate in Sangin, as I have done, it becomes a bit of an occupational hazard up there. I’m just fortunate enough that I’ve survived.

‘We’re trained to do what we do and it becomes second nature. You work together as a team and regardless of the threat there’s a job to be done at the end of it.’

All but one of the 17 explosions took place in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand where more than 100 service personnel perished.

The father of two, from Cheltenham, was recognised for his bravery when he was among 100 British troops deployed to Sangin to help Afghan forces repel a major Taliban offensive.

After coming under fire, the Afghan general leading the operation and Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bewick, the British officer advising him, sought refuge in a mud-walled compound. When WO1 Hyde reached the scene, he suspected it was a trap.

‘It had significant battle damage on it and I know the tell-tale signs of where IEDs are planted by insurgents,’ he said. ‘I wanted [Lt Col Bewick] out of there, and the only way was to go and get him.’

As he waited for Lt Col Bewick in a narrow alleyway, an Afghan soldier walked past him and triggered a concealed bomb just a few feet away. WO1 Hyde said: ‘The Afghan soldier lost a leg and I got some fragmentation to my hand, neck and stomach – superficial stuff, but I was lucky.

Unflappable: The Warrant Officer Class 1 received a gallantry medal from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace yesterday for saving his colleagues while he lay wounded 

‘It bloody hurt. I thought I had lost my leg, but fortunately it was still there once the dust had settled.’

Despite lying wounded on the ground, he arranged for troops to be removed by helicopter and avoided any more casualties. His citation said he had shown ‘personal gallantry’ and an ‘immense sense of responsibility’.

WO1 Hyde had already survived 11 IEDs in vehicles, and two on foot patrol. His Mastiff armoured troop carrier was twice hit by rockets, and he was also hit by an IED while serving in Iraq.

The soldier, who has a son Henry and daughter Evie, said: ‘My family don’t want me to go back.’
