Former Newcastle United striker Micky Quinn has revealed to would 'walk' to St James' Park in order to become the club's manager - and admitted he longed for a Geordie to be back in the Magpies dugout.

Alan Pardew is close to leaving the North East in order to take over at Crystal Palace, his former club.

And that means Newcastle owner Mike Ashley will be looking for a new manager for the first time in more than four years, with ex-Magpies forward Quinn admitting he would love to be the man to take over from Pardew.

Quinn, who scored 59 league goals in 115 appearances for the Magpies between 1989 and 1992, tweeted: 'I would walk to @NUFC to manage the club, sadly it won't happen.

'But I would love a Geordie to manage this fantastic club and supporters again.'

A compensation package of £2million has been agreed between Palace and Newcastle for Pardew to move to south London, and the deal looks set to be completed imminently.
