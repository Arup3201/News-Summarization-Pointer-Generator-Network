Julie Anne Culp wanted to give her students a lesson in internet safety - now she has a cult following.

Keen to show how quickly an image can go viral, the Tennessee school counselor posted a picture of herself to her Facebook page on November 18 and asked people to 'like' it.

In less than two weeks, it has been 'liked' millions of times and shared on tens of thousands of Facebook pages globally.

Education: Tennessee teacher Julie Anne Culp posted this note on her Facebook page on November 18 to teach her students about internet safety. It has received more than 392,000 likes and been shared more than 30,400 times

Culp, a teacher at Indian Lake Elementary in Hendersonville, posted a picture of herself holding a note: 'I'm talking to my 5th grade students about internet safety and how quickly a photo can be seen by lots of people. If you are reading this, please click 'LIKE'. Thanks!'

Her post has been liked more than 392,000 times and shared more than 30,000 times.

The views skyrocketed when country radio personalities Tige and Daniel shared Culp's post on their own page on November 26.

The re-post has received more than 3.8 million likes and been shared more than 91,000 times.

A November 24 Facebook re-post by humanitarian social club Society's Choice has attracted nearly one million likes.

And, like all internet sensations, Culp's successful post has been Photoshopped numerous times and circulated on Reddit and imgur.

Thousands of Facebook users have congratulated the newlywed on her 'ingenious' social experiment.

One user wrote: 'Thank
 you for all you do. This is a very important "common sense" lesson that
 many educators forget in the process of learning to use this valuable 
tool.'

Another said: 'Great idea! I have a 5th grader! It's so hard to get that concept across to them!'

Culp has been overwhelmed by the response, which she plans to analyze.

'There are currently over 12,000 comments on this photo. WOW,' she wrote on her Facebook page on November 22.

'Thanks again for everyone for helping bring attention to this issue. I will continue to post updates/information on this page, and plan to do a full write-up in the near future.'

However, internet users have noted that Culp has effectively sacrificed her privacy to educate her students.

A number of images on Culp's Facebook page are accessible and private information can be found online.

Culp, who recently married her husband Joshua Culp after meeting online, has three dogs and likes knitting. She grew up in Brentwood, Tennessee.

Educating young students about Internet security has become commonplace in schools, Huffington Post reported.

According to Reuters, while Facebook enforces an age minimum of 13 
years old, as of 2012, there were 5.6 million Facebook users in 
violation of that rule.

Many young kids also have Instagram, even though the social network has the same age minimum.
