They say you should never work with children and animals, but this hospital visit proves they are a winning combination.

For National Children’s Week, a squad of cute and cuddly native wildlife were brought into Melbourne's Monash Children’s Hospital to put a smile on the faces of the sick children in the wards.

Baby animals, feathered friends and native wildlife went on an excursion from Healesville Sanctuary to meet with some of their littlest friends.

It was a very special day for some little children who are otherwise too sick to visit the zoo - and some so young it was their first time seeing such exciting critters.

It’s hoped the animals will bring some laughter and fun to wards, celebrating every young person’s right to childhood.

‘This is the fourth year we’ve brought some of our native wildlife to the wards of Monash Children;s Hospital and we’re thrilled to make the trip again,’ said Mr Glen Holland, Director of Healesville Sanctuary.

‘We had a great time meeting the children and introducing our adorable friends to them,’ said a representative from Zoos Victoria.

Professor Nick Freezer, Director of Monash Children’s Hospital, said the critters’ visit was eagerly anticipated.

“Kids deserve a distraction from the reason they’re in hospital,” Professor Freezer said. “The children all know that tomorrow is the day the animals come to visit, and they’re all incredibly excited.”

National Children’s Week is holding events around the country to focus on the needs and achievements of every child in Austalia.

The campaign urges Australians to have a greater awareness and response to the plight of every child.

The new Monash Children’s Hospital is currently under construction, creating a space that will allow for more activities and engagement for the children – including a space for animal visits and wildlife education sessions
