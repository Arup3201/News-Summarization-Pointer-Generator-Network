A dog that fell 15 stories inside the exhaust shaft of a Fort Lauderdale building on Friday night has survived and seems to be making a recovery.

Susie was with owner Elaine Caralis at a friend's 16th-floor apartment before she fell through the friend's closet, CNN reported.

Reunited: Owner Elaine Caralis is seen here with her Maltipoo Susie, who fell 15 stories inside the exhaust shaft

'(Susie) walked into (her) closet and fell down into the exhaust shaft,' Caralis told the channel.

'I don't have children so Susie is my life, Susie is my family,' she added. 'They treated it like they were searching for a human being.'

Firefighters 'cut holes above and below the second floor to try to get (to Susie),' Deputy Fire Chief Timothy Heiser told CNN, and were able to retrieve the trapped pooch.

They 'eventually managed to get close enough to the pup to remove her from the shaft before she could fall any further,' Heiser added.

Rescue: Firefighters were able to cut a hole in the wall and rescue Susie

Once safely retrieved, Susie was transported to Oakland Park Hospital and treated by Dr. Spencer Ratnoff.

'I did put dog on IVs that stabilized dog from trauma and then we ran some diagnostic tests and x-rays to see the extent of the injuries,' he told CBSMiami.

'[...]The miracle of miracles is the dog has sustained as few injuries as it has some lacerations but no broken bones and no serious internal injuries,' he added.
