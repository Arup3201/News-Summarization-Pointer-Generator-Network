Left for dead: Arturo Martinez was critically injured in the April 15 violence that claimed the lives of his wife Ignacia and daughter Karla

The sole survivor of a brutal home invasion attack in which his wife and daughter were murdered is home from the hospital, nearly a month after the horrific attack.

Arturo Martinez was left for dead in the April 15 violence at his family’s Las Vegas home that claimed the lives of his wife Ignacia, 38, and daughter Karla, 10.

Ignacia Martinez and her daughter were bludgeoned to death. Young Karla had also been raped.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Arturo Martinez suffered at least 17 skull fractures, and now faces a long recovery process, but his family is thankful that he will survive.

His sister, Gaudia Martinez-Seal, told the Review-Journal: 'It's a miracle that God gave him back to us.'

About a week after the gruesome murders, cops arrested 22-year-old Bryan Clay, who police believe was involved in the sexual assault of a 50-year-old woman the day before the murders.

Clay was charged on May 2 with murder, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault.

DNA evidence is believed to link Clay to both cases.

Mr Martinez’s two sons, ages 9 and 4, were also in the home at the time, but were not harmed, in what police described to ABC 13 as a ‘drug-fuelled crime spree.’

Police made the terrifying discovery on 
April 16, after the 9-year-old showed up at his school that morning and 
told officials there that his mother and sister were dead.

At a subsequent news conference, Lt. Ray Steiber of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police's homicide division said: 'I've been doing this 24 years and this is the case you hope you never see.'

The killings sent shockwaves through the
community, especially at the Real KO Boxing Club in North Las Vegas, 
where both Arturo and Ignacia Martinez worked and were viewed as 
positive role models.

Those who knew them say that the couple, both trained fighters, would not have gone quietly if attacked or robbed.

Felipe Lazos, a 16-year-old who trained at Real KO Boxing, told the Review-Journal that the attacker would have 'had to be a good fighter.'

Neighbor Lucinda Jackson-Griffin said she
had never heard disturbances at the home until she was woken by what 
she said sounded like gunshots on Monday morning.

Another neighbour, Juliana Maqueda-Perez, said she heard a man screaming in English and a child crying in the early hours of the morning, the Review-Journal reported.

'I walked past there every day,' neighbour Dick Webb, 82, said about the house.

He said he had walked past the house less than 90 minutes before the boy arrived at school but hadn't seen anything amiss.
