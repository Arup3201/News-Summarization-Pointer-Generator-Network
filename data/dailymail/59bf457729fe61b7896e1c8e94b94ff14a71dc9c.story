He might be a 'little more than halfway' to reaching his weight loss goal, but image experts claim New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is still too fat to run for President.

The 51-year-old has shed a dramatic amount of weight after undergoing lap-band surgery in February, following relentless taunts about his girth.

But image expert Sylvie di Giusto claims Christie would be taken more seriously as a Presidential candidate if he continued to drop the pounds.

Before and after: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie reportedly weighed more than 330 pounds before lap-band surgery in February (left, pictured in March 2011). He claims he is now half-way to his goal weight (right, pictured November 5)

'You will see a huge difference in his face actually and the face is always important for politicians you cannot hide anything in the face,' she told My9NJ.

'What voters want to see is action and discipline. If he cannot control himself, how can he ever control anything else.

'He not only has to prepare himself, there are other people involved, and I'm wondering for example if
 his wife Mary Pat is a potential First Lady?

'Not right now. Right now she doesn’t show that 
professional appearance and attitude, he has to make sure that if he 
runs for president in a few years that he will start preparing the team 
right now.'

Despite the charismatic leader's 
landslide re-election victory in October, commentators have consistently
 questioned Christie's chances as a potential GOP presidential contender
 in 2016.

Much of the focus has been on the Governor's body size. 

While Christie has never disclosed his weight, New Republic guessed he weighed about 334 pounds in 2011.

Last month, an unflattering silhouette of Chris Christie on the cover of Time magazine with the title, 'The Elephant in the Room', appeared to mock the Governor's weight.

And even Mitt Romney reportedly made fun of the generously-proportioned Republican, and allegedly didn't choose him as his presidential running mate because of concerns about his health.

However Christie has repeatedly assured the public that he has no  problem handling the rigors of a presidential campaign.

He recently told the New York Times he felt healthier after his recent weight-loss.

'I sleep better. I didn’t realize how badly I was sleeping being that much overweight,' he said.

'This surgery really causes you to have a new way to eat - it really does.

'It teaches you a new way to eat, and that’s a process over a period of time to get used to. And I’m still not completely used to it.'
