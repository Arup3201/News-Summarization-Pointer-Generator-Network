In the Barclays Premier League, the margins remain very fine.

Here, Manchester City were not at their best but they won. Newcastle, on the other hand, began what may yet be a testing season competitively and earnestly but could not find way to bring a save from City goalkeeper Joe Hart.

City's two goals were easy on the eye even if they were not generally in keeping with a performance that was more reliant on muscle than magic.

They were good enough, though, and that is the point.

Many have tipped Chelsea to edge Manuel Pellegrini's team to the title. Certainly the London club will be stronger this season.

Nevertheless, Pellegrini would appear to have bought astutely this summer leaving City stronger in two key positions, at the heart of their midfield and their defence.

On Sunday they settled an interesting contest only in the second minute of added time and that period of play perhaps summed up the difference between the teams on this occasion.

City looked rather short of complete fitness as the game wore on – something that Pellegrini alluded to later – and were under some pressure in the closing stages.

When the lively Newcastle midfielder Remy Cabella provided an opportunity for Moussa Sissoko in the 90th minute, however, his team-mate could only direct a rather wild shot over the crossbar from 18 yards.

A goal then and Newcastle would have had a point they probably deserved.

As it was, City broke on Alan Pardew's team quickly and when the impressive debutant Fernando played Sergio Aguero in down the left, the substitute brought a parry from Tim Krul with his first shot and controlled the rebound well enough to find the far corner.

Arguably, that chance was tougher than Sissoko's but it fell to one of the best goal scorers in the world and that, for managers trying to solve problems like Pardew, is the frustration.

Up front for Newcastle was one of four starting debutants, the Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere. The 24-year-old ran hard and was game enough but looked limited.

City, on the other hand, benefited from the expertise of Edin Dzeko – due to sign a new contract this week – and the gentle improvement of the gifted Stevan Jovetic. On occasions like this, it makes the difference.

'They have world class players everywhere,' said Pardew afterwards. 'At times they make it look like the world has stopped.'

Certainly City produced an opening goal in the 39th minute that turned the Newcastle defence to stone.

Prior to that the champions had played efficient football and Krul had saved competently from Dzeko in the third minute and from Samir Nasri's half volley soon after.

In 23 season since the Premier League started, the title-holders have never lost and opening game - there have been 20 wins and three draws.

The Dutch goalkeeper had little chance just before half-time, though.

Yaya Toure's long pass found the Newcastle defence fractionally light on concentration but Dzeko's first time back heel in to the path of David Silva was testimony to perfect vision and technique and City's Spaniard found the corner comfortably.

Up until this point, Newcastle had struggled to trouble City.

Central players Vurnon Anita and Jack Colback were enjoying decent games and Cabella – another Frenchman – was already in to his stride, scampering across the dimensions of the field imaginatively.

Newcastle couldn't find anything approaching a final pass, though, and as half-time arrived it already looked a long way back.

City's intensity soon dropped, however. Physically, they were not the same team after the interval and Newcastle sough to profit.

As time passed, the home team certainly began to push City back. Cabella's influence increased and Pellegrini's team began to look for full-time if not desperately then certainly enthusiastically.

Yoan Gouffran dallied over one chance from a corner before young left-back Paul Dummett beat Joe Hart to another cross only to head over the bar from seven yards.

It was at the death, though, that City's defensive resolution was really tested and substitute Ayoze Perez looked certain to equalise after turning beautifully inside two defenders only for Fernando to apply a crucial defensive touch and divert the shot wide.

Pardew called it an 'unbelievable tackle' and he wasn't wrong. Pellegrini, meanwhile, was happy to head in to next Monday's game at home to Liverpool with points already in the bag.

'I thought we played very well, especially in the first half,' said the City manager.

'In the second half, we did not have so much possession of our ball because seven of our ten outfield players were not really fit enough to last 90 minutes at the same pace.

'We only need to have the same attitude as we showed today and the same hunger for glory that we have started the season with to have a chance.

'I am sure this squad can fight for the title again.'

Only a fool would argue.

Tribute: Fabricio Coloccini (centre) lays wreaths and greets family members of Newcastle fans John Alder and Liam Sweeney, killed on Flight MH17

Poignant: A banner from Manchester City supporters dedicated to the two Newcastle fans who died on Flight MH17

An impeccable and touching tribute was paid to the two Newcastle fans killed in the MH17 air disaster. Liam Sweeney and John Alder, who were on their way to watch their team in New Zealand, were remembered with a minute's silence, while captains Fabricio Coloccini and Vincent Kompany laid wreaths on the pitch and stood alongside family members during the tribute. Supporters then applauded for the duration of the 17th minute.

It was only last season that Alan Pardew hurled an expletive-laden insult at Manuel Pellegrini. '****ing old ****' was his charming remark. This time, however, the pair shared a friendly handshake, kept their distance during the game and Pardew even invited Pellegrini for a glass of wine afterwards.

Perhaps the best-timed run of the day came from a pitch invader who waited until the chaos of full-time before entering the field and making for Sergio Aguero. The City fan then enjoyed a 30-second conversation with his hero before security intervened. But whatever he said must have worked, for Aguero led the fan to the away dug-out where he was rewarded for his endeavour with a piece of training kit.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was at St James' Park having stayed away for the majority of matches last season. And it looked as if the billionaire was enjoying himself — TV pictures showed him laughing raucously with a pal despite his side trailing in the second half. Ashley  has been a target for fans in recent times, but he will be hoping their anger subsides this season after he provided Pardew with £40million to spend on new players.
