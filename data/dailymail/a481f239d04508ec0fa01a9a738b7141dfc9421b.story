This groovy gibbon's funky dance moves cannot fail to bring a smile to the face.

The cheeky little ape was spotted boogieing her way over a grassy floor at Khao Kheow Zoo, Thailand, waving her arms as she went.

Gollum, who is clearly a star in the making, was even happy to pause briefly and pose for the camera with a flower in her mouth.

Wildlife photographer Ashley Vincent, 48, said the white-handed one-year-old had stolen his heart.

Mr Vincent, from London, said: 'Little Gollum has some delightful expressions.

'Her inquisitive and exploratory nature had me smiling, chuckling and laughing out loud.

'Her playful behaviour would be enough to melt anyone's heart.'

Gibbons spend most of their time up in the trees, and have the longest arms of all primates.

When walking on the ground, they hold them above their heads for balance, which is why Gollum appears to be jiving around her home in Chonburi Province.

The zoo is home to 20 gibbons across four species.

Under the supervision of a veterinary assistant, Mr Vincent photographed Gollum as she relaxed near some trees.

The married father of one teenage daughter  moved to Thailand more than 20 years ago, and now takes photos of the zoo's youngest animals to help document their growth and development.

It looks like this giddy gibbon is developing so fast she'll soon be showing off her swing dancing.
