A shipwrecked sailor who had been adrift in the Pacific for 16 months has told rescuers he drank turtles’ blood and ate seabirds to survive.

Jose Ivan and his battered 24ft fibreglass boat with propellerless engines washed ashore on a remote coral atoll this week.

He says that after the engine cut out in September 2012, he drifted more than 8,000 miles from his home in Mexico to Ebon Atoll.

When he was spotted stranded on a reef by locals, he was long-haired, emaciated and dressed only in ragged underpants.

The Mexican told rescuers he had left his homeland for El Salvador with a companion, who had died at sea several months ago.

No fishing gear was on the boat and Mr Ivan – who speaks only Spanish – indicated that he had caught turtles and birds with his bare hands, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology research student on Ebon.

She said the details of his ordeal were ‘sketchy’ but there had been a turtle on the boat when it landed at Ebon – part of the largely English-speaking Marshall Islands chain.

‘His condition isn’t good, but he’s getting better,’ she said. Mr Ivan had had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but was now gaining strength.

Locals are caring him until he can be taken to the main island in the atoll, to be interviewed by Foreign Ministry officials.

'The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,' Ms Fjelstad added.

Stories of survival in the vast Pacific are not uncommon. In
 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were 
discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall 
Islands, in the middle of the ocean in their stricken boat, nine months 
after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition.

They survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the bible.

And in 1992, two fishermen from Kiribati were at sea for 177 days before coming ashore in Samoa.

According to Fjeldstad, the Marshall Islanders who found Ivan took him to the main island on the atoll, which is so remote there is only one phone line at the local council house and no Internet, to meet Mayor Ione de Brum, who put in a call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro.

Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Friday they were waiting to get more details and for the man to be brought to Majuro.

The government airline's only plane that can land at Ebon is currently down for maintenance and is not expected to return to service until Tuesday at the earliest, with officials considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway.

But he did not appear to have any life-threatening illness and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island.

The Marshall Islands, in the northern Pacific, are home to barely 60,000 people spread over 24 atolls, with most of them standing at an average of just two metres above sea level.
