Struggling French side Bastia have fired Claude Makelele after less than six months in charge.

The former midfield general, who was part of the France team that lost the 2006 World Cup final to Italy, took over this season after a two-and-half year spell as assistant coach at Paris Saint-Germain.

But after just 12 games in charge of the French side and them lying second bottom of Ligue 1, Makelele has been relieved of his duties.

Makelele oversaw just two league victories in charge of Bastia, with their sixth defeat of the campaign against Guingamp on Saturday the final nail in the coffin of the former Chelsea midfielder's reign.

An official statement on the club's official website read: 'Bastia board advise all supporters and partners that Mr Claude Makelele is no longer the coach of Sporting Club de Bastia.'

Makelele is the first coach to be fired in the French first division this season, and has been replaced on a temporary basis by Ghislain Printant and Herve Sekli.
