The world's tallest statue of former pontiff Pope John Paul II has been unveiled today in Poland.

Businessman Leszek Lyson funded the 45ft statue in gratitude to Pope John Paul II because he believes the former pope intervened in saving his son from drowning during a family holiday in Croatia in 2010.

The statue, which weighs five tonnes and is made of white fibreglass, shows the pope standing with outstretched arms with a gold cross around his neck.

Archbishop Waclaw Depo unveiled the 45ft white fiberglass statue of Pope John Paul II, funded by businessman Leszek Lyson, in gratitude for what he believes was an intervention by the late pontiff in saving his drowning son

The 45ft statue of John Paul II is thought to be the tallest in the world, trumping a 40ft model in Chile

The monument stands on a hill above the city of Czestochowa, famous for the Jasna Gora monastery, and its icon of the Black Madonna  which is believed to work miracles.

It is situated in a miniature park, which holds models of sacred sites like Lourdes in France.

In 1920 Pope John Paul II was born Karol Wojtyla in Wadowice, Poland.

He was the first non-Italian pope to be elected for 450 years, as the Archbishop of Krakow at the age of 58.

He visiited 120 
countries in a 27-year pontificate and became known as a freedom fighter.

In 2005 he died aged 84after a long illness.

In 2011 he was was beatified - the penultimate step towards sainthood - after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints attributed a mircale to him.

At the unveiling ceremony an actor read fragments of texts written by the late pope, who died in 2005, before a children's choir sang.

Later the Archbishop Waclaw Depo of Czestochowa blessed the statue.

Mr Lyson met the pope, who was named Karol Wojtyla  before he rose to his title, in the 1960s.

He said the new statue surpasses the 40ft shrine to John Paul II in Chile.

Since his death, the pope has become a cult figure among Poland's Catholics who expect him to be made a saint.

In Poland 90 per cent of the 38 million population are Catholic, making it one of Europe's most devout countries.

Poland also is home to the tallest statue of Christ, a 118ftÂ  monument
that was erected in the western town of Swiebodzin two years ago.
