Living constantly under threat of insurgent attacks, sweeping sandstorms and blistering desert heat, life on Camp Bastion is an uncertain existence.

But there is at least one thing troops can always be sure of... they will never run out of chips for dinner.

A new exhibition has lifted the lid on what life is really like for soldiers stationed on Britain's largest overseas Army base built since the Second World War.

Scroll down for video

The Mess: In 2011 they ate 7.5 tonnes of chips every week - the same weight of a double-decker bus

Camp Tombstone: Aside from insurgent attacks, soldiers on Bastion live under constant threat of blinding sandstorms that can sweep in in the blink of an eye

Mountain of food: One of the most challenging tasks is feeding the 28,000 personnel at the base - and they need a lot more than a lot of chips

And to get an idea of quite what it takes to keep the 28,000 personnel's energy up, consider that in 2011 they ate 7.5 tonnes of chips every week - the same weight of a double-decker bus.

In short, Camp Bastion - which is the size of Reading, only in the Afghan desert - exists to support troops fighting on the frontline.

From keeping thousands of soldiers hydrated in temperatures exceeding 50C, to the complexities of moving equipment, ammunition and supplies around the war torn Helmand Province, IWM London’s new display War Story: Supplying Frontline Afghanistan takes the visitors behind the scenes to reveal the challenges of supporting and maintaining troops on the frontline.

Staying in touch: Beyond the huge amount of fuel and equipment that is ferried into Camp Bastion each day, 30 tonnes of mail arrive there every week

The modern soldier is issued with more kit and equipment than ever before.

It’s
the job of logisticians, battling a landlocked, stifling hot and 
hostile country with poor infrastructure and a deep history of conflict,
to ensure that specialist equipment, as well as the basics such as 
food, water and morale boosting mail from home, reaches the troops on 
the ground.

This new display follows the journey and logistical challenges from RAF Brize Norton in the UK to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan and on to the Forward Operating Bases and Patrol Bases on the frontline.

Visitors can put their skills to the test to see if they have what it takes to keep the frontline supplied in our interactive logistics challenge.

War Story: Supplying Frontline Afghanistan features brand new materials including photographs, interviews and time lapse footage collected by IWM staff on a series of expeditions to Afghanistan in 2012 and 2013.

In conjunction with the Ministry of 
Defence, IWM’s War Story project started in 2009, offering British 
personnel an opportunity to record their role and preserve their 
personal accounts and experiences of the current conflict in Afghanistan
in IWM’s unrivalled national collections for future generations.

Since
the project began, over 1,600 soldiers and family members from over 75 
regiments have registered to share their stories and there are already 
over 70 interviews in IWM’s sound archive and over 700 objects from the 
conflict have become part of IWM’s collections.

Diane
Lees, Director-General of IWM, said: 'IWM has been collecting personal 
stories of conflict in the form of letters, diaries, photographs and 
objects since the First World War.

'Nearly 100 years on staff and curators from IWM went out to the frontline once more to collect and record stories of war to preserve them in our collections so that future generations can know more about serving personnel’s experiences of the conflict.'

Air Commodore John Bessell, Commander Joint Force Support (Afghanistan), added: 'It is about the people, and by the people – the chance for them to tell their story in their own words, and pictures and things.

'This is about dedicated people making an often unseen but vital difference to the future of Afghanistan.'
