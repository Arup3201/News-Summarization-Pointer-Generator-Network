The British banker accused of brutally murdering two women in his luxury Hong Kong apartment allegedly invited another woman back to his flat prior to the killings but was turned down by her because she thought he was 'acting strangely'.

Rurik Jutting, 29, invited the Indonesian nanny, who wishes to remain anonymous, back to his flat in the early hours of last Saturday – just two hours before police arrived at his home and found the decomposing body of one woman and another with stab wounds to her throat and buttock.

The Cambridge graduate, who worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), has since been charged with the murders of the two women – revealed to be 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, who also goes by the name Jesse Lorena Ruri, and 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih.

Jutting (pictured  being taken to a Hong Kong court by police) allegedly chatted up an Indonesian nanny just hours prior to his arrest for the murder of two women after whose bodies were found in his luxury apartment

The former public schoolboy, who did not enter a plea when he was charged on Monday, was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the  Makati Pub & Disco.

It was at the nightclub prior to his arrest that he allegedly began chatting to the mother of three, who has lived in the former British colony for four years and works as a nanny for a Hong Kong Chinese family.

She claimed he approached her and a friend at the bar and said 'Hi, girls. Where are you from? How old are you?', before buying a round of drinks for them.

After just minutes of chatting, he allegedly asked the nanny to return to his apartment with him but she said she denied his request because of his 'strange' behaviour.

She told The Telegraph: 'I said, "No, I'm with my friends. I'm just here to party with my friends."

'He was just walking around and around and around.

'It was strange. I didn't understand why. He looked happy but I didn't understand why he was moving around all the time.'

The woman, who is believed to be in her thirties, said she had witnessed Jutting pacing the club, occasionally grabbing women, before he approached her.

Her comments come after it was revealed Jutting contacted his ex-girlfriend Ariane Guarin last month asking if she would fly out to visit him in Hong Kong.

The message sent to the 22-year-old nightclub hostess from the Philippines was abrupt and to the point. 

It simply said: ‘Did you get your passport? If so, do you want to come to Hong Kong this weekend? And stay the week?.'

Miss Guarin, who had a six-month relationship with Jutting, said she felt 'lucky' not to have flown out to stay with him. 

She said: ‘I had a problem applying for my passport because I don’t have a valid identity card. 

'He wanted me to stay for a week with him but I couldn’t go without a passport.

'I feel lucky. I am really thankful that it wasn’t me.’ 

Earlier today, more than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims, who were both sex workers in Hong Kong's red light district.

Ms Ningsih's cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen her relative in August in their home village in Indonesia.

Prior to his arrest, Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, sent a message to his former girlfriend of six months, Ariane Guarin (pictured together above), asking her to fly over to Hong Kong to visit him for a week

Jumiati, who goes by only one name, said she called police about a week ago to report that her cousin was missing and was later asked to identify her body.

'I hope the killer will be punished and will feel the same as what has been done to my cousin,' she said at the vigil.

Susiati, a friend of the victim, broke down in tears as she remembered Ms Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son back home.

'I have lost my best friend, and I am devastated,' she said.

Several in the crowd held signs demanding reforms to Hong Kong and Indonesian laws governing how domestic workers can find work and how long they can stay in the city.
