British Airways and Iberia have become the latest airlines to offer a small holding fee that caters to travellers who need more time to decide before booking a trip.

With a deposit of up to £10, customers can lock their flights and the price for up to 72 hours before booking.

The deposit for short-haul flights is £5 per person, while the fee for long-haul flights is £10 per person.

Hold on: British Airways has introduced a small fee that allows customers to put a hold on certain flights

The fee is refunded once the seats are paid for, but customers will lose their deposits if trips are not booked within three days.

The price will not go up while the flights are held, British Airways said.

If the price jumps while the booking is on hold, British Airways will cover the difference. If the taxes, fees and charges drop, the customer will pay the lower price.

Some planning is required because the holding fee is not available for flights departing within 21 days. It does not apply to bookings including infants.

The holding fee is not available for all flights offered by British Airways and Iberia, however.

Family getaway: The holding fee could mean cheaper getaways

Twenty British Airways destinations are currently excluded, including Argentina, Barbados, Egypt, India, Israel, Mexico, Syria and Pakistan.

Colombia, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Haiti are among the 16 Iberia destinations that are ineligible.

Drew Crawley, British Airways’ chief commercial officer, said: ‘There’s nothing more frustrating than seeing a great flight price but not being able to book it straight away, either because you may need to get the time off work or check it’s ok with family or friends – then coming back and finding there are no seats left or the price has changed.

‘Now customers can see the price, hold their seats and be sure that’s all they’ll pay, up to three days later.'
