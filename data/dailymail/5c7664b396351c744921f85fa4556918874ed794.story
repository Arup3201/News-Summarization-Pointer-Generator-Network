Brits have been facing an obesity crisis for years but now help is at hand in the shape of fit and toned personal trainer Jessie Pavelka.

The L.A. based 30-year-old has been helping Americans with their battle with the bulge and now he's come to the UK to offer his advice on the Sky TV show Fat: The Fight For My Life.

On the programme, Jessie meets morbidly obese Brits and advises them how they can shape up and change their lives.

Fat fighter: Jessie Pavelka advocates a healthy lifestyle

Love to workout: The weightloss expert wants people to embrace exercise and the way it can make them feel

He told the MailOnline: 'For many of them, it was almost as if they had given up. They had tried gimmick diets that just weren't working. My approach is not to just cut food but to get active. In doing so, you then feel better about yourself.'

He added: 'It's great when my clients lose weight but I also want to change how they feel about themselves.'

Sport has always been a huge part of Jessie's life and he was a bodybuilder before moving into a career as a weightloss expert.

Stuck in a body she didn't like: Alison was 26 stone before she followed Jessie's advice

Get active: Jessie taught Alison to face her fears and push her boundaries to try new things

Turned a corner: She has lost 9st, right, and never felt happier

He trains every day doing interval sessions, resistance training and running. But he said people don't have to do as much exercise as he does to notice the benefits.

He said: 'The first thing I tell clients is get off the couch! Just start making some small lifestyle changes such as walking to work instead of driving or taking the stairs instead of the lift. The small things you can change all add up.'

Jessie recommended the participants on Fat: The Fight For My Life to try these sort of lifestyle changes. He also got them to do low impact resistance training before making them push themselves harder through exercise alongside healthier eating.

New horizons: Jeni also lost 9st, right, with Jessie's help and now wants to start a family

He worked with each of them over a year, in person when he was in the UK and then via Skype.

He said: 'They all had to be vulnerable and open to change. They had to trust me. My aim was to get them to fall in love with exercise and the freedom it gives you. It helps you feel good about yourself and it also means you can treat yourself to the odd burger because you've earned it.'

The Brits who Jessie helped shed the pounds included Alison, a comfort eater who had ballooned to 26st. She would drive a mile from her home to her workplace at a petrol station where she would be sedentary all day.

Jessie said: 'Alison had never challenged herself, she needed to step outside her boundaries and face her fears.'

Simple to shape up: Jessie said small changes can go a long way in making a difference to your health

Alison summed up her situation as a 'hopeless place to be, stuck in a body that you don't like.'

She added: 'A lot of the time I didn't think about my size or the weight I was, because I think if I did I'd never leave the house.'

Jessie got Alison to face up to her size and the fact that it meant she was in danger of developing major health problems such as diabetes.

He got her to take simple steps such as walking to and from work instead of driving and pushing herself with workouts including boxing - as well as cutting out the junk food she usually consumed.

Seven months later she lost 9st and 3lbs and has never felt better. She said: 'You've no idea how glad I am that I started this journey - there's no words to explain how lucky I feel and how proud I am that I've done it and seen it through. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but easily the most rewardingâ€™.

Also featured on the progamme is Jeni who, with Jessie's help, dropped from 22st to 12st and now hopes to fulfill her dream of starting a family - as her size had been a barrier to getting fertility treatment.

Jessie said it's rewarding seeing how much his clients change - not just physically but emotionally.He said: 'There were times on the programme where they all resisted my advice or were frustrated but the transformation they have all made is amazing, just from leading a more healthy lifestyle.'The TV programme shows the dark and light sides of their journeys and the real rewards they gained. I hope it can inspire people watching to think "I can do that."'
