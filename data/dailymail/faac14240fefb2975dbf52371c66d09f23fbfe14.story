Almost 70,000 blue badges and 100,000 bus passes have been confiscated as part of a huge drive to detect fraud by cross-checking official records.

The travel scams form part of more than £1billion found to have been lost to fraud by the Audit Commission’s National Fraud Initiative (NFI).

Since it was launched in 1996, the NFI has also detected 15,000 cases of pension overpayments worth £450million, over £250million of housing benefit overpayments as well as incorrectly awarded single person council tax discounts amounting to £160million.

Confiscations: The National Fraud Initiative has found far too many motorists have been claiming disabled badges for parking

The initiative compares data held by 1,300 public sector and 77 private sector organisations such as councils, the police, government departments and hospitals.

It aims to identify potentially fraudulent claims, errors and overpayments.

Where inconsistencies are found between two or more sets of data - for example, when data matching shows a person listed as dead also being in receipt of a pension - the relevant body will investigate and, if appropriate, stop pension payments.

So far, 68,736 blue badges and 97,361 concessionary travel passes have been cancelled as a result of investigations carried out by local authorities after the NFI raised concerns.

Around half of those motorists or travellers were caught during 2010/11, the most recent ‘matching’ period for which statistics are available.

During that time, 32,633 ‘disabled’ motorists and 52,635 bus travellers had their passes withdrawn. They included a woman from Bromley, south London, who was convicted of fraud after she was found to have been using the blue badge belonging to her deceased mother. The woman was fined £181.

Abuse: So far 68,736 blue badges have been cancelled after local investigations

In 2008, a review of data relating to concessionary travel passes found that a husband had claimed travel tokens on behalf of his wife for at least the previous seven years - even though the wife had died in 1991. Portsmouth City Council recovered the remaining travel tokens and the value of the previous years’ tokens.

While most of the frauds relate to pensions, council tax and housing benefit, the most recent two-yearly round of cross-referencing also uncovered 164 people with no legal right to work in the UK.

The employees - working for organisations such as the NHS, local authorities and housing associations and either failed asylum seekers, working without a visa or on an expired visa - were subsequently dismissed or asked to resign.

They were uncovered after the NFI matched data from the Border Agency against data on housing benefit claims, payroll records and housing tenancy.

Crackdown: 97,361 concessionary travel passes have been cancelled

Jeremy Newman, Chairman of the Audit Commission, said: ‘The NFI is a powerful weapon in the fight to protect taxpayers’ money from fraud.

‘I applaud the commitment of the scheme’s participants.

‘The vigilance of organisations from local councils to central government departments, supplying essential data and investigating potential frauds flagged up by the initiative, has paid off to the tune of £1 billion.

‘We are working hard to ensure this valuable legacy of the Audit Commission continues to benefit the public.’

The Audit Commission said that the £1billion total fraud detection figure includes ‘estimated outcomes’ where it is possible to ‘assume that fraud, overpayments and error would have continued undetected without NFI data matching’, as well as the total value of frauds already detected.
