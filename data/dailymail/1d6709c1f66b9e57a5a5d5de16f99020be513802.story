Michael Dawson is confident Hull have the squad depth to cope with their bruising encounter at Arsenal.

The Tigers expanded their squad in the summer to cope with the demands of the Europa League although an early exit from that competition has left several senior players struggling for game time.

But that could change following Saturday's 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium, which saw Dawson hurt his ankle and goalkeeper Steve Harper join regular number one Allan McGregor on the sidelines with a bicep injury.

Striker Nikica Jelavic also sustained a knee injury in the warm-up, leaving manager Steve Bruce to count the cost ahead of the weekend trip to Liverpool.

And Dawson is sure the players are there to keep Hull's standards up at Anfield.

'The only disappointment (from the weekend) was the injuries we picked up but that is where the squad comes in. We overcame those against Arsenal,' Dawson told the Hull Daily Mail.

'You need a good squad because injuries come along and the manager has built that now. We pick ourselves up and see how we are but there is strength in depth to cope.'

Former Tottenham captain Dawson had been enjoying his return to regular football under Bruce and is hoping not to miss too much football.

'We will have to see how it is in the week. I tried to play on. I got back on the pitch but the swelling was already coming up,' he said.

Striker Nikica Jelavic sustained a knee injury in the warm-up and did not feature against the Gunners 

'I love playing, which is why the ankle injury is so frustrating. Hopefully, it won't be too bad.

'I am loving my time and this is a great club with great lads and a great gaffer. You can't ask for a lot more than that. We also have a good team striving to be successful.'

Alex Bruce and Paul McShane are in line to challenge for Dawson's place in the side, Eldin Jakupovic is set to retain the gloves after coming off the bench against the Gunners, while Sone Aluko or Tom Ince could return to the squad in place of Jelavic.
