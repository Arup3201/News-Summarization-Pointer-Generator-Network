Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has moved to quell rumours that Samuel Eto'o is set to quit the club less than a week after he joined from Everton.

The striker, who joined the Serie A side during the January transfer window, had a disagreement with head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic after he refused to take part in an afternoon training session on Monday.

Mihajlovic scheduled two training sessions that day - one in the morning and another in the afternoon - as punishment for his team's dismal 5-1 defeat against Torino on Sunday.

Eto'o, who came on as a substitute in the 72nd minute during Sunday's game, left after the morning session without telling his manager and reportedly did not return.

'I don't know where he's gone and I don't know what the club intends to do,' Mihajlovic told Gazzetta dello Sport following the incident.

'The only thing that is certain is that the player did not give me any explanation; I consider it to be a serious lack of respect to myself and the rest of the team.

'That's the only truth today, the rest is pure fantasy. There hasn't been a row with Eto'o, simply because you need two people to have an argument and he has done everything on his own.

'I haven't seen him since the morning training and haven't spoken to him either.'

Ferrero, however, has played down the row and insists that the former Everton striker is going nowhere.

'Nothing has happened,' said Ferrero. 'It was just a small argument. An exchange of views if you want.

'We are all calm, the club is united.'

The 33-year-old had spent five months at Everton before joining Sampdoria as a free agent
