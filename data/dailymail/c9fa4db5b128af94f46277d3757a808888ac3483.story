Jodhi Meares has been a prisoner in her own home, suffered 'public humiliation' and considered going overseas to avoid scrutiny since flipping her Range Rover in June, her lawyer claimed in court today as the fashion designer was convicted of drink driving.

Prominent Sydney solicitor Chris Murphy also said Ms Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to James Packer, although it only lasted for two and a half years, lived a modest life and was not a rich celebrity.

Mr Murphy told the court the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over the space of four and a half hours while eating a small piece of lamb before she crashed her car in Bellevue Hill on June 21.

After police arrived at the scene of the accident, she was arrested and recorded a blood alcohol reading of 0.181.

Today Ms Meares pleaded guilty to a charge of high-range drink driving and was fined $1,100 and had her licence suspended for 12 months - a third of the possible penalty for the offence - during an appearance at Waverley Local Court in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Mr Murphy said Ms Meares had not made any money from her label 'The Upside', had had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to a Cambodian orphans charity, the Cambodian Children's Trust.

'Every garment that is sold by that business,  a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said.'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children.

'She has worked all her life. She has a staffof eight people. Six women - three have been pregnant this year. She worries about these people.  She's a good person.'

Mr Murphy also downplayed the worth of Ms Meares' assets.

He said her two-bedroom Pt Piper apartment 'did cost $1 million over ten years ago - but her lifestyle is not ostentation'. He said Ms Meares' crashed vehicle was not worth the $200,000 quoted in the media, but $41,000 and, following the crash, just $2,500.

He said she had been prescribed Beta Blockers for anxiety since her home had been under siege after the accident.

Mr Murphy also tendered character references to the court, including statements from Ms Meares' mother and her rock star partner Jon Stevens, and said of the stress the ordeal had on his client: 'She has been restricted to her house for all but one day'.

Mr Murphy also submitted a traffic report, a document explaining the crash and her intoxication, as well as four photographs from the accident and a character reference from former NSW police assistant commissioner John Laycock.

He tendered the photographs to the court, along with statements which showed how Ms Meares had experienced 'increased opprobrium, public humiliation ... and stress' from the charges because she was well known.

'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said it about it [the marriage],' he said.

'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools.

'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer.

'They were married for two and half years,' she said.

Mr Murphy told the court Ms Meares had virtually been a prisoner in her own home since the crash.

'She has been restricted to her house for all but one day,' he said.

The lawyer also said Ms Meares had contemplated going to live overseas because of intense media attention since the crash.

'The issue has got got so bad with the harassment I am trying to talk her out of leaving Australia,' he said.

Mr Murphy said he had gone to the restaurant and asked them to pour two standard drinks, which he then photographed.

Ms Meares sat with Mr Murphy and two legal associates for her matter to be heard. She earlier at 10.50am wearing a slim - fitting black pantsuit, a plain white shirt and high heeled black stilettos.

She wore her golden tinged dark hair back in a pony tail and looked very tanned.

Police Prosecutor Daniel McMahon told Magistrate Huber he would not argue with the character references or the statements about Ms Meares being restricted to home since the crash, but he would take issue with the traffic report tendered by Mr Murphy and the material relating to Ms Meares' intoxication and her 'state of mind'.

Mr Murphy told the court a 'substantial part of the plea' he was arguing on Jodhi Meares behalf was that 'the one drink per hour rule ... doesn't work for females'.

Mr Murphy tendered scales which purported to show how men and women of particular body weights responded to one drink per hour in terms of blood alcohol readings.

There was no sign of Mr Stevens, the fiancé of Ms Meares. Ms Meares owns the fashion label, The Upside.

An earlier charge of driving while her licence was suspended had been dropped.

Mr Murphy, had applied to the court earlier in the month for an adjournment while he had an expert crash investigator examine Meares' wrecked black Range Rover Sport.

At around 9.45pm on Saturday, June 21 Meares was turning her black Range Rover Sport from New South Head Road into O'Sullivan St, Rose Bay when her vehicle collided with a line of parked cars.

Meares' vehicle then jack-knifed and flipped onto its side and she had to be pulled from the wreckage.

A dazed Meares was attended by paramedics but not taken to hospital.

Magistrate Julie Huber gave Meares one of third of the possible fine and disqualification for high range drink driving, which can incur a maximum fine of $3300, three years' disqualification - and a naxinum of 18 months' jail for a first time offender.

Ms Huber said she took into account Ms Meares' good character, her good driving record and the fact she had been the subject of intense media attention.

She also noted a slightly hidden traffic island the intersection where the crash took place was ' an aggravated feature' of the accident.

'Having said that,' Ms Huber told Meares,  who was standing in the court to receive her sentence,  'had you been driving under the prescribed limit of under .05 the [chance of crashing your car] wpuld have been remote.

'I accept that when you drank you were surprised as to your reading.

'I have to say though, having regard to the level of your reading, it would have been unusual for you not to have been feeling the effects.'

Ms Huber said she also noted that Ms Meares 'being a person of interest to the media you have found yourself in a situation where where you have been unable to leave your home ... and you have had fewer visitors.

After the June accident, police arrested her and took her to Waverley Police Station where she allegedly registered a blood alcohol level of .181, almost four times over the legal limit

'Having said that it's been over a  relatively short period of time.'

She arrived in a black Toyota Kluger four-wheel drive, travelling in the back passenger seat behind Mr Murphy who sat in the front next to a woman driver.

Mr Murphy arrived at Ms Meares' Pt Piper home just before 10.30am in the Kluger to collect her and take her to court.

One woman client at the court took a photograph of Ms Meares inside the building and was immediately admonished by Chris Murphy to delete the image.
