Smartphones are to be subject to extra checks at airport security for airlines flying directly into the U.S. amid fears terrorists could be converting them into 'stealth bombs'.

American officials have called on terminals in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to bring in stricter checks on electronic devices after warning Islamic extremists are making explosives which are undetectable to airport scanners.

U.S. officials have identified iPhones and
 Samsung Galaxy models as the biggest concern as authorities urged passengers to allow extra time to get past the additional measures.

Queues at Manchester Airport on Friday morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners

Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport, with many complaining of delays

An official familiar with the matter said the United States believes that while it is possible there may be some additional delays at security checkpoints, at most major airports passengers will not be seriously inconvenienced.

The official said most passengers taking long-distance flights arrive well in advance of scheduled departures, leaving time for extra screening. But he said the United States could not rule out disruptions in countries where airport infrastructure and security procedures are less sophisticated.

In Britain, where the controls have been implemented for two days, long lines of people have already built up at airports, with passengers taking to Twitter to vent their anger.

Ian Moreno-Melgar, who was trying to get to Belfast this morning for a wedding, tweeted: '“Airports operating normally”. Queuing in the car park for security isn’t normal.'

He added: '[Manchester] staff obviously under a lot of pressure,but no priority or care for passengers potentially missing flight because of security.

'Genuinely awful service from the usually reliable airport today. 90mins in security, no communication about changes to bag searches.'

Chantel McGregor added: 'Ahhhhh bless Manchester airport baggage check, we're finally half way down the queue which started OUTSIDE!'

Another passenger said: 'This is the absolute worst security queue I have ever been in. It's like wading through treacle.'

There were queues at passport controls at Gatwick airport last night after tougher checks were brought in

Passengers wait at Heathrow Airport this morning as security staff carry out more stringent security checks

Last night, Matteo Pescarin posted a 
photo of queues filling a terminal at Gatwick airport's North Terminal as hundreds of 
passengers waited to go through security.

Other
 passengers took the delays with good humor, with David Silvester 
tweeting: 'Just had my croissants x-rayed and then inspected... 
#Airportsecurity'

At Glasgow Airport, passengers said they noticed longer times from previous journeys, having to wait up to 40 minutes in queues.

Norma
 Decent, 59, from Stranraer,  said: 'It seems absolutely ridiculous to 
me. You had to queue to get through the first gate and then queue again 
to put your bags through security.

Ibrahim al-Asiri is the Al-Qaeda bomb-maker thought to be working on the new 'stealth explosives' which have led to the heightened alert

'I understand why they're doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me.'

Laura
 Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, who was traveling with her two children,
 said: 'Normally it only takes about five or 10 minutes, but I think we 
were queuing for about 30 minutes.

'The problem was that lots of things were being taken from people's bags to additional checks - probably because of the tighter control, but it's better to be safe than sorry.'

And Kenny Stafford, 25, from Dumfries, added: 'My lap-top was given an extra check by the security officials. It probably took me about 30 minutes to get through and I had to run to my gate.'

It is feared the scenes could become commonplace during a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that 'cannot be detected' by traditional scanners.

Authorities around the world are introducing tougher checks after U.S. security officials said they fear bombmakers from the Yemen-based 'Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula' (AQAP) group have figured out how to turn phones and other devices into 'undetectable' explosive devices.

American officials also are concerned that hard-to-detect bombs could be built into shoes and have previously raised fears that explosives may be surgically-implanted into extremists' bodies.

Authorities are now hunting a Saudi bomb expert thought to be a leading figure in Al Qaeda's bomb-making team.

Ibrahim Al-Asiri, 32, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners.

The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights from the UK.

French soldiers patrol through a terminal at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport July 4. France is tightening airport security for U.S. flight destinations for the summer holiday period at the request of American authorities, an official statement said on Friday

The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from 10 to 21 yesterday.

Manchester Airport has insisted today's queues were unrelated to any security changes and were due to the busy summer holiday season.

A spokesman said: 'July is a busy month for the airport and many passengers will be using services from Manchester over the next few weeks.

'Our security officers are on hand to give advice and we ask that passengers work with us so that we can ensure we get people to their gate on time, in a safe manner.

'We ask that passengers leave enough 
time and arrive two hours before their flight to ensure that we keep the
 security process moving.'

A spokesman for Gatwick said there were no additional delays due to security, with customers only having to wait at baggage reclaim.

France today followed Britain in increasing security on flights to the U.S., with the French civil aviation authority announcing stepped-up security measures 'for the summer period' which will begin next week.
