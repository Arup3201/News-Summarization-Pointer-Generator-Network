Radamel Falcao has revealed he was in talks with Manchester United 'for some months' before his deadline day transfer.

The Colombia striker had been widely reported to be heading to Real Madrid before his shock switch to Old Trafford. 

Falcao, speaking on Wednesday as he 
prepared for his country's friendly against Brazil in Miami on Friday night, said: 'I am 
very proud to be at Manchester United.

'We have been in talks with the club for some months and, in the end, we were able to reach an agreement with Monaco on the last day of the transfer deadline.'

The 28-year-old had to wait until 1.30am on Tuesday before his £6million season-long loan move from Monaco was approved by the Premier League and he could be unveiled as a United player.

He
 said: 'I haven't had the opportunity to speak with the players but, 
although they are stars, they are also footballers that play for the 
team to achieve the common goals of the group. I am sure this will be 
the basis of our success and in any team that wants to achieve important
 things.

'Angel
 (di Maria) is a fantastic player. I love the way he plays, I really do.
 I am very excited to be a team-mate of his and also to be part of 
Manchester United.'

Falcao only recently returned to action after six months with a serious knee injury, which also ruled him out of the World Cup  

He added: 'I
 trusted in God to return to football, I have worked very hard every day
 to achieve it and thank God my work paid off, being able to come back 
normally, scoring goals. I'm feeling relaxed about it.

When
 I had to go for surgery, all the country sent positive messages. I was 
very happy with that and all I want is to give back some of this 
happiness I received both with the national team and at my club.'
