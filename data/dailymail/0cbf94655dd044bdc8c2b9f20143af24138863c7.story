A white supremacist appeared at court on Monday dressed in full Nazi uniform as he tried to convince a judge that he was a good father - despite having named one of his children Adolf.

Heath Campbell, who had four children, asked the judge to be allowed to see his 18-month-old son Hons.

The self-proclaimed Nazi, from New Jersey, has given three of his children Nazi-inspired names but claims he is fit to be a father and has never abused them.

Fascist statement: Heath Campbell, 40, appeared at a New Jersey court today to try to reclaim custody of his children, wearing full Nazi regalia and accompanied by fellow Nazi Bethanie White

Campbell, a swastika tattoo clearly showing on his neck, told NBC10: 'I'm going to tell the judge, I love my children. I wanna be a father, let me be it.

'Let me prove to the world that I am a good father.'

He said that he had never abused his children and had only named them. He has not seen his children in two years and the eldest three have been adopted.

The 40-year-old white supremacist appeared at a hearing in Hunterdon County Family Court in Flemington, NJ this morning. His regalia included knee-high black boots and swastika patches.

He told the TV station that whether wearing his Nazi uniform might sway the judge's decision, depended on the judge.

Bethanie White, a member of his organization 'Hitler's Order', was with Campbell at court - also covered in swastikas.

Adolf Hitler Campbell, six, and his younger sisters Joycelynn Aryan Nation, five, and Honszlynn Hinler, four, were taken into custody in January 2009.

State officials also took another son, Hons Campbell, from his parents Heath and Deborah Campbell just hours after he was born in November 2011.

A court denied the Campbells' appeal to have their children returned last year.

The Nazi-inspired names came to light
 after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy 
birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008.

In 2010, a
 New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse 
or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children.

Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.

Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people.

The
 mother reportedly had also once given a note to her neighbor saying she
 was terrified of her husband, who had threatened to kill her.

Decisions: The Campbells, pictured leaving court in 2009, said they chose the Nazi-themed names as they were unique

The Campbells have previously defended the names, saying they chose them simply because they liked them and they were unique.

Campbell said he named his son after the Nazi leader as 'no one else in the world would have that name'.

Campbell has since separated from his wife and she has given up rights to her children.

A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for later this month.
