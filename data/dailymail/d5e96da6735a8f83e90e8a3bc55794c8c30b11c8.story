Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said Wednesday that he was 'stunned' to hear President Barack Obama during his speech to the United Nations making an 'outrageous' comparison between a white-on-black police shooting in Missouri and a mass genocide by the ISIS terror army in Syria and Iraq. 

'I was stunned,' Cheney said during a Fox News Channel interview.

'I mean, in one case you've got a police officer involved in a shooting. There may be questions about it. They'll be sorted out through the legal process.'

'There's no comparison to that with what ISIS is doing to thousands of people throughout the Middle East,' he said, 'with bloody beheadings of anybody they come in contact with.'  

Cheney said it's 'outrageous' to compare Ferguson with Syria 'as though somehow there's moral equivalence there'

'We have our own racial and ethnic tensions': Obama brought the August shooting in Ferguson, MIssouri into his speech condemning ISIS terrorists for a genocidal march across parts of Syria and Iraq

Michael Brown's police-shooting death followed his participation in a convenience-story robbery, but civil rights protesters descended on the town of Ferguson, Missouri to demand the cop's prosecution

Obama had said hours earlier at a UN General Assembly meeting in New York that the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri was evidence that the United States has 'our own racial and ethnic tensions.'

Brown, 18, committed a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store before a physical altercation with a police officer, which turned deadly minutes later

Critics quickly jumped on Obama's comment, saying the president was drawing lines of similarity between the teen's death and the ethnic cleansing plaguing the Middle East.

Richard Grenell, formerly the spokesman for America's UN mission, wrote Wednesday in an online essay that 'overstating America's issues doesn't make us relatable; it makes others' issues easily dismissable.' 

Obama had offered what some interpreted as an apology on the world stage for a local law-enforcement crisis that left a single man dead.

'I realize that America's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals, that America has plenty of problems within our own borders,' he told world leaders, referring to the shooting.

'In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.' 

Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Wednesday night that he was 'stunned' to hear President Obama bring the Ferguson, Missouri police shooting into a speech about ISIS terrorism and genocide

Fair comparison? The murderous Islamist terror group ISIS has mass-slaughtered fellow Muslims for the crime of belonging to the wrong religious sect

The case brought American race-rioters to Missouri from as far away as California and Maine. Ferguson was the scene of looting and nightly riots. 

Cheney appeared on the 'Hannity' program.

Later in his interview, he said Obama would eventually have to heed calls for American ground troops to intervene in Iraq and Syria, where the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions in its quest for a 'caliphate' state ruled by religious extremists.

The president, Cheney said, repeatedly refuses to 'accept good military advice in terms of how he actually uses the force.'

In part because of that, the former VP said, the next decade will see another bloody terror attack on American soil.

'It's not just ISIS. ISIS front and center right now,' he said. 'But I believe there'll be another mass casualty attack against the United States.'
