Police in Sussex are complaining about an invasion of prisoners from Eastern Europe after a poster was put up in a Polish prison suggesting they 'Come to Bognor Regis'.

The revelation emerged after police in 
the area arrested a Polish criminal in a stolen car who told them he had
decided to come to Sussex after seeing the posters.

It is not known which prison the posters have been put up in, or how many, but they urge criminals to 'start a new life' in the prosperous coastal county.

New life? Prisoners in Poland are being urged to start a new life in 
Bognor Regis in West Sussex after seeing posters in their jail

Crime: Pagham Harbour in Pagham, Bognor Regis. Police say there's been an increase in Eastern Europeans operating in the area specialising in theft, burglary and possibly human trafficking

Now police say there has been an increase in 
Eastern Europeans are operating in the area, specialising in theft, 
burglary and possibly human trafficking among migrant agricultural 
workers.

Speaking of the day when officers arrested the Polish criminal who told them about the posters Inspector Nick Bowman, of the force's Arun district said: 'He had just been released from a Polish prison.

'He
let the officers know the reason he came here was there was literature 
out there that said 'come to Bognor Regis, start a new life'.

'That is what we are up against.'

A special police task force has now been set up to target organised crime in the Arun district.

Officers say 18 per cent of the crimes in the Arun area are committed by Eastern Europeans.

It is thought that there are about 6,000 Eastern Europeans living in the area, which is home to about 150,000 people.

Insp Bowman said: 'Some of these individuals who are criminals in their home countries come over here and develop organised crime groups where they are making a huge amount of money.

'When they get what they think is sufficient they'll go back to their own country and build a big house.

'They have considered themselves untouchable, but that is not the case.'

Police are also very concerned that many offences committed by the gangs against people from their own countries go unreported.

They are now trying to encourage the migrant workers to report crime to the police and overcome a general mistrust of police which is prevalent in their own countries.

Insp Bowman said: 'We the police haven't yet managed to reach out and engage with the settled community - the hard-working, decent, legitimate community.'
