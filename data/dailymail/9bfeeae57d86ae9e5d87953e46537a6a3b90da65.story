It’s the common cry of many a struggling dieter: ‘I live on salads yet I can’t shift the pounds.’

Those struggling with their weight also often blame ‘a slow metabolism’ for setting them back, but as a new TV series reveals, the answer may be far more simple.

In the Channel 4 show Secret Eaters, hidden cameras record every  surreptitious nibble taken by participants. And when their eating habits aren’t being spied on at home, they are secretly tracked by two private detectives who take photographs of them sneaking crisps, cakes, fizzy drinks and takeaway meals.

‘At the end of five days of surveillance,
 Secret Eaters presenter Anna Richardson then takes the dieters to the 
‘Incident Room’, where everything they’ve eaten during that time is laid
 out before them – damning evidence of the scale of their consumption.

You can see the look of astonishment on their faces when they see the food they’ve actually consumed. They have no idea,’ says the show’s dietician Lynne Garton.

‘Snacks can add up to more than 500 calories a day but too often people get distracted by their busy lives and forget the chocolate bar or biscuit they ate earlier and it soon mounts up. Cutting out those calories can lead to a 1lb loss per week.’

Sisters Stephanie and Lauren Spearman, who appear in the first episode of the series, are a perfect example. Stephanie, 23, survived on junk food, while Lauren, 28, although regularly enjoying a drink and  chocolate bars, was training for the London Marathon.

The thing they had in common was that despite their seemingly diverse eating habits, neither could lose weight.

It wasn’t until CCTV cameras captured 
their daily routine that the sisters were faced with a shocking truth – 
their snacking was so bad that within six months they would each have 
gained more than 2st in weight.

Lauren, who weighed 12st 9lb, says: ‘I thought I might go over the recommended calorie intake by a little but I assumed it would be cancelled out by my running.

‘In fact, I ate more than 14,000 calories in one week – over-eating by two day’s worth of calories.’

The advertising sales manager adds: ‘I 
honestly had no idea. I was eating a chocolate bar every day at work but
 how bad could it be? When I was told that added up to 2,575 calories a 
week, I was horrified.’

As well as her bars at 515 calories each, Lauren’s alcohol intake during four nights out added another 500 daily calories, while meals out provided 1,500 more.

Stephanie, a sales manager for High Street chain Matalan, weighed 12st 6lb when she contacted the programme.

Her shift patterns at work meant she often skipped breakfast but would be so hungry by 11am that she would get a quick-fix from biscuits or cakes.

Calorie-laden microwave meals and a vending machine provided a ready supply of snacks and fizzy drinks which, added to her fast-food takeaways, made up a total of 4,000 calories on some days – double the recommended intake for women.

Dietician Lynne says: ‘Millions turn to the latest fad for a quick fix but to lose weight long-term requires a change in eating habits.

'Eating three meals a day and snacking only on healthy foods such as fruit can be all that’s needed to lose weight.’

Stephanie and Lauren, from Chelmsford, have taken on the advice they received on the programme and have lost 10lbs and 11lbs respectively.

‘We feel so much better since we’ve replaced sugary drinks with fizzy water, swapped crisps for fruit, and burgers for healthy sandwiches,’ says Stephanie.

‘I’ve managed to save £100 a month by not buying ready-meals and sugary snacks. We’re losing weight and we’re not even on a diet.’

Secret Eaters starts on Channel 4 on March 27.
