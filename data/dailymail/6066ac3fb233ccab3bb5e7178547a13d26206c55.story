HM Revenue chiefs were yesterday ordered by MPs to stop sending threatening letters to people who owed them money, warning that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off for a pittance.

In a scathing rebuke, tax bosses were told by the Commons' Treasury committee that the 'widely used' practice of mailing out threats to auction off people's property was 'completely inappropriate'.

Labour MP George Mudie, deputy chairman of the committee, even suggested that HM Revenue and Customs had been breaking the law by sending out the 'horrifying' letters.

'Horrifying threats': HM Revenue has been sending out letters to people threatening to auction off their property

And he accused Chancellor George Osborne of turning a blind eye to the abuse after one of his Treasury Ministers appeared to condone it.

Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how the tax office was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands.

In a damning report this weekend on HMRC's performance, the Treasury committee said: 'These letters appear to have been widely used without sufficient thought to whom they were sent to, even being sent to people who did not actually owe money.

'Such language is appropriate only where there is strong evidence of persistent and deliberate non-payment.'

Mr Mudie, who led the inquiry,  praised The Mail on Sunday for exposing the HMRC tactics.

He said: 'This was one of the most disturbing things uncovered in our inquiry. They were sending these out to taxpayers, seemingly on a random basis, and telling them to pay up within weeks.

'There was no question of saying  we would like to discuss this with you, or you can phone this number, and you have a right of appeal.

'It was just: pay up this money – and it was often a four-figure number – within weeks or we will seize your goods.

'Imagine the effect on someone elderly and vulnerable living on their own if they got a letter like that.'

'Disappointing': Treasury Minister David Gauke was on the receiving end of stern criticism from the committee

The Leeds MP also warned that unless the letters were being sent to people who had repeatedly and deliberately refused to pay up, they were illegal.

He also voiced his anger that Treasury Minister David Gauke, who oversees HMRC, appeared to condone the practice.

Mr Mudie said: 'The Minister came before us and I was disappointed because he took the line that they owed money and they had to get it.

'He seemed to think it was acceptable but the committee didn't.'

Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how HMRC was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands.

In a provocative twin-track tactic, tax chiefs set out to humiliate people into paying up by threatening to seize their possessions and auction them off publicly for a fraction of their real value, and warning them that if they refused the Government would run out of money to treat the sick and educate the nation's children.

One letter sent from the HMRC office in Croydon described in graphic terms how 'embarrassing' and costly it would be for the taxpayer if a debt of more than £2,000 was not settled.

'We must collect this tax from you to pay for the hospitals and schools we all rely on. We will do that by taking your possessions and auctioning them publicly.

'We don't like doing this because people have told us it is embarrassing for them and it will cost you so much more to pay this way.

'For instance, if your car is worth several thousand pounds, it might sell for only a few hundred pounds at auction, a flat-screen TV costing £2,000 would typically sell for about £200-£300, and an £800 laptop would sell for about £100.'

Praised: The Mail on Sunday story from earlier this year that exposed how HMRC was sending menacing letters to late payers

In their report, MPs painted a dismal picture of HMRC as an organisation in deep crisis, with 'endemic delays'.

Staff were so over-stretched that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months.

The report comes after HMRC  admitted last year that six million people had paid the wrong amount of tax in previous years.

Last night HMRC remained defiant about the letters, saying most of the them were sent to people who either repeatedly failed to respond or refused to pay up.

The Treasury declined to make a statement last night.
