The body of missing Wisconsin college student Eric Duffey has been found in the Wisconsin River after an exhaustive search involving 150 volunteers.

Duffey, 21, disappeared early on Saturday morning having been out celebrating his birthday with friends at Joe's Bar.

He was last seen at about 1.15 am leaving the bar and is thought to have been heading for his residence or that of his girlfriend.

Birthday: Eric Duffey, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, was last seen Saturday morning leaving a bar after a night celebrating his 21st birthday

Stevens Point Sgt. Dan Wheeler said officials removed Duffey’s body at around 1.10 pm this afternoon from the river, which goes through the city about 110 miles north of Madison.

The coroner's office made a positive identification after meeting with Duffey's family.

Firefighters on boat and a diving team had been searching for any sign of Duffey in the river. Stevens Point assistant police chief Brian Kudronowicz said emergency personnel including the Civil Air Patrol had been scouring a part of the river where the ice becomes open water. He said it's not far from where Duffey was last seen.

Kudronowicz said the department had received new information that led officials to believe Duffey walked into the Wisconsin River, adding ‘I think alcohol had something to do with his actions.’

But Duffey’s father Darren told WISC-TV: ‘I know that they were drinking, but it doesn't sound like they were drinking heavily. It wasn't like they were doing 21 shots or anything like that.'

Sgt Wheeler said that information included a witness who came forward and said he heard someone yelling for help at about 1.30 am Saturday near the Clark Street bridge. But Wheeler said the witness didn't see anyone when he checked.

Police sent a Code Red Alert out Saturday evening and again on Sunday morning. With the alert, police asked residents between downtown Stevens Point and Duffey's residence to check their property for signs of him.

The official search was suspended Sunday evening, but police, family and friends continued to search neighborhoods near the campus.

Several college-age men around Wisconsin have disappeared after drinking heavily at taverns only to turn up dead in local rivers over the last decade.
