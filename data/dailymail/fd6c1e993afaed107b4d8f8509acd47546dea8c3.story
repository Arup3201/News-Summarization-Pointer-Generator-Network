She credits her as her ‘greatest inspiration’ – yet the one person model-turned-artist Tali Lennox has never painted is her popstar mother Annie.

The 22-year-old, who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in New York, has received critical acclaim.

But in an exclusive interview with The Scottish Mail on Sunday, she revealed she had still not plucked up the courage to capture the Eurythmics star on canvas.

She said: ‘She is one of the only people I haven’t painted. I haven’t built myself up to it yet.

‘I am such a perfectionist and I worry that it might not turn out as amazing as I would want it to. She is so important to me and I want it to be just right.’

Last week the 22-year-old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online

She has painted her close friends, her sister, even her boyfriend, New York-based photographer Ian Jones: ‘I like to paint people I know rather than strangers, as I have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means.

‘I will paint my mum at some point. The last time I was with her we were talking about it. I am thinking I might do a series, in different situations, that capture different sides of her.’

The youngest daughter of the Scottish singer and her second husband, Israeli film producer Uri Fruchtmann, Tali grew up in London’s Notting Hill.

Yet despite her high-profile parents, she describes her upbringing as ‘sheltered’, saying: ‘People find it hard to believe, but my childhood was really quite normal.

‘My mum has always been so modest and grounded and didn’t really involve herself in the world of celebrity. First and foremost, despite being an incredibly successful singer, she was a parent.

‘I never felt we were under a spotlight and we didn’t have paparazzi trailing us all the time, which I am grateful for.

‘I think because we didn’t do anything out of the ordinary we were left alone and that helped me growing up. I didn’t really feel any different to anyone else.’

It was only when Tali and her older sister Lola first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how fêted their mother was. ‘I remember, during her performances, seeing people crying in the crowd and I was like: “Woah, they must really love her”. Thousands of people would be singing along to her music – I think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was.’

Tali would later go into modelling, starring in big budget campaigns for Burberry and Prada. Two years ago, she put her modelling career on hold to move to the US and become a professional portrait artist.

But still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day: ‘I love to talk to her about what I am doing. I don’t always listen to other people’s feedback on my art, but with my mum I do listen.

‘We are really similar and we think in the same way. I am so lucky to have someone in my life who I am so so close to in that way and who really gets me. I never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work, even self-portraits that are quite raw.

‘Both my parents have always supported me and encouraged me to do what I love.’

Her self-portrait show, Layers of Life, opens next week at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York’s trendy SoHo area.

Tali has inherited her mother’s love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy.

Last week, she faced criticism that some of her self-portraits, which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse, were in ‘very poor taste’.

Yesterday, speaking from her studio in New York, the young artist, whose mother actively campaigns for women’s rights, explained that she wanted to shine a light on ‘every trait of human nature’.

She said: ‘It is so important that we do not hide away from important issues such as domestic abuse. We have to face up to it if we are going to stop it.

‘There is far too much abuse in the world. My mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking. 

'I know some people may find my work quite intense, but I want to make emotive art. I want to make people feel something and look inside themselves. I want to evoke compassion and discussion.

‘In a world where everything is instant and accessible, and people put out fragments of themselves on social media, I search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are. I am not putting my work out thinking everyone has to like it. Art is in the eye of the beholder.’

Tali has been drawing and painting for ‘as long as I can remember’. While she admits she loves to sing, and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home, her sketch book was always at her side.

The model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age

Her ‘unexpected’ move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty.

‘I had singing lessons at school but my parents were never pushy,’ she said. ‘I love singing and am not bad at it, but I don’t think I have what it takes to make a career out of it.

‘Art has always been my passion, since I was very young – it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting cannot be beaten. I have always painted people. When I was younger I used to like drawing pretty girls from magazines but as I got older, after I started modelling and was in a world obsessed with looks, I started to prefer more distorted faces which have more depth.’

The 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full-time. ‘I still do some modelling, but not as much as I used to,’ she said. ‘I want to work on something I created, whereas when you are modelling you are part of someone else’s idea.

‘In modelling, your one main ambition is to look after the way you look. It is not something I felt I could immerse myself in full-time – plus I like eating nice food too much.’

She added: ‘A part of modelling is great and fun, but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure. You can feel a bit insecure. Maybe in a way it is selfish, but I needed to find a better balance for me.

Tali admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling

‘I had never planned to model. It was all quite bizarre how it happened and I was very young but it taught me so much about myself and I met some amazing people.’

Tali hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a ‘privileged’ girl who likes to paint.

She said: ‘I am not in this for the fame, that is not important to me, but I would like people to see my paintings and realise how hard I work. I know I have had a very privileged life, but it is important to me I am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer. Sometimes you hear people questioning why the children of actors and singers don’t just get “normal” jobs. But when you grow up in an artistic environment, this is normal.

‘I also think it is in your genes. People are pleasantly surprised when they see that I am not a cliché and I take my work really seriously. I felt it was important for me to fly the nest and come to New York on my own and be self-sufficient.’

But she has never felt she was in her mother’s shadow. ‘I am so proud of what she has done in her life. I am so grateful to have such an incredible, passionate, giving person in my life. I was talking to her the other day about all her humanitarian work. She just never stops and does everything with the best of intentions.’

The singer plans to be at the opening of her daughter’s exhibition. Tali said: ‘She is my greatest inspiration and I am so glad she will be there. All those closest to me will be – which means a lot.’

Tali revealed she has also been taking acting lessons, saying: ‘I love acting. It is similar to painting as you use yourself as the tool and it is scary because it all comes from within. To be successful you have to give your everything to it – so I don’t think I could commit enough time just now with my art – but I haven’t ruled it out.’

Wistfully, she adds: ‘I can’t see myself in a comedy. I like things that are honest and raw, so I think the best acting is method acting for me.’

l The Layers of Life exhibition will be open for a month from March 19 at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York.
