British motorists caught speeding in Europe face being tracked down and fined, under controversial new EU rules.

At the moment, drivers caught by a speed camera while in their own car abroad cannot be fined because EU police forces do not have the power to trace people abroad.

But the European Parliament is expected to back new measures giving foreign police forces the power to send fines to British addresses and pursue motorists through the UK courts if they do not pay.

Motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine, under new EU rules

Motorists can already be traced if they are were driving hire cars or caught by police officers on the side of the road.

The new rules, which are expected to be easily passed by the European Parliament, will allow motorists to be fined for speeding, ignoring a red light, drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone.

If a driver commits an offence in another country, the police will be able to use their car's registration number to track them down.

They will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver's own language, demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine.

British police will also be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in Britain for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the UK.

If approved, the Bill will apply to member states from May â€“ but the UK will have two years to enforce the new law.

The move, which is backed by ministers, has been welcomed by road safety campaigners.

Ed Morrow, from the organisation Brake, said: 'For a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims. Illegal driving crosses borders, so enforcement must cross borders too.'

The Department for Transport added: 'It's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the UK, and we are pleased this is set to change.

'But it mustn't be easier for British drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the UK. We have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations.'

Ines Ayala Sender, a Spanish MEP and the EU Parliament's negotiator on the issue, said the move would help cut road deaths by 50 per cent.

He said: 'Citizens are, of course, never thrilled to receive a letter telling them they have been caught committing a traffic offence, but they do welcome the fact that everyone in the EU will be treated equally, no matter where their vehicle is registered.'

But, Edmund King, the AA president, said: 'In theory, tracking down drivers who break the law driving in other countries might sound like a good idea in terms of road safety but in practice it could be a nightmare.

'Different European countries have significantly different motoring laws and indeed penalties. If UK drivers receive a penalty notice for using a "restricted lane" in Spain they may wish to contest it but this would prove impossible in most cases as often photographic evidence is not provided. Returning to Europe for a court case is prohibitive in terms of cost.'
