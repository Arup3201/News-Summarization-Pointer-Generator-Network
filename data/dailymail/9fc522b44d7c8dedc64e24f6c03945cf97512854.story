Chinese police are trying to dissect a bizarre mystery after a meat cleaver was found jammed into a block of flats nearly 13 floors up.

Baffled officers are being driven up the wall trying to work out how the huge knife got there, nearly 150ft above the ground, as it is not close to any windows.

The cleaver was discovered by residents of the apartment block in Chengdu, Sichuan province, embedded in the outer wall between the 12th and 13th floors.

Knife block: Chinese police cannot figure out how the meat cleaver got jammed so high up the building

Slice of luck: The blade is not near any windows and did not harm anyone in the process of getting there

Threat: Police believe that the act could have been done to send a message to someone in the block

It has not harmed anyone, but has left residents scared about what it could mean. 

'It's really creepy. No-one knows how it got there and now we're all afraid to sit on or balconies or leave our windows open,' said resident Chan Juan Ts'ai. 'We just woke up one morning and it was there.'

Police hired a local steeplejack to abseil down the building to remove it from the wall.

A police spokesman said: 'It appears no-one saw it happen so we're appealing for anyone who knows anything about this to come forward.

'We doubt that someone on a floor above innocently dropped the knife which went over their balcony or out of a kitchen window. Given that it was hurled in the wall with some force that seems unlikely.

'More likely is we could be dealing with someone who is deliberately trying to disturb their neighbours or deliver some kind of threat.

'We are watching the block and the knife is being tested for fingerprints and other forensic evidence.'
