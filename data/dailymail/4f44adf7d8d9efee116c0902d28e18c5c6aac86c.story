Many comedians and TV personalities such as Alan Partridge and Johnathon Ross have their own bands to add a bit of interest to their shows.

And now for the first time a fashion brand has introduced an in house musical offering as ASOS launched it's own band.

Over the next two months visitors to the fashion site will be able to hear new ASOS House Band duo 'Man Like Me' ... and one of their muses the Made In Chelsea star Millie Manderson (nee Mackintosh) will even be staring in one of the videos.

Hundreds of artists were auditioned for the band slot until ASOS found the perfect duo, Johnny Langer and Peter Duffy (pictured here with their backing singer)

The first release from the House Band will be 'LOLROFLOMFGLMFAO', which asks 'who needs words when you've got letters?'

Last night ASOS launched its new House Band, which saw Millie Mackintosh attend the exclusive VIP party at ASOS HQ.

Millie attended with her friend Charlotte de Carle. The pair chatted together, dressed to impressed in printed suits and matching bangs.

Tweeting throughout the evening in the ASOS fashion house, the pair #twins at each other, with Millie overheard telling pals that with MIC back on air she is missing the show and hoped for a comeback.

Also in attendance was trendy TV presenter Arielle Free and Big Brother presenter AJ Odudu.

Over the coming weeks the house band will be debuting a series of ditties that take a sideways look at things like the joys of a fashion face-off (‘Frock Off’), celebrity worship (‘Me, My Girl and Ryan (Gosling)’) and finding loose change down the back of the couch (‘Found A Pound’).

One of the music videos, ‘Supersonic’, features Millie and her transition from 'West London It Girl to edgy East London' (their words, not ours).

That song, which celebrates her sense of style and London’s love of partying, will be released on the ASOS website 22nd November featuring a guest appearance from the lady herself.

The house band is the latest clever online marketing strategy used by the fashion brand who were one of the first to introduce a digital magazine

Other House Band inspirations include 
the perils of buying suitable Christmas presents (‘Wrap It Up’) and the 
nation’s growing obsession with posting photos of their pets across 
social networks (‘Heavy Petting’).

Hundreds
of artists were auditioned for the band until ASOS found their perfect 
fit, Johnny Langer and Peter Duffy (also known as Man Like Me).

The fashion website hope that the charming pair will win the hearts, ears, and pursestrings of ASOS shoppers.

The pair will often be joined by Talia, a female backing singer, in their videos.

The first release from the House Band is be ‘LOLROFLOMFGLMFAO’, which asks who needs words when you’ve got letters.

Seven more songs and videos will be released over the next two months, each premiered on the ASOS website weekly on Friday mornings.

ASOS might be the first brand to sign its own band but more and more fashion companies are using the power of music in their advertising and social media campaigns.

Last month H&M announced that super model Gisele Bündchen is the face - and voice - of their autumn campaign.

Her hitherto unheard singing voice will accompany the TV and online commercials, in which she sings along to the tune of All Day And All Of The Night by The Kinks.

British brand Burberry have also ultilised popular music in their brand development.

They have run a series of gigs, often held in their flagship store in London, for Burberry Acoustic, as part of a project that brings together British fashion and music.

The artists are selected by the brand's Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey, who often uses live music, particularly from budding artists, as the soundtrack for his catwalk shows.

Burberry's new men’s fragrance is inspired by the ‘exhilaration and adrenaline of live music' and the campaign is fronted by musician George Barnett, 25.

And Brit Rhythm, the first fragrance Burberry have launched since taking its beauty business in house in April 2013, celebrated its launch with a live gig from White Lies in Shoreditch on Wednesday.
