Police have put out a stern public warning after they were forced to launch a number of search and rescue operations which could have been prevented.

A man on the Sunshine Coast who took a young boy for a ride on a blow-up toboggan in fast flowing waters was charged with public nuisance after the pair had to be rescued.  

The incident occurred at the same time as two boys were feared swept away in Queensland's floodwaters. They have since been found safe and well after a desperate search.

Just after Marcia made landfall, locals took advantage of the conditions caused by the category five cyclone as youth seized the opportunity to boogie board in a flooded park while surfers weren't deterred by rough seas.

This comes as rescue crews bring a teenager to safety after he was found clinging to a tree in a swollen river in Queensland's southeast.

A 15-year-old boy has been rescued after clinging to a tree in the flood-swollen South Pine River in Queensland's southeast.

Emergency service crews were called to the river between the Eatons Hill and Bunya shorelines at about 7pm on Saturday following reports the boy had been swept down the river and was clinging to a tree unable to move.

The boy was located 'holding on to a tree in knee-depth rapidly flowing water unable to make his way back to the shoreline,' police said in a statement.

He was kept under torchlight until a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services swift water rescue crew in an inflatable boat reached him and conveyed him to shore.

The boy was treated by ambulance paramedics at the scene. 

Police continue to appeal to the public not to go into or play in floodwaters.

Just yesterday, a 40-year-old local was charged with public nuisance.

A young boy and the man were rescued at a property in Woodford on Saturday afternoon after they went tobogganing in a rapid waterway. 

Neither was injured, police said. 

The rescue operation was one of two police were involved with on the Sunshine Coast following localised flooding throughout central and southeast Queensland due to heavy rainfall from Cyclone Marcia.

A search for the two teenage boys feared swept away in floodwaters at Beerwah was called off on Saturday afternoon after they were found safe and well.

The search was launched after a member of the public told police they had spotted the teens clinging to a tree amid floodwaters.

Eight police crews, multiple swift water rescue teams as well as a rescue helicopter were deployed to help.

But the pair contacted police about three hours later and said they were safe and unhurt.

'It appears the boys were able to reach land without assistance,' a statement from police read.

'It would seem that the simplest of messages are often the hardest to receive.

'Flooded creeks and rivers, fast-flowing waterways and watercourses and churned up oceans are dangerous places to play,' the statement read. 

But while the category five cyclone shattered Queensland's coastline, young swimmers defied the weather and enjoyed the raging sea on the Gold Coast.

It also tore through houses and businesses, including a liquor store in Yeppoon which police allege that bottles of alcohol had been stolen from the shop.

Police say they caught three underage boys with 11 bottles of liquor which they claim was from the damaged store, Nine News reports.

Police advised the penalty for such behaviour will be 'severe'.
