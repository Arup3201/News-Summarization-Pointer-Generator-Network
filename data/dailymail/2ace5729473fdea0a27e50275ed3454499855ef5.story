Cyberbullied: Giant Georgia Davis, 19, was forced to delete her Facebook page after she was targeted by internet trolls

Britain’s fattest teenager is being tormented by sick internet trolls who say they wish she was dead as she is treated in hospital.

Georgia Davis, 19, was yesterday forced to delete her Facebook page after she was targeted by cyberbullies who taunted her for weighing 63 stone.

Friends say she is upset after being bombarded with sick jokes and cruel remarks since being rushed to hospital for complications brought on by obesity.

Miss Davis - who spent hours on Facebook while housebound due to her size - was yesterday stable in hospital as doctors tried to treat her obesity.

As well as having her personal account abused the teenager also had to contend with one troll creating a new Facebook page called RIP Georgia Davis - which has since been taken down. The page said: 'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.

'You fat blob, you are adding millions of pounds to the tax payers bill. If I had my way I would wipe that fat grin off your face by making you pay us back.'

Another anonymous commenter said: 'Why don’t you just stop eating so much you fat fool.

The rise in popularity of social networking sites has been accompanied by a worrying increase in computer screen harassers known as 'trolls'.

They are people who post deliberately sick and inflammatory messages on web pages and forums to provoke anger and upset.

Sean Duffy, 26, from Reading, Berkshire, who targeted dead teenagers and cruelly 
mocked their deaths was banned from social networking sites in March.

He admitted defacing a tribute site set up to remember schoolgirl Sophie Taylor, 16, who was shot accidentally by her boyfriend.

Duffy was sentenced to a community payback order with supervision for two years and told to do 300 hours of unpaid work.

People in the public eye have also been targeted by trolls.

Comedian Dom Joly called the police after a Twitter account was set up by somebody writing abusive messages about his two children.

And student Liam Stacey, 21, who mocked footballer Fabrice Muamba on Twitter after he collapsed during a match, was jailed for 56 days for inciting racial hatred.

'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.'

Miss Davis had to be cut free from her home in Aberdare, South Wales, in a rescue operation after she became too heavy to leave her bedroom.

Around 40 people were tasked with taking down two walls and building a ramp so she could be stretchered to nearby Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.

She was yesterday described as stable in hospital as doctors put her on a strict diet to tackle her health problems - including diabetes, kidney failure, spinal and skin problems.

But as she lay in bed recovering, trolls set up the fake Facebook tribute page.

It was reported to the site by her friends and has now been removed.

One message on it read: '63-stone teen dies in hospital - as she hears McDonalds are banning her.'

And cyberbullies also took to the networking site Twitter to post vile jokes about her weight.

One said: 'Georgia Davis was asked what was her favourite instrument in school?

'She said the dinner bell.'

Another wrote: 'Georgia Davis says she was depressed as she has just lost her boyfriend - Has she tried looking in the folds of her skin to see if he’s there?'

Miss Davis closed down her Facebook page in an attempt to escape her tormentors - eventhough it was one of the main ways she kept in touch with friends.

One friend close to Miss Davis said: 'It’s an absolute disgrace how people are treating a girl they don’t even know with such disrespect.

'She turned to the internet for support and she gets sick comments like this sent her way.

'She has closed her own Facebook page now and is very upset.

'I just want her to be able to focus on getting healthy and in better shape, she doesn’t need mockery like this.'

Miss Davis moved in with friend Jade Tarrant but put on weight after she returned home to care for her sick step-father.

Miss Tarrant revealed earlier this week how Miss Davis's weight went from 18 stone to 63 stone as she returned to her bad habit of eating junk food.

Miss Tarrant, 19, said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again.

'She’d come to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step-dad got so stressful.

'She just wanted a break - she wanted some girly time.

'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it.

'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

Miss Davis moved out of their shared home in Aberdare to move back into her parents' home three miles away after her step-father was diagnosed with lung cancer.

She tried to be good daughter as her mother struggled with osteoporosis, Miss Tarrant said.

But the stress led to her returning to a diet of cakes, chips, burgers and chocolate, washed down by sugary fizzy drinks.

Miss Tarrant added: 'If she’d stayed with me her life would have been good, she would have been happy and not had a so many problems on her mind.

'It was the strain of caring for her ill parents which made her eat - it was eating as a way of coping.'

She thinks the world of her mum, she loves her and she loves her step-dad - she’s been through a lot.

'I like my salads and I could have got her on it': Jade Tarrant said she could have helped Miss Davis lose weight again

'Her mum’s osteoporosis and her step-dad’s lung problems had a large impact on her.

'It went wrong when she moved back in with them, she was under a lot of stress and it put her back on the same spot.

'She went back to eating fatty foods and having huge portions every time we went out for a meal.'

Miss Davis eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 40-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

The teenager is being treated for a range of obesity-related problems at hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin.

Doctors and obesity experts have put her on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet to help her lose weight.

Jade, who is currently pregnant with her first child, said: 'When I saw the situation I was in shock. I broke down and started crying.

'I didn’t even realise it was her, It didn’t look like her, she looked so unhappy.

'I had a fear inside me that something would happen one day but never expected this.

'I really want Georgia to get well and get out of hospital so she can come and see me and my baby.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals.

'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'
