The ruler of mega-rich Arab state Qatar has handed power to his son in a rare bloodless transition of power.

British-educated crown prince, Sheik 
Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, will take control of the hugely wealthy and influential Gulf 
state which has become one of Britain's biggest investors.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has welcomed news of new leader, taking to Twitter to say: 'Historic day for Qatar as the new generation takes over.'

Transition: Ill health is thought to be the reason why Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, left, has decided to hand control of the hugely wealth Gulf state to his son crown prince Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, right

The 33-year-old new ruler will take over a country with a sovereign wealth fund thought to total $100biliion which owns Harrods and 
Christieâ€™s, has financed the Shard and has major stakes in a number of high-profile British institutions.

Qatar is a small country of two million 
people but is a big exporter of natural gas, a global investment 
powerhouse and a financial backer of Arab Spring revolts.

The 61-year-old emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, said in a televised address that the decision has been made to step down following weeks of speculation.

Power: A view of the skyline of Doha, Qatar's capital, is a symbol for how the country has rising to be one of the most influential and wealthy countries in the Middle East

Rising from the sands: Huge natural resources has transformed Doha, the capital of tiny Gulf state Qatar, into a glittering metropolis of skyscrapers in just a few years

In a seven-minute speech aired on 
state television, the emir said it was time for a new generation to take
 over following his 18 years at the helm of the small, rich state.

The Qatari investment fund is thought to total $100bn.

The resource rich Gulf state has used its enormous spending power to buy a swathe of high profile brands and institutions over the past few years.

Qatari investments include:

'The time has come to open a new page
 in the journey of our nation that would have a new generation carry the
 responsibilities ... with their innovative ideas,' said Sheikh Hamad, 
reading a prepared text behind his desk.

'I address you today to inform you 
that I will transfer power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. I am 
fully confident that he is qualified for the responsibility and is 
trustworthy.'

But the transition - a rarity in a 
region where leadership changes are nearly always triggered by deaths or
 palace coups - also sends a message the wider Middle East.

It appears a sweeping response to the 
Arab Spring upheavals and their emphasis on giving voice to the region's
 youth, and reinforces Qatar's bold-stroke political policies.

Under Sheik Hamad, who took power in a
 bloodless coup in 1995, Qatar has been transformed into a political 
broker.

It has also become a center for global investment with a sovereign fund 
estimated to be worth more than $100 billion.

Its portfolio includes landmark real 
estate, luxury brands and a powerful presence in the sporting world.

Tiny Qatar also defeated rivals including the U.S. to win the rights to 
host the 2022 World Cup.

Now, the new ruler will begin the process of putting together a new government that may be in direct contrast to the old guard leaders across the Western-backed Gulf Arab states.

Qatar has given no official explanation on the transition, but it is widely believed that Sheik Hamad is suffering from health problems.

Sheik Tamim is not expected to make any immediate policy shifts for Qatar, which has used its riches to propel itself into one of the world's most politically ambitious countries.

It has served as a powerful player in the Middle East, including key support for rebels in Libya last year and now in Syria.

Qatar
 also has broken ranks with other Gulf states to offer help to the 
Muslim Brotherhood, which rose to political dominance in Egypt.

In an important sign of continuity and shared goals, the outgoing emir and Sheik Tamim stood shoulder to shoulder and greeted members of the ruling family and others following the address.

Sheik Tamim has been closely involved in all key decisions in recent years and his father is expected to remain a guiding force from the wings.

'Sheik Tamim will be driving his father's car, which is already programed on where to go,' said Mustafa Alani, a political analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Geneva.

Qatar has played a role as mediator 
in conflicts such as Sudan's Darfur region and regional disputes 
including Palestinian political rifts.

Qatar
 this week hosted a Syrian opposition conference attended by U.S. 
Secretary of State John Kerry and is the venue for possible U.S.-led 
peace talks with Afghanistan's Taliban.

Sheik Tamim became the next in line to rule in 2003 after his older brother stepped aside.

On
 the eve of the power transfer, Sheikh Hamad issued a decree extending 
the term of the advisory shura council, in effect indefinitely 
postponing elections that had been tentatively scheduled for the second 
half of the year.

The 
election would have been the first to the Shura Council, 30 of whose 45 
members are meant to be elected, with the others appointed by the emir, 
under a constitution approved in 2003. All the body's current members 
are appointed.

Diplomats have said the emir, who 
overthrew his father in a bloodless coup in 1995, had long planned to 
abdicate in favour of 33-year-old Crown Prince Sheikh Tamim.

Tuesday
 was a national holiday in the country of a one-family absolute monarchy
 has ruled over for more than 130 years. The royal court has invited 
Qataris to go to swear allegiance to Sheikh Tamim on Tuesday and 
Wednesday.

In Tehran, 
an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said: 'Most definitely we will be 
watching these developments and waiting for more details ... The 
tranquility and stability in that country and elsewhere in the region is
 of high importance for the Islamic Republic of Iran.'

King
 Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab power, congratulated 
Sheikh Tamim on his accession, acccording to the official Saudi Press 
Agency.

The only time the Qataris have excited the curiosity of the British was when two of their royal family's matching turquoise supercars were clamped outside Harrods, which they own
