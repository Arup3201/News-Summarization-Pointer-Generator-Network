Admission: Former Tory MP Louise Mensch says alcohol was ruining her life, as she was drinking every night after work

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has criticised Britain's 'off-base' culture of drinking to unwind saying that alcohol was ruining her life before she emigrated.

Mrs Mensch, who quit politics to move to America, says she has been diagnosed with a form of attention deficit disorder (ADD), which meant she was 'self-medicating' for stress with a large glass of wine after work every night.

The controversial chick-lit author last month admitted having a face-lift because 'I like the way I look and like to keep it that way'.

She has now encouraged others to give up drinking because it will improve mood, sleep patterns, and refresh the skin.

The 41-year-old says she was diagnosed with ADD (type 2 inattentive), which has an impact on concentration.

Her 'problem' with alcohol is yet another admission by the former Tory MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, who also said she was involved with hard drugs as a young woman.

On her Unfashionista blog, under the title 'Why-ne O'Clock', she wrote that moving to America 'had a number of beneficial side effects, but the most profound has been that I have almost completely given up alcohol'.

'Like many British women I relished that moment every night, after work, when I could get a large glass of white somewhere, and relax,' she said.

'I now realise it was also putting the breaks on the spinning atoms in my head, caused by untreated ADD. I was self-medicating for stress. And Britain is a culture in love with alcohol. In fact not to drink makes you weird and a killjoy.

'But alcohol was ruining my quality of life, although I didn't understand this fully until I stopped wanting to drink it.

'The elephant in the room is that British culture is completely off-base about booze. It's NOT ok to drink wine every night. It's not ok even to have a large glass of wine when you do'.

Marriage: Louise Mensch with her husband Peter Mensch, who she moved to New York with after quitting as MP for Corby

In August last year she sensationally 
quit as an MP, saying she could not represent Corby in Northamptonshire 
because she could not juggle her political and family life. Mrs Mensch 
moved to New York with her three children to live with her second 
husband Peter, who manages rock group Metallica.

One of the so-called ‘Cameron cuties’, Mrs Mensch won the her seat for the Conservatives in 2010 after it had been in Labour hands for 13 years.

Labour then regained the seat in a by-election which was triggered by her departure.

Her decision to quit, three years before the next election went down badly with her party, and she was booed and heckled when she appeared on a film screen at the Conservative party conference.

Blog: Mrs Mensh wrote about her problems with drink on her Unfashionista website, under the title 'Why-ne O'Clock'

This week she wrote that Americans have a 'happier and healthier' life because they do not drink like the British, and warned many others may have untreated Attention Deficit Disorder.

'It's a sign of a problem that you feel the need to have an evening drink. You shouldn't need it. If, like I was, you are a woman who drinks "reasonably but regularly", it's not reasonable. Consider that you may have ADD. Ask your doctor,' she said.

'There is a downside to cutting right back on alcohol, and it is that when you do indulge (even modestly) it will hit you a hell of a lot harder - seemingly unfairly hard, because you will lose your alcohol tolerance.

'But it is a small price to pay for a happier life. Consider making this change. It's how most American women live, (wine rarely) and they are happier and healthier for it.'
