Caretaker Newcastle manager John Carver conceded that he was deeply embarrassed by Newcastle fans booing their own team after their FA Cup defeat at Leicester – but insisted that he still wanted the job of head coach at the club after Alan Pardew’s move to Crystal Palace was confirmed.

Carver made seven changes and saw his Newcastle side go down 1-0 in a lacklustre performance and led his players over to a packed out contingent of travelling supporters – only to be greeted by boos and chants of: ‘We’re s*** and we’re sick of it.’

Newcastle fans gestured for the players to go away and also directed abuse at owner Mike Ashley but Carver said the fans the right to criticise the team in the light of the defeat.

‘It’s hugely embarrassing but they’re entitled to do that,’ said stand-in coach Carver. ‘The one thing I wasn’t going to allow was that the players didn’t go over to them. I was in front of everybody because we deserved it. I that’s how they feel, they pay their money their entitled to do that. 

'And I’m not going to shirk my responsibilities and it’s important the players didn’t either. It was important we went across and show appreciation for our support.’

Carver still wants the job, despite the reaction from fans and said: ‘I’d be a fool if I didn’t want to be head coach of this football club. Obviously results dictates that happens but I don’t feel any different. I still want to be head coach.’

He admitted that he had had no conversations with owner Mike Ashley since taking over the reins from Pardew on Monday – and that his sole contact with the board has been with managing director Lee Charnley.

But Carver says that even with the transfer window open, there is no need to speak to the owner as the new head coach – whether Carver or a new appointment – won’t have any say in transfer dealings.

Carver said: ‘I’ve not spoken to Mike and my only communication has been with Lee Charnley on Monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today.

‘It will be confusing (to fans) but the only thing I will say is that the position is not now as a manager - it’s now a head coach’s job. So the head coach’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that’s all I’ve been thinking about.

‘There’s no need for me to be in touch with owner because that’s the line the club is going down now – head coach. When I was with Toronto in the MLS, I was head coach so I never got involved in any transfer dealings. My sole responsibility was to look after the team and get them prepared and ready for the game.’

Carver admits that he will be judged on Premier League form but said that didn’t excuse the FA Cup exit. ‘It hurts me because I grew up watching the FA Cup and I’ve been to a final and lost and I’ve been to a semi-final with Sir Bobby and lost. And that wasn’t a nice feeling. 

'I went and watched a final when Kenny Dalglish was manager against Arsenal and I was in with the fans and I was so disgruntled and I was in with them. So I know how important the FA Cup is but ultimately Premier League football is very important.’
