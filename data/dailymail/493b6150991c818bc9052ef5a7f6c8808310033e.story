A beloved Standard Oil heiress who drove an old station wagon and wore jeans has shocked her former high school by leaving them $40 million in her will - and nothing to her relatives.

Ruth Bedford, the last surviving grandchild of Standard Oil director Edward T. Bedford, was two months shy of her 100th birthday when she passed away in her sleep at her Greens Farms, Connecticut home on June 15.

Bedford, who lived humbly despite her fortune, had told Foxcroft School, a small all-girls school in Middleburg, Virginia, that she was going to leave them money, but they only learned of the sum after her death.

The $40 million bequest is likely the largest gift ever made to an all-girls school and one of the largest gifts to a secondary school from a woman, school officials told the Washington Post.

'Our students will directly benefit as we expand the experiential learning that has always been a hallmark of a Foxcroft education, refresh our physical plant, and strengthen our scholarship offerings,' Cathy McGehee, Foxcroft's head of school, said in a statement.

Staff at the school, which has just 157 students, said some of the gift will be set aside to establish a scholarship in Bedford's name and some will be used to commemorate her love of theater.

Bedford attended the small countryside school between 1928 and 1932.

The institution, which has an equestrian program, had a lasting impact on Bedford, who was a talented rider and active on the basketball and cheerleading teams, her grandniece, Libby McKinney Tritschler, said. 

Accomplished: Bedford, top left with her basketball teammates, was a natural athlete who enjoyed horse riding, cheerleading and sailing. She later worked as a volunteer during WWII and a Broadway stage hand

Loved: Bedford, pictured right during her school days, also learned how to pilot a sea plane

She added that it was not surprisingly that Bedford, who was never married and had no children, did not leave anything in her estate for family members. 

Wealthy: She was the only surviving grandchild of Standard Oil's director Edward T. Bedfor

'It was never about the money for my family,' she told the Washington Post. 'Money wasn't what they lived off of. They really gave back to their community.'

Bedford was one of three surviving children of the son of Edward T. Bedford, who served as director of Standard Oil in the early 1900s, and grew up on her family's 17-acre estate in Westport.

She grew up seeing her father, industrialist, farmer and philanthropist Frederick T. Bedford, and mother donate large sums to local hospitals and charities.

After Bedford left Foxcroft, she served with the Red Cross during the London Blitz before moving to New York to work on Broadway as a Rodgers and Hammerstein production hand.

She also raced thoroughbreds that won stakes at Saratoga and Belmont, and became a skilled pilot after she had been inspired to take up the hobby by the man she loved.

She never married but she was known to have fallen for Briggs Cunningham, a millionaire race-car driver who later featured on the cover of Time.

Bedford took up flying, hoping she would get to spend more time with him because he often flew to Long Island on business, the Post reported.

Good life: After leaving school, she volunteered with the Red Cross and then moved to New York City

Strong: She had fallen in love with a millionaire race car driver Briggs Cunningham, pictured right, as a teenager and took up flying to impress him. But her sister married him and Bedford never wed

Thrill-seeker: Friends remembered Bedford as a skilled sailor, pilot, golfer and tennis player

But Cunningham's attentions were elsewhere - with her sister Lucie. The pair married in October 1929 and went on to have children. Lucie was known as a successful yachtsman.

Bedford never had a love interest after losing 'her one true love', her grand-niece said.

For the past five decades, she instead devoted her life to her community, her local hospital and her animals; she tended to pigs, llamas and thoroughbred horses.

She lived a humble life; she drove an Oldsmobile station wagon and donned jeans to muck out her horses. She also enjoyed drinking scotch.

She was also a skilled sailor, golfer, tennis player and aviatrix, and friends remembered her as 'generous, unpretentious, with a zest for life, a beautiful smile and laugh, and an interest in everybody around her no matter their position in society', Leesburg Today reported.

Thankful: Foxcroft School is in the countryside in Middleburg, Virginia and has just 157 students

The countryside school has 157 students - a quarter of whom are from 15 foreign countries - and yearly tuition us $50,900 for boarding and $42,900 for day students.

Its alumni include women from the Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon and Astor families.

Students will be informed of the gift on Tuesday.
