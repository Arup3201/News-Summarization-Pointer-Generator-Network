A brave boxer has fought against the odds to become a top martial artist - despite being born with part of one arm missing.

Nick Newell, 26, was born with his left arm only reaching just past the elbow after a congenital amputation caused part of the limb to become detached in the womb.

But he hasn't let his disability prevent him from living his dream of being a professional fighter after he won the title of XFC lightweight world championship.

Fighting to fight: Nick Newell now wants to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championships but the company president has refused to let him enter

And Newell, from Milford, Connecticut, now hopes to take his career to the next level by entering the Ultimate Fighting Championship - the largest mixed martial arts promotion company in the world which hosts all top-ranked fighters in the sport.

He told Eyewitness News: 'I think that whether you're missing a limb or you're not missing a limb, you should always be confident in yourself.

'Growing up, I was always looked at a little different. I've been like this my whole life and I don't know any other way.'

Newell joined the wrestling team at Jonathan Law High School in Milford where he became captain and an all-state wrestler. He then went on to become captain of his wrestling team at college.

Newell then began his career as a mixed martial artist four years ago and has built up a reputation as a talented fighter.

But that hasn't stopped UFC President Dana White throwing cold water on the idea of Newell fighting for his company.

Determined: Nick Newell competed in wrestling throughout school and college before going on to start a career as a martial arts fighter

When asked about the possibility, he responded: 'Never, no.

'It's hard to fight here with two arms. It's tough. There's guys that we bring in that are considered top guys on The Ultimate Fighter that don't ever really pan out and make it.

'Will the state of Nevada let him fight? Will the state of California let him fight? Would some of these bigger athletic commissions let him fight? Maybe he can get away with that in some of these other states.

'I don't know, fighting with one arm is just craziness to me.'

But Newell is determined to make it to the top of his profession.

He told MMA Fighting: '[The UFC] is where you can test yourself against the best guys in the world.

'I want to see where I stand among the world's elite fighters and I feel like I've earned my shot. Anyone else with my track record would be getting looked at.'

He insisted that he's 'not going anywhere' and just wanted a fair shot.

He told Eyewitness News: 'I'm far from invincible but I've proven that I'm more than capable. And all I'm asking for is my fair shake just like everyone else.'
