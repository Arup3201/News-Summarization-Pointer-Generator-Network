Who knew fatalities could be so fun? 

Funny guy Yousef Saleh Erakat of FouseyTube decided to make a video where he surprised unsuspecting people trapped in an elevator with him while dressed as a character from the fantasy martial arts video game, and film, Mortal Kombat.

The results, filmed somewhere in the United States, were both terrifying and hysterical.

Game on: Funny guy Yousef Saleh Erakat dressed as a character from Mortal Kombat (above) to scare people in elevators

Not his bae: One man actually shoved his girlfriend toward Erakat rather than protect her

Got to be going: These two left the elevator in a terror after they walked in on Erakat (fake) choking and throwing someone

Inspiration: A look at Raidan in the Mortal Kombat video game

Most people just screamed and jumped a little, but one man who is no doubt it very big trouble actually cowered behind his girlfriend and then pushed her towards the man who appeared ready to launch an attack in the elevator. 

There was also a man who was incensed at Erakat's yelling and wild hand motions and another who laughed hysterically throughout the entire thing.

As guests enter the elevator, the theme music would begin to play and the second the doors shut, Erakat, dressed as the character Raidan, the thunder god, would spring into action.

He would then quickly calm down the people, though one couple that ran for their lives after seeing him as he fake choked a friend may be scarred for life.

Laugh factor: This woman found the entire experience hysterical, and was at no point scared

Tough break: This group of guys got ready to beat on Erakat after the saw him (fake) fighting one of their friends

Playtime: These kids were both frightened and amused

Erakat himself almost got scarred for life too, when one group of boys pinned him to the ground and got ready to beat him after they say him kicking another man, but the comic was able to reveal the prank in time.

But hey, at least he got a taste of his own medicine.

This is the second Mortal Kombat video the 24-year-old has made, and just one of the many prank hidden camera stunts he has released since 2010.

While at first terrified, many found it very funny, except for one group of men who almost beat up Erakat
