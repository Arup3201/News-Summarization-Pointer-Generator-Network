Jailed: Last week, Ghoncheh Ghavami, from West London, was sentenced to a year in prison

The Foreign Office has been ridiculed after it claimed that data protection rules meant it could not tell the family of a British woman jailed in Iran what is being done to secure her release – because it first needed her permission.

Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested on June 20 after attempting to watch a men’s volleyball game with a group of about 40 women protesters in the Iranian capital Tehran.

Iran banned women from volleyball matches in 2012, claiming that they need protection from the lewd behaviour of male fans.

Last week, the law graduate, from Shepherd’s Bush, West London, was sentenced to a year in prison after being found guilty of ‘propagating against the ruling system’.

Before her sentencing, her brother Iman Ghavami contacted the family’s MP, Andy Slaughter, begging for help, and on October 3 the Labour MP wrote to the Foreign Office asking it to look urgently into the case.

Three weeks later, he received a response from Junior Minister Tobias Ellwood, who is responsible for constitutional matters in the Middle East, saying the department was taking the case ‘extremely seriously’.

But the Tory MP for Bournemouth East added: ‘You will understand that due to our obligations under the Data Protection Act I cannot go into detail of Ms Ghavami’s case without her express permission.

‘Once we have received this, my officials will keep you informed by forwarding updates.’

However, the Foreign Office has since been forced to back down from its initial response. A letter to Mr Slaughter from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘The Foreign Office takes its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act very seriously. However, I accept that, in the circumstances, you could not reasonably be expected to obtain authorisation from Ms Ghavami.’

Mr Hammond added that the matter was complicated further because the UK does not have an embassy in Iran and the country does not recognise Ms Ghavami – who has a UK and Iranian passport – as a British citizen.

Mr Slaughter said: ‘I was dismayed at the initial farcical letter from the Foreign Office but I now hope that together we can all do our utmost to bring Ghoncheh back home.

‘Most Mail on Sunday readers will find it hard to believe that a young woman – a British citizen – could be locked up for months in a foreign prison simply for wanting to attend a volleyball match.

‘But that is the shocking situation facing one of my constituents. Ghoncheh is a promising law graduate whose bright future in now in jeopardy as she suffers in an Iranian prison for something that us Britons would take for granted.

‘It is a testament to the key British value of tolerance that her case has caused such outrage over here. A petition calling for her release could soon reach one million signatures.

‘The matter is all the more urgent due to reports that she has been sentenced to one year in prison and is currently on hunger strike.’

There has been widespread outrage across the world over Miss Ghavami’s imprisonment. She was first detained by the morality police outside Tehran’s Azadi Stadium with around 40 other protesters after attempting to watch Iran take on Italy.

She was released shortly afterwards and wrote a blistering attack on the extremist state, courageously publishing it under her own name on Facebook.

She was then rearrested ten days later after returning to a police station to collect her belongings.

More than 700,000 people have so far signed an online petition by Amnesty International urging Iran’s theocratic regime to release her.
