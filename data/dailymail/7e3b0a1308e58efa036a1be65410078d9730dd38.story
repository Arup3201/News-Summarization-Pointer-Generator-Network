It seems the message is clear: men should give up control of the wine list, as they are twice as fearful of getting it wrong. 

Choosing wine is one of the things that makes Britons most anxious – and men are far more uneasy about it than women.

One in eight (11.5 per cent) men say what makes them most uncomfortable - even more than spiders - is choosing wine in a restaurant or to go with food at a party.

Incy wincy spider: Unsurprisingly, almost one in six Brits admit to being terrified by the arachnid

Significantly, women are far less perturbed by picking the right wine with only six per cent listing it as the thing that makes them most uncomfortable.

In terms of day-to-day events that make us feel uncomfortable, spiders still give us the creeps – almost one in six (16 per cent) of us admit to being scared by them.  

There are things even more unnerving than spiders and wine but, thankfully, they are not likely to crop up quite as much.

Under pressure: Both men and women said that job interviews were scary

Job interviews rank top for both women (28.5 per cent) and men (24.5 per cent). 

And, in a less formal context, both sexes hate being at a social occasion where they don't know anyone – 25 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men rank this as the situation that makes them most uncomfortable. 

The research was commissioned by an online wine specialist Naked Wine who surveyed 2,000 people to uncover how scared Brits were of ordering wine. 

Eamon FitzGerald Managing Director of Naked Wines said: 'As a social business we love delving in to what makes our  the public tick. It's unusual our survey showed that men find ordering wine more scary than spiders - but we aim to take the fear out of ordering wine and make it an enjoyable experience for customers.'
