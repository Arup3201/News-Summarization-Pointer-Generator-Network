Filipe Luis insists he is happy with his decision to join Chelsea this summer despite limited opportunities at the club so far.

The left-back moved to Stamford Bridge in a £16million switch from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid this summer and was expected to fill the birth vacated by Ashley Cole who joined Roma.

Having been a key man at Atletico Luis' hopes haven't hit fruition yet at Chelsea with the Brazilian overlooked by Blues' boss Jose Mourinho preferring Cesar Azpilicueta.

The 29-year-old isn't too fazed by his slow start though and is delighted to be plying his trade in west London.

'It's brilliant to be at this club, it's a great feeling. Every time I play and train, I feel I'm at a big club,' he told the London Evening Standard.

'Everyone wants to play. If you don't, normally you're not happy. But when I came here, I spoke with Mourinho and I knew I'd come to Chelsea to be a champion, not to be the best left-back or best crosser or something.

'When you work with Mourinho, you have to know that the group, the collective is above the individual. I don't think about myself right now.

'The team are doing a great job. We won the first four League games and drew the fifth one. I have nothing to complain about. I have to wait for my chance and when it comes I must make sure I don't go out of the first 11.'
