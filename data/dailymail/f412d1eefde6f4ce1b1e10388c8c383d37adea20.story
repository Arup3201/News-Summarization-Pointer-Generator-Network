A father has told how he managed to escape the Dark Knight Rises shooting - but was horrified to realise he had lost his four-month old son on the floor of the theatre in the chaos.

The infant was rescued by his mother who had a shrapnel wound to her leg but still managed to drag the child and their four-year-old daughter to safety.

Jamie Rohrs and Patricia Legarreta took their infant son Ethan and four-year-old daughter to the midnight screening in Aurora, Colorado, thinking the children would sleep through the movie as they sat on the second floor balcony.

When gunman James Holmes burst in and began shooting Ms Legaretta heard her fiance shout at her to get down on the floor.

She was then hit in the leg and fell to the floor herself.

Rohrs jumped over the seat with their baby son and says he considered playing dead.

'I'm trying to keep him low. And he's crying,' he toldÂ ABC News . 'People are running all over. I'm tripping and falling. I don't know if I laid him down or sat him down.

'I look up to see if I can run. I'm ducking, dodging, turning left, turning right. ... Every time you hear a gun shot, it's like 'Oh, I'm dead.'

'I'm just disoriented after I put him down," Rohrs said. "I'm just waiting for me to hit the ground and fall down dead. You could see the gunfire and people are dropping."

He says he tried to retrieve his son but eventually jumped over the balcony and fled.

But Ms Legratta saw Ethan as she lay on the floor with the wound to her leg that stretched from her upper thigh to waist.

She pulled the infant to him and ran out the theatre with her daughter and baby boy - only realising she had been hit when she made it outside.

Rohrs said he was horrified to realise his fiancee, son and daughter when he made it outside.

'My son's still in there,' he told ABC News. 'My girlfriend is still in there. I'm out here. Who leaves their child there?'

The couple then reunited outside the cinema, after Ms Legratta phoned her fiance who had driven away from the scene.

They had recently moved to Aurora from New Mexico and defended their decision to tak their children to the late night screening.

Rohrs said: 'We have to go out. We have to do things. You don't think you're going to get shot. You're just living your life.'
