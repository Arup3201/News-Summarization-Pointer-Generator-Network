Cardinal Vincent Nichols warned alarmist rhetoric about immigration caused distrust of foreigners

Britain’s top Roman Catholic cleric has accused politicians of using ‘alarmist’ language over immigration to fuel public anger at foreigners moving here.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, said most migrants ‘add’ to the nation’s wellbeing and warned against attempts to foster distrust of ‘all these people coming to this country’.

The row came as the UK Independence Party unveiled a controversial £1.5million poster campaign of against EU immigration.

The issue of immigration is likely to dominate in the run-up to the European Parliament elections on May 22.

The government has sought to tighten rules on migrants accessing benefits, housing and public services.

But Ukip argues that Britain can only control its borders if it leaves the EU altogether.

The party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’

Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’

But Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been forced to deny the posters are ‘racist’ amid growing concern about the impact of anti-immigration rhetoric.

Cardinal Nichols did not name Ukip directly but appealed to all sides to celebrate the contribution of immigrants rather than ‘anger and dismay’.

‘What I would appeal today is that the debate about immigration is done with a sense of realism and a sense of respect - and that it is not cushioned in expressions which are alarmist and evocative of anger or of dismay or distress at all these people coming to this country,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

‘We have to grow to appreciate the richness that immigration brings, not simply to the Catholic church but to the life of hospitals and many public sector areas where we are now embracing and dependent on people who come to this country willing to give and wanting to support their families back home.

‘The reality is that the vast majority of migrants to this country add to our well-being.’

Controversial:
 Ukip's new posters are being funded by £1.5m of funding from 
millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Skyes to launch its biggest ever 
publicity drive ahead of the European Parliament elections in May

Ukip is using £1.5 million of funding from millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Sykes to launch its biggest-ever publicity.

Critics compared the immigration posters with those used in the past by the far-right British National Party and Labour MP Mike Gapes said they were ‘racist’ and appealed to ‘decent’ voters to turn out to oppose Ukip.

But Mr Farage said Ukip was ‘standing up and speaking for ordinary people’.

He described his party as ‘non-sectarian and non-racist’.

Adverts: Under the slogan 'take back control of 
our country', the party complain that 75 per cent of British laws are made 
in Brussels and that UK taxpayers fund the 'celebrity lifestyle' of EU 
bureaucrats

‘There is no angry language. There is very cool and calm language,’ he told ITV’s Daybreak.

‘We are not against anybody from any part of the world.

‘But to have an open door to 485 million people from the rest of Europe, many from poor countries, many from countries where youth unemployment rates are as high as 60 per cent, means there is an influx of foreign labour into Britain, the likes of which we have never seen, and it is working families in Britain who have paid a huge price for that over the last 10 years.

‘If I was Romanian, I would come to London too. I don’t blame people from poor countries for coming here, but I think it is the job of the British Government to put the interests of our own people first.’

An
 ICM poll published yesterday suggested that Labour will win the 
European elections with 30 per cent of the vote, Ukip second on 27 per 
cent and the Tories a distant third on 22 per cent.

Senior
 Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said the posters were ‘extreme 
even by the standards of the Front Nationale’, the French far right 
party Mr Farage has tried to distance Ukip from.

The
 peer said: ‘This is divisive politics. The mask is off now, this has 
never been about Europe with them, but playing on fears of foreigners, 
when there are many British people working in the rest of the EU.

‘It really is in the gutter with the extremist parties of Britain’s past, when I thought we had got rid of those 50 years ago.’
