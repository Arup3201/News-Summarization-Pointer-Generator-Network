Tottenham defender Eric Dier has been ruled out of the England Under 21 international against Czech Republic through injury.

Dier suffered a black eye in Spurs' 4-3 win over Leicester on Saturday and the area has swollen up badly.

The Football Association announced on Monday that the 21-year-old would remain with the north London club for assessment this week.

Dier flicked on a Spurs corner to set up Harry Kane for the opening goal at White Hart Lane 

West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino has also been ruled out through injury

Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, has withdrawn from the Under 21 sqaud

Dier will therefore miss Friday's friendly in Prague, but he could return for the Young Lions' match against Germany at Middlesbrough three days later.

The FA also revealed Boro's on-loan Chelsea striker Patrick Bamford and Bournemouth forward Callum Wilson had withdrawn from Gareth Southgate's squad for the double-header through injury.

West Brom's Saido Berahino was also ruled out with a foot problem over the weekend so Southgate has called up Fulham striker Cauley Woodrow instead.
