They say a good referee should blend in to the extent that you barely know they're on the pitch.

But UEFA may have taken that mantra a step too far, after their new Champions League kit received criticism on its first outing in the tournament.

The new kit, a dark shirt, with pale grey shorts, appeared to clash with some of the teams on the opening day, particularly Arsenal in their away tie against Borussia Dortmund.

UEFA referees were wearing the new Adidas kit in all of Tuesday night's Champions League games

Arsenal and the referee both wore dark shirts in Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Tuesday night

It was hard to spot which one was the referee at times during Arsenal's trip to Borussia Dortmund 

The officials were dressed in all grey, with a darker shirt and pale shorts, prompting scorn on social media

The Gunners were wearing their third choice kit, with shirts, shorts and socks all dark blue, and this looked to be a little too close to the all-grey officials.

Several time Arsenal players appeared to leave the ball to the referee at the Westfalenstadion, as the new Adidas strip caused confusion.
