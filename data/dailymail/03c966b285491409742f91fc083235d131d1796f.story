An American teacher has been arrested in China on suspicion of molesting six children at an international school in Shanghai.

David McMahon, 32, is suspected of abusing four 
girls and two boys, aged from 6 to 10.

McMahon was detained last month, the day after one of the children and her parents
reported to police that she had been abused by him several times.

Police said in a statement that McMahon was suspected of
taking the children alone to the school library or open, empty areas on
the pretext of checking their homework, then forcing them to take their
clothes off and molesting them.

Another 6-year-old child reported having seen McMahon allegedly molesting classmates, police said.

The alleged victims are all foreign nationals, the 
official Xinhua News Agency reported. No further details about McMahon 
were released.

China has been grappling with a recent spate of child sex abuse cases allegedly involving school teachers or employees.

The cases - whose victims have mostly been young girls - have triggered public fury and a pledge by the country's Supreme People's Court to crack down on crimes against children.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
