Three people were charged Monday in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spy ring that tried to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, authorities said.

Evgeny Buryakov, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.

Monday's charges are linked to Buryakov's alleged covert work on behalf of Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, according to a criminal complaint.

Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, according to the complaint and the bank's website.

Buryakov was arrested Monday in the Bronx. 

The two other suspects are at large.

The alleged conspiracy began in 2012, following the 2010 expulsion of several Russian spies from the United States.

Federal prosecutors said Sporyshev, 40, worked as a Russian trade representative from November 2010 to November 2014, while Podobnyy, 27, was an attaché to Russia's mission to the United Nations from December 2012 to September 2013.

'The presence of a Russian banker in New York would in itself hardly draw attention today, which is why these alleged spies may have thought Buryakov would blend in,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement.

Each defendant was charged with acting as or helping Buryakov to act as an unregistered agent of a Russia, which carries a maximum 10-year prison term, and conspiracy.

Prosecutors said the case was built on physical and electronic surveillance of dozens of meetings, including several in which Buryakov met with an FBI agent posing as a wealthy investor who hoped to develop casinos in Russia.

They said Buryakov would seek information 'far outside' what a banker in his position would care about, including a list of Russian entities that might face future U.S. sanctions.

Buryakov was arrested on Monday in the Bronx borough of New York City. 

His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

The FBI Twitter account carried the news on its page on Monday afternoon 

Sporyshev and Podobnyy have not been arrested and no longer live in the United States but had diplomatic immunity while they were in the country, federal prosecutors said. 

'These charges demonstrate our firm commitment to combating attempts by covert agents to illegally gather intelligence and recruit spies within the United States,' Holder said in a statement. 

'We will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country - no matter how deep their cover.'

'Following our previous prosecution with the FBI of Russian spies, who were expelled from the United States in 2010 when their plan to infiltrate upper levels of U.S. business and government was revealed,' said Bharara, the new charges 'make it clear that - more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War - Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst.'
