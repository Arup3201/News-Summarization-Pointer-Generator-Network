A man and woman who met when they were serving as a ring bearer and a flower girl in a wedding have married – 20 years after their first trip down the aisle as children.

Briggs Fussy and Brittney Husbyn, of Mankato, Minnesota, married in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, on January 10, five years after being reunited in a college class.

'She turned around one day in class and said "I think I have a picture of you on my wall at home,"' Briggs, now 22, told Fox 9.

Flashback: The couple first met in 1995 while serving as a ring bearer and flower girl in a wedding

'It's funny how God's plan came into place. I didn't even know her before she turned around in class and told me that.'

Briggs and Brittney, who are students at Minnesota State University, Mankato, also shared what they remember of the wedding that first brought them together.

'I’m standing up there straight, and Brittney’s running around, making commotion,' Briggs said, adding that he recalls 'little glimpses' of the day that their respective relatives wed in 1995.

It turned out that it wasn't just Brittney's family who had kept photos of the nuptials two decades later.

'It was funny, the first time I ever went over to his house his mom whipped a picture off her wall and said "I've had a picture of you up in my house forever,"' said Brittney, who describes herself as the 'sappiest human ever'.

'It's fun to have something special like that to look back on,' she added.

Happy couple: While their fairytale story prompted guests to wonder whether the flower girl and ring bearer in their wedding might one day tie the knot, Briggs said they're both Brittney's cousins

Briggs' father, Scott Fussy, observed: 'If crazy equals love, they won't have any problem because they're both a little crazy.'

After Briggs and Brittney wrap up their remaining college classes, they plan to take a Caribbean honeymoon.

While the couple's fairytale romance likely prompted guests to wonder whether the flower girl and ring bearer in their wedding might one day tie the knot, Briggs said that's not the case - as they're both Brittney's cousins.

'They're related, so it's not going to be the same story,' he said.
