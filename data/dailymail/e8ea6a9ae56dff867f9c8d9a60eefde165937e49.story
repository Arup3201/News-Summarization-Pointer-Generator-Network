Media personality Mia Freedman has apologised after coming under fire for comparing gay people to paedophiles on live television, saying she 'made the wrong call.'

In a public statement on her MamaMia Blog, Freedman said she is devastated to have accidentally given 'ammunition to haters and bigots' by causing the words homosexuality and paedophilia to appear in the same headlines.

'Let me be absolutely clear: I unreservedly apologise to anyone I have upset, confused or outraged and to anyone who thought I would ever ever ever stand with bigotry or homophobia,' she said.

Freedman was lashed on social media for the comments she made on Channel Ten's The Project on Thursday night when talking about the idea of a national paedophile register.

'We accept that gay people can't change who they love and they're sexually attracted to, so why do we think that people who are sexually attracted to children can be rehabilitated?' she said on air. 

In her statement today, Freedman said she should have known better. 

'It’s dangerous to try and make a complex point about such an important topic in 10 seconds,' she said. 'You run a huge risk of your words being twisted, taken out of context and fed to the enemies of your cause.'

'I truly hope my heartfelt and sincere apology is accepted,' said Journalist and social commentator Mia Freedman after comparing gays to paedophiles on Channel Ten's The Project on Thursday night

'I should have known better': Mia Freedman says she made the 'wrong call' after being criticised for her comments linking gays with paedophiles on Channel Ten's The Project this week. 

On Thursday night's program, Freedman had gone on to say she agreed with the introduction of a register.

'Name and shame them. I want know where they are,' she said.

Freedman said today that she was trying to raise a point about society's capacity to rehabilitate sex offenders.

'I chose a bad example to try and do so,' she said. 'The point I was trying to make was this:

'Sexual orientation is real; it cannot be "cured" or "changed". We reject the idea that gay people chose to be gay. We reject the idea that straight people choose to be straight. As a society we have come to accept the intractability of sexual orientation.

'So why do we assume that people who have sexual feelings towards children can be ‘cured’ or have those feelings changed with therapy?' 

Freedman said many people have asked why she did not use heterosexuality as a comparison instead of homosexuality.

'So why didn’t I? I could have – and in hindsight I really, really wish I had,' she said. 

Freedman, who is a regular guest on The Project, took to Twitter immediately to apologise for the 'lousy analogy.'

'Apologies if it came across wrong,' the journalist tweeted.

'Mortified that I may have caused offence to some in the gay community who misunderstood my clumsily worded point in chat on @theprojecttv.'

The publisher of MamaMia was slammed on social media, with many labelling the comments offensive:  

'@MiaFreedman We have fought long and hard to not be considered sexual deviates. Thanks for the comparison. So disappointed.' Tracey Skittles tweeted. 

Jarrah James wrote: 'Shame on @miafreedman comparing the love between gay people as the same for a paedophiles love for children!'

But other viewers defended Freedman, saying they knew where she was coming from in her argument.

'@MiaFreedman @theprojecttv Ease up tigers. I would like to think that everyone knew what you were getting at,' B D Fiedler said.

While Robyn wrote: '@MiaFreedman @theprojecttv I Didn't find it offensive I thought your point was relevant but it took a sec to realise it wasn't homophobic.'

Freedman says Mama Mia is proud of its reputation for advocating for marriage equality and is a champion of the LGBTQI community.

'It’s something I’ve fought passionately for my whole life,' she said in her statement.
