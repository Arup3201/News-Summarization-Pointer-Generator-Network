A homeless man who spent five hours dangling upside down after getting stuck in a window has been cleared of burglary after a court heard he had 'just been trying to find somewhere to sleep.'

Carl Attar scaled two fences and shimmied up a drainpipe to reach the window 10ft above the ground of a university building.

But the 27-year-old homeless man got his legs caught and he was left suspended upside down by his ankles in freezing conditions.

Two passing students rang the Fire Brigade to rescue Mr Attar after they heard his panicked screams

He was found by two students who initially thought he was playing a prank, but dialled 999 when they realised he was stuck.

Mr Attar was arrested and charged with attempting to break into the Nottingham Trent University building on January 22.

He was found not guilty of burglary after Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard he was simply trying to find shelter warm for the night.

Chair of the bench, Keith Taylor, said: 'We are not satisfied that you entered the building with intent to steal.'

The court heard Daniel Dei Niet and fellow student Tom Burdett were passing the university's Arkwright building at 3am when they heard Mr Attar's cries.

They took photos of the man and made a video before realising the seriousness of the issue and deciding to phone emergency services.

In a 34-second video, which has since received more than 70,000 views on the internet, the students can be heard asking Mr Attar if there was any way they could help.

He was freed by firefighters and spent two days at Queen's Medical Centre before being charged with burglary with intent to steal.

Magistrates heard Mr Attar had nowhere to stay on the night and after taking amphetamines, found himself in Nottingham city centre.

Doctors told Mr Attar that they would have needed to amputate his leg if he spent a further 30 minutes suspended upside down from the window

Mr Attar said he saw the open sash window and decided to climb inside to find somewhere to sleep, but his plan went wrong when he became wedged.

Now the drug addict has vowed to 'change his ways' after medics told him he could have lost his legs if he had been suspended any longer.

Mr Attar, of no fixed address, said: 'Something trapped me in there.

'I don't know what it was. My legs just got caught and after a while I lost the circulation in my legs. I thought I was going to die.

'I had been there so long, my legs had pins and needles and my shins felt like they had been cut badly.

'Then I saw this guy and he asked me what I was doing up there. I said 'It doesn't matter what I'm doing, please help me'.

'I wasn't bothered about the students laughing, I just wanted to get down. Doctors told me another half an hour and I would have to have my legs amputated.

'I'm not a burglar. I was just trapped. It's like a lesson being taught. I'm changing my ways.'

The court heard Mr Attar had 40 convictions for 69 previous offences, mainly shop thefts, and that he had been served with an anti-social behaviour notice, having previously been found on University of Nottingham premises.

Ian Carter, defending, said: 'He was a homeless drug addict loner who had nowhere else to go. The question is, did he intend to steal?

'No. What he intended to do was find somewhere warm to go to sleep. He had no gloves and no means of carrying any items.'

During the trial, Mr Attar said he had not bothered looking for a hostel because he was not registered.

But a spokesman for homelessness charity Framework said: 'Help is available for people who find themselves in this situation.

Tom Burdett, left, who is studying History, said he initially thought Mr Attar, top right, was a drunk student 

'We will make every effort to find them accommodation in such cold weather.

'For this reason we would urge anyone who is about to sleep rough to contact our street outreach team by calling our rough sleepers' hotline on 0800 066 5356.'

Tom Burdett, 19, who is a first year student studying History, said: 'We initially thought it was a drunk student, because we've got friends who would probably end up doing something like that.

'But when we heard he was 27 I thought it might be a bit more sinister and he must have been trying to burgle the place.

'But I didn't know he was homeless, so I guess that makes a lot of sense.

'If you were in that situation you would just be desperate to find somewhere warm to sleep - it just went spectacularly badly for this bloke..'

Daniel Dei Niet, 20, a Property investment and Finance student, added: We had been walking home from a night out when we literally stumbled across the guy.

'All I could see was the lower half of the person's legs poking out through the open part.

'I called out 'are you OK?' The man's voice was crying: 'I've been here five hours, help!' '

'He was crying out shouting 'Let me go' and I dialled 999 and told the operator what had happened.

'Two fire engines and three police cars arrived and they had to cut the guy out of the window.

'The police took him away in handcuffs and we carried on home.'
