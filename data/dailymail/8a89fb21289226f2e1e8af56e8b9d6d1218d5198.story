Many cat owners recognise their feline friends have a killer instinct, but a scientist believes pet owners are partially responsible for cultivating their cat's wild streak.

A British anthrozoologist said that as many owners spay or neuter their tame pets and most kittens are born of stray or feral cats, felines effectively evolve in the wild.

He said cats are not as in-tune with human behaviour as their canine counterparts, as dogs have lived alongside humans since the late stone age and are more domesticated.

John Bradshaw said that as cats have only been domestically bred for a few thousand years, they are caught in a generic 'grey area' somewhere in between being a prehistoric killer and a domestic pet

John Bradshaw said that as cats have only been domestically bred for a few thousand years, they are caught in a generic 'grey area' somewhere in between being a prehistoric killer and a domestic pet.

He said human are partly responsible for cats' genetic situation as the less desirable or wild parts of their character stems from humans 'counter intuitive' way of breeding the animals, Medical Daily reported.

Dr Bradshaw of Bristol University said tamer cats that are most suited to the domestic environment are the least likely to have kittens as 88 per cent of pet cats are spayed or neutered by careful owners.

While this has been billed as responsible practice, he said cats do not become tamer as a domestic generic lineage is largely not allowed to emerge.

In fact, 80 per cent of kittens are born
to stray or feral cats, meaning cats effectively living in the wild 
pass on their more primitive traits and pets do not become more 
domesticated, according to Dr Bradshaw.

Dr Bradshaw said 80 per cent of kittens are born to stray or feral cats, meaning cats effectively living in the wild pass on their less domestic traits and pets do not become tamer. He believes the way kittens play is a clue to cats' killer instinct

The anthrozoologist said cats are not as in-tune with human behaviour as their canine counterparts, as dogs have lived alongside humans since the late stone age

He said that geneticists have found a small number of genes that define the domestic aspects of a cat and 'if we can identify those, then maybe we'll generate a cat that is more suitable for urban living than the current model is'.

Dr Bradshaw said that while cats might look regal and sophisticated and owners like to think of them as intelligent and independent, their inscrutable behaviour might occur because of the mixture of modern and ancient animal instinct.

'The cat's domestication is incomplete, in terms of its need to continue hunting and also in terms of its ability to socialise.

'One of the consequences of that is it has a rather unexpressive face.'

He also noted that the way cats play indicates they are not completely tame as even as kittens they systematically map their environment and hunt for prey - whether it's rodents or a ball of string - before striking.
