The mummified remains of a stroke victim who went missing from his hospital bed three years ago have been found in a store cupboard just metres from his room.

Primo Zanoli, 65, was being treated at Baggiovara Hospital in Modena, Italy, when he disappeared on New Year's Eve in 2011 and was never seen again.

Italian media reports have said the family have never stopped looking for Mr Zanoli. 

Friends even set up a Facebook page called 'Don't Forget Primo Zanoli' but had not had a single response to their pleas for information about what happened.

Police believe they have found the mummified remains of Primo Zanoli, 65, in a store cupboard metres from the hospital room he was staying in three years ago

The group's description says they are determined to find out the truth, adding: 'You can not disappear into thin air from a hospital.'

Now, police believe his body has been found hidden in a small storage room in the hospital only a few metres from what had been his bed.

Police spokesman Luigi Angelo said: 'We are awaiting the result of DNA tests but the evidence seems overwhelming. 

'Now we have to establish how he died and how he got into the room.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'It cannot be said precisely yet whether this is the body of the patient who went missing.'

Local reports said Mr Zanoli's family have never stopped looking for him and friends set up a Facebook page
