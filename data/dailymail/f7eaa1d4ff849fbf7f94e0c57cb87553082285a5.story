A social media star who tried to record a video of himself dancing down the aisle of a plane dressed in nothing but his skintight Speedo's was detained by police when the joke backfired.

Jerome Jarre, a Vine star with 7.5 million followers, described how he  made a video of himself coming out of the bathroom wearing bright yellow swimming trunks and carrying a green inflatable duck.

But one member of the American Airlines cabin crew on board the flight from Mexico to Miami  was not amused and called the police to meet him at the gate when he landed at Miami airport.

Vine star: Jerome Jarre was on the flight from Mexico to Miami when he attempted the prank

Arrested: Jarre tweeted that he was landing in Miami and was about to be arrested and would need help

Hashtag: Jarre  asked his followers to tweet and retweet with the hashtag, #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT

Jarre, a star, who creates short videos for the video-sharing website Vine, tweeted that he was about to be arrested at Miami Airport and asked  his followers to help him  on Tuesday.

He tweeted: ‘Speedos are great on the beach but no one wants to see them dancing down the aisle at 30,000 feet.’ 

He then begged his 867,000 Twitter followers and his 7.5 million Vine followers to tweet and retweet with the hashtag, #AmericanAirlinesCHILLOUT, to make the hashtag a trending topic.

Within hours, it was the top-trending topic in the United States. 

Yet, when he landed at Miami Airport over 11 police officers were there to greet him  and they took him to meet with FBI agents, who told him they were on the phone with Washington.

He tweeted that he saw FBI agents printing out some of the tweets that he had asked his fans to send.

‘It was pretty funny to see,’ Jarre said. 

Explanation: The Vine star explained that he was trying to make the video whilst he was on the flight to Miami 

The airline told ABC News that Jarre will not face any charges, despite police being called to the incident. 

He told ABC News that his ‘goal was not to scare anyone but make people laugh.’

And, there was no record of his detention with either the Miami-Dade Airport Police nor the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at the airport.

Freedom: Jarre tweeted 'I am free!!! You are all the best friends in the (sic) workd [world]

Within three hours of landing, Jarre was back on Twitter and told fans that he was free to get on his next flight to Brazil. He then tweeted a celebratory picture to his fans. 

Jarre's followers have made him so popular that he reportedly walked out on a $1 million ad deal this week, because he says he's done making videos for profit.

 

A YouTube video shows Jarre going into his agency and turning down $1 million for a one-year contract with the 'world's biggest brand,' which was not named. 

Despite his latest stunt backfiring,  the Vine star was back on Twitter on Wednesday, starting the day by saying hello to his loyal band of 867,000 Twitter followers.
