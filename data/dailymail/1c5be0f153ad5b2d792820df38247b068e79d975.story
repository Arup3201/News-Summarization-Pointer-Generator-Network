James Brokenshire, Minister for Security at the Home Office, said the publication of files has harmed national security

Security services are likely to lose track of terrorists and cyber criminals thanks to the Guardian’s publication of the stolen Snowden files, a security minister has warned.

Huge damage has been inflicted on the UK’s national security because of the newspaper’s coverage of classified material taken by former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Home Office minister James Brokenshire was speaking in a Commons debate on the Guardian and its decision to reveal that GCHQ has access to the mass surveillance of citizens’ emails and phone calls.

‘There is no doubt that Snowden’s actions and the publication of material stolen by him have damaged UK national security,’ Mr Brokenshire said.

He said anyone publishing details of intelligence gathering was giving away the capabilities that ‘we have relied on in recent years to stop terrorist plots, disrupt organised crime and put cyber criminals – including those exploiting children or illegally proliferating arms – behind bars.’ 

He added: ‘Once an adversary knows if and how we can read their communications they will change their behaviour.’

Mr Brokenshire suggested that this kind of action had led to the September 11 terrorist atrocity going ahead undetected.

When it was revealed that Osama bin Laden’s communications were being disrupted in the late 1990s, ‘we didn’t hear from him again until September 2001’.

The Tory minister said he could not go into detail about the ‘damage’ done by the Guardian but said: ‘We expect to lose coverage of some very dangerous individuals and groups.

The threat remains very real. And only 
through the tireless efforts of the police and intelligence agencies do 
we keep those who wish us harm at bay. Secret intelligence gives us that
 edge.

The minister claimed whether Edward Snowden was a traitor or a whistleblower, his actions had endangered British Intelligence's ability to do its job

Regardless of whether you see Snowden as a whistleblower or traitor, revealing our capabilities destroys it.’ 

Tory MP Julian Smith, who initiated the debate, accused the Guardian of ‘stepping beyond any reasonable definition of journalism’ by ‘copying, trafficking and distributing files on British intelligence and GCHQ’.

It was guilty of ‘risking their lives and those of their families’, he suggested. And he criticised the Guardian for sharing its information with the New York Times.

In a statement on its website,  the Guardian said: ‘When responsible journalists working on the  same story share documents  they are engaged in journalism,  not terrorism.’
