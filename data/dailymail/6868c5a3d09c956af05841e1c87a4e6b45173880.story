Southampton coach Ronald Koeman has confirmed an interest in Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar.

Koeman is expecting to lose Dejan Lovren to Liverpool this week for £20m while Southampton have rejected Cardiff's £3m bid for Jose Fonte.

Koeman also has an interest in Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk.

Targeted: Southampton want Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar

On the move: Koeman is hoping Vlaar can replace Croatian defender Lovren, who has joined Liverpool

He said: 'Ron would definitely be an option. But I think he won’t be cheap right now. Let’s just wait and see.'

Vlaar was one of the defensive stars of the World Cup, making it all the way to the semi-finals with Louis van Gaal's Holland.

And he was exceptional for 120 minutes against Argentina, before unfortunately missing a penalty in the shootout.
