Two armed raiders held up three couples leaving a St Louis restaurant shouting: 'This is for Michael Brown,' before running off with their belongings. 

One of the men was holding a silver gun as the diners, aged between 59 and 61 left the Eleven Eleven restaurant on Mississippi Avenue, in St Louis, Missouri. 

St Louis Police confirmed that the three couples were walking north on the west side of the street after leaving the restaurant around 11pm on Saturday. 

The three couples left Eleven Eleven restaurant in St Louis at 11pm on Saturday, when they were attacked 

Michael Brown, pictured, was shot dead by police in Ferguson Missouri on August 9 leading to civil unrest 

Thousands of people took to the streets following Mr Brown's shooting to protest against police brutality 

One of the men brandished a silver gun. Police said both men were black and in their early 20s. The first man was described as being of thin build and wore a white tank-top and blue jeans. He had medium length twisted braids and had a small sliver handgun. 

The second man was 5'8 and was wearing all black clothes with a black ski mask.  

According to KSDK.com the Michael Brown reference related to the shooting on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri of an unarmed black man.

Both suspects fled the scene after the robbery.  

Eleven Eleven restaurant owner Paul Hamilton told KSDK.com: 'We feel for our customers. This is an unfortunate incident. We've been here 11 years and nothing like this has ever happened. It's unfortunate that two young guys would do something like this.' 

The six diners left Eleven Eleven restaurant and headed north on Mississippi Avenue when they were attacked

Sixth Ward Alderman Christine Ingrassia who represents the area said: 'From the time I've spent in Ferguson and what I've watched from the media, I am 100 percent sure that Mike Brown's family would not think this robbery had anything to do with Mike Brown nor would the rest of us. 

'There are a lot of people in our community who are using this Mike Brown situation to let the community know there is something else bubbling below the surface. There are racial issues. There are issues of cyclical poverty here, so I think it's important to at least take note of it.'
