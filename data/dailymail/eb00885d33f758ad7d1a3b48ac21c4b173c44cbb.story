A row of eight Sydney homes sold for what it believed to be more than a total of $30 million – three times more than valued two years ago.

Following six months of negotiations with property developers CBRE, the eight homeowners received up to $3.6 million each for the 1920s bungalows in Epping after the homes were individually valued for about $1.2million in early 2012, the Australian Financial Review reported.

The blocks of land at 11- 27 Cliff Road could pave the way for up to 138 apartments under new planning laws allowing maximum density of five storey developments around the centre of Epping in Sydney’s north-west.

The five-bedroom home at 15 Cliff Road was sold for only $1,230,000 back in July 2007

Developers have had their eye on property in the area since the Department of Planning and Infrastructure earmarked the area for medium and high density development in March last year.

The deal for the eight properties was sealed on Friday after more than six months of negotiations.

Resident Fiona Maher, a resident of 16 years with her three children, said she was relieved the bidding process was finalised.

Her daughter, Bronte Maher told the Australian Financial Review that it had been a stressful but exciting time.

'Originally it was shocking to see the quiet Cliff Road and these streets around here being developed into apartments, but when we saw building down the street we knew it was only a matter of time,' she said.

The five-bedroom home at 15 Cliff Road was sold for $1,230,000 in July 2007 with the 853 square metre block boasting an elegant lounge room, dining room and family room, a pool, a two-car garage and manicured gardens.

While the house at 11 Cliff Road, described as a spacious three bedroom home featuring separate lounge, dining and family rooms with solid timber floorboards, was sold for just $675,000 in December 2001.

Daily Mail Australia contacted CBRE who declined to comment on the sale.
