A suped-up quad bike which has is powered by a Ferrari engine and has a top speed of 150mph has been developed by engineers in France.

The Wazuma V8F, which costs £160,000, bears striking similar to the Batmobile driven by Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Rises.

The four-wheeler boasts a 3-litre V8 engine which was sourced from a 1970s Ferrari 308 sports car.

'Masterpiece': The French designed quad bike has been hailed as a design triumph by engineers Lazareth

Star quality: The £160,000 machine looks like the Batmobile driven by Christian Bale in the Dark Knight films

The Wazuma's manufacturer's, Lazareth, say the quad bike develops 250bhp in a vehicle weighing just 650kg.

This gives the machine a power-to-weight ratio of 384bhp per tonne, the same as a Ferrari 458 Spider, and the potential to reach 150mph.

But with a standard quad bike from the likes of Honda typically costing around £8,000, only a select few will be able to afford the Wazuma's huge price tag.

Lookalike: The Wazuma has been likened to the new-design Batmobile from the latest Batman films

For the price, owners will get  BMW M3 gearboxes and high performance Brembo disc brakes to stop the 18-inch wheels.

The Wazuma V8F uses three wheel geometry, with two largely spaced front wheels and two narrower spaced wheels attached at the rear. It has been fitted with the lights from a Nissan 350Z.

A statement from Lazareth said: 'The Wazuma V8F Matt Edition is a unique masterpiece, which is simple, aggressive and offers high performance.'
