A pastor from Bellevue, Washington, has produced an inventive - and hilarious - video, which seeks to educate people on how they can better phrase their questions to adoptive families, in order to avoid causing offense.

Jesse Butterworth, 36, the father of two biological sons and one adopted daughter, Harper, two, has made a three minute YouTube tutorial on the matter, using an unlikely analogy to illustrate his point.

'If you wouldn’t say it about a boob job, don't say it about an adoptive family', he reasons.

The video, billed as 'A public service announcement from adoptive families everywhere', has scored over 18,500 views and a rapturous applause since it was uploaded earlier this week, and stars Mr Butterworth playing a number of comedy roles himself.

In it, he re-enacts some of the things people have said to him in regards to his daughter, who was born in Ethiopia.

'Are those real?' he feigns, leering at a woman's chest. And then, to the same woman holding his daughter, 'Is that your real daughter?!'

At which point, Mr Butterworth steps in to respond to the inquiry. 'Yup, she's real, she's not a unicorn,' he says, deadpan, before instructing his audience that their correct phrasing should be: 'Is she your biological daughter?'

'Weeew, where'd you get those?' he squeals animatedly in the next clip, pointing at the woman's chest, and then, indicating his daughter: 'Where did you get her from?'

To which Mr Butterworth responds: 'As adorable as she is, my daughter actually isn't a 'trendy accessory.' The correct question in this instance? 'Where is she from?' according to the proud dad.

When juxtaposing the question of whether the woman got to 'pick out' her own boobs, to someone asking whether he got to 'pick' the daughter he wanted, the pastor-turned-jokester has an amusing response.

'Nope, we didn't actually go and haggle... and try to find the cutest little red-headed orphan. That only happens in musicals,' he says.

The question we should be asking, he points out, is: 'How does the adoption process actually work?'

He concludes his lessons in the art of delicacy with a somewhat poignant comparison.

'Aww, did you get them because you couldn't have boobs of your own?' he asks, with mock pity. And then warns: 'This is probably a question you want to avoid altogether.

'Because adoption isn't always the result of infertility - and even if it was, it's none of your business.'

Mr Butterworth and his wife Maria were inspired to create the tutorial after one of their first outings with Harper, to a restaurant, was interrupted by the insensitive questions from the couple's waitress.

The new father spoke to TODAY Moms about the incident. 'I really, really, really don’t think that people are trying to be mean,' he maintains.

'People are curious, that’s human nature and it’s natural to ask questions,' he goes on. 'So we were thinking, what’s a way that we could help people just put language around it?'

He shrugs off the suggestion that he shouldn't be talking about 'boob jobs', revealing that he 'appreciates real talk', and relished the opportunity to inject humor into a positive and important message.

'The truth is... I’m trying to be incredibly protective of my daughter who doesn’t understand [the comments] yet,' he says.

'But at one point, she will, and the last thing I want her to feel is that she is a lesser member of my family.'
