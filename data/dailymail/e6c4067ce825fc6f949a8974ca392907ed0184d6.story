A devoted wife shed five stone to give her husband one of her kidneys and save his life.

Pat Moule, 69, slimmed down from 16 stone nine pounds after surgeons told her she was ‘too fat’ to have a transplant operation for David, 72.

The retired couple, who have been married for nearly 50 years, were devastated when doctors told them Mr Moule’s failing kidneys were functioning at just 12 per cent.

When they broke the news a year ago, Mrs Moule couldn’t walk up the stairs without getting out of breath and was told she was too overweight to undergo the vital op.

Determined to help her husband, Pat managed to shed the extra pounds and passed stringent tests marking her out as a compatible donor.

Mrs Moule, from Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'When you love someone as much as I love David it really isn’t a big decision to make.

'I am just so grateful that I am compatible enough with him to do it.

'We have been through a lot together and sometimes there are things that drive couples apart and then there are things that pull you closer together. That is what love is all about.'

The thought of losing her ‘best friend’, spurred Mrs Moule on to join Slimming World and buy an exercise bike.

This new diet and fitness regime helped the five foot eight inch tall retired personnel manager shrink from a size 26 to a size 14.

At 11 stone five pounds, she is a shadow of her former self and is counting the days until the transplant surgery - which carries a one-in-3,000 risk of death.

Mrs Moule said: 'David is my best friend as well as my husband and I honestly cannot imagine not having him with me.

Devoted: Mrs Moule said 'I would not want to be here without him'

'I would not want to be here without him and I know that by losing this weight it will make my life better as well.

'We will be able to do so much more.'

Mr Moule, a retired research engineer, was first diagnosed with kidney disease more than 20 years ago.

He now suffers from End Stage kidney failure, a deteriorating condition that has no cure.

Mrs Moule said: 'When we were first told we thought that was it, all over. David’s condition affects everything - he gets very tired and only has to be active for about five minutes before he has to rest.

'But we were told it was only ever going to get worse.

'The hospital mentioned a transplant and asked if there was anyone in the family who could help.

'I immediately wanted to help but the fact was I was obese. The doctor took one look at me and said "No, you are too fat.£'

Mr Moule, a retired research engineer, says he has mixed feelings about his wife’s sacrifice.

He added: 'For me there are mixed feelings, especially about putting Pat through this but I can see how this can make our life a lot better.

'The reality is I am only going to get worse.

'My fear is if it doesn’t work Pat will have gone through all of this for nothing.'

Mrs Moule is more optimistic.

'I am not thinking about it not working,' she said.

'If I don’t do this I would always think ‘what if?’ for the rest of my life.

'At least I will know I have done everything I can do. He is everything to me.'

The couple are still waiting for a date for surgery.
