Restaurant owners across the country have been stocking up on Sriracha after learning that the hot sauce plant will remain closed through mid-January.

Last week, the state of California ordered Huy Fong Foods to halt production at its Irwindale plant for 30 days, citing a new rule enforced by the Department of Public Health that requires a 30-day hold on the product, to ensure that bacteria isn't gathering in the bottles.

But while the company has claimed that there is enough hot sauce in stock to last until mid-January, when the factory reopens, Sriracha enthusiasts are taking no chances.

Jennifer Saesue, general manager of OBAO Hellâ€™s Kitchen, told DNAinfo: 'We've stocked up since a couple weeks ago, when we got word of a possible impending shortage.'

She claims that she has enough Sriracha at the New York restaurant to last another three months, just in case.

And Kristine Mana-ay, executive chef of The Windsor in the West Village, said she was very disheartened to learn of the factory closure.

She goes through about two dozen 12-ounce bottles of Sriracha a week, and uses it for her popular chicken wing recipe.

'One of my friends told me about it and I was like, "Oh no! Why? Oh my God! I'm gonna die!"' she said.

'I am concerned. People will be crushed - it's our most-used condiment'

For Ben Thach, who works at Kim Son Vietnemese restaurant in Houston, Texas - where customers go through around 100 bottles of Sriracha a week - the shortage could mean trouble for business.

'I am concerned,' he told the Chron. 'People will be crushed, it's our most-used condiment.'

According to Health department 
spokeswoman Anita Gore, 'Holding products for a period of time at a 
specified pH level is one method of controlling those microorganisms.'

Once the Huy Fong factory is given the green light, it can resume production of its popular rooster sauce.

This isn't the first time hot sauce fans have lived in fear of a Sriracha shortage, or #Srirachapocalypse, as it was nicknamed on Twitter.

In November, Huy Fong was ordered to stop production on a partial basis after residents who lived near the factory complained of noxious odors.

Irwindale residents sued the company, claiming that the spicy smells emanating from the hot sauce plant were resulting in various health risks including asthma, heartburn and nosebleeds.

In November, a judged ordered Huy Fong to stop producing the odors until air-quality experts could determine how to mitigate them.

But not everyone has suffered from this hot sauce setback.

Lisa Kartzman, a spokeswoman for Roland Foods, which produces its own version of Sriracha sauce, says the temporary shutdown will be good for her own business.

'You don't wish this on anyone,' she told DNAinfo, 'but certainly it's opened doors for us and we expect that to continue.'
