He wriggled, he struggled ... and then he broke free.

Prince George made a determined crawl for freedom as he watched his father play polo yesterday.

First he fidgeted in his mother’s arms and then, when she put him down on the ground, he was off – straight into the path of a polo pony.

Luckily, the Duchess of Cambridge was on hand to scoop up the playful prince before he could get into any trouble.

Perhaps
 he felt left out at seeing other men in his family – his father William
 and his uncle Harry – taking part in the match at Cirencester Park Polo
 Club in Gloucestershire.

Held to raise money for charity, both
 princes have made a habit of playing in the match, with the Duke of 
Cambridge refusing to miss it even when the birth of his son was 
imminent last year.

The 11-month-old even grabbed a polo stick in an attempt to join in the fun.

When
 he wasn’t exploring on his own, he held his mother’s hand and toddled 
around the polo field, looking smart in his white polo shirt teamed with
 red and white striped dungarees and black shoes.

He
 was also seen to kick his first ball in public – a tap with his left 
foot, perhaps indicating that like his father, grandfather Prince 
Charles he is left-handed. His great-grandmother the Queen is right-handed.

William
 and Harry were competing on opposing teams in the Jerudong Trophy polo 
match. Both princes regularly participate in the charity event, with 
William refusing to miss it even when the birth of his son was imminent 
last year.

At one point 
yesterday, the duke wandered over to offer his little boy a sip of 
water. It was his first Father’s Day with his son and heir.

Kate
 was dressed for Mummy duty, in a practical pair of skinny blue jeans, a
 white and blue-striped Breton top from Me + Em, one of her favourites, 
and beige and white loafer-style shoes.

This
 year's event was a family affair with Prince George giggling happily as
 his mother showed him the ropes and allowed him to grab on to a mallet 
while walking through the pony lines.

The
 Duchess herself was typically stylish and wore her favourite Me + Em 
breton striped top with a pair of skinny dark blue jeans and a chic pair
 of beige and white loafers. 

Beaming
 broadly, she smiled as proud father Prince William, who was enjoying 
his first Father's Day, made his way over to his wife and child during a
 break in play, even giving Prince George a slug of his water - much to 
the baby's delight.

And the family weren't the only royals to indulge in a polo match today. The Queen, fresh from celebrating her official birthday yesterday, joined the Duke of Edinburgh to watch the action during the Cartier Polo Cup, held at Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park.

Elegant in royal blue Angela Kelly, the monarch was on smiley form as she toured the ground and watched play get underway ahead of a busy week which includes five scheduled appearances at Royal Ascot next week.

A keen 
racing fan, the Queen's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans 
more than 60 years, and began with the handful that she was left by her 
father George VI.

Since
 then, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, 
including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom 
Derby, although she has managed a second place finish with Aureole in 
1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

 to head: Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge face off across the

opposing teams

On his way: Prince Harry, who spent much of yesterday making the Duchess of Cambridge laugh during Trooping the Colour, was playing in the Jerudong Trophy

While the Derby has so far eluded her, 
the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, 
among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. 
Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 
and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, 
Royal Ascot was the scene of another triumph for the Queen, after 
her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup - much to the obvious delight of the monarch.

And
 it seems that this year's event, which opens on Tuesday, could prove 
just as lucky. 'Oh, I think she absolutely has a chance this year - 
without any question,' reveals Royal Ascot's head of international 
racing, Nick Smith.

'She
 has a fighting chance of winning the Gold Cup for the second year 
running with Estimate but she will also have a couple of other runners.'

Her appearance at next week's Royal Ascot
 will be the latest in a series of engagements, which began two weeks ago 
with the State Opening of Parliament and a state visit to France for the
 D-Day celebrations, before visits to a school and Trooping the Colour this week.
