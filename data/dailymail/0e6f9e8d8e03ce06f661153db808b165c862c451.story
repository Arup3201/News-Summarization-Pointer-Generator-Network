British jihadis fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have pledged to send militants to fight police in the riot-hit American city of Ferguson, Missouri - providing the protesters embrace Islam.

The city has seen widespread disorder after a police officer escaped punishment for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager, and now the Islamic extremists are attempting to take advantage of the anti-authoritarian feeling to convince those involved to adopt ISIS' radical ideology.

Using the slogan 'From #IS 2 Ferguson', Birmingham-born jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 - who has adopted the nom de guerre Abu Hussain al-Britani - this morning tweeted a photograph of a hand-written letter urging the Ferguson rioters to 'reject corrupt man-made laws like democracy' and declare their allegiance to ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Pledge: The note Birmingham-born jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 posted on Twitter today is titled 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' and contains a promise to send militants to the Missouri city if protesters pledge allegiance to ISIS

Miliants: The note was accompanied by a photograph of a number of masked young men posing with assault rifles and mobile phone cases bearing the black and white logo of the Islamic State

The note Hussain posted on Twitter today is titled 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' and contains a promise to send militants to the Missouri city if protesters pledge allegiance to ISIS. 

It reads: 'We hear you and we will help you if you accept Islam and reject corrupt man-made laws like democracy and pledge your allegiance to Caliph Abu Bakr and then we will shed our blood for you and send our soldiers that don't sleep, whose drink is blood, and their play is carnage.' 

A militant calling himself Abu Dujana urged the Ferguson protests to carry out acts of violence

Underneath the picture Hussain tweeted: 'Accept Islam & give bayah [allegiance] to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi & then we will send u soldiers that don't sleep! - #IS #Ferguson'.

The note was accompanied by a photograph of a number of masked young men posing with assault rifles and mobile phone cases bearing the black and white logo of the Islamic State. 

It is understood the men in the photograph are militants based in ISIS-held areas of Syria and Iraq, and that one of the men is 20-year-old Hussain.

Another militant, who uses the Twitter handle @Abu 3antar Britani and is also thought to be British, tweeted: 'From #IS to #Ferguson we heard your call and we are ready to respond! #FergusonDecision #BeLikeMalcolmX #FightBack'.

A third jihadi using the nom de guerre Abu Dujana subsequently posted a photograph of a large knife being brandished by somebody wearing a glove made by the American sports brand Nike.

'For how long will you let these govts oppress u. Draw ur knives and show them a response!! #FergusonDecision #IS,' he wrote.

Terror: British jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 - who has adopted the nom de guerre Abu Hussain al-Britani -used the slogan 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' to share the note pledging support for Ferguson protesters

Abu Dujana later urged people to learn about Bilal Ibn Rabah, a freed slave who was one of the Prophet Mohammed's closest companions.

He posted: 'Read the story of Bilal Ibn Rabah oh people #Ferguson and see how an oppressed slave became a hero & warrior through Islam.'

Today's developments are far from the first time ISIS militants have spoken about Ferguson. 

In fact the opportunistic terrorists have repeatedly looked to take advantage of the anti-establishment feeling in the city by calling for the demonstrators to embrace extremist Islam.

'Chilling': The links between Ferguson and ISIS go right back to the first protests in August, when a CNN news report appeared to show a man holding a placard reading 'ISIS is here'

The militants' attempts to hijack the protests in Ferguson appear to have two intentions. 

Firstly the militants seem to believe that Ferguson allows them to portray the US as promising black people fair treatment and equality, but treating them with violence and oppression.

Secondly ISIS is evoking the names of a number of black civil rights leaders - many of whom, including Malcolm X, were Muslims and members of the Nation of Islam. 

In drawing comparisons with the civil rights movement, the militants appear to trying to attract new converts from among the many protesters.

The images inspired ISIS sympathisers around the world to use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS to urge the protesters to embrace radical Islam.
