Yeehaw!: The Texas lottery tweeted tonight that they have a Powerball winner somewhere in their state 

Three winners: The winning numbers for the $564.1 million jackpot are 11-13-25-39-54 as revealed in the drawing on Wednesday night

The $500 million pot - which equates to a cash value of  $337.8 million - has been building steadily for two months. 

If no one were to win the Powerball tonight then the jackpot for the next drawing on February 14 could have equaled $650 million making it one of the largest  lottery game jackpots in U.S. history.

To win, the players needed five numbers and the Powerball number. The odds of winning are one in 175 million.

Each ticket costs just $2.  

The lottery is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   

The Powerball jackpot was last won on November 29. A Washington woman who bought her first-ever lottery tickets on a whim on Thanksgiving Day won $90 million.   

February 2014 was the last time that the Powerball reached the current prize amount. 

Jackpot winners receive either payments over 29 years or
a smaller cash lump sum.

The Powerball jackpot  reached $500 million for Wednesday night's draw, making it the fifth largest prize in U.S. history

Powerball's biggest ever jackpot was awarded by the Multi-State
Lottery Association - a cool $590.5 million went to the holder of
a single winning ticket in 2013.

The association also operates
the Mega Millions jackpot, which awarded a top prize of $656
million three years ago.

The Powerball is drawn on
Wednesdays and Saturdays at 10.59pm in Tallahassee, Florida.

Powerball sales reached nearly $5 billion last year for game
tickets that are sold through more than 210,000 lottery
terminals. Each ticket costs $2.

The odds of winning are slim and people are more likely to die from vending machines than win, according to the Daily Beast. 

The odds of matching all five normal numbers drawn without matching the sixth 'Powerball' number are one in 5million.
