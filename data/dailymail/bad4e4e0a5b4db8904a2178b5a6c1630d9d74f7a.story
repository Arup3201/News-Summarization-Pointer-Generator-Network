The widow of the late rock singer Phil Everly has opened up about his long struggle with the lung disease that took his life.

Everly, half of Grammy-winning duo The Everly Brothers, passed away in January this year, aged 74.

After a life-long smoking habit, the Bye Bye Love singer was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2011.

His widow Patti, who has openly blamed the lung disease on his smoking, spoke about how Everly had to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went in his last years.

Although Everly quit smoking in 2001, the habit had done permanent damage to his lungs and he started experiencing problems that eventually ended his singing career in 2004.

At his last public appearance in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of fame, Everly was struggling to catch his breath as he addressed the crowd.

'It went from mild COPD to severe. He skipped medium,' Patti Everly told The Tennessean.

'When I met him, he was 55 and taking nothing but vitamins. By the end he was taking 20 medications, and hooked up to oxygen 24/7, carrying it with him.'

'In the middle of the night, you look over to see if they're still breathing. Pretty soon, all you're waiting for is death.'

In January this year, Phil Everly died in hospital in Burbank, Los Angeles.

At the time, Patti said: 'We are absolutely heartbroken. He fought long and hard.'

The Everly Brothers were best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close vocal harmonies and dominated charts on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 60s.

Their biggest hits included Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Bye Bye Love. 

Their unique vocal style directly influenced The Beatles – who even referred to themselves early in their career as 'the English Everly Brothers'.

The Everly Brothers still hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history.

During the height of their success, the crooners charted nearly three dozen hits on the Billboard Hot 100.

The pair broke up on stage in 1973 and reportedly did not speak to each other for a decade except at their father's funeral.

They got back together at a reunion concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1983 and three years later were among the first acts to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
