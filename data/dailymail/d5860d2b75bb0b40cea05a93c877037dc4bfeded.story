The Philadelphia Eagles served up a Thanksgiving Day rout over the Dallas Cowboys to move top of the NFC East.

Dallas and Philadelphia came into the game as co-leaders of the division but when time expired the Eagles took a significant step toward the postseason after quarterback Mark Sanchez ran for a touchdown and threw for another while LeSean McCoy rumbled for 159 yards and a score.

The Eagles took control early with Sanchez diving in from two yards out to cap an impressive opening drive before hooking up with Jordan Matthews on a 27-yard touchdown strike on their next possession for a 14-0 first quarter lead.

LeSean McCoy ran for 159 yards and a touchdown to secure his his fourth 1,000-yard season since 2010

DeMarco Murray, the NFL's leading rusher, put Dallas on the scoreboard when he dove over from the one early in the second but the Eagles would answer with three Cody Parkey field goals to take a 23-7 advantage into the intermission.

Dallas converted a LeSean McCoy fumble into a short Dan Bailey field goal early in the third quarter but on the next possession McCoy made up for his drop by racing 38 yards for a touchdown to put Eagles up 30-10.

'It is a team win, that's all it's about,' said McCoy, praising his offensive line. 'We've been criticised all year, all the doubters, but no matter who is in there they give 110 percent and that's what it is about.

'It doesn't matter what anybody says, it's all about what goes on in the locker room.'
