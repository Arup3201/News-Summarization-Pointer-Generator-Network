Monica Lewinsky is reportedly set to write a tell-all book about her affair with Bill Clinton - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he had an insatiable desire for threesomes.

The former White House intern, 39, reportedly wants revenge on Clinton, who she believes escaped unscathed while she has never been able to shake the disgrace of their Oval Office trysts.

Friends claim publishers are scrambling to get their hands on the book, and after holding meetings, she has learned she could get as much a $12 million if she recounts every tawdry detail.

While she has not yet secured a book deal, her apparent attempts to cash in on the affair could rattle the Clinton marriage - and wreck Hillary's bid for the presidency in 2016.

Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky is reportedly writing a $12 million tell-all book about her affair with Clinton

Speaking to the National Enquirer, her friends said the memoir could
even spark further health problems for the former 
president, who has undergone heart surgeries.

'Her book could be more than just revenge, it could kill him!' a source said.

Her bids for a book deal will at least shake Clinton - bringing him crashing down from the success he enjoyed after an energetic speech at the Democratic National Convention earlier this month.

'Monica has tried to move forward, but the nightmare of her affair with Bill still haunts her,' a friend told the Enquirer. 'Sheâ€™s facing 40 without a man in her life, and seething about the way her reputation was destroyed as the whole world watched.'

The book will also include never-before-seen love letters that she wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent them, another friend added.

They reportedly detail her love for 
Clinton and how Lewinsky, then just 22, could make him much happier than
 his wife, Hillary, who the president called a 'cold fish'.

He also laughed about his nonexistent sex life with his wife - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage.

'Monica can describe how Bill went on 
and on about his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies and the use
 of sex toys of all kinds,' the friend added.

As
 well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky 
also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her
 liaison with the president, the source said.

She
 was carrying a child fathered by a Pentagon employee called 'Thomas', 
she revealed in an earlier biography written by Andrew Morton. 'That 
void has never been filled,' said the friend.

She
 decided to develop the memoir after her sullied reputation meant she 
struggled to find work but realised she would get a generous offer for the book.

Denial: With his wife standing by in January 1998, Clinton insists he did not have relations with 'that woman'

Truth: But in August 1998, Clinton confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her

She is also writing it to get revenge on Clinton, now 66, friends said.

'For years, Monica tried to protect 
Bill out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,' a source told the Enquirer. 'But she no 
longer feels that way, and her memoir is his worst nightmare.'

During her grand jury testimony 
against Clinton in 1998, an immunity deal prevented her from exposing 
intimate details about their affair in the Morton expose that came out that 
year.

'But that agreement expired in 2001, and 
when Bill published his autobiography My Life three years later, 
Monica felt betrayed by him all over again,' said the source.

In the wake of the scandal, Lewinsky became the centre of a political storm and gave a series of high-profile interviews.

But unable to escape the shake the reputation, she moved to England in 2005 where she earned her master's degree and worked as a news correspondent for the UK's Channel Five News.

Though it has been 14 years since she claimed she had nine sexual encounters with the president, her presence still looms in the life of Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's political career.

In what was an unfortunate and awkward schedule at the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina earlier this month, Lewinsky's former rabbi - who publicly condemned Clinton during the sex scandal - gave the benediction minutes after the former President took the stage.

ABC News reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because Rabbi David Wolpe is such a well-known figure in the Jewish community.

And in July, during a visit to Egypt as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was taunted by her husband's affair by protesters as they chanted 'Monica, Monica!'
