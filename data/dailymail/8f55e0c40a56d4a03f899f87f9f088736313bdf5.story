A teenage boy has described the sickening moment he heard his father beat his stepmother to death with a baseball bat.

Lawson Dickey, 13, told a jury on Tuesday that his father woke him to say that his biological mother was an 'angel' and she would take care of him. He then saw his father collect an aluminum bat from the garage, go to the bedroom and then came 'three whacks'.

Lawrence Dickey, 46, is charged with first-degree premeditated murder and faces life in prison.

Sobs: Lawrence Dickey, 46, told the Florida court on Tuesday that he had no memory of allegedly beating his wife to death with a baseball bat last year

Lawson told the crowded courtroom in Florida: 'He [Lawrence Dickey] said that my mom was an angel and that she'll guide me through everything.'

The teenager told the defense that he believed his father was talking about his biological mother.

The 13-year-old continued: 'He [Lawrence Dickey] got up, went to the garage, I heard him open the garage door. I heard bats rattle and hit the floor, metal bats.

'He went over to his bedroom... I heard three whacks.

'I heard him going to the kitchen and get his keys. I heard him go outside and start his car. I heard the tires screeching in the street.'

Torn apart: Lawrence Dickey's two children, Lawson (right) and Taylor (left) were forced to take the stand after they allegedly witnessed him murdering their stepmother Beatrice

Broken home: The murder suspect's 16-year-old daughter Taylor took the stand to describe how she found her stepmother covered in blood

Lawson, his sister Taylor and their stepbrother Dillon were all at the family home in Plant City on the night of the murder last September.

Taylor Dickey, who was 16 at the time, wept as she told the court she had found her stepmother covered in blood.

Miss Dickey said: 'I jolted up and walked over to my stepmom and dad's bedroom. I knocked before entering and basically said ''can I come in?''

'I thought I heard her crying. I walked into the room and she was breathing really heavily and I saw blood. I ran into Dillon's room and told him to call 911.'

Mrs Dickey's 17-year-old son Dillon  Kirkland dialed 911 after finding his mother's body on September 17, 2011. She was flown to Tampa General Hospital and pronounced dead from blunt force trauma.

Dillon told the court: 'My mom was laying on her side with her head beaten in and there was a baseball bat right next to her. And there was blood everywhere and her hands were under her head like she was sleeping.'

Both prosecution and defense agree that 
Lawrence Dickey launched the brutal attack on his 44-year-old wife, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The couple had earlier gone to see the band Journey in concert, where the accused became drunk and 
embarrassed himself by falling into the mud.

Lawrence Dickey, who worked as a security guard at Walmart, also took the stand on Tuesday.

He sobbed as he told the courtroom he could not remember killing his wife but found himself standing over the bed looking at her body. He admitted to being intoxicated at the concert.

On September 17, 2011, Dickey drove to a Plant City police 
station where he reportedly said: 'Lock me up. I just beat my wife with a
bat. She is hurt real bad.'

The court will hear closing arguments today.

Beatrice Dickey was a cancer survivor who volunteered as the executive director of the sheriff's office's public safety charity.

Sheriff Grady Judd paid tribute to Mrs Dickey who was the highest-ranking civilian employee of the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

'Bea was an incredibly special person to all of us at the Polk County Sheriff's Office,' he said of the office's director of business affairs.

'She was not just our colleague, she was our dear friend. Our sheriff's office family is hurting. This is a tremendous loss.'

Mr and Mrs Dickey had been married since 2007 and each had two children from previous relationships.
