The admirable show of respect between players when they swap shirts is usually reserved for the end of a match, not half-time.

But during the break between Chelsea and Liverpool on Sunday, a few of the players saw fit to get in early and bag themselves their opponents' shirts with 45 minutes left on the clock.

After referee Howard Webb blew his whistle for half-time in Chelsea's thrilling win at Stamford Bridge, France and Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho and Chelsea star Samuel Eto'o swapped shirts while making their way down off the pitch.

And they weren't the only ones. Sky Sports cameras also picked up fellow Brazilians Coutinho and Oscar prematurely exchanging their jerseys too.

The peculiar act sparked outrage from supporters of both clubs on Twitter.

One user posted: 'Here's @LFC player Sakho asking for the shirt of the man who just scored against him.'

And another wrote: 'Note to Mourinho and Rodgers... get Eto'o and Sakho off the field right now for that ridiculous half-time shirt swap'

But the players' bizarre move to swap shirts before the final whistle isn't the first time it's happened.

Former Arsenal defender Andre Santos provoked outrage from fans when he approached ex-Gunner Robin van Persie for a half-time swap in the Dutchman's first game against his former club after joining Manchester United.

The Brazilian defender didn't endear himself to the travelling Arsenal fans after a torrid half at Old Trafford that saw Van Persie net after just three minutes for United.

Robinho, of AC Milan, and fellow Brazilian Neymar also swapped at the break during the Champions League clash between the Italian side and Barcelona earlier this season.
