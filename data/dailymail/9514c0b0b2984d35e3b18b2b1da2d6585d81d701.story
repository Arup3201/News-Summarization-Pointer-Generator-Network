Mike Wallace has joined the Minnesota Vikings, two years after being courted by Rick Spielman and Co.

Wallace was traded for a seventh round pick, in exchange for a fifth round pick in May's draft.

His expensive and ill-tempered two seasons in Miami will be best remembered for a touchline spat.

Wallace joined the Dolphins on a $60million deal before the 2013 season and was an outspoken member of the locker room.

He often criticised the gameplan and was said to quit on his team-mates during December's defeat to the New York Jets.

He failed to post a 1,000-yard season and the deep ball threat he posed in Pittsburgh never materialised in Miami.

After the Dolphins acquired Kenny Stills from the New Orleans Saints, Wallace's trade appeared inevitable.
