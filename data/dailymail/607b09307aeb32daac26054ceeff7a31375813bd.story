A roly-poly detective, who had grown so fat gorging on donuts and fast food that he could no longer button up his bullet proof vest is fit to protect and serve once again after shedding well over half of his body weight. 

Big Bob Brenner, 41, had ballooned to almost 450lbs lbs and hit rock bottom when he failed to compete the 'Fit For Duty' test he needed to pass in order to keep his job as a detective in the Wisconsin Police.

The father-of-two was deeply ashamed that he was letting down colleagues on the force because 
he was simply too fat to chase after any crooks.

Detective Brenner, who helps coach his son’s football team at Waukesha North High School, had been a promising player in his youth, but was struggling to demonstrate basic drills to the youngsters.

He said: 'Just watching me get out of the car is a treat.

'I was very conscious of that. I think there were times where I got that look, "This guy is investigating my case? Who is this big fat guy?" That part of it was hard.'

'I felt a little bit ashamed. If something bad happened where one of our deputies were out with a bad guy and they were in a foot pursuit or if they were in a physical altercation with somebody, if I am in the area, I just (questioned)

‘Can I respond, and potentially be that guy to help out?' I just knew intellectually that I couldn’t.'

Detective Brenner was thrown a lifeline when he was selected to apperar on ABC's Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition.

And after almost a year with the programme he has surpassed expectations by losing 253lbs to weigh in at a trim 195lbs.

Detective Brenner said he was delighted when trainer Chris Powell picked him to transform his life in one year.

Powell surprised Brenenr by dressing up as a local sheriff in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and pulling him over to the side of the road.

The show saw the father-of-two performing punishing exercise routines which led to him suffering a serious knee injury which almost forced him to drop out of the show.

An MRI scan revealed he had torn his 
meniscus, but Bob decided to forgo surgery to carry on with the 
programme and lost a staggering 126lbs (9 stone) in the first 90 days.

Speaking to Extreme Makeover's Chris Powell at the final weigh-in where he clocked in at a sprightly 195lbs, Detective Brenner broke down with emotion.

He said: 'I’m done with being obese, with having my joints hurt all of the time. I want to be with my wife. I’m done being the fat guy. I’m done with being overweight.

'I want to be good to myself, and that’s why I’m here,'
