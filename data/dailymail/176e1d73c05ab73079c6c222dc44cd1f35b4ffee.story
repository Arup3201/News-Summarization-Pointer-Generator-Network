The mother of a student who was kicked out of high school after starring in gay porn to help pay his family's bills said she couldn't be prouder.

Melyssa Lieb, from Cocoa, Florida, said she vehemently supports her son, 18-year-old Robert Marucci, who was suspended from his high school after classmates discovered his explicit career.

'I think he's the most awesome person in the world,' she told WKMG through tears. 'He stood up and he was the man of the house when I couldn't be.'

Back to class: Robert Marucci has been allowed to return to Cocoa High School

Following outrage over his suspension, the school district has now ruled that the decision was wrong and Marucci is allowed back to school on Wednesday.

'No child would ever be suspended for a job that they have outside of the school environment,' said Michelle Irwin, a spokesperson for the district.

Even after his suspension, Marucci remained unapologetic for the work he considers no different any other job. He pointed out that it is legal and doesn't believe a school can tell him where he can work.

The debacle began two weeks ago when fellow students at Cocoa High School discovered his videos on an adult website and started showing each other the explicit images on their phones.

Legal: But he insists that the job is no different from any other, saying it was legal and outside of school

The website shows Marucci, who goes by
 the name of 'Noel', posing naked and having sex with other men, as well
 as featuring in an introductory video about his love of surfing.

Despite his pride in his work, when the photos emerged at school, he was targeted by bullies, WKMG reported.

School administrators called him a 'major disruption', according to the referral slip.

A friend posted on Reddit that Marucci was suspended for 10 days, which meant that he would not be unable to graduate because of an automatic 'failure from absences'.

'I feel like I have been treated unfairly and this is unjust,' Marucci said. 'This was completely legal. I didn't break any laws, and this took place out of the school.'

Administrators also wrote that he threatened to bring weapons to the school, but he denies this.

But
 his mother said these threats were not the real reason he was kicked 
out, as Lieb claimed the principal, Dr. Stephanie Soliven, told her: 'He
 was expelled due to his explicit lifestyle career.'

His
 mother added: 'I think that it is [her] morals and her personal beliefs
 and I don't think that this is anybody's business except for my son. 
The children at the school found it [the porn] and she didn't do 
anything to stop it.'

But Marucci's mother wasn't the only one who supported him, as dozens staged a walkout at the school on Friday. A Facebook group was also set up to support him.
