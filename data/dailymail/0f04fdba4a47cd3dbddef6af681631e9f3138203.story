Inter Milan have expressed an interest in Cardiff City midfielder Gary Medel.

The tough tackling middleman has impressed for Chile at the World Cup, with his nation going close to knocking out hosts Brazil after already defeating world champions Spain.

And Inter Milan believe they can tempt him to Italy after Cardiff were relegated from the Premier League last season.

Medel was a record Â£11million signing for Cardiff on promotion to the Premier League, signing a four-year deal, and after a decent season in the top flight he has plenty of potential suitors.

Cardiff are thought to have knocked back a loan bid from Valencia, while Besiktas are also keen.
