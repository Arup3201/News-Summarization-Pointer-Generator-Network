As Peter Crouch was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a 90th minute equaliser at Newcastle, Jonathan Walters decided to celebrate in his own unique way.

The Stoke forward ran over to the Potters' 6ft 7in hero but, instead of embracing him, opted to bend down and grab a  programme from the turf.

The matchday publication appeared to have been hurled on to the edge of the pitch during Crouch's celebrations, giving Walters a prop with which to wind-up the home fans at St James' Park.

The former Ipswich man was captured by Sportsmail photographer Ian Hodgson pretending to read the glossy title in front of frustrated Newcastle supporters as they came to terms with another disappointing result.

Walters was joined by ex-Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley, who seemed to take great delight in celebrating against his former rivals.

Crouch's goal sealed a deserved point for Mark Hughes' men, who had controversially fallen behind to a Jack Colback strike in the 74th minute.

The midfielder was fortunate to be on the pitch when he struck after avoiding a second yellow card for a rash challenge on Victor Moses just a few minutes earlier.

But Crouch's fifth Premier League goal of the season kept Stoke above their opponents and in 10th place. Walters won't mind reading about that.
