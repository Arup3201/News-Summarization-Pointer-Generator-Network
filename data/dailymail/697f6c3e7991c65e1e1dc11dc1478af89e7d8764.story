Manny Pacquiao has revealed negotiations are underway for a $300m mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

The two welterweight world champions have long been considered the best on the planet.

But boxing fans have been left frustrated by the pair's inability to agree terms on the richest fight in history.

However, speaking during his press tour to promote his fight with Chris Algieri in November, Pacquiao said: 'There are serious negotiations with the Mayweather camp and my promoter.'

When asked if the fight would take place in May, he added: 'Probably for next year.'

Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said recently that he believed the fight could happen twice in 2015.

‘Both [TV] networks want this to happen,' he said. 'All signs seem to point to a first fight early next year

'A second fight in the autumn would provide a different cash split because the winner of the first would claim the higher percentage. As each of them believes he would win, that provides an extra incentive.’

Mayweather, meanwhile, is focused on his rematch with Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas on Saturday week.

He has three fights left on his $200m six-fight deal with Showtime, with the final two expected to take place in May and September next year.

Pacquiao has said he intends to retire in 2016 and devote his time to politics in his native Philippines.
