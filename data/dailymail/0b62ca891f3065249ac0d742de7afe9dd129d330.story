Snow-filled streets are causing fresh misery for many Britons who have been left with overflowing bins after hundreds of rubbish collections were cancelled for 'safety' reasons.

As mountains of black bags pile up householders are angry the welfare of binmen comes before collecting household waste - despite some rubbish dating back to New Year's Eve.

Waste strewn on pavements and spilling out of bins is a risk to public health because they are attracting vermin, critics have said.

Still waiting: A giant pile of black bags with food spilling out all over the floor lies against a tree in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, where collections were cancelled because it was unsafe for binmen

Anger: Because of the snow and ice, rubbish lies uncollected around Birmingham, with some residents saying their waste dates back to New Year's Eve

Cancellations have also taken place in Birmingham, Solihull and Dudley, with refuse lorries also struggling with ice-covered side roads - and councils have wheeled out a 'health and safety' excuse to explain why bin men cannot coolectÂ  the overflowing rubbish.

Mother-of-one Pat Robinson, from Kings Norton, said: 'It baffles me why binmen find it so difficult to complete their rounds when everyone else is getting their life back to normal.'

But a message on Birmingham City Council's website defended the cancellations. It said: 'Even if the road has been gritted and is safe for vehicles, we also need to consider the safety of refuse collectors carrying heavy loads across slippery pathways and driveways as falls can be common.'

The overflowing bin bags follow the furore at the start of January when council binmen made just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an EU law.

Residents in a block of flats in 
Colchester, Essex, were told red tape means the binmen can't collect 
rubbish there when it's too dark for them to see it.

As a result, the massive pile of 70 
stinking black binbags has built up and was overspilling into the bin 
store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile.

But residents were stunned when the 
binmen told them that the EU regulations mean they can't put their hands
where they can't see them for health and safety reasons.

A fresh layer of snow fell over Birmingham yesterday with more today and temperatures plunged to as low as -12C last night.

There have been car accidents, slips and snow-ins, but the latest problem to come from the cold snap is overflowing rubbish bins.

Newcastle is one of many areas across the country that is still waiting for their rubbish to be collected, with piles of it left in the streets

Residents have complained that the overflowing bins pose a serious health hazard, as the rubbish might attract rats

The condition of the roads has made it
impossible for bin wagons to collect waste from residential areas, 
leaving homeowners to dispose of rubbish themselves or cope with the 
contaminated consequences.

In Newcastle, rubbish can be seen spilling from wheelie bins and bursting from rubbish bags.

Rubbish from full bins in the Byker area is strewn around snowy roads and streets.

Julie Gowland, 50, unemployed, who lives in the Byker Wall in Byker, Newcastle, said: 'I'm not very happy about it, it is awful.

'Especially if people come to visit, it just looks awful.

'In the past there have been rats. They seem to empty them haphazardly at the best of times, leaving stuff lying about.'

Excuses: Councils have been criticised as residents fear that they are putting binmen over their own safety

Residents around the country have complained about the lengthy time it has taken to collect their rubbish which has been strewn over the pavements

In the plush area of Jesmond, Newcastle Upon Tyne, the remnants of New Year's parties can be seen spilling from the bins. Beer and fizzy pop appear to have been the tipples of choice with empty bottles pouring from rubbish bags.

Alice Potts, 21, a Newcastle University student of Media and Communications living in Grosvenor Place, Jesmond, said: 'It's pretty bad around here. There's obviously going to be rats and stuff.

'There should be another way they can clear the bins. If people can sweep the snow off the road they can clear the rubbish.'

One 33-year-old doctor who works at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, but refused to be named, has a build up of rubbish outside his home in High Heaton, Newcastle.

He said: 'The council could have let us know that it couldn't be collected.

'We know it is difficult to go around everywhere but they could have put something on the radio or television to let us know when it is going to be collected.

'They came last week, but they haven't been this week - they were due on Wednesday.'
