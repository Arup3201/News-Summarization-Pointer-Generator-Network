The business tycoon who owns the insurance website Compare the Market has raked in £220million after the successful advertising campaign featuring Aleksandr the meerkat. 

South African entrepreneur Douw Steyn, 59, who set up the website in Britain, has used some of his fortune to buy a 10-bedroom mansion for £62million in one of London’s most expensive and exclusive streets just a stone throw from Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

Steyn owes much of his success and 
wealth to the fictional chief meerkat Aleksandr Orlov, who talks in a 
bizarre fake Russian accent and has made his ‘Simpiles’ catchphrase a 
national phenomenon.

Meerkat moolah: Douw Steyn was ranked 170, with a £600million fortune

The popular advertising campaign featuring the loveable creatures began in 2009. The catchphrase 'Simples' has now become so familiar it was included in Collins English Dictionary in 2010.

When the meerkats first hit our screens three years ago, the businessman was worth £200million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List and as the campaign grew his income soared.

In 2010 he was worth £320million, then £360million last year. And now his wealth stands at an estimated £420million.

Making money is Simples: Alexandre the Meerkat from Compare The Market.com ad has been a huge success since its launch in 2009

The cuddly meerkat is such a hit in the UK that it has more than 55,000 followers on Twitter and over 800,000 people have liked his Facebook page which keeps followers amused with jokey updates.

His personal fortune may have benefited, but so has his company. The Compare the Market comparison site is an offshoot of BGL, which was launched by Mr Steyn in Peterborough, in 1992 as an insurance firm.

And since the Meerkat campaign started the company’s value has more than doubled from £43million in 2008 to £88million. And BGL is employing 2,400 people at its Cambridgeshire HQ plus offices in Sunderland and Coventry.

The Meerkats , which are a member of the ­mongoose family, have also given a shot in the arm to the advertising industry  because other firms have tried to copy the campaign’s success.

More than an ad: Chief meerkat Aleksandr Orlov has been made into a cuddly toy

Mr Steyn, who stepped down as BGL non-executive chairman in February, is said to divide his time between London and South Africa, where he has business interests that include the five star Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg and a game reserve.

Former South African president Nelson Mandela is understood to be one of his close friends and his new London mansion used to belong to billionaire Wall Street investment banker Bruce Wasserstein, who died in October 2009.

Documents lodged with the Land Registry show the property was bought this year for £62.75million.

Meanwhile the success of  Aleksandr has been so huge that he has featured in more than a dozen TV adverts, often accompanied by his long-suffering sidekick Sergei.

Spin-off characters were launched and the meerkats have achieved the feat of taking on a life of their own beyond the commercials that spawned them.

Much like ITV Digital’s Monkey and Levi’s Flat Eric, Aleksandr is an advertising icon who has been made into a cuddly toy.

Customers who book insurance through comparethemarket.com get one free. Aleksandr’s ­autobiography A Simples Life: The Life And Times of Aleksadr Orlov had more orders before publication than the life stories of Tony Blair, Cheryl Cole, Russell Brand or Dannii Minogue.

The book tells the story of his ­ancestors’ journey from the Kalahari to Moscow and dwells on his love of cravats.Six more books called Meerkat Tales followed.

Earlier this year he topped a TolunaQuick poll for the best insurance and comparison advertising characters ­– beating the Churchill dog and Gio Compario the Go-compare opera singer.
