On the day a ceasefire was finally agreed in Ukraine, two MPs traded blows in a full-blown and vicious punch-up. 

The fight took place between Yegor Sobolev, of the centre-right Samopomochi party, and Vadim Ivchenko, from the Fatherland party, also centre-right, in the country's parliament building. 

They squared up to one another and then threw a flurry of powerful punches at the other in the brawl that lasted half a minute. 

Mr Sobolev wore a T-shirt and zip-up sweater and was left with a bloody nose, while his opponent who wore a suit (without a tie) emerged unscathed.

The violent scenes are not a rare sight in Ukrainian politics - a mass brawl also took place in April last year

The altercation in the halls of Verkhovna Rada in Kiev was allegedly over an anti-corruption bill that is currently being discussed. 

Following the break-up of the brawl, a guard stood between the pair as they continued to discuss their disagreement in a more diplomatic fashion. 

This is not the first time the country's politicians have been at the centre of violent scenes. 

In April last year, a session of parliament was interrupted when a fight broke out on the floor of the legislature.

Then in September an angry mob bundled top-ranking MP Vitaly Zhuravsky into a huge rubbish bin and tossed a tyre on top of him before pouring liquid over his face. 

As he lay helpless, a woman was heard shouting: 'Boys, let me kick him at least one more time.'  

It comes after an agreement aimed at ending the fighting in Ukraine was finally reached today, following marathon talks in Belarus.  

The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France announced a ceasefire would begin on February 15.

The deal also includes weapon withdrawals and prisoner exchanges, but key issues remain to be settled.

The pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine have signed the agreement. Thousands of people have died in almost a year of fighting in the region.
