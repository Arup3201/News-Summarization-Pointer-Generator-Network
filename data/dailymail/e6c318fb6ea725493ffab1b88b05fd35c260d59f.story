Stabbing: Holding a blood-stained shirt and being treated at the scene, this is the man in his mid-twenties who is believed to have been stabbed in Woolwich this afternoon

A man in his twenties has been stabbed in broad daylight less than 300 metres from where soldier Lee Rigby was executed on Wednesday afternoon.

Police treated him at the scene in central Woolwich but Scotland Yard said the violent assault is not linked to the terror attack last week.

The person was stabbed at 4pm in Wellington Street - across the road from where Lee Rigby was murdered - and he is not thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries.

Hours earlier the family of murdered British soldier Lee Rigby paid an emotional visit to the scene where he was hacked to death close to Woolwich Barracks.

A group of young soldiers also arrived to pay their respects to Drummer Rigby, solemnly saluting the site where he met his death.

Many of the young men carried red and white hackles, famously worn by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, of which Drummer Rigby was a treasured member.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The victim is a man in his mid 20s. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening. He will be taken to hospital.

'This incident happened geographically very close to where Lee Rigby died, but we do not believe what happened is linked to Lee’s murder or any issues associated with it.'

There have been no arrests.

Initially today's stabbing horrified people as it was feared the attack may be linked to the killing, which has shocked the world.

The streets wee filled with people who came to pay their respects.

Lee Rigby was hacked to death by two attackers in the same street on Wednesday, also in broad daylight.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and his alleged accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, are believed to have run down the off-duty British soldier with a Vauxhall Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks, crushing his body against a road sign.

Last respects: Soldiers in full uniform salute murdered British soldier Lee Rigby at the site where he met his death last week

Round of applause: Soldiers gave a show of hands as they viewed the ever-increasing volume of floral tributes to Drummer Lee Rigby, and placed further flowers at the site where he died

Tribute: Many of the soldiers carried red and white hackles, which are famously worn by members of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers

Witnesses said the terror suspects 
then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like 'crazed animals', before 
dragging his corpse into the middle of the road leaving a trail of 
blood.

As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting: 'this is what God would have wanted'.

A
 blood-soaked man believed to be Adebolajo, who was still holding a 
number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a 
clear London accent: 'You people will never be safe. An eye for an eye, a
 tooth for a tooth.'

Within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms, knives and a machete.

Police opened fire, taking the pair down with up to eight bullets. The suspects remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals.

Four days after he died his bereft family arrived at the spot where he died and struggled to cope with what they saw.

Drummer Rigby's mother Lyn, stepfather Ian and estranged wife Rebecca looked at the thousands of tributes in Woolwich and left a balloon from his two-year-old son Jack saying 'Dad in a million'.

The
 relatives arrived at the place where he was killed at 12.40pm. They 
hugged and comforted each other before crossing the road to look at the 
spot where he was murdered on Wednesday.

One
 clutched a teddy bear, while others held baskets of flowers which they 
left at the scene. They then spent a few moments in reflection, still 
clutching each other.

Emotional: The fiancee of murdered soldier Lee Rigby, Aimee West, steps forward to pay her own special tribute yesterday

And among the masses of poignant messages left in south-east London, one very personal message was placed separately yesterday. Aimee West, his fiancée, laid flowers with a handwritten note.

In it, she said that Rigby will 'always 
have her heart' and that he was her 'guardian angel', before signing it 
off as his 'Princess'.

Miss West, 22, who had flown back to 
the UK from Afghanistan, wore a green hooded top and an engagement ring 
as she took her time to read the tributes to her murdered partner.

She was helped with the tribute by around 20 friends, who stood quietly as she paid her respects.
