Aaron Hernandez has used ‘coded messages’ to discuss the Odin Lloyd murder from prison, authorities claim.

A Thursday court filing from the Bristol County (MA) District Attorney accuses the former New England Patriots tight end of talking about the murder with fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton.

The recorded conversations mostly took place during visits the two women made to the county jail since Mr Hernandez was incarcerated in June, the papers first reported by the Boston Globe said.

The DA made the filing to request copies of the conversations from the county sheriff as further evidence in their case against Mr Hernandez.

‘We did file a motion, and what’s in the documents is pretty self-explanatory,’ DA spokesperson Gregg Miliote told MailOnline. He declined to provide further details while citing a gag order issued by the court.

‘During those conversations, the defendant has discussed the following matters directly relevant to the circumstances surrounding the murder of Odin Lloyd,’ said the affidavit.

The former all-pro is accused of discussing what he believes is his criminal liability, related prior offenses, denials of ownership of a vehicle impounded by police, his control of persons outside the jail and the whereabouts of others implicated in the slaying, said the filing.

Ms Singleton and Ms Jenkins have been charged as co-conspirators.

‘Both of these co-defendants have been charged as accessories in the underlying offense of murder on the theory that they provided assistance to the defendant after the commission of that offense,’ the affidavit said.

These conversations took place despite all three of the accused being advised the conversations were being recorded, authorities said. Most happened during visits, but some were outbound calls placed from prison.

The recordings can be used against all three during court proceedings. Only calls between Mr Hernandez and his attorneys are off-limits during trial.

Messages left by MailOnline seeking comment from Mr Hernandez’s legal team were not immediately returned.

An attempt to reach the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office was not successful.

The
 motion was filed the same day Ms Singleton posted bail after spending 
months behind bars for aiding accomplice Ernest Wallace’s flight from 
Massachusetts.

Back in court soon: The next pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday

Also filed Friday was a motion by Mr Hernandez’s legal team seeking clarification as to whether authorities believe he fired the shots that killed Mr Lloyd or if he acted in concert with co-defendants Mr Wallace and Carlos Ortiz.

‘If Hernandez is alleged to be a joint venturer as to the murder count, the bill of particulars should identify the alleged principal or principals,’ the filing said, according to the Fall River Herald News.

Mr Hernandez is due again in court on Wednesday for another pretrial hearing.
