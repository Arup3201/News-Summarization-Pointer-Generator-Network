Britain may need to introduce controversial privacy laws to meet the ‘challenges’ thrown up by lightning-fast internet communications, Britain’s most senior judge has said.

Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said it was time to re-think the law because information spread quickly around the globe via social media including Facebook and Twitter.

His comments were interpreted as a first step towards legislating to protect people’s privacy – which critics warn would hinder the Press’s ability to investigate and expose corruption and wrong-doing.

Britain has no single privacy law, unlike many other European countries.

But UK judges have been accused of introducing a privacy law never debated or considered by Parliament, based only on the Human Rights Act – which contains a ‘right to private and family life’ – and their own successive judgments.

The process began when law lords ruled it was wrong for a newspaper to have pictured model Naomi Campbell going to a drug rehabilitation clinic.

In a speech in Hong Kong, Lord Neuberger said there had been ‘astonishing developments in IT – the ease with which information can be transmitted and received across the world, the ease with which words and scenes can be clandestinely recorded, and the ease with which information can be misrepresented or doctored.’

Media lawyer Mark Stephens said a privacy law enables 'scallywags and scoundrels' to hide their wrongdoing

He said: ‘These developments may make it inevitable that the law on privacy, indeed, the law relating to communications generally, may have to be reconsidered.’

He also gave a new interpretation on the ‘law on privacy’ in England and Wales, saying: ‘If I want to do or say something which I am only prepared to do or say privately, then it is an interference with my freedom of expression, if I cannot do it or say it because it will be reported in a newspaper.’

But Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer, said Lord Neuberger’s intervention could be the first step towards a new privacy law in this country.

He said: ’I think we can say without fear of contradiction that this is a first indication of new government policy on privacy.

‘This is very controversial. There is always a debate about whether scallywags and scoundrels use privacy laws to conceal their wrongdoing.’
