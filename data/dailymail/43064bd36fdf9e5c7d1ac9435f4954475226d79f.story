Conrad Hilton Jr appeared in a Los Angeles court on Tuesday, nearly seven months after 'going insane' on an international flight back in July.

The 20-year-old little brother of Paris Hilton created a raucous scene aboard an airplane while flying from London to LA, as he allegedly 'screamed and threatened flight attendants' yelling profane statements such as 'I will f**king own anyone on this flight; they are f**king peasants.'

Hilton and his team are blaming his behavior on a sleeping pill and hoping that his recent stint in rehab will prove him to be a changed man.

This as Hilton left the courthouse with a smug smile on his face before looking at one photographer and telling him; 'You're a scumbag.' 

The judge released Hilton on $100,000 bail, but forced him to surrender his passport and remain in the state of Californian until his next court appearance in March.

Arrested:  Hilton, pictured arriving at Los Angeles International Airport in May 2014, was arrested on Monday seven months after causing a loud disturbance abroad an international flight from London to LA

Conrad - who is the grandson of famed hotel billionaire Conrad Hilton Sr - was 'ferociously punching the bulkhead of the plane, ten centimeters from a flight attendant's face' and 'went berserk causing children on the plane to cry.'

Witnesses revealed to the gossip site that he was yelling offensive blurbs such as 'If you wanna square up to me bro, then bring it and I will f**king fight you' and 'I will f**king rip through you and kill you.'

Also many on the same flight believed Conrad was smoking marijuana as they noticed a 'smell of weed seeping out of the bathroom.'

Illegal act: The 20-year-old was allegedly smoking marijuana in the bathroom of the plane (pictured on June 7)

When Conrad fell asleep, 'the captain authorized crew members to restrain him to his seat for the descent and he was ultimately handcuffed to his seat.'

This was not the first time, the young hotel heir had caused a disturbance on a plane.

Another source told the site: 'Conrad grabbed a flight attendant's shirt and said "I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss! My father will pay this out. He has done it before. Dad paid $300k last time.'

His father, Rick Hilton, has built a commercial real estate empire with his real estate brokerage company Hilton & Hyland and has an estimated net worth of $300m.

Daddy pays for his mistakes: Hilton's net worth is approximately $300m with most of his profits coming from high end commercial real estate

Days before his arrest: Rick snapped this photo of Conrad and a female pal in Las Vegas on his Instagram account on Sunday

The Hilton family's attorney, Robert Shapiro confirmed to the gossip site that 'Conrad took a sleeping pill before the flight and wasn't himself.'

In documents obtained by TMZ, Conrad 'admitted to taking a sleeping pill before the flight and then bragged that he "buried" flight attendants' by telling the crew that he 'could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds.'

In his client's defense, Shapiro said there are 'numerous news reports and cases of people experiencing adverse effects including aggressive outbursts.'
