Philip Seymour Hoffman rejected his accountant's suggestion he set aside money for his three children because he didn't want them to be 'trust fund' kids, according to new court documents.

In a July 18 filing in Manhattan Surrogate Court, the actor's accountant David Friedman recalled conversations with Hoffman where the topic of a trust for his children was raised.

He said Hoffman wanted his estimated $35 million fortune to go his longtime partner and the children's mother, Mimi O'Donnell.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman poses for a portrait in January this year. He died of a drugs overdose at his New York City apartment the following month. His accountant revealed in recent court documents that he would be leaving his estimated $35million fortune to his long-term partner Mimi because he didn't want his children to become 'trust-fund kids'

Hoffman was found dead in his Manhattan apartment in February of a drug overdose.

Ms Spencer, a costume designer who met the actor in 1999, had reportedly recently kicked him out of the family's $4.2million apartment as he tried to get his drug problem under control. 

The actor admitted struggling with drug addiction in the past, and 
reportedly checked himself into rehab in May last year for heroin abuse 
after 23 years of being clean.

According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning actor treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse'. Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage.

The court-appointed attorney says the actor's will should be approved by the court because there isn't anything suspicious about it.

Attorney James Cahill Jr., interviewed Hoffman's accountant as part of his court-appointed duties to protect the interests of Hoffman’s children, Cooper, ten, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa, according to the New York Post.

Hoffman also said that he wanted his son to be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco, an edict that was written before his daughters were born.
