A patient has been left in a vegetative state after his doctor walked out in the middle of his open-heart surgery to attend a lunch, a lawsuit has claimed.

Silvino Perez, 72, suffered complications after his cardiologist, Dr Pervaiz Chaudhry, left a physician's assistant to close his chest in 2012 - even though he wasn't qualified to do so, according to relatives.

Perez's wife, Maria Arteaga Alvarez, and his stepson, Cristobal Arteaga, have now filed a lawsuit against the doctor and Fresno Community Regional Medical Center in California.

Arteaga says they only learned that the doctor had left the room when they received an anonymous phone call in October from a nurse who had been in the room at the time, ABC News reported.

He revealed that when Perez was undergoing surgery, Dr Chaudhry left to attend a lunch at least 20 minutes away, Arteaga said. When the doctor received a call to say that Perez's heart had stopped, he returned - but the patient's brain had already suffered extensive damage.

Arteaga said the man on the phone told him that this was why Perez was in a vegetative state.

'I cant put it into words,' Arteaga said. 'What kind of monster is that? That would just walk out? You trust this individual with your life.'

The man said that a state health department report had detailed the incident, but had not named the patient or doctor. But Arteaga said the caller told him the report was about Chaudhry and Perez.

An investigation had been launched into the surgery a week afterwards following an anonymous call from a staff member, according to the California Department of Public Health's website.

Arteaga's lawyer, Jeffrey Mitchell, said the details of the report matched Perez's case - but neither the California Department of Public Health nor the hospital would confirm he was the subject.

Accused: Dr. Pervaiz Chaudhry left the room to attend a lunch at least 20 minutes away, according to the lawsuit. When his assistant struggled to close the patient's chest, he rushed back - but it was too late

Before the surgery, Perez 'was the hardest-working man you'd ever meet', Arteaga told the Fresno Bee.

He had been a field worker and had also been taking care of his wife, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair, for three years.

Cristobal Arteaga, patient's stepson

He underwent surgery on April 2, 2012 after suffering chest pains and learning that he had a heart defect that required surgery.

During the surgery, Arteaga and his mother waited in a private waiting room and that, after two hours, Dr Chaudhry arrived to tell them the surgery had been a success, ABC News reported.

Their attorney says this is likely when the doctor left. But minutes later, a phone in the room rang and they learned Perez was suffering from complications.

The physician's assistant had closed the patient but another staff member noticed he was still bleeding, according to the health department. They called Chaudhry, who gave them instructions, but they struggled to make Perez stable.

Heartbroken: Perez's distraught stepson, Cristobal Arteaga, said the family only learned of the alleged mistake after receiving an anonymous call from a member of hospital staff last October

'It was somewhat of a whirlwind,' Arteaga said. 'At one point in time, they told us to round up the whole family, because they didn't think he was going to pull through.'

About 45 minutes after the patient 'coded', the doctor returned to the hospital and successfully restarted his heart, although he continued to bleed. That night, he was transferred to the cardiovascular intensive care unit.

Arteaga said his stepfather's chest was left open for days - covered with just a clear tape - in case something else went wrong.

Perez has never regained consciousness and has never moved, his stepson said. He is now in an acute care facility.

The doctor was given a 14-day suspension and his surgeries were monitored for two months, according to the health department's report.

Heading to court: The family has also sued Fresno Community Regional Medical Center in California

The family is asking for unspecified damages in their lawsuit.

Valley Cardiac Surgery Medical Group, which has been named in the suit and which counts Chaudhry as a memeber, said they have not yet received the suit.

But Bruce Eliason said in a statement that the claim that Chaudhry left the operating room before the patient's chest was closed 'is unequivocally false, and it will be proven so'.

Mary Lisa Russell, spokeswoman for Community Regional Medical Center, said in an email: 'While we can't comment on any ongoing litigation, we have instituted improved safeguards with action plans that have been approved by the state.'
