A mystery ramshackle boat carrying five rotten corpses has washed onto a beach on the coast of Japan.

The 13-metre wooden vessel was found at Sado Island and had what appeared to be faint Korean markings on its side prompting speculation that it may have come from North Korea.

Various belongings and rubbish from food packaging was also found scattered inside, suggesting its occupants may have been attempting to flee the world's most secretive nation but became lost at sea.

'The bodies are decomposed badly,' a police spokesman said, adding that Korean writing on the hull was impossible to read.

The boat was found around 9am on Wednesday by local fishermen. It had been so battered by the elements that it was barely afloat by the time it washed ashore.

The damage also indicates it could have been lost at sea for some time before it ran aground.

'We cannot determine their nationality yet. The boat seems to have been drifting in the sea for quite some time,' he said.

More than 21,000 
North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War with most crossing over the North's porous border with China or 
drifting in boats over the Koreas' western and eastern sea borders.

Nearly six million North Koreans - a quarter of the population - live in extreme poverty due to food shortages in the country.

A third of children under five are reported to suffer from malnutrition.

The police and 
the Japan Coast Guard are seeking to identify the deceased, who appear 
to be adults, and are probing how the boat drifted onto the beach, the 
police said.

Details were not yet known, including when the five died.

In January, the coast guard found three people adrift in a small boat off the Sea of Japan coast.

The three North Koreans and another man, who had died of hypothermia, were originally thought to be defectors from the communist state.

But they told officials their boat had developed engine trouble during a fishing trip and they had unintentionally drifted. They were later repatriated.

The bulk of would-be refugees from North Korea cross into China to escape repression, poverty and food shortages in the isolated nation.

Damage: The boat had been badly battered by rough seas and was barely afloat when it washed up

Nine North 
Koreans - three men, three women and three children - were picked up by 
the coast guard in September 2011 after spending five days at sea. They 
then traveled to South Korea to settle there.

In 2007, an apparent family of four North Korean refugees arrived at a port in Aomori Prefecture, also in a small, open boat.
