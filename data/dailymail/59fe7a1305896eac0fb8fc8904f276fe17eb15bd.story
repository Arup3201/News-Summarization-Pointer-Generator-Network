A Washington DC woman who claims she was the victim of the knockout game said the group of kids laughed when she was punched in the face.

Phoebe Connolly, a youth worker, was biking in the Columbia Heights area of the city this month when she encountered a group of teenagers.

As she biked past them one of them reached out and punched her in the face.

The knockout game, also called polar-bear hunting, is a violent activity performed by sucker punching or beating up an unsuspecting passerby with the intended goal of rendering the victim unconscious. Serious injuries and deaths have been attributed to knockout.

Shocking assault: Phoebe Connolly, a youth worker, was biking in the Columbia Heights area of the city this month when she encountered a group of teenagers, one of whom punched her in the face

Connolly said the kid yelled 'whoop pow!' - the sound comic book characters make when they punch each other - when he hit her.

‘The whole group of kids laughed,’ Connolly told CNN on Tuesday night.

She was not seriously injured in the attack, but says people should think critically about how such attacks can be stopped.

‘[Teenagers] just don't always think about the ramifications of their actions, how they can hurt people, how they can cause problems for the rest of their lives’, said Connolly, who works on youth programs.

She said it was due to the popularity of so-called ‘knockout’ videos.

‘Instead of constantly replaying them on media, or on YouTube, or whatever it is, you know I really feel like that's just creating more of a culture of fear and polarization - instead of actually spending time thinking about why it is that people are choosing to do this and how can it be stopped and prevented,’ she told CNN.

Another woman was attacked in the same area one day earlier. She, too, sustained minor injuries and was not knocked out, according to Washington police.

A police spokeswoman said authorities are investigating the two attacks as simple assaults.

Similar incidents have been reported in New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Missouri.

Investigation: Police commissioner Ray Kelly says the New York Police Department is investigating the recent attacks to see if there is a trend or not

A 78-year-old women was sucker-punched in New York City on November 9, while pushing her great-granddaughter’s stroller on Avenue L and East Fifth Street. She did not know the man nor had any previous contact or connection.

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said they are working to determine whether she is a ‘knockout’ victim.

This week an elderly
Russian woman was reportedly punched on the back of the head by a young thug 
as part of the vicious Knockout Game craze.

The
random attack happened on November 25 when the 72-year-old woman was walking
to the Jewish community center in Canarsie, Brooklyn, at around noon.

Her
attacker - a male in late teens/early 20s - didn't say anything or try 
to rob her.

In another incident, photography intern Israel Blizovsky, 
19, from Israel, said he was punched in the face by a group of teenagers
in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last week.

‘They just kept walking. They were all laughing,’ he told the New York Post through a Hebrew translator.

On Friday NYPD arrested a man on charges of assault as a hate 
crime after a 24-year-old Orthodox Jewish man was punched in the face in another so-called ‘Knockout Game’ 
assault.

Amrit 
Marajh, 28, of Brooklyn, had just left a bar at around 2:45a.m. on 
Friday, November 22, with three friends and was talking about boxing when the topic of
the knockout game came up, police sources said.

66th precinct police station in Brooklyn on Friday and, right, his 
alleged attacker Amrit Marajh

His victim, Shmuel Perl, 24, has said 
that he overheard his alleged attackers daring each other to punch him 
out minutes before he was actually assaulted. Perl was stuck once, but 
wasn’t seriously injured.

Despite
the recent assaults, police in New York say they haven't yet seen 
evidence of a trend, though they are not ruling out the idea.

‘The
press has named it the so-called knockout game. We don't discount that 
that exists. It's a possibility. We've investigated and will continue to
investigate,’ Kelly said on Tuesday.
