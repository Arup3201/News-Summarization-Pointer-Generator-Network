Picture this.

It's 7.50pm, and you're walking out of the tunnel at the Abbey Stadium to the welcome of a 7,987-strong attendance. To your left is Radamel Falcao – a man who earns £280,000 per week, or £40,000 a day, while you earn pennies by comparison.

Cambridge United were in that very situation a little over a week ago, when a Manchester United XI – total cost, £276million – drew 0-0 with their League Two counterparts – total cost, zilch.

Signed on: September 1

Wages per week: £280,000 

Wages per day: £40,000

Goals in all competitions: 3

Pay per goal as of January 29: £2million

Yet forget that FA Cup hiccup because this week marks an anniversary, and sometimes that calls for celebration.

Jorge Mendes can only have been tempted to use the good China on Thursday, when his client, Falcao, passed 150 days at Old Trafford.

The milestone for the man with three Barclays Premier League goals marks the day his wages hit a cool £6m since moving to Manchester from Monaco. Tax aside. Bonuses not included.

It was on August 31 when Falcao was photographed peeking out of the window of a private jet. No stop off in Madrid or London, despite apparent interest from Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho.

Louis van Gaal got him. A club desperate to become European heavyweights once more added the world-renowned striker named after Paulo Roberto Falcao – the Brazilian that starred for the greatest side not to win the 1982 World Cup. 

In a £6m season-long swoop plus wages they nabbed the natural-born killer from 12 yards or less, coached in the art of terrorising defenders by one himself: his father, Radamel Garcia.

It was Falcao's father who arranged his first contract – £50 per week – before his debut on August 28, 1999, in the Colombian second division for Lanceros Boyaca at the age of 13 years, 199 days.

Fast forward 15 years and it was Mendes, the most powerful agent in football, who orchestrated his latest contract – leaving behind a club that average less than 15,000 fans at Stade Louis II.

Yet his move from Monaco to Manchester has not matched expectations. Not by a long shot.

Not enough to warrant the Glazer family spending £2m per goal, nor enough to feel obligated to relinquish £43m to make his loan arrangement permanent.

Falcao has not scored or provided an assist since New Year's Day against Stoke City. 

Between then and now, he's faced Yeovil Town (60 minutes), Queens Park Rangers (90) and Cambridge (90).

Against QPR, to his credit, Falcao's positioning was second to none. Yet every chance – the point-blank header from five yards out, for example – was squandered.

One miss in particular was ridiculed, mainly because it was captured from an unkind angle where you could not see Steven Caulker get his studs to it beforehand. Twitter reacted to the air shot appropriately: 'Even Fernando Torres...' You can guess the rest.

Manchester United created more chances (16) against QPR than any other team  this year. The closest after that being against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Aston Villa (all 15).

Had it not been for Rob Green, Falcao would have his fourth, perhaps fifth or even sixth goal in all competitions. The pesky QPR goalkeeper was seemingly hell-bent on not allowing him relief.

And so to Cambridge, where Falcao managed 24 touches and one shot on target against a team loitering some 76 places below them in the Football League basement. 

The appropriately-named Richard Money, meanwhile, is rubbing his hands. His club are prepared for a £1.7m windfall in their return trip to Old Trafford on February 3, a smidgen more than their annual income of £1.6m. Bang for the buck, indeed.

All this frustrates Mendes, who accordingly stuck his nose in. The not-so-average Mr 10 Percent took aim at his client's new manager, insisting Falcao would be better off under the guidance of Manchester United's previous leader. No, not David Moyes.

'I would have liked it if Falcao was with Sir Alex Ferguson,' he told La Sexta last week. 'He is a player who needs to play 90 minutes and I don't understand [why he isn't].'

Be careful what you wish for, Jorge.

Falcao's 90 minutes apiece against QPR and Cambridge saw six shots, four on target, 40 accurate passes, two offside calls, no goals and no assists. All this, shown above.

This doesn't fit the reputation of a man voted for by Cristiano Ronaldo to win the 2013 Ballon d'Or. No petty, political, Eurovision voting by the Madridista that year, it seems. 

Is it a lack of service?  An injury hangover? Louis van Gaal's formation? Plain, old rotten luck?

Well, against QPR, Falcao (No 9) played a supporting role behind Angel di Maria (No 7), as the average positions below demonstrate. A conundrum in itself. Against Cambridge, he averaged a role further up the pitch, more central, slightly ahead of Di Maria.

Next up, Leicester City, the club bottom of the Premier League, and minnows Cambridge – both at Old Trafford. Score against them, and what were we worried about? Fail, and uh oh.

When Falcao signed in the early hours of September 1, the headlines wrote themselves. 

Take, for example, The Daily Telegraph's 'Striking it rich', Daily Star's '£350,000 a week', or Daily Mail's 'Wow Falcao'. That buzz, however, has left. The hype, barely existent. Patience wearing thin.

This was always a gamble. They hired a man that suffered anterior cruciate damage in January – an injury which stole the 2014 World Cup and eight months from him.

It was the third severe knee injury of his career. Falcao, still to this day, is understood to  ice the delicate area following every training session. A rumour strengthened when he uploaded a photo to Instagram, inadvertently showing what looked to be an ice pack strapped to his left knee.  

There are still concerns about Falcao's knee, which caused him to miss the World Cup last year

United must make a decision on whether or not to sign the Colombian striker on a permanent basis

Not so reassuring, either, is Falcao's diminishing records at Manchester United when compared to Monaco and Atletico Madrid.

His shot conversion rate (15 per cent) is the 64th best in the Premier League. It is by far his lowest at every club he's been with since 2011, as the table below shows. His average shots per game (1.5) is down, a far cry from his record with Atletico in 2011/12 (3.2) and 2012/13 (2.9).

Yet not all is lost. His shooting accuracy (70 per cent) is better than ever, and he now has as many assists (3) as he has managed in any season since 2011.

Perhaps this is a storm in a teacup, then.

Maybe his so-called 'adjustment period' is just longer than others. 

But Louis van Gaal is losing patience, no matter what he says. Dropping a man being paid £280,000 per week against Southampton – your Champions League qualification rivals – hardly screams faith.

A goal against Leicester or Cambridge would be a start because, so far, there's no value for money to be had here. And if it persists, Manchester United would be better washing their hands of Falcao.
