A police bomb squad robot was called in to remove a suspicious vest from a bank robbery suspect after officers cleared a city block on the west side of Salt Lake City.

Officers were struggling to arrest the man on the sidewalk on Thursday afternoon when they noticed the wires and backed away, police sergeant Robin Heiden said. 

The suspect was then seen lying on the rubble as a robot removed the suspicious apparel.
