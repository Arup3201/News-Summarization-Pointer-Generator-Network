Sir Cliff Richard, who has added an extra date to his forthcoming tour despite an allegation for child sex abuse  

Sir Cliff Richard is said to be so confident that child sex abuse allegations against him will be dropped that he has extended his forthcoming sell-out tour, it has been reported.

Detectives swooped on the 74-year-old's £3.1million apartment in Berkshire in August amid accusations he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago.

Police launched a probe after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985.

The singer has strongly denied the allegation and South Yorkshire Police have not pressed any charges.

But despite the allegation, Sir Cliff has added an extra date at the Royal Albert Hall for his 75th birthday tour in October, with concerts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield sold out.

And although neither the singer or his management have recently commented on the six-month police enquiry, a source told the Sunday Mirror, they are confident the allegation will be dropped in time for the beginning of the tour in September.

They told the newspaper: 'He is impatient to put this behind him and get on with his life. He knows he is innocent and just cannot understand why it is taking so long for the police to clear his name.

'These events have to be organised up to a year in advance and were already being planned before the enquiries began.

'Cliff has always vehemently protested his innocence. He is hoping all this will be behind him before these concerts begin.'

Sir Cliff has issued two statements since the allegation first sufaced to deny any wrongdoing and to thank his fans for support.

In a statement published on Facebook last September, he said: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press.

Sir Cliff was in Portugal when his Berkshire mansion was searched and the singer has always strongly denied any wrongdoing 

'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name.

'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again.

'Once again...many thanks!'

It is the second statement he has made in relation to the investigation having first denied the accusations on Facebook on August 14

Then, he wrote: 'For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are completely false.

'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.

'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.

'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me.

'Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say.'

Detectives swooped on the apartment while Sir Cliff was on holiday in the Algarve, Portugal. Officers spent five hours inside the property searching for evidence.

Previously one of the country's most senior police officers was accused of 'sheer incompetence' over his handling of the raid, which was aired live on the BBC.

The corporation and South Yorkshire police clashed in Parliament over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month.

The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after officers were confronted with the leak

The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault.

Mr Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert said it was a 'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'.

But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.
