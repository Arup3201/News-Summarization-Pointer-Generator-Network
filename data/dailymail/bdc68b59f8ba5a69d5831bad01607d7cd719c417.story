The Mexican fisherman who claims to have survived more than a year at sea has flown into Mexico to meet the family of his dead shipmate.

José Salvador Alvarenga, 37, was discovered in January this year, 14 months after setting sail with 23-year-old Ezekiel Cordoba Rios.

Just four months into the trip, young Rios became ill after drinking turtle's blood to survive, and died.

Survivor: Still-injured José Salvador Alvarenga, 37, was supported by his mother as he limped into Chiapas where he will meet the family of his shipmate Ezekiel Cordoba Rios, 23, who died at sea

From the airport, he drove to Costa Azul, where the family live. He said he will pass on Ezekiel's dying message and answer questions about their months adrift after the engine on their wooden fishing boat broke

On Friday, the Salvadoran fisherman landed in Mexico City with his parents and lawyer, before catching another plane to Chiapas, where his journey started in December 2012.

'I feel like a hero,' Alvarenga told press as he limped through Chiapas Airport, still recovering from his injuries sustained at sea.

'I don't feel capable yet of telling what I remember.

'When I talk about that day, I feel like I am back there in the moment when I was suffering and hurting... what I am trying to do is to forget that.

Their engine broke and bad weather sent them 6,500 miles into the Pacific Ocean where they were stranded

Survivor: Alvarenga was far more articulate on Friday than when he first spoke to journalists. Plans are now under way for a book deal or movie to be made of his life

He called Nicolas Cordoba Cruz, Ezekiel's father, in February but today will meet him to answer his questions

Asked about his time with Rios, he said: 'There was nothing we could do except cry and suffer.'

The
 so-called Miracle Man Of The Pacific is now en route to Costa Azul, the
 coastal town where Ezekiel's father, mother and three brothers live.

It
 has emerged Alvarenga phoned his companion's father, Nicolas Cordoba 
Cruz, on February 7 for an initial conversation, and passed on part of 
his companion's dying message.

Alvarenga, who flew in with his parents and lawyer, said he will struggle to discuss those months

'Ezekiel
 told him [Alvarenga] to tell his brothers to look after their mother 
and to tell me that he was going to be fine,' Cordoba Cruz told the El 
Paso Times, clutching the only two pictures he has of his son.

But, he added, there is much more to discuss in person: 'He
 asked me for forgiveness because he could not do anything for 
Ezequiel.

'Maybe authorities think that it is enough to have an explanation of what happened over the phone.

'But that doesn't hurt as much as the pain I feel of knowing I will not see my son again.'

When he emerged on January 30, 2014, Alvarenga told media his companion died just four months into the trip.

'My friend,' he said in an interview, 'tried to drink the blood of turtles but he kept being sick because it disagreed with his stomach.'

Eventually Ezekiel died, Alvarenga said, and he had to lower the body overboard.

They had drifted 6,500 miles from Mexico into the Pacific Ocean, thrown off course by bad weather.

Despite emerging from the fishing boat with bleached hair, sunburn, and bloating, Alvarenga was deemed to be in strikingly good health by doctors - though mentally frail.

Ezekiel, his three brothers and his parents lived in Mexican border town Juarez until early 2012 when they moved to the seaside village of Chiapas to escape the town's gang culture.

There, the young fisherman met Alvarenga and months later they were missing.

Five days after Cordoba Rios failed to return from his shark-fishing trip with Alvarenga, the family in Chiapas reported him missing and began searching for him, his aunt Lucia Cordoba Cruz said.

'Our family looked for him in the sea, in other villages, always hoping to find him,' she said, adding that their search ended about three weeks later in December 2012.

But his father, who had been sick and had several surgeries, was not told about his son's disappearance for several more months.

'I thought the boat had sunk in the open sea,' he said.

Plans are now under way for a book or movie to be made about the ordeal.
