For those trying to cut down on salt, bacon is usually off limits – but a new version may put it back on the menu.

From next month, Danepak's six-rasher packs of smoked and unsmoked bacon will contain 30 per cent less salt, according to The Grocer magazine.

The products are aimed at millions of Britons who eat too much salt – which can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease and strokes.

The new versions contain two per sent salt compared with 3.3 per cent found in the brand's smoked bacon

Danepak owner Tulip said it had developed a curing process that uses Iposol – 'a solution of water and sea salt' – to give the same flavour as conventional bacon in a healthier way.

The new versions contain 2 per cent salt compared with the 2.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent previously found in the brand's standard unsmoked and smoked bacon respectively, The Grocer reported.

Salt content of own-label bacon at the big four supermarkets varies from around 2.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent. 

Tulip senior brand and licensing manager Simon Harrington said: 'Our unique curing process is an industry first and we are excited by the additional sales opportunities our newly developed technology will offer our retail and food service customers.'
