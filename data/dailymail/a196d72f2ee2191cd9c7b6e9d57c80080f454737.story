The boss of British Gas has been accused of blackmail after warning of blackouts following a decision to launch an inquiry into the energy market.

Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, which owns Britain’s biggest energy firm, said the industry was likely to stop building power stations, and the gap between the demand for electricity and supply will narrow to the point where the country’s lights might go out.

Industry watchdog Ofgem said yesterday it was referring the energy market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for investigation.

Energy chiefs have drawn flak for 
pocketing six-and seven-figure pay packets while thousands of people are
 forced to choose between eating and heating.

Yesterday
 British Gas owner Centrica said its top team shared a pool worth 
£7.1 million last year. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw received 
£2.2 million during 2013 – and would have got significantly more if the 
company’s share price had not collapsed in the last six months.

The previous year he collected a raft of pay and perks worth a total of £5.7 million.

SSE
 boss Alistair Phillips-Davies was paid £1.8 million last year, while 
Eon chief Dr Tony Cocker received a package worth £1.3 million during 
2012, the last year for which figures are available.

EDF’s
 British chief executive Vincent de Rivaz was paid £1 million in 2012, 
while ScottishPower chief Keith Anderson received £500,000.

Npower
 boss Paul Massara, who only took over last year and has refused to give
 up his bonus, is expected to be paid £750,000 for 2013.

It has found ‘possible tacit co-ordination’ on prices, with the ‘Big Six’ firms apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time.

Specifically, there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them.

Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months, but the Big Six – British Gas, SSE, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and EDF – are delaying passing this on.

The watchdog said the firms were also penalising long-serving customers by routinely charging them higher tariffs.

Ofgem
 said: ‘Profit increases and recent price rises have intensified public 
distrust of suppliers and highlight the need for a market investigation 
to clear the air.’

The
 CMA could decide to break up the Big Six, with power generation and 
supply separated from the business that sells electricity and gas to the
 public.

But Mr Laidlaw set a bomb under the process by suggesting 
the inquiry, which will take two years, could have disastrous 
consequences.

He said energy firms were likely to delay investing in new
 power stations if there was a risk of the firms being split.

Ofgem 
has already forecast that spare electricity capacity – the difference 
between power station output and peak demand – could fall as low as 2 
per cent by 2015-16.

Asked if that situation would now worsen, Mr 
Laidlaw said: ‘It’s just become more difficult, clearly, because we’re 
now going to have to wait until we see the outcome of this review.’

The 
lack of meaningful competition means many families and pensioners are 
paying as much as £250 a year too much.

Yet between 2009 and 2012, 
energy firm profits rose 410 per cent to nearly £1.2billion – as bills 
increased by 12.5 per cent.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey dismissed the blackout warnings as ‘absolutely and utterly wrong’.‘The
 lights will stay on,’ he said. ‘We are seeing record levels of 
investment in energy. Independent generators are coming in.’

He insisted
 that while Centrica may cut back on building power stations, there were
 plenty of firms willing to fill the void.

Ofgem director Dermot Nolan warned of a new aggressive regime of fines if firms failed customers.He
 said: ‘We are disturbed by the rising level of profit. If competition 
is working effectively it should be pushing profit margins down and 
forcing efficiency improvements.’

John Robertson, a Labour MP and 
member of the Commons energy select committee, added: ‘Scare stories 
from people like Sam Laidlaw are simply untrue. This is blackmail.’

Ed 
Miliband will say in a speech today that high energy costs ‘stifle’ 
small firms on which the economic recovery depends.

He will say 
family businesses have lost out from this week’s price freeze by SSE, 
which is only for households. And firms do not have the same protection 
from rogue practices as domestic customers.

If Labour wins the next 
election, it will set up a new energy regulator which would ban 
suppliers from rolling customers on to more expensive tariffs without 
their consent.

1) Regular meter readings. Make sure you check every time you receive a bill, rather than relying on an estimate by your energy provider's estimate.

2) Change to online bills. You could save up to 10 per cent.

3) Avoid
prepayment meters if you can, and swap to a billed meter. Even if you have
to pay to get one, it's probably worth it for the savings you'll gain.

4) If you're in financial trouble
some 
companies offer special deals, which help ease any difficulties you 
might be facing. But don't just assume this will be the cheapest option -
make sure you still do your homework.

5) Dual fuel (gas and
electricity from the same supplier) is not always the cheapest option.

6) Monthly direct debit payments could save you five to 10 per cent as companies are more confident that customers won't default and 
earn interest on any overpayments. Check any extra payments are refunded at the end 
of the year.

7) Move beyond the Big Six.
 Some of the best tariffs are now offered by smaller providers such as 
First Utility, Ovo Energy and Spark Energy. In a recent survey, Good 
Energy and Ecotricity topped the table for best service with 82 per cent
 customer satisfaction.
