The saying diamonds are a girl’s best friend has been taken to a whole new level as the world's most expensive dress has been unveiled.

The dazzling dress, which received mixed reviews from onlookers at Ukraine Fashion Show, is encrusted with 50 two carat black diamonds and weighs a staggering 29lbs (13kg).

The gown is one of seven diamond-covered dresses created by British designer Debbie Wingham's collection - but with its hefty £3.5m price tag, it is the her extravagant to date.

The dress boasts 25 two carat black diamonds adorning the peplum 
and a further 25 two carat black diamonds on the shoulder shrug, while more diamonds frame the detachable shoulder line.

On the bustier part of the handmade dress - which is the result of six months' work - is a centrepiece of five 
carats of black diamonds.

'The rest of the embellishment is 
fine beading and delicate white diamonds set in white gold with a very 
fine chainmail detail to add  more individuality, setting the 
embellishment on this gown apart from any other world's most expensive 
gowns,' Debbie says on her website.

The dress, seen here in a series of exquisite photographs by Josh Carroll, was launched officially at 
the Billionaires' Club in Monte Carlo before going on a tour that ended 
at Ukraine Fashion Week.

Debbie Wingham, a self-taught designer whose mother was a seamstress, started her trading at Greenwich market at the age of 18 before opening her first boutique in Hoxton.

A year later she crossed the capital, opening a showroom on the Kings Road.

In 2005, one of her gowns was worn to the BAFTAs, prompting a renowned fashion columnist to write: 'the best dress at this year’s BAFTAs was a dress designed by an unknown designer, but watch this space'.

Seven years on, her designs have been worn by a client list including Kate Winslet, Hilary Swank, Amy Smart, Catherine Jenkins, 
Rebecca Ferguson, and Dita Von Teese.

On October 19th and 20th Raffles, Dubai will showcase Debbie's creation. An edible ‘bake’ on the trends of the season, the showcasing of the dress and afternoon tea will see the addition of a Dark Chocolate Stiletto encrusted with Sugar Diamonds and replicas from Debbie’s Black Diamond range – stylishly mastered by Raffles exceptional pastry team.
