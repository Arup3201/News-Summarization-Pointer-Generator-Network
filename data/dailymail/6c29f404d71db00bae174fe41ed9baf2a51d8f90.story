Real Madrid are set to reward Carlo Ancelotti with an improved one-year extension to his contract after the club's fine start to the season, according to reports in Spain.

Marca claim the Italian, whose current deal expires at the end of next season, has agreed to put pen to paper and commit his future to the Spanish club.

Ancelotti has led Real to the top of La Liga and last season won the club's 10th European Cup with victory against city rivals Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.

The Spanish newspaper also believe that Los Blancos are closing in on the signing of  midfielder Lucas Silva.

The talented 21-year-old currently plays for Brazilian side Cruzeiro but Real will complete a deal for him 'in the next few days' according to Marca.

If that move is completed, Silva will join Marco Asensio at the Bernabeu after the La Liga leaders signed the 18-year-old for £3million. 

Meanwhile AS lead on Real's home clash against Celta Vigo - a game which could see them record their 18th consecutive win in all competitions.

That would match the record set by Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona, who won 18 games in a row between October 22, 2005 and January 26, 2006.
