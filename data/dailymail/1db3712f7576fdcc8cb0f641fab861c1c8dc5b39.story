An own goal and late strike from Dominic Solanke booked Chelsea a place in the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League as Atletico Madrid were swept aside at the club’s Cobham training base.

John Terry stayed behind after training to watch on the sideline as the teenagers showed Chelsea’s first team how to progress in Europe ahead of their Champions League last-16 second leg match at home to PSG on Wednesday.

Adi Viveash’s team could now face an intriguing all-English last four encounter with Manchester City at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, if Patrick Vieira’s young charges win away to Roma next week.

After a tight opening half, the Blues finally broke the resistance of their Spanish opponents after 38 minutes when defender Fran Manzanara could only guide Izzy Brown’s effort into the net.

They then mounted a Jose Mourinho-esque rearguard action to keep their opponents at bay through the second period before Solanke struck on the counter-attack to settle it two minutes from time.

Atletico had eliminated Arsenal in the previous round and arrived in sunny Surrey seeking to pile the misery on another English opponent.

Viveash was taking no chances, fielding a full-strength team containing Brown and Solanke, both tipped by Mourinho for bright futures, the talented Frenchman Jeremie Boga and England under-19 star Charlie Colkett.

After a quiet start in which both teams tested one another out, Chelsea had the first chance on 25 minutes when Boga sent a free-kick spiralling over Carlos Marin’s crossbar.

Just when it appeared the opening 45 would end without score, Brown broke free down the left channel and outpaced the Atletico defence. Colkett found him with the ideal through ball and Brown directed it past the goalkeeper.

With Andreas Christensen charging in to make sure, the under-pressure Manzanara got an unfortunate final touch to help it in. Brown will certainly want to claim the goal, his third goal of this season’s European campaign.

Atletico were much improved after the break, dictating the tempo and starting the create opening. Amath Diedhiou, who scored the last 16 winner against Arsenal, fired in a near post effort that Bradley Collins diverted around the post.

Shortly afterwards, Matija Spoljaric sent a bouncing shot narrowly wide as Chelsea’s goal came under threat.

But their defence refused to be breached and, in classic Chelsea style, they grabbed a second on the break in the dying moments.

Christensen, playing in midfield rather than his normal defensive position, showed his creative instincts with a fine pass to Solanke and the England under 18 international applied the finish. Remarkably, it is his ninth goal in the Youth League this season.

Chelsea are the first to book their place in the semi-finals, which take place across the road from UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on April 10. The final will be staged at the same venue three days later.
