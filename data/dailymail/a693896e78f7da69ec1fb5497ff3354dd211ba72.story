A finalist in Britain’s Shed of the Year competition might have to reduce his pride and joy to bricks and mortar – because he’s been letting it out without the say-so of council chiefs.

Jonathan Melville-Smith, 61, built the 80 sq ft shed out of recycled wood in his back garden in Lizard, Cornwall, but it is much more than your average outhouse.

Inside it contains a table, gas hob, basin, shelves, seats and a bunk bed on a tiny mezzanine level.

Mr Melville-Smith explained: ‘It’s sort of a wibbly-wobbly shape and has a door that looks a bit like a flame and reminds people of pixies and fairies.’

Jonathan Melville-Smith's shed, which is in his back garden in Lizard, Cornwall, is a finalist in Britain's Shed of the Year competition. But he may have to pull it down as he has been letting it without the council's permission

Not just a shed: The interior contains a table, gas hob, basin, shelves, seats and a bunk bed

Mr Melville-Smith had been letting out the 'pixie grotto' to holidaymakers keen to see St Keverne, an area of outstanding natural beauty in Cornwall

Magical: The shed's front door reminds people of pixies and fairies

But the very same qualities which won it a place as a finalist in the annual competition might risk its future.

Homeowners are allowed to put up modest outbuildings without special authorisation.

But the shed needs consent because Mr Melville-Smith has been letting it out to holidaymakers keen to appreciate the sights of St Keverne - an area of outstanding natural beauty in which it lies.

But Mr Melville-Smith insists he had no idea it needed Cornwall Council’s go ahead before he built it last year along with a series of gypsy huts, which he also now lets out.

He said: ‘At the time I didn’t really think garden sheds needed planning permission.

Creature comforts: The shed, which Mr Melville-Smith has been letting out, contains a all the mod cons to provide a comfortable break

Mr Melville-Smith has submitted a planning application to Cornwall Council and hopes that he will not have to tear his creation down

‘I didn’t set it out as a holiday let. I suppose I thought at the time, ‘it’s a shed’.

Now he has applied for planning permission in a bid to sway planners – otherwise he will have to stop using the shed as holiday accommodation or risk having to pull it down.

Mr Melville-Smith said the unique accommodation was an asset to the area and attracted lots of tourists.

‘Lots of people stop and take photographs and say how special it is to see something so unusual.

‘They wouldn’t come to Cornwall if it wasn’t for our unique accommodation.’

A spokesman for Cornwall Council said it was waiting to receive Mr Melville-Smith’s planning application before taking further action.
