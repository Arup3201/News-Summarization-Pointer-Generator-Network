David Cameron vowed to fight 'incredibly hard' to secure a good deal at today's EU summit

European leaders today claimed Britain will 'have to be convinced' to accept a rise in Brussels spending as David Cameron scrambled to build support for a real terms freeze.

The Prime Minister today warned any increase in the European Union's budget would be 'quite wrong'.

He vowed to protect the UK's prized rebate from Brussels negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

But Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's PM calling for a Budget increase, said Britain will have to fall into line.

'I can't imagine how we can convince them, but they will have to be convinced,' he told reporters as talks began in Brussels.

Mr Cameron flew out of Britain early this morning to be the first leader to hold face-to-face talks with Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.

The pair are meeting the other 26 EU leaders today ahead of formal talks over dinner tonight.

But tensions are already rising, with Britain demanding a cut or freeze in spending while other countries who benefit from vast EU handouts demanding big rises.

Sweden and the Netherlands have 
joined Britain in demanding big cuts. Germany, France, Finland and 
Austria want to freeze the maximum Brussels can draw from member states 
every year.

But 15 countries, led by Poland, want to see budget increases.

Amid growing speculation that the summit could continue until Sunday, Dutch PM Mark Rutte warned a deal will have to be done quickly or risk souring relations for months.

'If it doesn't happen at once we have to avoid worsening the atmosphere 
by so much that we need months to restore personal relations.'

Asked if he was ready to veto an unfavourable deal, Mr Rutte added: 'My idea is that you have to keep your loaded gun in your pocket and once you put it on the table you are putting so much pressure on the negotiations that they don't lead anywhere. I always have a loaded gun in my pocket during negotiations, only figuratively speaking, of course.'

Mr Cameron, who had a half hour meeting with Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, said: 'These are very important negotiations and clearly, at a time when we're making difficult decisions at home over public spending, it would be quite wrong - it is quite wrong - for there to be proposals for this increased extra spending in the EU.

'So we're going to be negotiating very hard for a good deal for Britain's taxpayers and for Europe's taxpayers, and to keep the British rebate.'

The summit will look to set the maximum ceiling for EU spending for 2014 to 2020 rather than the UK's contribution.

Mr van Rompuy has drawn up plans for a ceiling of 973 billion euros (£783 billion) at 2011 values.

This
 would represent a real-terms cut compared to the 993 billion euros 
limit for 2007-13. It is also well below the European Commission's 
request for 1,033 billion euros.

Nick Clegg said today: 'What we want from the European Union is just common sense. There is not enough money to go around at the moment. Everyone is tightening their belts, let's make sure it is reflected in the EU budget.'

The Prime Minister has vowed to fight 'incredibly hard' to protect Britain's rebate

A UK official said today: 'The Prime Minister wants an agreement, he is looking for an agreement," said one UK official. But he wants the EU budget to reflect what is happening in member states - and he wants the best deal for British taxpayers.'

Mr van Rompuy is holding one-on-one talks with all 27 leaders, including Mr Cameron, today before the summit formally opens.

Later
 he will produce a new 'negotiation box' which will try to take account 
of all the competing priorities of different countries.

There will then be a new round of wrangling. A third of countries is threatening to use a veto. The summit is due to end on Friday, but could last until Saturday or even Sunday.

One 
official said: 'Mr Van Rompuy will keep the leaders talking as long as 
it looks likely that there can be agreement.

'But he will not want to keep them at 
the negotiating table all weekend if the result is going to be a 
failure. There is the credibility of the EU to consider - better to end 
early and return another day than end in complete disarray.'

Leaders arriving at the summit today included European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who has criticised those calling for a spending cut, and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias

Ahead of today's crunch summit 
that is turning into a key diplomatic test of Mr Cameron’s premiership, 
France made it clear it is aiming to prise more cash out of the UK in 
the EU’s budget settlement for 2014 to 2020.

France’s socialist president Francois
 Hollande launched a thinly veiled attack on Britain’s ‘lack of 
solidarity’ with Europe for demanding it maintains its budget rebate.

Mr Hollande, whose country lost its 
AAA credit rating this week after putting the brakes on austerity 
measures, said countries he ‘would not name’ would come to the EU budget
 summit in Brussels today looking for ‘their discounts’.

‘At the exact moment we are calling 
for solidarity and mobilisation for growth, there are these countries 
that will be coming to get their cheques, their rebates and their 
discounts,’ he declared.

‘The idea that they have of Europe is 
to obtain exactly what they put in, as if solidarity doesn’t represent 
the most fortunate providing for the most hard up.’

Margaret Thatcher found that Britain's payments were relatively higher than other countries

And last night European Commission 
president Jose Manuel Barroso attacked those – such as Mr Cameron – 
proposing cuts to EU spending.

‘The European budget is not, as is 
sometimes claimed, a budget for Brussels  or Strasbourg,’ he said. ‘It 
is a budget  for investing in the economy of all  member states.

‘I have listened to the preparatory 
discussions, which all focus on how to make cuts. There is no real 
debate on the quality of investment – it is just cuts, cuts, cuts.’

European Council president Herman Van
 Rompuy appears open to British demands that the EU budget should be 
cut, but is understood to be proposing an £800million-a-year reduction 
in the rebate.

But in a sign of the scale of 
disagreement across the Continent, Britain is just one of ten countries 
threatening to block the proposed deal if changes are not made.

In the Commons, Tory MP David Nuttall 
challenged Mr Cameron to promise to veto any deal that reduces the 
rebate.

The Prime Minister answered: ‘I can give my honourable friend 
that assurance. The rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, is an 
incredibly important part of making sure Britain gets a fair deal in 
Europe.’

David Cameron seen with President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, will discuss the EU's budget cut

Mr Cameron launched a strong attack on
 Labour for giving up a chunk of the rebate in 2005 in return for 
reforms of agricultural subsidies that never materialised.

‘It is absolutely extraordinary that 
the last government gave away almost half of that rebate and we’ve never
 heard one word of apology, one word of regret, for the fact that 
however hard we fight in Europe – and I will be fighting incredibly hard
 this week for a good deal – they cut away our feet by giving away half 
the rebate,’ he said.

The rebate secured by Mrs Thatcher in 
Fontainebleau in 1984 is designed to compensate the UK for the fact that
 it receives relatively little support under the Common Agricultural 
Policy compared with similarly sized economies such as France.

It is worth about £2.9billion, and 
meant that Britain’s net contribution to the  EU budget in 2010 was 
£5.9billion rather than £8.8billion.

Labour agreed that the rebate should 
no longer apply to investment in relatively poor new member states, 
meaning Britain’s contributions will inevitably rise as the EU enlarges.
