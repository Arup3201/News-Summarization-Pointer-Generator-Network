A quarter of young men have used tanning products over the past year, according to research.

The bronzed look sported by stars of shows such as The Only Way Is Essex is increasingly being imitated by men, the study by market analysts Mintel suggests.

Fake-tan usage is only slightly higher among women aged 16 to 24, with 29 per cent admitting they use the products, compared with 27 per cent of men in the same age group.

And while as many as a fifth of men aged 16 to 24 said they would use it again, just nine per cent of this group said they would not repeat the look.

Males are the most likely to use salon spray tans and oral tanning supplements, with eight per cent admitting they tried the tablets.

The market is worth £60 million a year in Britain. 

Roshida Kahnom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel, said: 'As stars from shows such as The Only Way is Essex popularise self-tans, and even in some cases launch their own ranges, self-tanning remains fashionable for young people. 

'High usage of self-tanning products amongst young men suggests that they may be aspiring to recreate looks inspired by celebrities such as Mark Wright. 

'With summer becoming a distant memory, and as the nation gears up for a wet winter, our research suggests that young men are looking to extend the summer look with a year round tan.' 

Around 21 per cent of men aged 16 to 24 have used a sunbed or tanning salon.

On average 16 per cent of Brits have used self tan in the past twelve months, followed by gradual tanner at 15 per cent. 

One in ten have used pre-tan accelerator, while the same number have used tanning oil or lotion without SPF.  

'With self-tanning products traditionally associated with unnatural results, older people may be less willing to try it. 

'Additionally, self-tanning products can be tricky to apply, which may make it difficult for older people who tend to have looser and less hydrated skin. 

'Product innovations in self-tanning for older people, designed for looser skin, could make it more appealing to older people.' said Ms Kahnom.
