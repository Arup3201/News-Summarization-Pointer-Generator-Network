British Airways has provoked fury by drastically slashing the number of air miles points it will award passengers buying its cheapest economy class tickets.

Ordinary passengers who travel economy class will have the number of points they can earn slashed by 75 per cent while the points awarded to those in First and Business will be increased by up to 300 per cent.

Customers who have spent years collecting reward points for BA's scheme – launched as Air Miles but now called Avios – described the changes which take effect from April 28 as 'disgusting' and a 'devaluation.'

British Airways passengers are outraged following the announcement of a slashing of Avios points for economy passengers, beginning April 28

Many customers took to Twitter to voice their concern, including Michael Bhaskar who contemplated switching airline allegiance

They took to social media to complain that it now rewards rich and expense-account travellers at the cost of families on tight budgets who use the scheme to make their holidays more affordable.

BA is introducing different point pricing for reward flights 'depending on the time of the year, the cabin and zone.'

It says that for two-thirds of the year customers will require fewer points to travel. But for the busiest third of the year they will need more.

The airline - motto 'To Fly, To Serve' – defended the radical 'structural changes' by insisting the new system was fairer because 'those who pay more get more points.'

Those who book into the economy cabin will now receive 75% fewer 'air miles' or Avios points

It also allowed 500,000 more seats to be made available under the loyalty system – taking the total to nine million a year.

Avios is one of the world's biggest airmiles programmes used by 6.4 million travellers. The changes sparked an immediate backlash and accusations that the airline has 'gutted' the scheme.

The controversial and at times complex changes creating winners and losers were outlined in a letter to BA's 7,000 executive club members .

It sets out how points will be awarded more in line with the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket, rather than just the 'class' of ticket they buy.

Formerly called Air Miles, the Avios rewards points scheme will now be awarded based on the amount of money a passenger pays for their ticket

So an economy class passenger who buys a bargain-basement special offer ticket will earn far fewer points than the person sitting next to them who may have paid a lot more for a fully flexible economy ticket.

Under the current scheme, an economy return flight from Heathrow to Vancouver earns 9,400 points – enough for a round-trip from London to Milan, subject to a £35 payment. 

But some economy passengers face a 75 per cent drop in the number of Avios points earned, which will see them collect just 2,350 points. By contrast, business-class and first-class passengers on the same plane will see a rise of 9,400-points - enough to provide a free flight to Italy.

Another outraged customer claimed that the announcement is a 'worse deal for poor passengers'

As this Twitter users points out, the new scheme will make it harder to collect points in economy

Also under the new scheme, a basic economy-class ticket from London to New York will from April 28 earn just 865 air-miles – rather than the 3,458 available now.

Even 'Silver tier' executive club members – who include many middle-ranking managers and executives flying on business – will see their tier bonus slashed in half from 100 per cent to 50 per cent. This could affect their ability to continue qualifying for silver status, and for the perks they currently receive, such as use of the executive lounge at airports and priority boarding.

British travellers who live outside London and use connecting flights from regional airports to fly to other destinations in Europe will be among the worst hit. Passengers in Scotland and northern

England travelling to mainland Europe will no longer be entitled to a free domestic connecting flight. This will 'bring the UK in line with the rest of the world'.

'Silver tier' club members will see their bonus slashed in half, which could affect their perks, such as the use of lounges in airports

Tweeter Craig Garland believes that British Airways 'have ruined the executive club' with this move

Those flying from Edinburgh to Heathrow and connecting to Geneva currently pay 9,000 Avios plus £35 per person for a return journey . From April, the number of points needed, and the cash supplement required, will double.

By contrast, business and first-class passengers are the big winners. First class passengers will see their Avios points rise by as much as two-thirds. Transatlantic passengers from Heathrow to New York's JFK will earn 8,645 points on their one-way flight - up from 5,187.

The changes will also hit passengers when they come to cash-in their points as British Airways introduces 'peak' and 'off peak' pricing for reward flights covering periods such as the school summer holidays, Christmas and Easter. So a single flight to Rome will cost 7,500 points in peak-season July compared to 6,500 points in less popular January. 

However, for those flying first class, passengers' Avios points may rise by as much as two-thirds

However, business travellers will see a rise in the number of Avios points they need for a flight. For example, a business class flight from London to Sydney currently costs 100,000 points, but this will rise to 125,000 at off-peak times and 150,000 at peak times. Travellers also have to pay taxes, fees and charges.

BA Executive Club boss James Hillier said in his letter to points collectors: 'Our lowest priced tickets in Euro Traveller and World Traveller will award a minimum Avios of 25% per mile flown instead of 100%.

'In Club World/Club Europe and our First cabins the Avios you earn will either remain the same as it is now or increase up to 300% per mile flown depending on the cabin and type of ticket,' he added.

But many passengers were unconvinced.

Customer James Russell tweeted: 'Looks like British Airways just utterly gutted the Avios scheme for most flyers. Shame, it made a big difference to the overall cost.' Suzanne (@philatravelgirl) tweeted: 'Shame to see the British Airways Avios devalution.' She said Philadelphia to London had risen from 80,000 to 120,000 points 'plus exorbitant taxes/fees of $1,000.' Antonio Fersini tweeted: 'British Airways is disgusting the way you reward the richer with more.'

BA defended its shake up and insisted that 'for two thirds of the year you will require fewer Avios than now to fly on reward seats.' A British Airways spokesman said: 'An off-peak economy return to New York will cost 26,000 Avios, down from 40,000 at present'.

'We're now guaranteeing there will be nine million redemption seats a year available – more than 500,000 more than before. For the first time, we guarantee that there will be a minimum of four seats in economy and two in business available for booking with Avios on every BA flight.'
