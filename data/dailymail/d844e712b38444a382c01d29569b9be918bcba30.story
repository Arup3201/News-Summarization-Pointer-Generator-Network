Three passenger jets sighted UFOs above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their approach to Gatwick Airport, a report has revealed.

Their pilots each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft.

Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared.

Eerie coincidence: The encounter happened very close to the British Scientology headquarters in East Grinstead, Werst Sussex

The encounter, which was probed by the UK Airprox Board, happened on December 30 just before 9am.

A Boeing 777 was flying over the Scientology headquarters in East Grinstead minutes from touchdown when all three pilots on the flightdeck spotted the objects about 100ft below them moving slowly or stationary, according to the report.

A following Boeing 767 also spotted the two white or silver discs, which were at approximately 1,000ft above ground. An Airbus A319 then landed before the objects disappeared from ATC screens.

Believer: Tom Cruise follows the controversial church, which says aliens inhabit human bodies

The crew of the first aircraft described seeing 'some some sort of toy'.Â  The information was passed on to air traffic control and then to police.

Investigators offered the possibility the objects could have been balloons or kites but, with the UFOs remaining untraced, the incidents was deemed unassessable.

The encounter came the day before Scientologists, followed by actor Tom Cruise, carved a message to aliens in hills in New Mexico, America. The cult believes aliens inhabit human bodies.

The Airprox Board primarily investigates near misses between aircraft.
