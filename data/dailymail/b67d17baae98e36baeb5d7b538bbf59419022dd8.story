Police and paramedics were called to the West End Debenhams at 6.15pm yesterday but the customer could not be saved. 

A shopper told the Evening Standard: 'It was obvious something horrible happened.

'Decorative boxes for a Christmas display were scattered around and about 20 minutes later they said over the Tannoy the store was closing immediately.'

The shop is Debenhams' largest store, covering seven floors.

The department store boasts five floors of clothing, three restaurants and their largest ever selection of beauty products.

A Met police spokesman said: 'Police were called  to Debenhams in Oxford Street to a man who had fallen from an escalator.

'Police and London Ambulance Service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene.'

A source told MailOnline that the man most likely jumped to his death and did not trip and fall. 

A Debenhams spokesman said: 'Police were called to the Oxford Street Debenhams store at 18.15 last night following a serious incident where a man fell from the third floor. 

'At this stage there are thought to be no suspicious circumstances.

'Police and London Ambulance Service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Debenhams continues to work with the authorities on the matter'.
