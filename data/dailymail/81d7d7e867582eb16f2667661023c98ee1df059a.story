During a typical English summer, there are very few opportunities to lie on the beach and feel the hot sand beneath you.

So when families in Torquay, Devon, visited what they thought was a golden stretch of shoreline to relax in the glorious sunshine - they were furious to find Preston Beach covered in seaweed.

But instead of heading home, many decided to dig their way through four inches of slippery, stinking sludge on the half-mile stretch of coast, determined to relax on the bright green beach.

Green with envy? Sunbathers were forced to clear away a carpet of seaweed on Preston Beach in Torquay, Devon which was four inches deep in some places

Some people did give up though, blaming the council for failing to clear the seaweed which regularly coats the beach.

Local resident Carol Greechan, who headed to the popular sunspot on Monday with her two grandchildren, said: 'I’m been going there for 30 years and I’ve never seen it so bad.

'It was crispy on top and slimy underneath. The smell was absolutely revolting but the colour was remarkable.

'It was heart-breaking, we had to dig a little hole to find some sand in a pool of seaweed. We have got beautiful weather but you can’t go on the beach.'

Response: Torbay Council, which says the occurrence is a natural phenomenon, cleans the beach on a rota three times a week. However this stretch of coast was not scheduled to be cleared that day

Torbay Council said it cleans its beaches on a rota and it just so happened that Preston hadn’t been scheduled for a clean-up that day.

A spokesman said: 'There is a rota for beach cleaning - usually three beaches each day - and Preston is cleared on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Fridays, depending on the suitability of the tides and how busy the beach is.

'This year there has been one complaint from a member of the public about seaweed on beaches.

'It is widely understood that the tide and the sea will generate this natural occurrence, especially in the summer, and that Torbay Council has a reliable and appropriate system in place for its removal with minimal disruption to beach users.'

The council have since cleaned up the beach. However, the overcast conditions meant there was only one sunbather - with a tent and a windshield - on the beach.

Cleared: The council has now removed the carpet of seaweed that covered Preston Beach. However, the overcast conditions meant there was only one sunbather - with a tent and wind shield - on the beach
