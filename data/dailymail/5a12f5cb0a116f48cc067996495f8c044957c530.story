Manchester United have sacked one of their European scouts after he was accused of posting a series of racially offensive comments on social media.

Torben Aakjaer, a 32-year-old Dane who joined the club from Hamburg in 2011, was suspended on Wednesday afternoon and then had his contract terminated following an brief investigation led by chief executive Ed Woodward.

His Facebook account contained several anti-immigration messages, including support for Denmark to close its borders and put 'extra personnel on every crossover and exit so all that eastern Europe dirt and sh.. can be kept out' and a photograph of six pigs with a caption: 'It's time to deploy our secret weapons against Islamists.'

In a further post on the social networking site, he can be seen in conversation about the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, when a friend comments that he hopes France will 'throw the rest of all that s*** they have in their country out'. Aakjaer replies: 'Couldn't agree more. Let's hope other countries including our beloved Denmark follows that example efficiently.'

Aakjaer, whose Facebook page also includes references to his trips around Europe covering matches for the club and images of visits to their Carrington training ground - including a lunch with Robin van Persie and Nemanja Vidic. 

However, it is understood he was not a permanent United staff member and used on a casual basis to scout young players for the club's academy rather than the first team. Aakjaer had not scouted anyone of note and was not considered a key member of the scouting team.

On his Instagram page, the Dane has posted several pictures including a selfie with United winger Nani and he also published a picture of a letter he received from Sir Alex Ferguson wishing him well on his wedding day.

Aakjaer initially denied using racist or aggressive language following a report by the Guardian, but United acted swiftly once presented with the evidence.

A statement from Old Trafford said: 'The club received the evidence, launched an immediate investigation into the matter and has terminated our association with Mr Aakjaer. Manchester United is an inclusive organisation and will not tolerate this sort of behaviour.'
