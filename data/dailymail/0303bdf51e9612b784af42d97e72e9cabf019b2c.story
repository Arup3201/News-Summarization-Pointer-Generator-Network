Around 40 pupils were sent home on the first day back to school after the Christmas break for not wearing the correct uniform - including one boy who was wearing the wrong colour socks.

Dozens of children were refused entry to Strood Academy, Kent, on Monday for not complying with the school's strict uniform policy.

Furious parents said teachers turned children away at the gate for wearing the wrong kind of trousers, blazer and even socks.

Harri Scott, a 12-year-old girl with autism, was turned away because her black, tailored trousers were 'wrong', her mother said.

'Being singled out and turned away made her really upset,' mother Jackie Winter told KentOnline.

'Harri has worn those same trousers for two terms now, and suddenly the school said they were inappropriate, but they haven't said why.

'They even left it up to the children to ring home and to make their own way back. As far as I'm concerned when my child is at school she is under their duty of care and it is their responsibility to make sure she is safe, not let her off school grounds to walk home on her own, without even knowing for sure if I'd been contacted. What if something had happened to her?' 

Other parents, including Ashley Hitch, 33, who works at Medway Maritime Hospital, reported having to leave work to pick up their children and sort out the problem.

Furious parents said their children were told to go home for wearing the wrong kind of trousers, blazer and even socks

Miss Hitch, whose daughter Chelsie, 13, was pulled up for wearing 'too skinny' trousers, said: 'The teachers were standing outside the gates with clipboards turning pupils away. It was like a power trip.

'They obviously don't have enough to do. They are teaching pupils about appearance rather than actually educating them.'

Headmistress Kim Gunn said she would make no excuses for her school's 'high standards'

Meanwhile parent Laura Hopwood said her friend's son was sent home for wearing navy socks instead of black ones.

The academy's uniform policy states that girls must wear the academy blazer with the school's badge, as well as a skirt which should sit no higher than just above the knee.

Girls can also choose to wear black, tailored trousers or a pinstriped blouse with black or skin-toned tights or black socks.

Meanwhile boys must wear the blazer, a white shirt and the academy's tie.

They must wear black trousers and both boys and girls should wear black shoes.  

Strood Academy headmistress Kim Gunn said: 'Strood Academy make no excuses for having high standards for their students, including uniform.

'Unfortunately, a very small number of students have persistently challenged the uniform expectations despite numerous reminders and conversations with families

'Four letters, a newsletter item and a website notification were sent to parents asking them to ensure that students were in correct uniform or they would be sent home to rectify the uniform issue. 

'Pupils who informed staff that they were unable to safely make their way home were kept in school.' 

Pupils and parents around the country have found themselves the victims of stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's classrooms this school year.

Around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term in September when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them their footwear was not 'black, leather shoes' and was 'inappropriate'.

Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good.

'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing?

'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.'

A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School.

His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help.

'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.'

In October, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight.

They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform.

Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight.

She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her. 

In November, Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire sent home 215 pupils over two days after strictly enforcing a new dress code.

Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard.

A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. 

Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers.
