It has not been captured in a drama series since The Jewel in the Crown in the 1980s.

But colonial India is returning to our television screens in the form of new period saga Indian Summers.

Considered to be Channel 4’s equivalent to Downton Abbey but set in India, veteran actress Julie Walters has a starring role in the lavish £14m production - making it the most expensive drama commission in the channel’s history.

Considered to be Channel 4's equivalent to Downton Abbey, veteran actress Julie Walters has a starring role in Indian Summers

Set in Simla, a Himalayan hill station, Indian Summers follows the passions and politics of the period, among both the British elite and the Indian population.

The first episode of the 10 part series will air on Sunday February 15th at 9pm putting it head-to-head with Casual Vacancy, the BBC’s hotly anticipated adaptation of JK Rowling’s novel set in a fictional English town called Pagford.

Speaking at a screening of episode one, series executive producer Charlie Pattinson said the money spent on Indian Summers was evidence of channel 4’s ‘extraordinary confidence’.

Mr Pattinson said:' Paul (Rutman, writer) came to me, with Simon Curtis (another executive producer).

'It’s not often that someone comes to you with a fully formed, madly ambitious… they came and they pitched me 50 hours of television that would start in 1932 and would follow these characters through a massive romantic, political saga, through to independence, and in so doing describe a key piece of history. So this was entirely originally work.

‘We’ve got an amazing television season this year. If you look around it most of our work is adaptations and I think that’s the extraordinary confidence of Channel 4, that they sat and they looked at an original piece of work, that’s not an adaptation, and is hugely ambitious and went this is a story that is work telling, and in a very modern way. 

'The notion of a television novel, in the way that David Simon (The Wire creator) described Baltimore or whatever it would be in The Wire, is new and exciting and I think that was the ambition that Paul and Simon brought to me, and what I responded to.’

Indian Summers also stars Jemima West, who is best known for appearing in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and The Borgias, as well as The Inbetweeners actor Henry Lloyd Hughes, Ayesha Kala, from Shameless, and Bollywood stars Lillette Dubey and Roshan Seth.
