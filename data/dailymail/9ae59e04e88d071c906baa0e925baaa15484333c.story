The start of this season’s January transfer window in England has been delayed by 24 hours to open on Saturday — so it complies with FIFA’s wish that it stays open for only 31 days.

The reason is that the last day of the month, January 31, falls on a Saturday when there is a full fixture list. 

With Sunday not classified as a business day, that pushes back the close of the window to Monday, February 2 at 11pm.

January's transfer window has been delayed by 24 hours — so it complies with Sepp Blatter and FIFA’s wish

Uefa have ruled that to avoid any major league gaining a competitive advantage, all transfer windows should run for a maximum of 31 days.

A Premier League spokesman confirmed: ‘This is about the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) — the system through which all international transfers have to be registered. 

'TMS can only be open for 31 days in the winter window (FIFA rules). We aligned our window with that in mind.’
