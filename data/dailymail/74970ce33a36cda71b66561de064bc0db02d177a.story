Fur-nomenon! An abandoned rescue cat has become an internet hit after amassing more than one million followers on Instagram

She's so popular, you can even buy t-shirt or a phone case of her face. 

But there was a time when four-year-old Nala, who was adopted from an animal shelter, didn't have a friend in the world.

At just four months old Nala was ditched by her owners who couldn't afford to look after her.

It was then she started to develop breathing problems.

To make things worse, Nala was separated from her siblings, who were also abandoned at the shelter, but luckily for them, they were adopted soon after. 

Nala's luck soon changed when cat-lover Varisiri Mathachittiphan - nicknamed Pookie - laid her eyes upon the ailing kitty. 

The 27-year-old from Los Angeles adopted the cat without hesitation and soon nursed the cat back to health.

She was then inspired to set up an Instagram account to share Nala's experiences with her family and friends.

Pookie now uses Nala's account to spread awareness for animal welfare, urging pet owners to neuter their animals to avoid over-population at shelters

She said: 'When Nala licked my face I knew she was the one that I was going to take home.

'But it wasn't until she was adopted and cared for, that she became the lovable cat she is today. 

'Even though I never really intended to adopt a kitten that day, when I saw her, I just knew it was meant to be.

'After given love and attention, and of course some medicine, Nala was back to 100%, and has grown up healthy and big.'

She said: 'Nala is like a lot of cats - curious and playful, but she is different in her own way.

'I started Nala's Instagram account two years ago to share her with my friends, but I had no idea that it would come this far. 

'I'm not sure if it's because she's cute, or if it's because of her background, but I like to believe that Nala is an underdog.'
