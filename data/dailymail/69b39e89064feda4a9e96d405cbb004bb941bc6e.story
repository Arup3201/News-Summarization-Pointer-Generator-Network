Devon is the most popular place in Britain to build a new home, a survey has revealed. 

Around 7million people in the UK dream of transforming a plot of land into their own customised dream home. 

In 2014 Devon became the most searched-for county for people looking for the perfect spot to build their own properties, closely followed by the Scottish Highlands and then Kent.

Devon is the most popular place to build your own home in the UK, followed by the Scottish Highlands

Southern regions of the UK feature heavily in the list - with Cambridgeshire, Somerset and Avon, Hampshire, Cornwall and Sussex all in the top 10 places budding house builders search for to build their own homes. 

Aberdeenshire in Scotland and Carmarthenshire in west Wales also appear in the top 10 places as many people search for rural spots to build their dream homes.  

The relatively unspoiled countryside of Devon may appeal to some home builders, with 18,500 online plot searches done for the county in the last 12 months. Searches also typically peak around January as people look to move home and make a fresh start in the new year.

Prices for plots in the UK vary widely across the country, but can start from as little as £6,950. 

However in Virginia Water in Surrey a 1.5 acre plot can cost £5.2million. 

Building your own home appeals to many people because it gives them the chance to tailor every inch of their house to their needs. 

Ray and Michele Blundell spent 14 years perfecting their own 'mock tudor' cottage in Lichfield to build their house from scratch for £200,000. 

The idyllic countryside in Devon, shown here at Widecombe in the Moor in Dartmoor, could be the attraction

The property resembles a 16th century cottage complete with exposed beams and medieval carpentry. 

The couple taught themselves construction and plumbing skills and the house is now worth around £600,000. 

Researchers said it can take people who wish t build their own homes up to two years to find the perfect plot. 

PlotSearch, a plot finding website, compiled the top ten lists of where people want to build their homes in the UK by analysing the number of searches in the last 12 months.
