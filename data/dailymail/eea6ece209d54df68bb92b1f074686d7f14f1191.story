The commercial production of eggs for fast growing GM salmon has been given approval in a crucial step to bringing ‘Frankenfish’ to the world’s kitchens.

The salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from the eel-like Ocean pout and Chinook salmon, which means they grow more quickly than their wild or farmed equivalent.

The US authorities are in the final stages of an approval process to allow the first genetically modified animals for human consumption.

While salmon are the first GM fish soon to be approved, plans are also in place to create fast-growing trout and tilapia.

Biotech companies believe there are huge riches to be had from tapping into the fast growing fish farming industry, which is said to be worth $100 billion a year.

Typically the GM salmon grow to be around 24 inches long and a market weight of 3kg in 18 months rather than three years for farmed Atlantic salmon.

Some of the salmon, which have been developed by the company AquaBounty, have been grown to reach 11lb (5kg).

The addition of genes from the ocean pout and the chinook salmon triggers the release of growth hormone and encourages them to eat and grow all year round, rather than just the spring and summer.

The net effect is that fish farming companies can harvest the fish much more often, so boosting production and profits.

AquaBounty
 Technologies Inc is based in Canada, however it is listed on the London
 Stock Market where it is keen to enlist investors.

Today,
 the company said it was received clearance from the Government of 
Canada to produce eggs on a commercial scale at its facility in Prince 
Edward Island, Canada.

Critics
 fear the GM salmon will escape into the wild. It is suggested they 
might interbreed with wild fish or effectively kill off wild populations
 because they will consume all the available food.

However, AquaBounty insists there are a number of key safeguards that will stop this from happening.

Initially at least, the eggs will be shipped to a land-locked fish farm in western Panama, where they will be grown to market size in vast metal tanks, away from rivers and the sea. The salmon would be frozen and shipped to the U.S. and around the world.

In future, fish farm tanks would be established across the globe to meet growing demand for what is considered a healthy fish variety.

All the GM salmon are designed to be female and sterile, which should, in theory, prevent any risk of interbreeding.

The approval for commercial production of the GM salmon eggs was granted following a risk assessment conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which involved independent scientists and the government agency, Environment Canada.

This study concluded AquaBounty’s 
salmon ‘is not harmful to the environment or human health when produced 
in contained facilities’.

A
 company spokesman said: ‘While AquaBounty’s eggs and fish will not be 
available for sale until they are approved by the relevant national 
regulatory bodies, this is a significant milestone towards commercial 
production.’

Campaigning
 groups in the UK and overseas have raised significant questions about 
the ethics and safety of producing GM fish for human consumption.

They
 claim the fish farm in Panama has been built without all the necessary 
inspections and permits to ensure the site is secure and safe.

Dr Helen Wallace of GeneWatch UK said: ‘It is shocking that commercial production of GM salmon could be authorised in future in facilities which fail to meet environmental standards.’

GeneWatch claims the EU food watchdog, the European Food Safety Authority, has not put in sufficient safeguards to ensure GM fish cannot come in to member states without proper checks on their safety.

It is also a grey area as to whether GM fish imported from Panama or other parts of the world would have to be labelled to ensure consumers know what they are eating.

British consumers have made clear in surveys that labelling is a minimum requirement, however the record of the British government has been to oppose putting such information on packs.

The Canadian Biotechnology Action Network condemned the approval for commercial production of GM salmon eggs.

Spokesman Lucy Sharratt said: ‘We are extremely disappointed and alarmed that our government has approved the production of GM fish eggs. GM salmon egg production in Canada

endangers the future of wild Atlantic salmon around the world.

‘It’s simply crazy that the world’s first GM fish eggs are now going to be coming from Canada.’

‘It’s unacceptable that this incredibly important decision was made in total secrecy and without any public consultation.’

The GM fish egg production is opposed by the Prince Edward Island group called Islanders Say No to Frankenfish.

Spokesman, Leo Broderick, said: ‘We’re devastated that Prince Edward Island is now officially the home of the Frankenfish. We don’t want our Island to be the source of this dangerous living pollution.’
