The mistle thrush is fast disappearing from the UK's gardens, wildlife experts warned today as they urged people to take part in an annual survey to collect information about bird species.

Results from the RSPB's annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey have shown that mistle thrushes are now being seen in fewer than half the number of gardens they were spotted in 10 years ago.

The RSPB is urging the public to take part in this year's survey, which takes place this weekend, to help gather important information on how mistle thrushes and other garden bird species are faring.

Under threat: Sightings of the mistle thrush are down 28 per cent between 1995 and 2010 and wildlife experts are asking the public to look out for them and other birds in the annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey

The event, described by the conservation charity as the world's biggest wildlife survey, is now in its 34th year. Since starting in 1979 it has helped highlight dramatic declines in some garden birds.

Starling numbers have fallen from an average of 15 per garden in 1979 to just three in 2012, while house sparrow numbers have fallen by two-thirds in the same period, although the two species are still the most commonly seen.

But some birds have seen their fortunes improve, with garden birds such as blue tits, great tits and coal tits on the increase since 1979.

And goldfinches, which were absent from the Big Garden Birdwatch in its early years, have featured regularly in the top 15 species spotted since 2004.

Martin Harper, RSPB conservation director, said: 'Everyone that has ever taken part in Big Garden Birdwatch has helped to make us aware of huge changes in the populations of birds like house sparrows, starlings and song thrushes, leading us to do more work on the decline of these familiar birds.

'Mistle thrushes are already on the amber-list of conservation concern and are closely related to the threatened song thrush. The rate of decline we've seen throughout Big Garden Birdwatch suggest both these species are in need of help.'

Named for their fondness for mistletoe berries, mistle thrushes are large, aggressive and powerful songbirds.

They are also known as stormcocks after country legends that they are the last birds to be heard before a storm.

Mistle thrushes sing throughout the winter to defend territories that are rich in fruit, making their song the easiest way to recognise them.

They can also be identifed by their pale, black-spotted plumage and are most likely to be noticed at perched high atop trees.

Early nesters, their mournful songs can be heard echoing across chilly gardens as early as February.

'It's a species that very often people will mistake for a song thrush. They're both medium sized, brown and white birds with large spots,' said the RSPB's Graham Madge.

'But mistle thrushes are great characters and they will very often give their presence away by their call.'

Graham Madge of the RSPB told the BBC that there is still much to learn about just why mistle thrush numbers are in such a steep decline.

'It's reaching rates where as a community we should begin to develop some concerns because its population does seem to be haemorrhaging from our gardens, woodlands and countryside,' he said.

'Over the last six or seven years of Big Garden Birdwatch, the participants have been telling us that mistle thrushes have been declining - even over that short period.'

Last year almost 600,000 people, including 90,000 pupils and teachers at schools, took part in Birdwatch activities, counting 9million birds between them.

The survey, which sees volunteers count the bird visitors to their garden for an hour over the last weekend in January, is described as the largest citizen science project in the world.

People can take part by spending an hour at any time this weekend counting birds in their garden or park, noting the highest number of each bird species seen at any one time and submitting the results to the RSPB.

Schoolteachers and children will be doing the same thing in their school grounds as part of the Big Schools Birdwatch over the next week.

Sarah Houghton, RSPB manager for the Birdwatch, said: 'No matter where people take part, whether at home with the family, with classmates at school or with friends in the beer garden of the local pub, we’re all joining forces to gather vital information about some of our most familiar garden birds.

'It’s a great way to get to know the creatures that live around us, and that’s especially important for children. 

'Feeding garden birds can often be a child’s first encounter with wildlife and can spark a lifelong interest in nature.'

She added: 'The declines of birds like starlings and sparrows over the last 30 years or so have been alarming, but Big Garden Birdwatch has helped us find out more about their numbers and distribution across UK gardens, and that has been the first step in helping to put things right.'
