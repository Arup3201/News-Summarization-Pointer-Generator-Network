Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish came under fire from Liverpool supporters on Sunday night after making a comment on Twitter about their celebrations following the FA Cup win.

Making reference to his own club’s progress since he took over at Selhurst Park in 2010, Parish tweeted: ‘When we took over we just avoided going to the third tier. Yesterday #LFC beat us. They are celebrating like they won the league #progress’

However, several Liverpool fans on the social media site took offence and accused Parish of being bitter and classless, forcing the Palace owner to defend his statement, insisting he was simply paying tribute to how far the Eagles have come in the past five years.

Fraizer Campbell gave Palace the lead at Selhurst Park on Saturday before goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana saw Liverpool come from behind to win 2-1.

It means Liverpool qualify for the FA Cup quarter-finals and will be in the draw on Monday night. 

Palace will switch their focus to the Premier League as they look to avoid being drawn into a relegation battle with the London club sitting 13th - five points above the bottom three.
