Damning: Lord Tebitt accused the Prime Minister of relying on advisers 'without any experience or much understanding of the party or indeed politics'

David Cameron and George Osborne were
accused of running a ‘government by chums’ yesterday as they faced a 
series of  highly personal attacks from within the Tory party.

Former party chairman Lord Tebbit 
said the Prime Minister and Chancellor relied too much on advisers who 
lack ‘experience or much understanding of the party or politics’.

And he warned that Downing Street’s 
‘cash for access’ row and the fuel strike panic had reinforced the view 
that Mr Cameron was ‘born to privilege’.

Growing numbers of disgruntled 
Conservative MPs have also accused the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne of 
being out of touch with the party and Tory voters.

Stewart Jackson, a former 
parliamentary private secretary, said there was concern ‘that the 
Government is being run by a clique’ and called for more people with 
‘principles and integrity’.

The influential 1922 Committee of 
Tory backbenchers has warned Mr Cameron he needs to make major changes 
to the way he runs his Government. The attacks follow simmering internal
rows within the party over issues such as taxes on pensioners and 
pasties, gay marriage, the fuel crisis and the axing of child benefit.

The Prime Minister’s personal rating –
the difference between the number of voters who think he is doing a 
good job and those who do not – plunged to -27 in the latest YouGov 
poll.

Writing in The Times, Lord Tebbit 
said Mr Cameron’s carefully orchestrated public relations photo 
opportunities such as cycling to work, and not wearing a tie to black 
tie dinners, will not make voters forget his background of wealth and 
privilege.

Accused of being out of touch: David Cameron and George Osborne

He added that senior figures in  the 
Tory Party ‘had their paths lubricated with money from cradle to school,
to university and on through public relations and Westminster village 
bag-carrying’.

Lord Tebbit said: ‘After another week
of hasty, ill-thought-through policy initiatives and the calls to hoard
petrol, many Conservatives are questioning this style of government by 
chums.’

He described Andrew Feldman, 
co-chairman of the Tory party and  a university contemporary of  the 
Prime Minister, as another  ‘Cameron chum’.

Mr Osborne is also under mounting 
pressure from Tory backbenchers following his widely criticised handling
of the Budget. Nadine Dorries, a former nurse, attacked him for being 
out of touch with working-class voters, saying: ‘At the root of much of 
the catastrophe we have become is George Osborne. He drives the liberal 
elite agenda.’

In an apparent reference to the 
feuding between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, she took to Twitter to add:
‘History is teaching us that when you have a Chancellor who is more 
interested in becoming Prime Minister, he messes up.’

Criticising Mr Osborne’s 
‘self-appointed’ dual role as Chancellor and head of Conservative 
political strategy, she said: ‘It’s about influence controlling 
outcomes, not letting others shine ensuring own succession.’

Mr Jackson said: ‘David Cameron would
do well to take on board the criticism. The tone and tenor of his 
leadership is in danger of sending the wrong signal to Middle England 
voters. We need less Lords reform and gay marriage and more reducing 
taxes for ordinary voters, giving small business a leg-up and telling 
the EU courts where to go on Abu Qatada.

‘People are very concerned that the 
Government is being run by a clique. We need more authentic voices and 
less teenage scribblers at Number 10. People with life experience, 
principles and integrity. We are in danger of becoming obsessed with the
liberal chattering classes who are never going to vote for us.’

Tory MP Mark Reckless warned that the
Coalition had empowered Civil Service ‘Sir Humphreys’ to make policy 
decisions and accused Mr Osborne of ignoring backbenchers’ concerns over
the axing of child benefit for high-earners.

He said: ‘We have seen a whole raft 
of strange Civil Service initiatives rather than the political 
leadership the country needs.’

Loyalist Tory MPs hit back at Mr 
Cameron’s critics. Charlie Elphicke, an executive member of the 1922 
Committee, said: ‘It is not the Prime Minister who needs to get a grip 
but colleagues on the backbenches who need to realise that government is
not a cakewalk.’

Kris Hopkins, another Conservative 
MP, warned that his disgruntled colleagues risked ‘compromising’ the 
party. He said: ‘There should be constant challenge to the leadership, 
it shouldn’t start from the position of dislike for the Prime Minister.’

But Tory MP Mark Pritchard said Mr 
Cameron should hold an early reshuffle to promote more ministers from 
state schools and working-class homes ‘to make the government a little 
less foie gras and a little more fish and chips’.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said 
the Prime Minister would not be changing the way he governs. He said 
tackling the deficit ‘involves taking some difficult decisions, but we 
are getting on with the job’.
