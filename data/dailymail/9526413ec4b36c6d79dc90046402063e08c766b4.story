Prime Minister Tony Abbott is reportedly considering sending Royal Australia Air Force aircraft to join the US in carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State.

The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria.

Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command.

US warplanes have hit a wide range of Islamic State militant targets, including artillery, armoured personnel carriers, armoured Humvees, light trucks, mortar positions, checkpoints and roadside bomb emplacements.

There's potential for the air campaign to expand into Syria, in which case the US would have to call on aircraft and other elements of its military based in the Middle East and possibly Europe.

Australia could also join the US's air campaign, as well as extend its military role in Iraq more generally, as was laid out in Mr Abbott's foreign policy speech at Adelaide University last week, The Australian reported.

'We will do what we reasonably and prudently can to encourage American leadership because that leadership provided global security and stability,' the Prime Minister said.

'We are talking to our partners about how we might contribute to international efforts to protect people against the advances of the ISIS terrorists.'

As the US began its airstrikes earlier this month, Mr Abbott said the Australian Government was looking at joining the US in 'humanitarian airdrops' over northern Iraq.

'This is a potential humanitarian disaster,' Mr Abbott said, in reference to the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - surrounded by Islamic State fighters threatening to kill them.

Mr Abbott said RAAF aircraft is prepared to participate in humanitarian food drops in Iraq, and has two aircraft in the United Arab Emirates that could assist 'within days'.

Previously, Australia has been unable to answer US calls for air strike assistance due to concerns about the self-defence capabilities of RAAF aircraft.

But The Australian reports that the RAAF now have aircraft suitable for Iraq.
