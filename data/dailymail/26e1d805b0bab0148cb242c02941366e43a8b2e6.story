Once an endangered species on the brink of extinction, the majestic gray whale is now a common sight off the California coast.

The 40-foot, 40-ton behemoths have become so common that sightings off the Los Angeles coast have doubled since 2012.

The huge pods are migrating from Alaska to Baja California in increasing numbers and scientists are baffled as to why it's happening.

Prevalent: Whale watchers are delighted by the number of whales they are spotting swimming off the California coast this year

And while the researchers wonder if its a change in salinity, shifting currents or perhaps an explosion in population of the massive mammals that's made them such a common sight, whale watchers are delighted at their suddenly easy hobby. 

'It’s pretty exciting. It’s the first time I’ve been out here and I’ve been in California for 50 years ,' whale watcher Trenna Cousins told KCAL.

The folks at Captain Dave’s Dolphin & Whale Watching Safari couldn't be happier.

Heading south: More than twice as many of the 40 ton majestic mammals have appeared off the California coast this season as they make their way to the warmer waters off Mexico

'We’ve seen more whales than I have ever seen in my 20 years or so of being a captain,' said Captain Dan Salas while on an expedition Tuesday.

The whales migrate each year from the arctic waters of the Bering Sea to the warm currents off the coast of Mexico.

They aren't an uncommon sight around December, but they've certainly never been prevalent like they have been this past year.

Scientists are puzzled as to why the whales are suddenly so common.

'It could  have to do with currents, it could have to do with temperature or salinity. It doesn't have to do with food because they don't eat on south- or north-bound migration,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger, director of the Gray Whale Census Project told CBS News.

Thar she blows: A gray whale comes up for air as sprawling Los Angeles looms in the background. The species was once nearly extinct but has made a huge comeback in recent decades. While scientists are unsure if the cause is increased population, more gray whales than ever before are being spotted off the coast of California

While there is no evidence the whale population is increasing, scientists say this past year has seen an increase in the number of calves traveling in the massive pods.

Despite the uncertainty, researchers hope the more prevalent sightings mean positive things are happening for the once-critically endangered creatures.

'It could very well mean that more are coming down because they're pregnant and ready to give birth, and others are coming down ready to get pregnant for the next year,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger.

Scientists say the record number of sightings could be the result of a change in currents, salinity or other natural phenomenon

Gray whales were hunted to near-extinction by the early 1900s but rebounded after they were declared endangered in 1973
