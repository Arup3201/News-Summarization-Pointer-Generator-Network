Bassem, the husband of Mahassen Issa, who is facing court in Lebanon, has spoken of his heartbreak

The husband of the Australian woman charged in Lebanon with either adultery or bigamy has spoken out about his devastation at learning his wife had married another man before divorcing him.

Bassem, a custom-made furniture designer from Sydney's west, said he and Mahassen Issa were married for 10 years before she went to Lebanon and began a relationship with Mohammad Awick.

'I love her so much, I'd do anything, why has she done this?' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Bassem also expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'.

'She’s a devil. This lady, she’s a devil,' he said.

Bassem acknowledged the couple had been having problems, saying that he had moved out of their home on April 13 and had begun divorce proceedings.

But he denied her claims they had been separated since last September, saying they went on a holiday to Queensland together in February to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary.

His comments come as Ms Issa faces a Lebanese court after leaving her husband for a holiday with another man, Mohammad Awick.

Ms Issa was due to return to Sydney last weekend but said she was contacted by police and informed that her passport had been flagged and she was not able to leave the country.

Ms Issa said she had been charged with adultery, which is a criminal offence in Lebanon, and could face a six-month prison sentence.

Her family insist that she has been charged with bigamy and have provided photographs to Daily Mail Australia that they claim show Ms Issa and Mr Awick at their wedding three weeks ago.

Bassem claims that his wife met Mohammad Awick, who lives in Lebanon, through the Internet, and has been talking to him since last year.

'I found out from the phone bill, she's been talking to him before. I don't know what's going on behind my back,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Bassem said his wife married Mr Awick in Lebanon three weeks ago despite his requests to divorce him first and do things properly.

'I found out from her brother. We told her and we told him, ''First divorce me and then do what you want''.'

'I'm still her husband here and she has married another man.'

Bassem said that when he learnt his wife went through with the wedding, he sent his papers to Lebanon to inform them Ms Issa had committed bigamy.

'I sent all my papers to Lebanon saying "We're still married and you have to stop her".

'It's not up to me now. People say to me, "Why don't you drop the charges?" But if I drop the charges, the Lebanese government will charge her.

'I think that she should go to jail. She's been my wife for 10 years and she's a very good lady. But she needs a lesson that she needs to do the right thing.

'When she wakes up from this dream she will understand what she's done is wrong. She left everything. She left her family, she left her kids, she left her work, she left her friends.  For what? To be happy for a few weeks.'

'Now she's crying to make Australia feel sorry for her.'

Bassem shared his heartbreak with friends on Facebook earlier this month, posting a picture of himself and Ms Issa alongside a picture of Ms Issa and Mr Awick, with the caption: 'Is it halal for a married women to get remarried while she is still married?'

Bassem said he had been forced to stop work to care for the couple's two children and deal with the fall-out of the marriage breakdown.

Ms Issa's family have disowned her for starting the relationship. Her brother, Ahmmad, has told Daily Mail Australia: 'We want nothing to do with her. She is a compulsive liar.'

'She's disregarded her kids and disregarded her family, and gone off and married someone she had only known for 48 hours,' Mr Issa said.

Ms Issa's brother said the family had warned Ms Issa about marrying Mr Awick after her ex-husband registered their marriage in Lebanon.

'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married.

'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.

'We told her not to get married three weeks ago, we told her she would get in trouble and look what happened,' he said.

But Ms Issa protests her innocence, saying she and her estranged husband were in the middle of divorce proceedings in Australia.

'I came to Lebanon because I was going through a very messy divorce, I met my partner, we fell in love,' she told 9NEWS.

'I haven't broken any laws and I'm a victim of a jealous spouse's revenge plot.'

Ms Issa who was born in Sydney and attended Wiley Park High School has two children, a six-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter, and she said she fears not being able to return to them.

'The thought of not seeing my children again and my whole family disowning me, it's too much,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

The children are currently being cared for by their father in Sydney's west.

Ms Issa says she separated from her husband in September last year, though her husband claims they did not separate until April 2014.

Ms Issa said she and Mr Awick have been receiving threats and she does not know who to turn to for assistance.

'The holiday that I thought would just be some time out has turned into a nightmare… we have done nothing wrong,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that they were providing consular assistance to a woman trying to return from Lebanon to Australia.
