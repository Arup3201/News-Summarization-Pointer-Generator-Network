It is traditionally the risk of being attacked by dogs that prevents nervous postmen from delivering the mail.

But homes in one suburban  cul-de-sac have been declared out of bounds for a rather less obvious threat – fleas.

Royal Mail has suspended deliveries to the addresses amid claims one member of staff was ‘eaten alive’ by the insects.

'Unprecedented': Queens Crescent resident Lynne Cosh with the letter from Royal Mail to say deliveries had been suspended

Outbreak: Neighbours in the cul-de-sac have blamed the flea infestation on a rented property with they claim has a history of hygiene issues

The postman's arms and legs were 
covered in bites after he delivered letters to the cul-de-sac in 
Wiltshire, and residents - one of whom described seeing him brushing the
bugs from his trousers - have blamed the outbreak on a rented home they
say has a history of hygiene issues.

As
well as putting up with the fleas jumping into their own properties, 
fed-up neighbours have now been forced to drive to the nearest delivery 
office to pick up their post after Royal Mail temporarily blocked 
deliveries to Queens Crescent, Chippenham.

Lynne Cosh, 58, who lives next door to the flea-ridden house, said the bugs had got into her home and garden and bitten her face while she slept.

She said: 'It’s a joke, it’s making me ill, I can’t live here anymore.

'Disgusting': Lynne Cosh says she has been forced to sleep in her kitchen after being bitten on the face by fleas as she slept

'It’s been going on for seven weeks. The other night I was in bed and the fleas were jumping on my face.

'I have slept in a chair in my kitchen because I can’t go back to my bed, and I’ve also been at a friend’s house.

'I have spent nearly £700 on carpets and for the pest control office from Wiltshire Council to come out and various insecticides.

'I feel sorry for the poor postman, I can’t blame him, I saw his bites, they were horrible.

'I know what it’s like to be bitten by fleas. He was eaten alive.'She claimed the house in question - occupied by a woman who lives alone - had a fly infestation last year because of dog mess.

'She did have a dog but she never looked after it,' she said.

'Last year there was a fly infestation because there was dogs mess everywhere.

'People point blank refused to go into her home because it was so disgusting.

'The dog has since been put down and I think that’s where the fleas have come from, they have nothing to latch on to now.

'They did try and clean her home but whatever they did didn’t work. It’s still just as bad.'

Icylin Thomas, 71, who also lives in
the cul-de-sac, said she had seen the postman brushing off the bugs as 
he delivered the mail.

'I saw the postman after he had delivered the mail. He was brushing the fleas off his trousers,' she said.

'I have been bitten by fleas and so have my daughter and granddaughter, it’s just not fair.

'It is the 20th century and Britain is one of the most modern countries in the world.'

'Unfair': Icilyn Thomas said she saw the Royal Mail postman brushing fleas from his trousers after making his delivery

'Exceptional step': Royal Mail has suspended deliveries to Queens Crescent in Chippenham, Wiltshire

The properties affected are a mixture of bungalows owned by GreenSquare Housing Association, and private houses.

The occupant of the affected house is thought to be a renting tenant.

In a letter to residents, Paul Gibbons, Royal Mail delivery office manager, said the postman returned from his round having sustained numerous bites from fleas or ticks that were in the grass and gardens of one of the homes.

He said the decision to suspend deliveries had been taken on health and safety grounds, and explained that, until the situation is resolved, residents would have to travel to the Royal Mail’s nearest delivery office two miles away to collect their post.

The letter, dated October 4, said: 'This is now causing us concern and in turn causing the suspension of service.

'This exceptional step has to be taken in order to safeguard the health and safety of Royal Mail employees.

'Royal Mail has carried out its own investigation into the circumstances surrounding this health and safety hazard.

'We will also consider whilst completing the risk assessment what steps need to be taken to ensure employee safety before we can restore mail deliveries to your address.'

'Concern': The housing association which manages some of the properties said it has taken steps to address the infestation

Terri Yewkins, customer manager at GreenSquare which own some of the houses, said that it was unusual for them to become involved in cases like this as it was a tenants responsibility to deal with infestations.

But she said the housing association was taking steps to address the issue and said one treatment had already been carried out.

Royal Mail spokesperson Val Bodden apologised to the customers affected.

'We are keen to resume deliveries as soon as possible,' she said.
