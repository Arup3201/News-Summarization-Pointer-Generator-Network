Adopting a raw food diet has helped one woman shed nine stone and cured her of a crippling medical condition.

Stephanie Jeffs, 43, from Hertford, used a raw juice diet to cure her polycystic ovaries, and help her lose 126lbs in weight.

The former city worker adopted the diet as a way to cleanse out her overworked body after a lifestyle of drinks parties, late nights and high stress left her overweight and run down. But she never expected her change in eating to have such a transformative effect on her life.

Stephanie Jeffs, pictured before she lost weight, used to eat a rich dairy-filled diet and her lifestyle included lots of nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising

Stephanie has lost nine stone since embarking on her raw food diet and has also been relieved of her polycystic ovary symptoms

Stephanie thought she ate reasonably healthily as she ate a pescatarian diet

A recent trip to the doctors informed her she has dropped from 22 stone 7lbs to 13 stone 7lbs, slim for her 5ft 9in height.

In fact Stephanie was so inspired she quit her high flying job and set up her own company Explore Raw, which advocates the advantages of the no-meat, no-dairy and no foods heated over 38-43°C diet.

While her diet today may sound extreme, Stephanie was once a very normal, career-driven young woman, who, while she made attempts to keep healthy, was ultimately worn out.

‘I was not always raw – and far from it! In my late twenties career success became my prime focus and hand in hand with that came the absence of looking after myself.

‘I piled on the weight. I did no exercise. I had never been an exerciser! I had PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) which is a chronic disease. I was overworked, undernourished and toxic.‘I had been a vegetarian (well a pescatarian really) since the age of 20 so considered myself pretty healthy as I wasn’t eating meat but the truth be told I was eating anything that wasn’t meat. 

‘I had a rich dairy-filled diet that included lots of boozy nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising. 

Stephanie says her lifestyle had left her feeling toxic and her weight had gotten out of control

‘By my early 30s my weight was out of control – I was still focusing so much on my career I didn’t really focus on anything else. I had lost sight of me.’

Like many women, Stephanie had an ongoing nagging sense she should be taking care of herself more.

‘Towards my mid 30s I realised that I had to take action and began experimenting with going to the gym. I had no idea what I was doing.

‘I was instinctively focusing on cleansing my body - again, I had no guidance really and was feeling a bit lost - so began to have colonics and rein the booze in a little.

Stephanie was given her first book on raw eating as a birthday present and says she lost 10lbs in her first week of juicing

She says she now looks and feels much younger than she has for years

‘Over the years a few meaty dishes had crept into my diet and so I focused again on my vegetarian roots. It was working and slowly I began to lose a few pounds.’

Each day I try to consume:

However it was another few years before Stephanie began to discover the concept of ‘eating raw’ which essentially involves eating a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables which are never cooked above about 40 degrees C in order to preserve their enzymes.

Stephanie says: ‘It was on my 38th birthday that things took a turn. A friend of mine gave me a book as a gift.  It was Jason Vales 7lbs in 7days and I was immediately insulted! ‘Are you trying to say that I am fat..!?’ I thought. 

'Once I had gotten over it I worked my way through that book and dabbled in a few juices. Eventually I made it to a raw retreat in Turkey and suddenly I was hooked.

‘I lost more than 10lbs in a week! It was an unbelievable wake up call for me that even though I had PCOS I could lose weight, even though I had previously been told there is ‘no cure’ and that it would be incredibly difficult to lose weight without medication.’

‘As the weight falls off the more capacity the body has to heal. It’s a wonderful cycle.’

Stephanie now eats what she describes as a high plant-based high raw diet.

‘I carry my juicer everywhere. I lug it across London in a cool bag if I’m on the move. Wherever I go my juicer goes.’

‘I have so much to be thankful for. I have cured myself from polycystic ovaries and a wonderful side effect has also been that I have lost lots of my weight. Which is blissful!

‘My skin is glowing and I look and feel much younger than I have for years. Looking back at old photos I hardly recognise myself.’

Around 7am/on rising – ginger tea: hot water with lemon, raw fresh ginger and sometimes some raw honey I drink as much ginger tea as I fancy throughout the day.

Around 8am - Breakfast – green juice -  2 golden delicious apples 1 cucumber 1 peeled lemon 1 peeled lime  blended with two or three large fistfuls of greens (spinach or kale etc.). If I am not in the mood for a juice (which is rare!) I might have some chia pudding – which is chia seeds soaked in home made almond milk and served with honey and fruit.

Throughout the morning – green waters – water with a teaspoon of ‘green powder blend’ such as wheatgrass, spirulina, chlorella and barleygrass.

Around 11am/Mid morning snack – if needed – stuffed dates: organic medjool dates stuffed with wet activated almonds (soaked in water overnight so they are softer, more easily digestible, enzyme rich and tastier).

Around 1pm/ Lunch- Salad for example: 10oz or large bag of kale, Juice 1 lime 1 tsp. Himalayan pink salt, 1 tbsp. virgin olive oil, 1 tsp. linseeds, 1 tsp. sesame seeds, 1 pinch pine nuts.  ‘Make love to the Kale! – using a large bowl massage the kale with the lime juice, salt and olive oil until the kale is soft and wilted but not too limp. Remove any final stalks or tough bits as you feel them.

Mix in the linseed, sesame seeds and a big pinch of pine nuts. The portion for this dish is one cup per person. But I tend to eat as much as I feel I need. Served with blueberries and perhaps a toasted pitta bread (not raw!).

Around 3pm /Afternoon snack – if needed some organic fruit or vegetables, bananas, apples, oranges, carrots, cucumbers...

Around 6pm/ Supper- for example: Raw Curry – recipe serves 4: 1 cup soaked cashews (soak in filtered or pure water for at least two hours) 2 cups or more of filtered water, ½ chopped red onion, 6 organic cherry tomatoes, 10 sundried tomatoes (soaked or if from a jar then washed) juice of half a lime, ½ cup desiccated coconut, 1 ripe avocado, 1 inch ginger peeled and grated 1½ tsp. cumin, 1 or 2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. turmeric, 1 tsp. garam masala 2 clove organic garlic.

Basically blend until a smooth paste is formed and serve! Sometimes I might let it sit in a bowl in the oven with the door open on low if I don’t fancy eating it at room temperature. Served with salad or rice. (you can serve with cooked rice or make ‘raw rice’ by putting half a cauliflower in the food processor – chop finely so it resembles rice and add a handful or pine or other nuts).
