Michael Owen has slammed Manchester United's Premier League showing this season - insisting that his former club should be challenging for the title due to the amount of money they spent in the summer.

United outlaid over £150m on the combined talents of new recruits such as Angel Di Maria, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind in the previous transfer window as the Old Trafford sought to rebuild on a disastrous campaign where they finished seventh.

However, despite the vast figures spent under new boss Louis van Gaal, the Red Devils' fundamental problems of last term still exist as they trail 12 points behind table-toppers Chelsea in fourth place.

And Owen is adamant that securing just a top four spot should be deemed as a bad season for United due to the vast investment in the squad.

‘People keep saying they are going to get (a) top four (finish) and that was the aim, that is (the) absolute bare minimum. Top four for Manchester United?,' he told BT Sport's Football Tonight Show.

'After spending £150 million and having the players they have and the stadium – they should be first, second, third. Third should be a bad season.

'How they are accepting that they are not challenging for the title having spent that money on those calibre of players. It’s not a good season.’

United's 2-0 win at QPR on Saturday moved them on to 40 points after 22 games this season. With the scoreline goalless at half-time the Red Devils' travelling supporters deplored for a change of Van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 formation to a more conventional 4-4-2 style, which the Dutchman eventually heeded.

Van Gaal's choice of formation and tactics have been accused of hindering United's hitherto, swashbuckling traditional brand of football and Owen concurs that the club aren't creating the amount of chances that they use to in the past.

‘I don’t think any of the strikers are performing. Robin van Persie has gone quiet, he’s scored the odd goal but he’s not the player he was over the past few years,' he added.

'I don’t necessarily blame the strikers as Manchester United aren’t creating loads and loads of chances.

'They are not functioning as a team and if you don’t function as a team, and your strikers and midfielders aren’t working hard then you’ll concede goals – it’s not just about the defence. If you’re not playing well throughout the team you won’t score enough goals as the strikers aren’t getting enough chances.’

‘The likes of Juan Mata and Van Persie need to start doing more. Mata’s had a half decent season but I wouldn’t say I’m his biggest fan. Ashley Young has been really good and done well when he’s played wing back, he’s unlucky not to get in the team but it’s not very balanced at the moment.’

Van Gaal's men travel to Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night, before hosting Leicester at home in the Premier League on January 31.

Owen also believes United striker Robin van Persie (front) isn't the player he once was a few years ago
