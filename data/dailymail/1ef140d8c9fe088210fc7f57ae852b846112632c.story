A surfer had a lucky escape over the weekend when a 15-foot Great White shark knocked him off his board in the waters off of La Selva Beach in California.

The shark took a huge bite out of Beau Browning's board on Saturday when he was still tethered to it, pulling him underwater for around five terrifying seconds.

'And he finally let go, and I let go of my leash and I was finally able to get up to the surface,' said Browning.

The brush with death for Browning happened at sundown, as he prepared to stop his surfing for the day.

'I caught my second wave, and barely got into it, and out of nowhere, I was popped into the air by probably like 10-15 feet. looked down and saw a shark,' said Browning to KSBW.

'He took a bite on the way down.'

After the attack Brown said he felt more in danger of drowning than being attacked by the shark because he was still tethered.

However, despite his frightening experience, Brown does not hold any grudges against the shark.

'They were just doing what they’re designed to do,' the surfer said.

'And they thought I was something else. And that’s all it is. I got no hard feelings against sharks.'

The shark attack on Browing was the seventh in Santa Cruz County in the last 88 years. Not one of these attacks has resulted in a human fatality.
