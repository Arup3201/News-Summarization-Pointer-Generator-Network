Restoring lost senses to amputees is something that has, until now, only been considered as science fiction.

But Dennis Sorensen from Denmark is living proof that working appendages can reinstate senses as complicated as 'feeling'.

The incredible technology, revealed by MailOnline last year, is the first bionic hand that allows the user to feel the sensation of touch though the device.

The 36-year-old was fitted with the robotic limb, known as Lifehand 2, in Rome on January 26 2013 but the medical breakthrough has only now been shared.

'The sensory feedback was incredible,' said Mr Sorensen, who spent a month trying out the hand.

'I could feel things that I hadn't been able to feel in over nine years.

'When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.'

Mr Sorensen had his hand blown off in an horrific New Year's Eve firework accident at a neighbour's house in Aalborg, Denmark, where he still lives.

Since then he has been wearing a 
conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his
 arm, allowing him to open and close his hand and grasp objects.

But
 without sensory information he cannot feel what he is trying to grasp, 
making it difficult to gauge the amount of pressure needed.

He now has to cope with the psychological challenge of having re-experienced a sense of touch only to lose it again.

'I was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well,' he said.

The 36-year-old underwent the procedure to fit the arm at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, the first such medical procedure of its kind and a breakthrough in bionic limbs

In a laboratory wearing a blindfold and earplugs Mr Sorensen was able to detect the strength of his grasp as well as the shape and consistency of the different objects he picked up

The groundbreaking work was carried out by Dr Silvestro Micera and her team from the Federal Polytechnique School of 
Lausanne in Switzerland.

Mr Sorenson was taking part in a trial of the technology at Gemelli Hospital in Rome conducted by the Swiss and Italian scientists who developed the experimental prosthetic hand.

The nerves in the amputee's arm are attached to electrode relays in the hand to control movement

The artificial hand detects information about touch using electrical signals from artificial tendons controlling finger movement.

Fine wires send the digitally refined impulses to four electrodes implanted in the sensory ulnar and median nerves of the upper arm.

'This is the first time in neuroprosthetics that sensory feedback has been restored and used by an amputee in real-time to control an artificial limb," said Dr Silvestro Micera

Mr Sorensen had the hand fitted on 
January 26 2013 but due to clinical trial safety rules, the sensory 
electrodes had to be removed from his arm after one month.

However the scientists believe they would continue to function without damaging the nervous system for many years.

The results of the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, are the first step towards a true bionic hand which can feel as well as move, say the scientists.

However, they point out that it will be years before such a device becomes commercially available.

A robotic device invented by engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania could help its wearer carry an additional 40 pounds (18 kg).

The robot arm would make lifting a heavy suitcase feel as easy 
as lifting a cup of tea.

Titan
 Arm looks and sounds like part of a superhero's costume, but its 
creators say it's designed for ordinary people - those who need either 
physical rehabilitation or a little extra muscle for their job.

In
 technical terms, the apparatus is an untethered, upper-body 
exoskeleton; to the layman, it's essentially a battery-powered arm brace
 attached to a backpack.

Titan Arm's cost-efficient design has won the team accolades and at least $75,000 (Â£45,580) in prize money.
