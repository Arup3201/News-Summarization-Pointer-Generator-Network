Michelle Dodd (pictured) was convicted of assault for throwing water over her neighbour and her 'noisy' children

It started as a feud between two neighbours over the noise of children playing on a trampoline.

Now the row has ended up in court – after one of the women threw water from an upstairs window which splashed over her neighbour’s children.

Michelle Dodd, 38, was charged with assault following the long-standing dispute with next-door neighbour Afshan Iqbal.

It began when Dodd complained about Mrs Iqbal’s four young children making too much noise while playing on a trampoline in the garden of their home in Reddish, Stockport.

A court heard Dodd threw water out of her bedroom window three times, and on each occasion some of it landed on Mrs Iqbal, 33.

Dodd denied assault, claiming she was bed-ridden with illness and was emptying a bowl of water put out for her cat, not intending to hit anyone.

However, she was found guilty of all three counts.

After the trial, she said: ‘It’s disgusting but there’s nothing I can do. I thought the court would laugh and sue the police for wasting everyone’s time.’

Stockport Magistrates’ Court heard the dispute began in December 2013 over noise made on the trampoline.

Dodd argued that the garden toy should have been kept further away from her house.

Both neighbours complained about the other, and the police had been called out before the water incidents, which happened last May.

Speaking through an interpreter, Mrs Iqbal said some of the water hit her son, now aged three, which she claimed turned his dry skin condition into eczema.

She said the trampoline had been moved after Dodd complained about the noise.

But she added: ‘I can’t stop my two-year-old shouting or being loud. They are only children, they do what children do. I feel very sad.’

Dodd told the court: ‘I probably did shout at the kids to shut up, they were constantly shouting, screeching and throwing things.’ Chairman of the bench Jeffrey Stones gave Dodd a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £280 costs.

He told her: ‘You threw water out of the bedroom window not caring where it went.’

Last night, neighbours of the two women said they were shocked the matter had been taken to court and called for common sense to prevail.

One, a 69-year-old man, said: ‘It’s absolutely preposterous that someone should be charged with assault and be given a criminal record for a dispute that simply got a bit out of hand.

Dodd, who lived on this street, denied three counts of assault, claiming she was bed ridden with illness and was emptying a pan of water put out for her cat, not intending to hit anyone

‘Throwing water is hardly like throwing a punch. Children are noisy and it is up to parents to ensure they don’t disturb the entire neighbourhood.

‘In this case that simply did not happen and they caused a lot of grief.

‘This lady should not have reacted the way she has, but police have been called on several occasions to keep the peace and now it has resulted in this.’

Another neighbour, a retired woman, said: ‘When three or more children get together they always cause such a din and these were no different.

‘But to charge someone with assault for throwing some water is plainly ridiculous and giving this woman a criminal record is only going to make matters worse. I think the council need to intervene and try to keep the peace between them.

‘Now she’s got a real grievance against her neighbour and I’m sure this is not going to be the last we hear of this matter.’

No one at Stockport Council was available yesterday to discuss the dispute.

Dodd refused to comment last night, with a friend saying: ‘She doesn’t want to talk about it.’
