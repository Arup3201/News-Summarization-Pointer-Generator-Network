Erik Lamela is painfully aware of the disaster that was his first year in English football.

He does not try to hide from it and promises to put in the work required over the next few months to salvage his reputation as one of the brightest young talents in world football.

The early signs are promising. Already, in the opening two games, Tottenham’s £30million record signing has shown glimpses of his quality and a tantalising hint that this campaign may be altogether different, under the influence of Mauricio Pochettino.

‘It is something that can help me,’ said Lamela, aware that Pochettino, as a fellow Argentine, is being billed as the man to solve the mystery.

‘He has helped me a lot of times. But, really, it depends on me. It is down to me: how I train, what I do in training and in matches. Then I think he will put me on the pitch. I will play wherever he puts me. I have to adapt. If I am on the pitch, I will do my best.

‘It is a challenge for me because last season did not go as I had hoped: the injuries, maybe because I was not 100 per cent. These are things you have to overcome and change yourself. You always have to improve. I don’t know how far I can go but I will try my hardest to make my team win. I want to train to the maximum and continue to improve as a footballer.

‘I am still young. I can improve a lot but it depends on me. This season I want to help my team and my team-mates to reach our aims. My aim is always to give to the team all that I can and to be 100 per cent focused.’

Lamela started only three games in the Barclays Premier League last season after his transfer from Roma, where he scored 15 Serie A goals in the previous year. In all competitions for Spurs, he started 10 times and scored once, a goal against FC Sheriff of Moldova in the Europa League.

He arrived less than fully fit, unfairly touted as the man to help Spurs fans recover from the loss of Gareth Bale but suffered back problems and related muscular injuries and his poor form made it hard to settle in England.

There were negotiations with Italian clubs in January over a swift return to Serie A but the fee was a problem and Spurs would not agree to a loan. His season effectively ended in December, when Tim Sherwood cut him from his plans so he could sort out his problems.

It cost him a place in the World Cup squad but allowed time to spend with his family in his native Argentina and return with a fresh mind and strong body.

‘It was great,’ said Lamela. ‘I now feel 100 per cent, without any injuries. I hope to continue like this. When I was injured, I was not good, I was not happy. I am happy to be playing football again and helping the team to win.’

During his time away, Sherwood was replaced by Pochettino, his third Spurs boss in 12 months and a fellow countryman who has faith in the 22-year-old to show his true value in his second Premier League season.

Lamela started brightly in last weekend’s win at West Ham, although he suffered when they went to 10 men after Kyle Naughton’s red card, and he was the hero in Cyprus on Thursday, helping to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win after coming on for the last 18 minutes.

‘I am happy, it went well,’ he said, speaking in Italian because his English is ‘not quite there’.

He added: ‘To come on and help change the match was great. It was a really difficult match because of the heat. Mamma mia, it was super-hot. We are not used to it. The most important thing is that we came back and won the game and returned home as winners.’

Tottenham left back Danny Rose, who played in Thursday’s win, thinks he has detected a change in Lamela since his disastrous first season. ‘We were allowed a night out in America (in pre-season) and we all saw a different side to him,’ he said.

‘He really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody. I was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch.

‘He did well to assist Robbie (Soldado) for the first goal and was involved in the second.’
