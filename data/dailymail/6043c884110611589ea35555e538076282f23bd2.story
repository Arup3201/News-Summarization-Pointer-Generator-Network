Vice President Joe Biden has become well known for his love of close talking, and he was at it again on Tuesday.

Biden was at the swearing in ceremony of new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, and as Carter delivered his speech, Biden could be seen in the background with his arms on the shoulders of the man's wife, Stephanie, and whispering into her ear.

Moments later, Mr. Carter reached over and touched his wife on her shoulder as Biden stepped back. 

After some public outcry over his behavior, Biden managed to find himself under fire again later in the day with a statement he made about Somalians.

Carter seemed slightly uncomfortable while her husband was completely unaware what was happening behind him

While delivering the opening remarks at a White House summit on countering violent extremism, Vice President Biden said he was very close to members of the Somali community in Delaware.

'If you ever come to the train station with me, you'll notice that I have great relationships with them because there's an awful lot of them driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real,' said Biden, according to CNN. 

As for today's swearing in, Carter now replaces Chuck Hagel and becomes President Barack Obama's fourth Defense Secretary in his two terms in office.

Carter has had numerous positions in the Department of Defense, though he has never served in the military.

Mrs. Carter meanwhile was having a difficult day, having slipped and fallen on the ice prior to the ceremony, held at the Pentagon. 

Biden revealed at the ceremony that he and the Carters have been friends for years.

The vice president’s office declined to comment about the whisper.

Already, people on Twitter are calling out Biden for his behavior today.

'Just once, I'd like to see a husband in this situation knock Joe Biden out,' wrote Brad Thor, the author who makes frequent appearances on Fox News.

He then added; 'If Joe Biden did this to my wife, SHE'D knock him out. I'd have to take a number and wait my turn...'

Finally, he said; 'ISIS? Ashton Carter can't even fight off Joe Biden...'

Radio personality Mark Simone said; 'Creepy Joe Biden strikes again, hanging onto Ashton Carter's wife (and whispering things) at Carter's swearing-in.'

'Not sure why a creep like @VP is not shunned by civil society,' said Daily beast columnist Stuart Stevens.

Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was far more brief, labeling him an 'a**clown.'
