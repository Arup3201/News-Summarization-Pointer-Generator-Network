Since the Christmas Day fire at her Connecticut home last
year that took the lives of her three daughters and her parents, Madonna Badger
wonders why she survived.

Badger, a New York advertising executive until the 2011 fire
in Stamford, made it through the funerals for her children and parents.

Then
she fell apart, she tells the Hearst Connecticut Media Group.

Loss: The blaze claimed the lives of (left to right) seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah and Lily, nine

Missed: Her parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were also killed on Christmas Day last year

Her hair turned gray and fell out in clumps. She waved a
fistful of pills in the air and threatened to swallow them.

Badger traveled to Little Rock, Ark., in February to live
with a friend from their college days. She says the only condition was that she
promised to not commit suicide.

'I don't know why I survived,' she says. 'I told everyone I
was going to kill myself.'

The fire killed 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger,
9-year-old Lily Badger and their maternal grandparents, Lomer and Pauline
Johnson. The city investigated and determined the cause was accidental.

Firefighters arrived and dragged Badger off the burning
building. A friend also survived the fire.

Badger remembers lying in a bed at Stamford Hospital for
hours, screaming for her children. A doctor took her hand and told her that her
daughters and parents had died.

'I remember coiling up into a little ball and I looked at
the nurse,' she said. 'I just wanted to crawl out of my body. I don't remember
anything after that. People in the hospital said I was just screaming and
wailing.'

Badger wears three bracelets on her wrist, one for each of
her daughters. Grace gave her the beaded bracelet on Christmas Eve and Madonna
was wearing it when she escaped the fire. Two leather bracelets symbolize Lily
and Sarah.

'Now that they're not here with me physically, but here with
me spiritually and every other way, I still want to be a great mom,' Badger
said.

Badger is keeping her house in Little Rock for now and has
rented a loft in Brooklyn and plans to start working again in January. She
traveled to Thailand on Christmas with several suitcases of her daughters'
toys, collected from her garage after the fire. She planned to donate them to
at-risk girls at an orphanage.

Victims: The fire also claimed her parents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson, pictured with the three girls (all left)

'Santa Claus and retail signs and gift wrap and Christmas
lights just doesn't do it for me right now,' she said. 'I don't know if it ever
will.'

Badger said she believes love is the legacy her children
leave.

'They're not going to write a masterpiece or a symphony.
This is really it,' she said. 'What saves you, what saves us all, is love.'

Speaking on the 'TODAY' show earlier this month, she revealed that 'visits' from her children have helped her to heal, saying that she is doing 'really well' thanks to visions of her three girls, Lily, Sarah and Grace.

'I've seen my children in my dreams,' she told 'TODAY' host Matt Lauer. 'When I pray, I see my children.
