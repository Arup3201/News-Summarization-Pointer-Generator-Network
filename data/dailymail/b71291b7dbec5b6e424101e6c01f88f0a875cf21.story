Police are hunting a McDonald's customer who allegedly pointed a gun at a teenage worker after discovering his order was missing an item.

The Smoking Gun reported the man, who was sitting in the back seat of a car which pulled up to the service window of a Chickasha, Oklahoma outlet on Tuesday night, got upset that his order fell short.

He then allegedly aimed a gun at the female cashier and warned, 'Donâ€™t make me use this' and 'Donâ€™t let it happen again'.

Police received conflicting accounts over what item was missing.

While the cashier said the customer complained about absent dipping sauce, another witness claimed it was missing french fries.

Chickasha Police Department officers are investigating the matter as a felonious pointing of a firearm.

It is not known if the fun was real or fake.
