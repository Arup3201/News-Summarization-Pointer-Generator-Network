The controller of BBC Radio 3 who was accused of ‘dumbing down’ the station has suddenly resigned after 15 years in the job.

Roger Wright is leaving his £227,000-a-year salary, and will also step down as director of the BBC Proms, to take up a post heading a celebrated classical music centre.

He was accused of bringing Radio 3 into a ratings war with Classic FM, and diluting the content with phone-ins and presenter chatter.

There is speculation that Mr Wright did not want to work alongside this new role, but in a statement the 57-year-old said: ‘I am honoured to have been invited to lead Aldeburgh Music at such an exciting time in its development.

‘However, I am sorry to be leaving the BBC, having enjoyed such a long and fulfilling period at Radio 3 and the BBC Proms, and with the arts due to be such a key part of its immediate future under Tony Hall’s leadership.’

Mr Wright’s departure from the station - which has around two million listeners - comes as director-general Tony Hall is about to announce a new focus on the arts at the BBC.

Lord Hall said: ‘He has been a fantastic champion of classical music across the BBC and has raised the profile of the Proms every year. We wish him well at Aldeburgh Music and will be looking to build on his achievements at Radio 3 and the Proms.’

Helen Boaden, the director of BBC Radio, said: ‘Roger is a unique and brilliant talent. He has displayed an unwavering commitment to quality, courage in introducing new kinds of music and developing exciting collaborations, and massive ambition on behalf of audiences.’
