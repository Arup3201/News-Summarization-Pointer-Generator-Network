A cancer patient has been told the 'wonder drug' that doctors claim extended his life is too expensive for the NHS to fund.

Kevin Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, took part in clinical trials of Abiraterone to treat his prostate cancer.

But the 58-year-old has been left devastated by a decision this week by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) not to fund the drug for patients who, like him, have not undergone chemotherapy.

Mr Hughes was given three years to live after being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer last April.

After taking part in a clinical trial for the drug Abiraterone before having chemotherapy, doctors now believe he will go on to live longer than expected.

The drug is currently available on the NHS to men who have already gone through chemotherapy.

But Nice has ruled that the 'wonder' medication is too expensive to give to men before they have undergone the much more gruelling cancer treatment.

Mr Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, said: 'Under normal circumstances they give people Abiraterone when they are in the very advanced stages and everything else has failed.

'Nice's decision is a very bad one. I can empirically show what the drug has done for me.

'It's just wonderful. Before I got on it, people were calling it the wonder drug and I have to say it's pretty special.'

Mr Hughes was being treated with Zolodex hormone injections, which resulted in hot sweats and fatigue, and had radiotherapy before the start of the clinical trial.

He said: 'I had no symptoms, so when I was diagnosed, let's say it wasn't my best day.

'I walked around in a fog for a week and so did my wife. But you get over it, readjust and get on with it.

'I was on the hormone therapy injections and the side effects were not great, but take it on the chin and get on with it.'

Before being chosen for the trial, a blood test to measure the prostate-specific antigen found Mr Hughes' count had rocketed to 500.

The normal range is between five and six.

He said: 'It was coming down nicely on the Zolodex, but since being on Abiraterone, it dropped completely. One year on my count is so low it is undetectable.

'I would say my three-year prognosis has gone flying out of the window.

'My doctors are more cautious, but agree I will probably go past the dates they first thought.

'It's a no-brainer, it just works and personally I have had no side effects from it.

'It should be given to men before they even have to go through chemotherapy.'

From April 2013 to March 2014, Abiraterone pre-chemotherapy was the second most requested drug on England's Cancer Drugs Fund.

On Sunday, June 29, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the Department of Health to intervene in the Nice process and call off the proposed restriction on use of Abiraterone before chemotherapy.

Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by thousands of men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England. Above, prostate cancer cells

Owen Sharp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, has criticised the Nice decision.

He said: 'It's a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer. 

'For many, this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.'

In the case of Abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease.

When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective.

Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy.

The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer. 

Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: 'We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. 

'However, the manufacturer's own economic model demonstrated that the drug does not offer enough benefit to justify its price.'
