A mother of two preparing a Christmas stuffing mix in her kitchen got the shock of her life when she opened a bag of herbs from Tesco and a six-legged live praying mantis jumped out at her.

Linda Hebditch, 53, of Poole, Dorset, was about to chop up some sage when she found the predatory insect scurrying amongst the leaves imported from Israel in the 30g packet that cost 80p.

Mrs Hebditch and her son Ryan, 16, took the exotic creature to a pet shop where it was identified as the praying mantis - and insect experts believe it got into the bag before it was imported to the UK.

Tesco staff have collected the packet and launched an investigation after it was bought at a store in Poole. But the mantis is still residing with Mrs Hebditch while the family decide what to do with it.

She said: ‘It absolutely scared the socks off me, my legs just turned to jelly. I thought it was just a bit of bark among the leaves, but when I went to take it out of the bowl I saw a leg move and jumped.

‘The bag says the sage was imported from Israel so it has come on a long journey. I'm not sure what we are going to do with it. I don't want to keep it here, although I think my son Ryan is in two minds.’

‘I don't believe in killing things, hopefully the pet store will take it. It was a massive shock for me, so it could have been really awful if a frail elderly person had opened it.’

Complaint: Mrs Hebditch said it was a 'horrible thought' to consider that someone else who might have opened the packet 'could have just poured it all straight into a blender' without spotting the insect

The mantis, which is not dangerous to humans, is currently residing with the Hebditch family, who are still deciding what to do with it.

Mantises, who feed on insects, are widespread around the world and can be found in both tropical and temperate regions.

Often called the 'praying mantis' because of its folded forelegs which they use to trap prey, there are more than 2,400 different species.

During mating, the female will often devour the male in an act known as sexual cannibalism.

Mrs Hebditch added that it was a 
‘horrible thought’ to consider that someone else who might have opened 
the packet ‘could have just poured it all straight into a blender’ 
without spotting the insect.

Wesley Norton, who runs the Southern Aquatics pet store where Mrs Hebditch took the mantis, said he sells about 10 of the insects every month to collectors who buy different types of species.

He added: ‘Mrs Hebditch's mantis is ready to breed so it is worth about £25.

'If you buy it to breed though, it is often a one-off as the female sometimes eats the head of the male during mating.’

Mrs Hebditch, who lives with her husband Martyn and sons Matthew and Ryan, complained to Tesco after finding the insect in the bag.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We expect our food to be of the highest quality and were really concerned to hear of this matter. One of our colleagues has collected the product from the customer so we can begin an urgent investigation with the supplier.’
