Under fire: Bashir has been criticised for poking fun at the NRA prayer event

British TV presenter Martin Bashir has come under fire in the US after he took aim at gun-owning churchgoers on his talk show.

Bashir mocked members of America’s National Rifle Association over their plans to attend a religious gathering after their national convention wraps up Sunday in Houston, Texas.

‘There is also a prayer breakfast at this weekend’s conference,’ Bashir said on his MSNBC cable programme, ‘presumably to include the NRA’s version of the Lord’ s Prayer: ‘Thy kingdom come, help me keep my military-style gun’; ‘Give us this day our daily dead’; and other various phrases like that.’

Bashir, 50, is best known for his interviews with Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, but started out working for the BBC’s ‘Songs of Praise’ and identifies himself as a committed Christian.

He said he was worried that other Christians aren’t more concerned about the gun rights movement.

‘This is not a freak organization,’ he said. ‘There are large numbers who will be hearing this [prayer breakfast]. Yet they spew this kind of venom about an issue that is as saddening and shockingly disturbing for us all, after what happened in Newtown and all the other massacres that we reflect on.’ 

But Bashir’s comments provoked fury among the gun lobby.

Dr. Bob Reccord, a family-values political leader who once oversaw more than 5,000 evangelical missionaries for the Southern Baptist Convention, will be the prayer breakfast's keynote speaker on Sunday morning

‘I wish someone would slap some sense 
into that idiot,’ said a Dallas native named Bob who said he was 
attending the NRA convention for the first time.

‘Nothing gets me more worked up than self-righteous religious people who think they have all the answers.

'I go to church every Sunday, and I’ll be at the prayer breakfast,’ he added.

Charlotte, a middle-aged mother of two who flew from Nebraska, claimed Bashir was ‘the kind of Brit we should deport before Obama pushes his immigration legislation through.’

The NRA, which has more than four 
million members, illustrated its power in the US by playing a key 
lobbying role in blocking President Obama’s attempts to tighten gun 
controls in the wake of the Newtown school massacre in Connecticut that 
left 20 children and six adults dead.

Although polls show 80% of Americans 
supported Mr Obama’s plan to expand background checks for gun buyers, it
 was voted down in the US Senate.

The NRA is expecting more than 70,000 supporters at its weekend conference.

The biggest buzz at the 2013 convention surrounds gun control legislation that Second Amendment activists say threatens their freedoms under the U.S. Constitution. This attendee's gun-decorated shirt reads 'I don't dial 911'
