GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has risked the wrath of Occupy Wall Street protesters by fuming that they are only holding demostrations to distract from President Obama's failed policies.

The businessman addressed protesters in a Wall Street Journal interview, saying: 'Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.'

Meanwhile around $35,000 has now been sent to the protesters who have been camped out in Manhattan, New York, for almost three weeks now - angry at the state of U.S. politics and economics.

'I don't have facts to back this up, 
but I happen to believe that these demonstrations are planned and 
orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama 
administration,' Mr Cain, 65, said.

The protests are expected to swell with 
reinforcements as more groups head towards Zucotti Park, showing the 
demonstration that started out small is showing no signs of losing 
steam.

‘(The donations) are coming from 
everywhere,’ student Victoria Sobel, 21, who is on the group’s finance 
committee, told the New York Post. ‘I'm sure we're on the cusp of much 
larger donations.’

Among 
those planning to join the clamour on Wednesday are the liberal group 
MoveOn.org and community organisations like the Working Families Party 
and United NY.

The growing crowd will also include members of the Chinatown Tenants Union and the Transit Workers Union.

Believing: Activists take part in a demonstration to protest against corporate greed near the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. on Wednesday

Pete Dutro, 36, who is also on the committee, told the New York Post they want to be 'transparent' and use the money 'effectively'.

Meanwhile organisers have called for 
students at college campuses across the nation to walk out of class in 
protest at 2pm on Wednesday.

‘They're capturing a feel of 
disempowerment, feeling like nobody is listening to them,’ a United NY 
spokesman said. ‘What do you do when no one is listening to you? You 
speak up, you take action.’

In addition organisers in Washington D.C. are planning a march at Freedom Plaza on Thursday.

The groups will embark on yet another 
march in Manhattan, this one from Foley Square, which was named for ‘Big
Tom’ Foley - a former blacksmith's helper who became a prominent 
Democrat.

The marchers will head to Zuccotti Park -
the unofficial headquarters where protesters have been camped out in 
sleeping bags. Some organisers say thousands could show up to the march.

MoveOn.org is planning a ‘virtual 
march’ on its website by encouraging people to post photos of themselves
with the caption: ‘I'm the 99 per cent’.

This
is a reference to those people not among the wealthiest one per cent of
Americans and the debate over whether they should be taxed more.

Message: The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccoti Park are in their third week now and a number of creative banners have been produced by demonstrators

Spreading: Occupy Seattle protesters, who have taken the lead from those in New York, carry signs as they march on Tuesday

The group's executive director, Justin
Ruben, called the protesters ‘brave young people’ who have successfully
inspired others to join them.

'We want to make sure we have ways of 
using the money effectively. We are trying to be transparent 
about it'

Pete Dutro, 36

‘From our perspective, we're protesting kind of the greed that led to the collapse of our economy,’ Mr Ruben said. ‘The fact that these banks aren't paying their fair share.’

Many of those who work on Wall Street don't take the protests personally. Some even sympathise.

‘It's really incredible to me, the 
passion and conviction these people have,’ said Lou Crossin, who works 
for a company that sells corporate governance research to large 
investors.

‘I don't think these are violent people. They're just standing up for their beliefs.’

'(The donations) are coming from 
everywhere. I'm sure we're on the cusp of much 
larger donations'

Victoria Sobel, 21

Mr Crossin said the protesters - with their chanting in unison, leafleting and drum circles - reminded him of Jefferson Airplane song lyrics: ‘Look what's happening out in the streets. Got a revolution.’

Sam Schmidt, a lawyer who walks by the park in New York every day, said the protests took him back to when he was a student in 1970 and went to Washington D.C. to oppose the Vietnam war.

‘I lived through the '60s and the '70s, and this is nothing. I think it is well-behaved. We've got a few crazies, but we have a few crazies here anyway,’ he said. ‘It's just reminiscent of my youth.’
