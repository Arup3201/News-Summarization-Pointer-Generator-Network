Scotland Yard last night said they were assessing the credibility of new information relating to the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed including an allegation that they were murdered by a member of the British military.

It said it was 'scoping' the information, which surfaced in the second court martial of Sergeant Danny Nightingale, the SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom.

The allegation was contained in a 
letter from the parents-in-law of Soldier N, Sgt Nightingale's former 
housemate, which was sent to the SAS's commanding officer in September 2011.

Police have said they are 'assessing' information it has recently received in relation to the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed

It is understood the information was passed to the Metropolitan Police through the Royal Military Police.

The letter says Soldier N claimed the SAS 'was behind Princess Diana's death' and it had been 'covered up', the Sunday People has 
reported.

The letter said: 'He (soldier N) also told her (his wife) that it was XXX who arranged Princess Diana's death and that has been covered up.'

A statement issued by Scotland Yard said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is scoping information that has recently been received in relation to the deaths and assessing its relevance and credibility.

'The assessment will be carried out by officers from the specialist crime and operations command.

'This is not a re-investigation and does not come under Operation Paget.'

Police said they are not prepared to 
discuss the matter further, while a royal spokeswoman said there will be
 no comment on the matter from Prince William or Prince Harry, or from 
Clarence House.

Police said the deaths of Diana and Mr Al Fayed were 'thoroughly investigated' and examined by an inquest led by Lord Justice Scott Baker at the Royal Court of Justice in 2007 to 2008

Diana, 
Dodi and chauffeur Henri Paul died after their Mercedes crashed in the 
tunnel, which left the Ritz Hotel on the morning of August 31 1997.

The hearing into the deaths of Diana and Dodi lasted more than 90 days with evidence from around 250 witnesses.

The inquests concluded on April 7, 
2008, with a jury returning a verdict that the 'People's Princess' and 
her boyfriend were unlawfully killed.

After
 the hearing, Metropolitan Police said they had spent £8 million on 
services arising from the inquest and the Operation Paget investigation 
from 2004 to 2006.

That money includes the cost of the legal team which represented the force's commissioner at the inquest, police protection for the inquest jury and paying for the Paget inquiry, reported to have cost £3.6 million.

Former Met Police Commissioner Lord Stevens's Paget investigation was launched in 2004 at the request of Michael Burgess, the Royal Coroner, who was then overseeing the future Diana inquest.

The former top policeman published his report in December 2006, rejecting the murder claims voiced by some, including Dodi's father Mohamed al Fayed.

Lord Stevens's investigation found that Diana was not murdered by British spies nor by the Duke of Edinburgh and she was not pregnant nor engaged to boyfriend Dodi.

Operation Paget concluded, just like the French investigation in 1999, that driver Henri Paul was drunk and driving at excessive speed.

The investigation dismissed the endless conspiracy theories sparked by the fatal accident.

Mr Paul had an alcohol level of around 1.74 grams per litre at the time of the crash - about twice the British drink-drive limit.

The black type S280 Mercedes was being driven through the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris at around 61 to 63mph - twice the speed limit for that section of road.

Lord Stevens said allegations that Diana was murdered were 'unfounded' and that he found nothing to justify further inquiries with members of the Royal Family.

A spokesman for Mr al Fayed yesterday said he had 
no comment to make, but said he will be 'interested in seeing the 
outcome', adding that he trusts the Met will investigate the information
 'with vigour'.

The Ministry of Defence said tonight it was not commenting on the matter. 

The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said
