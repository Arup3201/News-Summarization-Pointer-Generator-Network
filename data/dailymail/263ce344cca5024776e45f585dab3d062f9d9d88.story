A squirrel caught stealing nuts was caught red handed - when it got trapped in the cage.

The grey squirrel, which has red markings on its body, was captured by wildlife photographer Roger Clark.

He installed a cage around the bird feeder after the rodent regularly raided the nuts.

Caught red-handed: This grey squirrel, which has red markings on its body, got trapped trying to steal bird feed in a garden in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire

Mr Clark, 68, who snapped the squirrel in his garden in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, said: 'I saw this as an opportunity.

'Normally it would flee, but this time it struggled and struggled to escape and I could get within three metres of it for a closeup.'

The squirrel eventually managed to squeeze through the bars and escape.

Mr Clark, who shot it with a Canon 60 camera, said: 'You can see it looks guilty after being caught red-handed and is holding on to the bars.

'Normally I go all over the world to photograph animals but this just shows there is a lot of wildlife in Hampshire if you focus on it.'

Red squirrels are no longer found in southern England except on the Isle of Wight and Brownsea Island.

But grey squirrels, with their red markings, are occasionally confused for the rare species.
