A top general warned on Monday that planned reductions in the size of military could have a harmful effect on the United States' ability to fight the Islamic State and counter Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe.

The military has already cut its active duty forces from a peak of 570,000 down to 510,000 troops. Budget reductions approved in 2011 call for troop numbers to fall to 490,000. Automatic spending cuts associated with sequestration could bring that number down to as few as 420,000 troops.

Chief of Staff to the Army Gen. Raymond Odierno said at a news conference on Monday that he was uncomfortable about a potential reduction in forces because of the threats to the U.S. and it's hegemony from around the globe.

'The world is changing in front of us. We have seen Russian aggression in Europe, we have seen ISIS, we have seen increased stability in other places,' Gen. Odierno said, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Raymond Odierno is pictured here testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 6. Odierno said Monday that proposed cuts to the military's budget and size would undercut the United States' ability to defeat ISIS and counter Russia in Eastern Europe

'So I now have concern whether even going below 490,000 is the right thing to do or not, because of what I see potentially on the horizon.'

Odierno was speaking at an Association of the U.S. Army event when he levied the complaint. 

It's not the first time the retiring general has spoken up in the last few weeks about his concerns that cuts to the military are becoming too drastic, and he's not the only military expert who is apprehensive about the curtailment.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is also a former secretary of defense, has vocally opposed the shrinkage.

'I think we're entering a period of considerable danger with the United States that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be,' he told The Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol over the weekend.

Speaking broadly about the Middle East, Cheney said it would be 'crazy' to 'look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean.'

'You gotta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go,' he said.

'We have no choice to be involved in that part of the world, and if we're not actively involved, some very bad things are gonna happen,' he forewarned. 

He later argued that 'this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels' and cut the defense budget. 

Iraqi soldiers inspect the site of a car bomb attack in Habibiyah district, northeast of Baghdad on Monday. Local media reports said at least 30 people were killed and dozens others were wounded in two car bombings. The attacks came as the U.S. has slowed the number of bombs its dropping on ISIS in Iraq

Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Kobani, seen from near the Mursitpinar border crossing on the Turkish-Syrian border on Monday. The U.S. and it's allies have dropped 21 bombs in Syria in the last days in an effort to slow down the Islamic State's advances there

At a breakfast with reporters last month Odierno cautioned that if the $9 billion in spending cuts included in sequestration are allowed to kick in, the number of active duty soldiers will drop to 420,000 in 2016. 

That would put the U.S.  at 'significant risk,' he said, and called fiscal year 2016 'the breaking point' for the military.

The agreement to cut troops was made before fighting broke out in Iraq and Ukraine, he argued, and it is ill-advised now in light of more recent threat assessments.  

'The risk has actually increased. The potential to have ground forces operating on multiple continents simultaneously causes me grave concern about the size of the military, and I think we have to review it,' Odierno said, per Politico.

Cuts to the military's budget would bring about 'a significant degradation of readiness,' he explained, and some brigades wouldn't be able to complete the necessary training to be battle-ready. 

'I’m not seeing, in ‘16, peace breaking out all over the world,' he noted. 

Time reports that Odierno also told reporters that U.S. combat forces may be needed in Iraq.

'Airstrikes have slowed the advances of [ISIS],'  Odierno said, according to Time. 'But airstrikes alone won’t defeat [ISIS]. 

'You need a complementary ground capability that will go in and do that.'

Asked if he would recommend the use of U.S. ground forces if it comes down to it, Odierno said, 'I never rule anything out.'

Obama has explicitly promised not put troops back into positions of combat in Iraq, regardless of what happens, even as top generals like Odierno and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey have suggested that circumstances may arise in which they would advise him otherwise.

The U.S. has had to slow its air campaign in Iraq as ISIS has changed its patterns and methods to avoid being bombed. 

In the last two days the U.S. and its allies have launched only one airstrike in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said in a statement, compared to the 21 bombs they dropped on targets in Syria, where fighting has spread in recent weeks to just a mile outside the border with Turkey.

On Monday Odierno said he was glad he was to be stepping down at Army chief of staff in a few months so he didn't have to be responsible for deploying troops who aren't prepared to fight. 

'I swore that I would never send soldiers into a place not properly prepared, trained or equipped,' he reportedly said. 'I will probably get away with that because I will leave … by the beginning of the next year. 

'But I worry for the next chief,' he added.
