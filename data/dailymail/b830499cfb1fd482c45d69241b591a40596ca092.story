With the pressure of closing in on his first Open crown weighing on his shoulders, Rory McIlroy grew frustrated with a fan whose noise interrupted his backswing at the 16th hole on Sunday.

The three-shot leader hit an almost perfect drive down the centre of the fairway - but took exception to one member of the crowd, pointing them out to be ejected with his club.

Speaking out about the incident later, McIlroy said he had been consistently heckled by the offender throughout the day.

'He was giving me grief all day,' the three-time Major winner said. 'I sort of put it up for the first 15 holes, and then he deliberately coughed on my downswing on the 16th tee.

'I still hit a great drive. But I heard it halfway down and I knew who it was. So I turned around and got him chucked out, thankfully.

'I don't know who it was. But I didn't have him bothering me for the last two holes, which was nice.'

McIlroy managed to keep his emotions in check to win his third major, finishing two shots clear of his closest rival.

And second-placed Sergio Garcia also had 
issues with the Liverpool crowd, leaving the putting surface on the same
 hole to enter the crowd and have words with an encroaching spectator.

The actions of both spectators were a big step away from the typical crowd etiquette, and both appeared to be ejected from the grounds at Royal Liverpool on request of the two leaders.
