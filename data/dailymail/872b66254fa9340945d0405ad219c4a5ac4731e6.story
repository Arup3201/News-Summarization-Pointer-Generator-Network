The massed ranks of St Winifred's School Choir are getting back together on TV to see if there is still no-one quite like grandma.

The angelic young singers from Stockport rose to fame - and the top of the charts - in Christmas 1980 and soon found themselves performing on Top of the Pops.

They even knocked former Beatle John Lennon off number one spot with their sickly sweet tune.

The chart-topping children of St Winifred's primary school in Stockport, Cheshire pictured in 1980, have reunited once again to appear in a nostalgic Christmas singing show 

There's No-One Quite Like Grandma spent a week at number one having knocked Happy Christmas (War is Over) off the top spot, before being replaced by another Lennon tune, Imagine, in the wake of his death. 

At their peak the choir even performed with Abba, met Margaret Thatcher and sold more than one million copies of the song.

In 2009 the group reunited to create a reworked version of the song in aid of Age UK and other charities. 

And now the singers will come together once again, to appear on a nostalgic, Channel 4 programme, Rewind its Christmas.

Among the original members are Sally Lindsay, who starred in Coronation Street as barmaid Shelley Unwin, and Jennifer Hennessy, a recurring BBC One and Two actress. 

The choir reformed in 2009 to create a reworked version of the single in aid of various charities. Some of its original members will come together again for the Channel 4 show

Five years ago 14 members of the choir reunited  to record a new version of the song for charity Age Concern. 

The Christmas themed Channel 4 show will include a performance by glam-rockers Slade and The Darkness and an interview with Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan and the family of Kirsty MacColl about the inspiration behind The Fairytale Of New York.

In 2009, some of the choir's original members reunited to produce a reworked version of the song in aid of charity. 

Eileen Brown, who sang alongside her sister in the 1980 hit, recalled chatting with Benny from Abba as an 11-year-old. 

'It seems ridiculous now to think that we did things like that.' 

Tara Daynes, another original choir member, said she was more excited at the prospect of staying in a hotel than she was about performing on Top of the Pops. 

'People forget that we were gigging a choir before 'Grandma' so performing was the norm.' 

The choir of schoolboys and girls were Christmas No. 1 for weeks in 1980 after knocking the Beatles from the top spot
