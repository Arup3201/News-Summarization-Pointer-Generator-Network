It's known as the island where condemned men and women come to die and for Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, Nusa Kambangan or 'execution island' is where they will take their final breaths. 

The tranquil Island off the coast of Java is misleading in pictures. Surrounded by pristine water, luscious green trees and white sand beaches, it appears to be a tourist's dream.

However looks can be deceiving and as news emerged yesterday that Sukumaran and Chan will be executed on this  island in the next round of inmates on death row, it will have become their nightmare.

It was confirmed on Monday that both Chan and Sukumaran will face the firing squad in the next group of inmates to be executed on death row 

The men will be housed on Nusa Kambangan for the remainder of their days. There are seven prisons on the island 

Nusa Kambangan is deceiving.  It's pristine waters and white sandy beaches are a tourist's dream. However there is a dark side to the island

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. 

The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will  get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan.

From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island , where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. 

Security around the island will be tightened when the inmates are taken into the facility. Previous human rights campaigners have disrupted executions and journalists posing as fishermen have been deported because of their illegal activity.  

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.

Sukumaran and Chan may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. 

After living on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Indonesia, for almost a decade, and four failed clemency applications, Sukumaran and Chan are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year. 

Chan and Sukumaran will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled.

The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest.

However looks can be deceiving and as news emerged yesterday that Sukumaran and Chan will be executed on this very island in the next round of inmates on death row, it will have become their nightmare

Each execution takes on the same form. Inmates are asked if they have any final requests, they are then lined up in front of a group of shooters - only three with live ammunition - and shot dead. A common recurrence is that it always happens after midnight. 

Chan and Sukumaran will also be given choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from a distance of between five and ten metres, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

Indonesia's attorney-general  confirmed yesterday that Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are in the next group of death row prisoners to be executed.

HM Prasetyo last week said Australians were among the foreign drug offenders in line for executions, but didn't reveal their names.

If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled

The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia

Asked on Monday if Chan and Sukumaran were on the list for the next round, he told reporters: 'Yes, included in the next round.'

The timing was yet to be determined, he said. 

The pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. 

Speaking to Nine, Irish priest Father Charlie Brown explained how he had watched two executions in his lifetime. Each lasted for seven to eight minutes and each was 'torturous'. 

'The presidents said they’re all going to be executed. That means none of them have any hope anymore and you can't live without hope,' he said.

‘The prisoners after being shot it took them seven or eight minutes to die. They were moaning in pain for that seven or eight minutes and that for me is torture.' 

In 2008, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were strapped to crucifixes with black hoods over their heads before being shot, reported news.com.au.

'It was simple: one, two, three, then ‘bang’,' said Father Charlie Burrows, who witnessed their deaths.

Nestled off the coast of Java, Nusa Kambangan is home to many but it is also the home of Indonesia's most notorious criminals 

Speaking to Nine, Irish priest Father Charlie Brown explained how he had watched two executions in his lifetime. Each lasted for seven to eight minutes and each was 'torturous'

The pair took nearly ten minutes to be pronounced dead, moaning and bleeding until they succumbed to their injuries.

'I think it is cruel, the torture...The blood came out slowly; they were in pain,' Father  Burrows said during his testimony before Indonesia’s Constitutional Court.  

Both Sukamaran and Chan's mercy pleas were rejected by the Indonesian government despite the fact that they could prove they had rehabilitated themselves during their ten years behind bars. 

Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot.

'If the prisoner isn't dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said.

Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad.

It is highly protected. Security is stepped up just before executions as human rights campaigners have been known to storm the island and interupt the shootings

Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th

Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.'

'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan.

Mr McMahon labelled the executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them.

'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said.  

Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system

Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution

Mercy Campaign co-founder Brigid Delaney called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to increase his efforts to save the men's lives, calling his response 'very weak'.

Mr Abbott said  that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations.

'If this does go ahead I think there will be such visceral outrage and questions will be asked of Tony Abbott - why didn't you do more?,' Ms Delaney said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a direct appeal to Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, reported The Australian. 

'They [the Australian Government] tried their utmost, they asked us to reconsider our decisions because their citizens have shown remorse, have expressed their deepest regrets,' said a spokesperson for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry.

Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system. 

'Myuran and Andrew are not just reformed prisoners leading good lives. They have indisputably changed and improved the lives of many prisoners,' he said.
