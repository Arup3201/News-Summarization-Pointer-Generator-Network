Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, was today found guilty of trying to sell Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat.

He was convicted on 17 charges of corruption by a jury in Chicago this afternoon, after a retrial on allegations he abused his power to extort money for campaign funds.

As the verdicts were read out, the 54-year-old turned to his defence lawyer and said: 'What happened?'. Then he sat back in his chair and whispered 'I love you' to his wife, Patti.

He could now face up to 300 
years in jail, although federal guidelines are likely to dictate he will end up 
with a much shorter sentence.

Grim verdict: Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and his wife Patti hold hands as they leave court after a jury found him guilty of 17 counts of corruption. He could now face up to 350 years in jail

His wife broke down as the first guilty verdict was announced, collapsing into her brother's arms.

He stroked her hair as she started crying, and she kept shaking her head and saying 'no' when the jurors left court.

Blagojevich spoke only briefly as the couple left the courthouse in Chicago. He told reporters: 'Well, among the many lessons I've learned from this whole experience is to try to speak a little bit less, so I'm going to keep my remarks kind of short.

In sombre tones, he continued: 'Patti and I are obviously very disappointed. I frankly am stunned.

'There's not much left to say other than we want to get home to our little girls and talk to them and explain things to them and try to sort things out. And I'm sure we'll be seeing you.'

The verdict was a bitter defeat for Blagojevich, who had spent two-and-a-half years professing his innocence on reality TV shows and later on the witness stand.

It capped a long-running spectacle in
which Blagojevich became famous for blurting on a recorded phone call 
that his ability to appoint Obama's successor to the Senate was 
'f****ing golden' and that he wouldn't let it go 'for f****ing nothing'.

His defence team had insisted that 
hours of FBI wire tap recordings were just the ramblings of a politician 
who liked to think out loud.

The jury found him not-guilty on one 
charge, of soliciting a bribe from a toll road authority, and failed to 
reach an agreement on two more.

The charges included wire fraud, attempted extortion, bribery and conspiracy.

Convicted: Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was convicted on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade President Obama's vacant Senate seat in exchange for campaign funds and personal advancement

Of those, 11 concerned his attempts to 
sell Mr Obama's Senate seat for personal gain after he was elected to 
the White House in 2008.

Today Rod Blagojevich was found guilty of 17 counts of corruption, which prosecutors divided into five separate incidents:

Senate Seat

He was found guilty on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade President Obama's seat in exchange for personal advancement.

Of those, eight were for wire fraud. They cover a number of calls in which he discussed the possibility of wealthy Democratic donors founding a charitable organisation that he could head, in exchange for appointing Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the seat.

They also include a conference call in which he discusses getting 'tangible, political support' in exchange for appointing U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.

Prosecutors said this 'support' was $1.5million in funds from Mr Jackson's supporters.

Another call recorded him and his advisers discussing 'personal benefits' in exchange for the Senate seat appointment.

He was also found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, and another of attempted extortion.

He allegedly had an agreement with his brother, Robert, to demand things of personal value in exchange for the appointment.

Children's Memorial Hospital

He was found guilty on one count of wire fraud, one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe.

They all refer to his attempts to solicit $25,000 in campaign contributions from the hospital's chief executive Patrick Magoon  in exchange for a state payment increase of paediatric doctors, and also in exchange for the state money for doctors treating Medicaid patients.

Racetrack Executive

He was found guilty on one count of wire fraud, one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe.

These charges cover allegations he conspired with his former chief of staff Lon Monk to extort a racetrack executive for campaign contributions in exchange for signing a bill to grant money to the racetrack industry.

Chicago Academy

Jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he demanded campaign contributions from then-U.S. Representative Rahm Emanuel in exchange for a state grant to a school in Mr Emanuel's district.

Illinois Tollway

Jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he attempted to extort campaign contributions from road-building executive Gerald Krozel in return for giving state money to the Tollway.

They found him not guilty on one count, 'solicitation of a bribe', concerning allegations he asked Mr Krozel for campaign money in exchange for approving a multi-billion dollar Tollway improvement plan.

Blagojevich was also found guilty of 
holding up official acts on the Illinois Tollway, a school grant, 
horse-racing legislation and the Children's Memorial Hospital while he 
demanded campaign contributions.

He
has now been barred from travelling outside the northern Illinois area 
without permission, and the judge set a status hearing for sentencing on
August 1.

Federal 
guidelines and previous sentences handed down to other Illinois 
politicians guilty of corruption suggest he could get around ten years 
in prison.

But judges have a
huge amount of discretion, and can factor in a host of variables - 
including whether a defendant took the stand and lied, something 
prosecutors say Blagojevich did.

He arrived at court with his wife Patti after Judge James Zagel said the verdicts would be read this afternoon.

The former governor told reporters gathered outside his home this morning: 'My hands are shaking, my knees are weak.'

He said he was praying for the best, but added: 'It’s in God’s hands.'

The jury had spent three weeks talking through the evidence.

Blagojevich was originally tried last
year, but the jury came back deadlocked after deliberating for 14 days,
the the judge ordered a retrial.

They agreed on just one of 24 counts, convicting Blagojevich of lying to the FBI. He faces up to five years on that conviction.

Today's verdict makes Blagojevich the second Illinois governor in a row to be convicted of corruption.

His predecessor, former governor George Ryan, is serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence.

Prosecutors,
defence attorneys and dozens of reporters filed into the courtroom 
today after the judge announced it had received word of a note from 
jurors.

Judge Zagel said: 'The jury has come 
to a decision on 18 of the 20 counts.'

He added that the jurors said  
they were deadlocked on two counts and 'were confident' they couldn't 
agree on those charges 'even with further deliberations.'

Asked
how he should respond, both prosecutors and the defence indicated to 
Zagel that the jury had deliberated long enough and should be asked to 
deliver the verdicts.

It was only the third note from 
jurors in their deliberations. The two other gave no hint about how 
deliberations were proceeding.

Blagojevich was arrested in December 2008, after the FBI had wiretapped hundreds of his telephone calls at work and home. The Illinois Legislature impeached him a month later.

Both trials hinged on whether the former governor's bold ramblings to aides and others on the telephone was just talk, as he insisted, or part of 'a political crime spree', in the words of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.

The case became a media spectacle, with the indicted governor and his wife appearing on television reality shows.

The loquacious Blagojevich made theatrical appearances daily outside the courthouse during the first trial to profess his innocence and hug his remaining fans.

In a case full of high-level name 
dropping, defence attorneys in the retrial pulled into court Chicago's 
new Mayor Rahm Emanuel and U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.

Mr
Emanuel's appearance on the witness stand, the most anticipated by a 
Chicago mayor in a federal courtroom in decades, was over in just five 
minutes. Jackson was done in about half an hour.

Overall,
though, the retrial had far less of the circus-like atmosphere that 
accompanied the initial trial. Blagojevich himself also was more subdued
this time.

Prosecutors dropped racketeering 
counts against the ex-governor and dismissed all charges against his 
then co-defendant brother, Robert Blagojevich.

When there was still hope: Rod Blagojevich and his wife leave their home in Chicago this morning, left, and right, a wellwisher offers the shamed former governor a hug of support

They presented just three weeks of evidence - half the time taken at the first trial.

They called fewer witnesses, asked fewer questions and played shorter excerpts of the FBI wiretaps that underpin most of the charges.

There was also a new variable at the retrial: The testimony from Blagojevich himself. At the first trial, the defence rested without calling any witnesses and Blagojevich didn't testify despite vowing that he would.

Retrial jurors saw a deferential Blagojevich look them in the eyes and deny every allegation, telling them his talk on the recordings was mere brainstorming. This time, jurors must decide if they believe him.
