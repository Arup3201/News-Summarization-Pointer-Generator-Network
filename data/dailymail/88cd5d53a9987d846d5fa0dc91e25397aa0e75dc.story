Model Daisy Lowe stunned festive shoppers yesterday by posing as a mannequin in a window display – wearing a £2,000 dress from the 1930s.

A crowd gathered to take photographs outside vintage goods shop Pennies, in Islington, Central London, as the 25-year-old struck a series of poses.

The model was promoting Small Business Saturday – a scheme sponsored by American Express to champion independent businesses.
