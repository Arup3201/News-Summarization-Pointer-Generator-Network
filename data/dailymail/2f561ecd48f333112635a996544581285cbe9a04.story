Shaun and Mitch Marsh will join some of the most famous names in Australian cricket when the brothers play alongside each other in the second Test against India. 

They will line-up at the Gabba and become the first siblings to represent the Aussies in a Test since Steve and Mark Waugh more than a decade ago - no pressure there then.

Shaun is a 31-year-old left-handed top-order batsman who made his name in the inaugural IPL season, while Mitch, 23, is a right-handed all-rounder.

The Marshes share a laugh ahead of Australia's second Test against India 

'It's great to be out here now and great to be out there together playing the Gabba Test,' Shaun said

'He (Mitch) is definitely my little brother, even though he might be little taller than me, I can still boss around him a little bit. We're looking forward to it and it's going to be a lot of fun.'

There have been other brothers representing Australia in Test cricket - Ian and Greg Chappell played with distinction in the Seventies, while David and Ned Gregory were involved in the first ever Test, against England in 1877.

The Marshes come from good cricketing stock as their dad, Geoff, played more than 50 Tests for Australia as an opening batsman.

He said: 'As a parent, you just hope they do the best they possibly can. Tomorrow, they'll walk out there and it'll be a really proud moment.'

The Aussies are 1-0 up in the Test series with India, which was played against a backdrop of emotion following the death of Phillip Hughes.

The home side won convincingly but captain Michael Clarke has been ruled out with a back injury and Steve Smith will captain Australia.

The second Test at the Gabba begins on Wednesday.
