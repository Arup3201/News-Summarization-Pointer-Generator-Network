Critics often say models in the fashion industry have static faces and frosty attitudes.

But now there is a real reason behind the cold demeanor - a French waxworks museum has unveiled a new section of the attraction dedicated to designers and supermodels.

The likes of Naomi Campbell and Cara Delevingne have finally been frozen time - for the next few months at least - at the Musee Grevin in Paris.

Fashion's hottest young thing: Cara Delevingne is immortalised in wax at the French attraction

Lingerie designer Chantal Thomass and aristocrat Inès de La Fressange were at the opening of the exhibition in the French capital on Monday, and gamely posed alongside their waxy counterparts.

Chantal's figurine was so similar that is was almost impossible to tell the difference between the artwork and the real deal, but other waxworks were less impressive.  

Cara and Naomi  flew the flag for the British supermodels after having their likeness cast into molds for the show.

Other global household names joining Cara and Naomi in the museum's famous hall of mirrors were the singer Madonna, the fashion designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Dior and the Canadian model Coco Rocha.

The exhibition space also includes fashion photography and a film by Ali Mahdavi.

The new section of the museum joins the more traditional section, which includes old and new movie stars, musicians from Mozart to Michael Jackson and sporting greats. 

Visitors to the show can also learn how the wax figures are made, including the detailed make-up that is used to transform each model into a celebrity and the models who sit for hours to help build the molds.
