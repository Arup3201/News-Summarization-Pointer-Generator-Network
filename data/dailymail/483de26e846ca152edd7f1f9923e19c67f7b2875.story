A Florida doctor sent his pregnant patient an email saying that he would call the police and have them force her to the hospital after she refused to give birth to her high-risk child.

The case is still going on as Lisa Epsteen refuses to give in and have a C-section even though that is the way she gave birth to her first four children.

When Mrs Epsteen, 35, became pregnant with her fifth child, she resolved to have a vaginal birth even though some view that as a more difficult and potentially complicated process after having given birth via caesarean four previous times.

Sticking to her plan: Lisa Epsteen, 35, gave birth to her four prior children via C-section though she refuses to take multiple doctor's advice and have a similar procedure for her fifth child even though her baby is at risk and a week past the due date

According to The Tampa Bay Times, her due date passed a week ago, she had a worrying doctor's appointment on Friday, and then another one on Tuesday where other doctors asked her to stay in the hospital and give birth right then.

She brushed those concerns away and stuck to her plan to give birth naturally, but the moment where she got truly upset was when her physician, Dr Jerry Yankowitz, sent her the threatening note in an effort to push her into action.

'I am deeply concerned that you are contributing to a very high probability that your fetus will die or your child will incur brain damage if born alive. At this time, you must come in for delivery,' Dr Yankowitz wrote in the letter.

He is the chairman of the University of South Florida's obstetrics and gynecology department, and though he initially agreed to take Mrs Epsteen on as a patient and help her towards a vaginal birth, the circumstances have changed.

'I would hate to move to the most extreme option, which is having law enforcement pick you up at your home and bring you in, but you are leaving the providers of USF/TGH no choice,' he wrote.

Expert: Dr Jerry Yankowitz is the head of obstetrics at the University of South Florida hospital and he sent her an email saying he would call police if Mrs Epsteen didn't go to the hospital immediately

'In a couple of hours there are going to be cops on my doorstep taking me away from home — in front of my children — to force me into having surgery.'

Instead of sending her speeding out to the hospital, Mrs Epsteen got angry and reportedly told the Tampa Bay Times that she called a support group called National Advocates for Pregnant Women because she felt his actions were illegal.

The group sided with her in spite of the fact that multiple doctors told her that her baby was in distress on Tuesday, and that because she had developed gestational diabetes she was at an additionally high risk point in her pregnancy.

When doctors at the University of South Florida hospital told her that she should give birth right then, she determined that their joint concern was unfounded, and felt that it was the wrong time to give birth because no one would be able to watch her 2-year-old child and her husband was still at work with no way to get to the hospital since she had used the family's only car.

The University of South Florida would not comment on the issue to MailOnline, saying that they respect patients privacy.

The New York-based advocacy group had a lawyer call the doctor and tell him to stop his threats against Mrs Epsteen.

'The threat he was making was both legally and ethically unjustifiable,' the group's attorney Farah Diaz-Tello said told MailOnline.

'The problem is not that her doctor 
recommended that she have a caesarean section; the problem is that her 
doctor threatened her with arrest if she didn't have a Caesarean 
section.'

Ms Diaz-Tello said that expectant mothers in Florida have extra reason to be nervous about the threat of law enforcement involvement, as two infamous cases stand out as warning signs.

In the 1990s, a woman named Laura Pemberton wanted to have a Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC) and wanted to have the child at home with the aid of a midwife. Because she became dehydrated, Ms Pemberton went to a local hospital to get treated for that before returning to her home to have a natural birth. Once doctors learned of her plans, they sent a sheriff to her home to force her to have a C-section at the hospital.

Another case occurred more recently in 2009, when Samantha Burton wanted to ask for a second opinion about whether or not she was going to miscarry as she was experiencing symptoms at the 25th week in the pregnancy. Rather than provide her with a second opinion, doctors got a court order to keep her on bedrest at the hospital for the rest of the pregnancy. She was eventually had a C-section, at which time doctors realized that the child had already died.

Even though Mrs Epsteen has been so adamantly opposing having a C-section for the fifth time- repeatedly refusing various doctor's suggestions and even going against the news that her baby boy is not in an ideal position for a vaginal birth- she went ahead and scheduled one on Friday.

'Honestly, I feel abandoned. There has
to be a level of trust between provider and patient, and that has been 
betrayed,' she told The Tampa Bay Times.

In
light of the legal action, Dr Yankowitz sent a follow-up email saying 
that he will not send the police to get her but he remains convinced 
that 'you and your child are in jeopardy'.

Borderline: Victoria Beckham famously had her fourth C-section with her daughter Harper, pushing what many doctors believe is the upper limit for how many caesaraen procedures many women can undergo

While the idea of having a natural 
birth seems like a woman's right, there are some serious health concerns
in this particular situation because of Mrs Epsteen's history of having
four prior Caesarean operations.

And the practice is common, since 29.1 per cent of all births in the U.S. in 2005 were via caesarean.

The
practice of having a Vaginal Birth After Caesaraen (VBAC) has dropped 
significantly in popularity and practice after a damning 1999 study.

The
greatest risk that VBAC poses is uterine rupture, as the scar tissue 
that forms around a woman's womb during a C-section could rip during a 
natural birth, which could cause 'a catastrophic risk to the mother and 
baby'.

Because the 
scar tissue can harden over time, many doctors consider three the 'safe'
upper limit for having C-sections, with four instances happening from 
time to time but still a rarity.

One
of the most noted instances of the procedure is that of Victoria 
Beckham who famously had her fourth C-section procedure when she gave 
birth to her daughter Harper.

According
to consultant obstetrician and gynecologist Clive Spence-Jones, a 
fourth Caesarean — or even a fifth or sixth — is not the automatic 
health disaster many people assume it to be, although risks do exist.

'Caesarean
surgeries become more dangerous for the mother the more surgeries you 
have... there is an increasing risks to the baby but the risks to the 
mother also becomes significant,' attorney Farah Diaz-Tello told 
MailOnline.
