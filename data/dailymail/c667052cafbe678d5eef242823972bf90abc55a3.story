A deal to lend Rebekah Brooks a police horse was agreed over lunch with the boss of Scotland Yard, the Leveson Inquiry heard yesterday.

Former Met commissioner Lord Blair said he had been dining with the former Sun and News of the World editor on the day she called the force’s media chief asking to ‘foster’ a retired police horse.

Yesterday Lord Blair attempted to distance himself from the saga dubbed ‘Horsegate’, which has come to symbolise the dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International.

Lord Blair said he had no recollection of a conversation with Rebekah Brooks over the loan of a Met Police horse

He said he had ‘absolutely no recollection’ of talking to Mrs Brooks about the horse and denied giving the authority for the animal named Raisa to be handed into her care.

But he accepted evidence from force press chief Dick Fedorcio that it would have been discussed over their lunch.

Lord Blair told the inquiry: ‘He (Mr Fedorcio) was telephoned by Rebekah Brooks asking about this arrangement – she had heard that this arrangement existed and he arranged for her to go down to see the inspector in charge of horses...

‘This seems to have happened on the day that I had lunch with her and, what I understand Mr Fedorcio is going to say, that this was discussed at the lunch.

'I have absolutely no recollection of that.’

Mrs Brooks, who was arrested last year on suspicion of phone hacking and making corrupt payments to police, adopted the horse after it retired from active service in 2008.

She paid food and vet bills until Raisa was rehoused with a police officer in 2010, months before fresh investigations began into illegal activities at the News of the World.

The horse, which last week the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had ridden at Mrs Brooks’ farm in Oxfordshire, was returned to the force in a ‘poor condition’ and later died of natural causes.

The Leveson Inquiry also heard yesterday how the teenage sons of two former Met commissioners were given work experience at The Sun.

Lord Blair said ‘it was a perfectly normal process’ to get his 15-year-old son a week’s work experience at the tabloid in July 2005 during his time as commissioner.

He also claimed his predecessor Lord Condon had arranged for his child to do work experience at News International.

The revelations came as it emerged that detectives wanted to mount a corruption probe into journalists bribing police as long ago as 2000.

The investigation was blocked by Met commander Andy Hayman who was later to become the subject of an inquiry into police leaks to journalists.

Bob Quick ordered an inquiry into John Yates's phone calls, to which Mr Yates responded that he was 'too well connected'

Former Met assistant commissioner Bob Quick compiled a report in 2000 claiming journalists from The Sun and other tabloids were offering bungs of £500 to £2,000 to officers for stories about celebrities caught up in police investigations.

In a statement to the inquiry, he said the force had accumulated a ‘huge volume of intelligence’.

But Mr Hayman, who was in charge of professional standards, raised ‘evidential challenges’ and the probe was not launched because it was considered ‘too risky’.

Bob Quick, former assistant commissioner for specialist operations said that he recommended an investigation into police corruption at the Met.

As part of that probe he called for a 'retrospective analysis' of then-assistant commissioner John Yates's phone records but he refused.

According to Mr Quick, Mr Yates said 'I am too well connected', and when this line of inquiry was further pressed, Yates told him 'No... I am very well connected'.

Quick told Lord Leveson that he thought this was 'a bit of theatre' and when his concerns were taken to commissioner Paul Stephenson it was made clear that matters would not be taken any further.

Mr Quick said concerns were raised by Sir Gus O'Donnell, chief secretary to the cabinet, who specifically spoke about Mr Yates's relationship with the press.

He told Sir Gus a few days later that 'there were no leaks or malpractice'.
