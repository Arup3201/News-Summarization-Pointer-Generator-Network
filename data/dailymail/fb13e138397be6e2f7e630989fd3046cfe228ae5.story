A 72 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by officers from Operation Yewtree - the team investigating decades of abuse by paedophile Jimmy Savile.

The pensioner was held in east London yesterday afternoon and taken into police custody before being released on bail until July.

Yewtree is exploring three strands: claims against Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving people not linked to the DJ.

This east London man falls under the strand of Yewtree police have termed others, and he is the 13th person to be arrested as part of the investigation.

The Met today refused to name the man.

It came as a different pensioner, who was earlier arrested in south London as part of the Jimmy Savile sex probe, has been released without charge.

The 65-year-old was held in February on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into police custody.

But a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said today there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.

The freed man was also arrested in the 'others' strand.

Most of the allegations relating to 'others' have been made against people associated with the entertainment industry, including ex-glam rocker Gary Glitter and comedian Freddie Starr.

PR guru Max Clifford, TV star and comedian Jim Davidson and entertainer Rolf Harris are also among those who have been arrested.

So far, 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with 450 alleging they were sexually abused by former Top Of The Pops presenter Savile.

Of those making complaints about the late DJ, 73 per cent were children at the time of the offences.

A report released in January revealed that Savile's victims included an eight-year-old boy and children who were seriously ill.

Branded one of the UK's most prolific known sexual predators, Savile now has 214 criminal offences recorded against his name, including 34 rapes.
