Melbourne University's Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis has estimated fees are likely to soar as he outlined the impact of the government's planned 20 percent reduction in funding in an email to staff on Friday

Student fees will double for some degrees at leading universities under the federal government's controversial overhaul of higher education.

Fees at Melbourne University will need to rise by up to 61 percent in some courses to manage budget cuts, while the University of Sydney is looking at double the cost for some arts degrees and a 55 percent increase for engineering and science degrees.

Melbourne's Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis estimated fees were likely to soar in an email to staff on Friday as he outlined the impact of the government's planned 20 percent reduction in funding.

'Initial analysis shows the gap (caused by reduced public funding) is momentous indeed - fees would need to rise by 45 per cent to make up lost funding in social science disciplines, by 54 per cent in Science, and by 61 per cent in Engineering,' the email said, according to the Age.

'The budget has significantly changed the allocation of public money across disciplines. There are some winners – mathematics and humanities – and many losers.'

A bachelor of science degree with a civil engineering major costs a minimum of $24,082 based on current fees, but that would rise to at $38,772.

An analysis of the cost implications from budget cuts show similar predictions for the University of Sydney with communications, social science, environmental and engineering degrees at least doubling, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

A bachelor of environmental systems currently costs a minimum of $25,839 but students could be faced with a $42,405 bill from 2016.

Communications students who now pay about $18,132 would pay about $37,000 under the changes.

In an interview last month with Fairfax Media, Professor Davis said Melbourne University would not increase fees to charge the maximum amount possible and said he found parts of the budget 'distressing' despite his support for fee deregulation.

'The only reason I am for fee deregulation is because both sides of politics have showed us they aren't prepared to do enough public funding,' he said.

Prof Davis said he was concerned about the 10-year government bond rate – a long term interest rate.

'It's a much higher rate of interest. It starts earlier and it will compound over time, which means that students will be paying back higher fees for longer… And that's very disappointing,' he said.

The changes to higher education were announced in the Abbott government's recent budget, which will allow universities to set their own tuition fees from 2016.

But Education Minister Christopher Pyne has rejected claims that the government's proposed rejig of university funding will drive up course costs for students.

Institutions that price themselves out of the market will have empty lecture theatres and tutorials, Mr Pyne said.

'Competition will drive prices down and students will be the winner in terms of quality and price,' he told ABC TV on Sunday.

Mr Pyne said some 200 universities across Australia will have to remain competitive in the education market and doesn't foresee an explosion in fees.

Despite the cost, students will still be able to borrow every single dollar from the government 'at the lowest interest rate that student will ever see in any loan they will ever have in their lives'.

Students enrolled in courses before the budget announcement will not be affected by the change, while those who have signed up since will be affected from January 2016.
