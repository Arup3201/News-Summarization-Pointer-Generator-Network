It'd be hard to persuade many people to teeter 1,000ft above a rocky mountain range, even with full safety gear.

But one daredevil climber took on the challenge with only his hands and feet to help him.

Jean-Michel Casanova scaled the outside section of 1,083ft-high Bailong Elevator today in the Wulingyuan area of Zhangijiajie, China.

Casanova successfully climbed the 564ft outdoor section of the elevator without safety equipment

It took the French climber 68 minutes and 26 seconds to complete the 564ft challenge, shunning protective gear to wear only trainers, a vest top and jogging bottoms.

If he'd taken the lift, he would have raced to the top in a mere minute.

The tallest outdoor elevator in the world lets visitors dodge the 2 1/2 hour walk to the top.

But Casanova opted for the more dangerous route with
its stunning, if terrifying, views of the dramatic green landscape and 
craggy rocks surrounding him.

The Bailong Elevator, also known as 
the Hundred Dragons Elevators, whisks tourists up the side of a massive 
sandstone column in a mountain range in China's Hunan Province.

It's not Casanova's first daring - some may say reckless - climb at an international landmark.

In 1989 he did scaled Paris's Eiffel 
Tower without a safety harness, and climbed New York's Brooklyn Bridge 
while dressed as Spider Man.Â
