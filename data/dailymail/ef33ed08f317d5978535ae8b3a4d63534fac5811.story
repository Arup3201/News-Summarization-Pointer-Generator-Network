Britain looks set to enjoy another week of uncharacteristically warm and dry September weather with temperatures of up to 22C as we head into Autumn. 

Met Office forecasters said that while some parts of the UK could see light rain - most will enjoy the same pleasant sunshine seen throughout the month.

And it would that appear the UK's wildlife is also enjoying the mild climate - with horses in Somerset captured charging around a meadow during this morning's mist.

Stags in Richmond Park were also seen bellowing in the evening sun yesterday as rutting season - when males attempt to attract females - fast approaches.

The Met Office said that Friday is likely to be the hottest day of the week and that people can also look forward to a weekend of good weather. 

Dan Williams, Met Office spokesman, said: ‘We’re looking at a continued dry and settled theme for the week – like we've seen through most of September

'Large parts of England and Wales will have dry and fine weather with temperatures staying in the high teens and possibly reaching the low 20s during the day.

'Friday is looking like the warmest day  – with possible temperatures of 22C.

'But there will be a variable amount of cloud and some very occasional light and patchy rain, with slightly more unsettled weather in the north of England and in Scotland.'

September is on target to become one of the driest on record, despite the thunderstorms and heavy downpours at the end of last week.  

The Met Office's three-day weather forecast shows a largely dry and fine week - especially in the south of the UK where temperatures could reach 22C

Figures up to September 15, released by the Met Office, show there was just 6.7mm of rain across the UK, which is just 7 per cent of the month’s average of 96mm. 

Mr Wiliams added: 'Next weekend, much like the week, looks mostly fine and dry with similarly warm temperatures on both Saturday and Sunday.

'Naturally, we are also beginning to experience slightly cooler nights.'
