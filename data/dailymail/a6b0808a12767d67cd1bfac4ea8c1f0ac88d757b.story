A driver escaped virtually unharmed after his van hurtled into a pair of trees and he found himself trapped within the mangled remains.

Delivery driver James Whittaker, 22, was on the A64 near York in the early hours of Saturday morning, when his van left the road and ploughed into a tree on his passenger side, before veering to the right and crashing into another tree.

The second tree stopped the vehicle rolling further down an embankment, but the double impact sliced the roof off Mr Whittaker's Vauxhall Vivaro and reduced the van into a twisted heap of metal.

Mr Whittaker, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said he did not remember what caused the crash, but recalled finding himself wedged within the battered van.

Miraculously, he did not break a single bone in the impact and came away with superficial wounds.

He said: 'Apparently, the police, ambulance and firefighters didn’t expect to find me alive. I’m so lucky. I’ve seen pictures of other crashes and the cars don’t look half as bad as mine.

'I can’t believe I made it out without major injuries.

'All I suffered was a cut to my forehead, a few grazes on my legs and a bruised foot, nothing really.

'The worst injury I had was a cut on my hand from windscreen glass, but even that happened after the crash when I was trying to get out of the van.'

Mr Whittaker, who started working for his father's Sheffield-based delivery service, Dedicated Couriers Ltd, had begun his shift at midnight.

He said: 'The last thing I remember is making a delivery in Beverley earlier in the night. At the time of the crash I was on the A64, apparently driving from Scarborough to York, but I don’t remember being there.'

Mr Whittaker came round after the impact to find a Polish truck driver, who had passed by the accident, calling 999. When ambulance and fire services arrived on the scene they removed him from the wrecked vehicle.

The roof of the Vauxhall Vivaro was sliced off in the impact, but miraculously driver James Whittaker escaped relatively unharmed

He explained: 'They didn’t even have to cut the roof off as it was already gone. They just cut some of the steering wheel so I could be pulled out.'

The lucky driver was taken off to York Hospital with a neck brace, as a precaution, but a CT scan and x-rays revealed that incredibly, James had not suffered any fractures.

He has suffered some memory loss, but doctors have told him he may get his full memory back at some point.

Police believe the accident happened around 4am, the same time his Tom Tom navigation system stopped working, but it is still unknown what caused it.

Lucky: James Whittaker escaped from the crash with a few superficial cuts and bruises

Mr Whittaker added: 'The Tom Tom system records speed and I wasn’t driving over the speed limit. It was very wet and windy so it could have been that I skidded, and the police say I could have fallen asleep.

“But I was talking to my friend on my hands free kit at 3.50am, so I would have been quite alert and the doctor thought it was unlikely that I would have dropped off so quickly.'

Looking at pictures of the written-off van, which is undergoing tests to determine if there was a fault with it, Mr Whittaker credited wearing his seat belt for his miraculous escape.

He said: “I can’t believe how lucky I was. I just keep thinking, if there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn’t have stood a chance.

“My girlfriend Brodie usually comes with me on my Friday night and Saturday morning shift, but luckily this week she came on Wednesday instead. It’s just so lucky she wasn’t with me.”

Mr Whittaker added: "When I look at pictures of the wreckage, I can't believe I wasn't more badly injured or killed. If there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn't have stood a chance."
