An entire village will be  resettled in a bid to escape starving jungle tribesmen who keep raiding their homes for food and clothes.

The Peruvian government has been forced to act after 200 members of the Mashco Piro tribe staged several raids on a local village in Peru stealing food and tools.

Ministers said the attacks are  a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on their food supply as loggers decimate their homeland.

According to the Peruvian Interculture Ministry the tribesmen chose to steal from their village neighbours because they realised it would be easier than searching for food.

The Ministry said it has become increasingly hard for the tribesmen to forage for food, leading to thefts and conflict between the two communities.

In the latest attack, village homes were damaged by the men who also sacrificed domestic animals which they found.

Meanwhile the tribesmen also stole cooking utensils, ropes, machetes, clothes, blankets and even mosquito nets from the villagers.

The thefts forced the villagers from Monte Salvado in south-eastern Peru's Madre de Dios region to flee to the local police station for safety.

However, the ministry warned that there were likely to be further raids on the isolated region and confirmed they are now planning to move the villagers to a new location to avoid further conflicts. 

The Mashco-Piro are an indigenous tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers who inhabit the remote regions of the Amazon rainforest. 

They live in Manu Park in the Madre de Dios Region in Peru. They have, in the past, actively avoided contact with non-native people. Choosing instead to live in voluntary isolation in Peru's south-eastern Amazon.

But last year, they sparked concern by  making contact with the outside world for the second time since 2011, on the river hamlet.

Patricia Balbuena, the Minister for Interculture,  said: 'We have in the meantime provided emergency assistance and compensation for the villagers although at this time of year and given the remote location it is difficult to get there.'

However, it is not the first time an indigenous tribe has been involved in violent conflict with the modern world.

The most violent raid was in 2010, when a local was brought to hospital in a critical state after being shot with an arrow in the belly by a tribe member.

The Mashco Piro are a hunter-gatherer tribe who live in the Amazon forest.

They were one of several tribes designated by the government as 'uncontacted people'. The government forbids direct contact with them because the tribes' immune systems are not thought to be able to cope with the type of germs carried by other Peruvians. 

They live a largely isolated life, but sporadically make contact with some of their modern neighbours such as the villagers of Monte Salvado.
