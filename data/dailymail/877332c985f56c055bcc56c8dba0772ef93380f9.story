North Korea's founder could very well be turning in his grave at the news his ruling grandson has removed his revered image from the secretive country's new banknotes.

Current leader, Kim Jong-un, would have had to give his approval for the image of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, to be dropped from the country's batch of new 5,000 won banknotes.

The face value of each note is about £70, although the market value is said to be less than £1.

However, the current leader has approved images of Kim Il-sung's house to be prominently displayed on the notes, along with pictures of gifts his grandfather Kim and his son, the late leader Kim Jong-Il, have received from foreign leaders.  

Although there has been widespread speculation about the reasons for Kim Il-sung's removal, most analysts suspect it is for 'continuity' - lower value notes also depict the birth places of Kim Jong-il and his mother.

However, Yoon Young-kwan, a North Korean expert at Seoul National University, has another reason.

'Removing his grandfather's image suggests that Kim Jong-un will follow an independent path to develop the North's economy, while due homage is being paid to the former dictators by depicting their birthplaces,' he told South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper.

Other 
analysts suggest that the old notes were an easy target for forgers - 
two years ago counterfeit 5,000 won bills from China caused chaos in 
North Korea.

It is not the first time the demigod founder's image has been taken off the banknotes.

His
 portrait disappeared from the 2,000 and 1,000 won bills after a failed 
robbery in 2009, although the reasons were not made public.

It was never disclosed what punishment the offenders were subjected to although it is doubtful they would have lived to try it again.

The new 5,000 won note is North Korea's largest denomination but with the market value being so low workers who receive on average 3,000 won a month have to seek second and even third jobs.

The official announcement last month of the new banknotes that no longer feature the revered founder sent panic  through the country among families who feared a total currency reform.

When the currency was reformed a few years ago there was panic buying sparked by fears that many commodities would become too expensive.
