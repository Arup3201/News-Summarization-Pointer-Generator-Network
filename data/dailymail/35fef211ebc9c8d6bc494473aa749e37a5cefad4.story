Roberto Mancini was flattened by one of his own players on Sunday as his Inter Milan side continued their resurgence in Serie A with a 3-1 win over Genoa.

With the score at 2-0, Genoa tried to unlock Inter's defence with a quick counter attack that was abruptly halted by defender Marco Andreolli.

Andreolli cut across and went to blast the ball into the stands, but instead the ball flew straight into Mancini's face.

The power behind Andreolli's clearance meant that Mancini, renowned for a neat touch and clever anticipation as a player, had no chance of getting out of the way.

But the Inter manager saw the funny side and burst into laughter as he rubbed his face.

Rodrigo Palacio put Inter ahead after 12 minutes when he converted a rebound from a Mauro Icardi volley.

And Icardi got his name on the scoresheet six minutes before half time with a powerful header.

After the break, Genoa's attacking play improved. Maxime Lestienne struck the crossbar on 62, and five minutes before full time, they pulled a goal back through an Armando Izzo strike.

The goal looked set to ensure a nervy finish at the San Siro, but former Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic had other ideas.

He was on hand to poke in his first goal for Inter from Lukas Podolski's corner to make the game safe.

The goal secured Mancini's first home league win since taking over the club for the second time in November, and continued their improved form after a 1-1 draw with leaders Juventus last week. 

The three points moved Inter up to eighth with the rest of Sunday's Italian league matches, including Roma v Lazio and Napoli v Juventus, still to be played.
