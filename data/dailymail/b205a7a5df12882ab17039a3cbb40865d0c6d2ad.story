There is outrage at the highest levels of the Australian Islamic community after a senior sheikh who recently met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott  was unable to board his flight after being stopped for a two-and-a-half hour baggage check.

Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman was leading a delegation to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj spiritual pilgrimage when he was halted by authorities at Sydney Airport last Thursday. 

He was released without charge but was the only member of the delegation to miss his flight.

The incident provoked an extraordinary blast from religious leader Grand Mufti Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, who expressed his 'anger' over the sheikh's 'detention' in a fiery statement released by the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC).

The Islamic community has become concerned by a number of anti-Islamic incidents in recent weeks, such as the alleged vandalism of this car in Sydney's west recently.

'It is totally unacceptable for any Australian citizen, let alone a senior member of the (Imams Council) to be subjected to this seemingly random yet profiled manner causing severe stress and unwanted convenience,' Dr Mohammad said. 

In his role as a senior ANIC member, Sheikh Al Suleiman was part of a delegation who met the Prime Minister to discuss community concerns about the government's proposed anti-terror laws in August. 

A spokesman for Scott Morrison, the Customs and Border Protection Minister, said Mr Al Suleiman was not randomly targeted and the government would not be providing 'running commentary' on the issue. 

'The Government will take the steps necessary at our borders to protect our national security,' the spokesman said. 'At times this will mean that national security takes priority over the convenience of travellers.

'Our officers do not stop travellers indiscriminately, including in this instance.'

Thursday's incident - which occurred on the same day as the largest terror raids in the country's history - was labelled  'a bit embarrassing for all involved' by one Islamic leader, Joseph Wakim, and branded 'a deliberate balls-up' by community spokesman Keysar Trad. 

It comes at a time where Muslim leaders said they are concerned by anti-Islamic sentiment. 

Mr Wakim, the founder of the Australian Arabic Council, said the sheikh was a ‘respected’ member of the community who had provided the police with advice in the past and that Customs had wanted to double check his baggage.

Sheik Al Suleiman has condemned the Islamic State terror group in recent media reports. He has since travelled on to Saudi Arabia, and spoken to Mr Wakim, who said Customs officials had wanted to double check his baggage. 

'We don't want to ever compromise on safety,' Mr Wakim said. 'Any individual travelling in and out, there does need to be scrutiny.

'It was just odd on this occasion, at this particular time, that it happened to one of the most senior Muslim clerics in Australia.

'It's a bit like having a bishop who was stopped. It was a bit embarrassing for all concerned.'  

Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad, who said he sat across from the Sheikh Al Suleiman at the meeting with Muslim leaders and the Prime Minister last month, accused the government of deliberately attempting to 'send a message' to the Islamic community. 

'I'm sure that he is one of the people who would be on the computer as a high profile person,' Mr Trad said. 

'It's very, very likely that detention was intentional... I think it's a deliberate balls-up to send a message (to the Islamic community).'

Last Thursday the nation witnessed the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country's history, in which 15 people were arrested. 

Omarjan Azari (pictured) was arrested and charged by police with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act last Thursday. The counter-terrorism raids, which involved more than 800 police, were the biggest in Australia's history.

Two men were later charged, including Omarjan Azari, 22. 

In court documents seen by Daily Mail Australia, police alleged Azari conspired with Australia's most senior jihadist militant, former Underbelly actor Mohammad Ali Baryalei, to conduct a public beheading on a random member of the public.

Following the raids, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione announced the beginning of Operation Hammerhead, which will see 220 police deployed in 'high visiblity police work' across Sydney to maintain order and protect significant infrastructure and iconic locations. 

Members of the Islamic community have set up a Facebook page, the Islamophobia Register Australia, to publicly document anti-Muslim incidents. The page had recorded a number of recent threats, including towards the Grand Mufti and a number of mosques.

Mr Wakim said recent threats against Muslims were actually helping the Islamic State terror group. 'The people who are perpetrating these attacks, who think it's open season at the moment, are inadvertently helping ISIS,' Mr Wakim said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State. 

'They are actually doing it because they think they're helping the war against ISIS by attacking local people, but what they're doing inadvertently is driving a lot of Muslims in Australia to the margins.

'You want to be doing the exact opposite because, in fact, any war against ISIS requires full cooperation from the Muslim (community),' he said, adding that it is members of the Muslim community who are denouncing extremist neighbours and tipping off ASIO to threats.
