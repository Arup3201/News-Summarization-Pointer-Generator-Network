Former Miami Dolphins fullback Rob Konrad survived a boating accident on Wednesday night by swimming nine miles to safety, confirmed the Coast Guard.

Konrad was reportedly fishing alone off the coast of South Florida when he fell from the 36-foot vessel, which was operating on autopilot. 

The 38-year-old spent between 10-12 hours swimming in the Atlantic Ocean, Petty Officer Mark Barney of U.S. Coast Guard told ABC News.

Konrad made a total of 82 appearances for the Dolphins, starting 57 games, between 1999 and 2004 before being released in March 2005.

The Coast Guard was alerted after friends became concerned that he missed a dinner date, sparking the release of an air rescue helicopter to search for him.
