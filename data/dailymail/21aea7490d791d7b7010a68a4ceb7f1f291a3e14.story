 Walmart can now add banking to its 'everyday low price' slogan.

The nation's largest retailer announced Wednesday that it will add to its shelves  low-cost mobile checking accounts managed and issued by Green Dot Bank to customers with simple eligibility requirements.

It will be called GoBank.

An official from the Green Dot Corporation, a prepaid-card specialist company in Pasadena, told MailOnline that with GoBank, members have full access and control of their money from participating Walmart locations, as well as their iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android device.

This isn't Walmart's first attempt to break into the banking business.

In 2005, Walmart officials applied for a banking license  but withdrew the application after being pressured by established banks opposing the company's efforts, CNN Money reports.

Walmart Senior Vice President Daniel Eckert said GoBank is an alternative to traditional banking

The accounts will include no minimum balance fees, overdraft charges or monthly fees to customers with a monthly direct deposit of $500 or more, according toThe New York Times.  

Steve Streit, founder and CEO of Green Dot Corporation and chairman of Green Dot Bank boasts of GoBank that no other checking account offers easy and affordable management of finances like the banking system will.

'GoBank is breaking down the barriers to traditional banking and brings the benefits of a FDIC-insured checking account that's loaded with features to a large segment of Americans,' Streit said in a statement.

The Times reports that the banking system, including a MasterCard debit card and checking account, will provide accounts to almost anyone over the age of 18 who passes an identification check.

The company will not use credit ratings or other eligibility determining scores for its customers.

Daniel Eckert, senior vice president at Walmart, told the Times Tuesday that GoBank is intended to be a 'low cost alternative' to traditional banking. 

The accounts will be available by the end of October.

According to CNN, the accounts will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who is involved with nearly all of the nation's banks.

GoBank will boast features like 'Money Vault' which will enable customer's checking accounts to act as savings accounts by allowing the customer to move money in and out of a 'money vault' for 'safekeeping' at any time.

The system will also allow customers to send money instantly via email or text message at no charge as well as receive direct deposit paychecks earlier than their usual pay date. 

The system's starter kit will be offered for $2.95. 

Eckert told the Times that most people receiving social security or fixed pensions would qualify for GoBank. 'Walmart customers want easier ways to manage their everyday finances and increasingly feel they just aren't getting value from traditional banking because of high fees,' Eckert said.
