Furious Tory MPs last night rounded on European Commissioner Viviane Reding who accused David Cameron of deliberately spreading ‘populist myths’ about immigration and benefits tourism.

Mrs Reding accused the PM of raising the issue deliberately to distract from the ‘real subjects’ of concern to British people. She said Mr Cameron’s actions were ‘destroying the future’ of Britain.

Her comments were condemned as ‘unbelievable’ and ‘utter nonsense’ by Tory backbenchers, who accused her of being out of touch.

James Clappison, MP for Hertsmere, praised Mr Cameron for his approach and said Mrs Reding’s remarks were ‘wholly inappropriate’.

‘She has no business in commenting in those terms and no business in interfering with national immigration policies,’ he said.

MP James Clappison said: 'She has no business commenting... and interfering with immigration policies'

South Northamptonshire MP Andrea Leadsom, writing on the Spectator website, said the comments showed out ‘completely out of touch with voters’ Mrs Reding was.

‘Whilst I believe the UK will remain an open economy and society that welcomes hard-working and aspiring people from across Europe, to hide our heads in the sand and pretend that the free movement of people across the EU does not come with some negative consequences is utter nonsense.

‘The issue of immigration is one of the biggest concerns of taxpayers across many EU countries, and the impact on wages, access to benefits, and ‘social dislocation’ all need to be addressed in the context of large scale migration in the EU.

She added: ‘Member states must be able to decide who should be allowed to access their welfare.’

Mrs Reding made her comments an online discussion. She claimed that ‘most of the things which are told to the people in Great Britain are myths, have nothing to do with reality.’

‘Coming back to the subject which the Government of the UK has pushed to the agenda, probably in order not to make people speak about the real subjects in the UK, are this supposed invasion of foreigners coming to the UK and stealing the jobs and stealing the social security and the health money.

‘The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections.

The European Commissioner said: 'I'm frustrated about [British] political leaders. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people'

‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders (of the UK). What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually.’

Mr Cameron has enraged the commission with his proposals to stop migrants from EU states claiming child benefit for children living in their home country.

Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said instead of 'populism' the Eurocrat should have used the word 'democracy'

The Government has also floated broader proposals to rein in EU free movement rules, a sacred cow for Eurocrats.

Earlier this week Mrs Reding, who is vice-president of the EC, called for the EU to become a ‘United States of Europe’ with the Commission as its government.

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘When Mrs Reding says ‘populism’, what she means is ‘politicians doing what their constituents want’, or as we call it in English, ‘democracy’.

‘The EU’s problem is not its people, but the unelected paleo-federalists like Mrs Reding with their 1950s visions of a European superstate.’

Tory backbencher Mark Reckless said he was ‘very surprised’ by the comments.

The MP for Rochester and Strood told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was the EU which was ‘stoking up’ the row and that the Government’s approach had been ‘quite moderate’.

‘People in this country get social security benefit, but they spend it here, but very often people coming from Poland - and perhaps now from Romania and Bulgaria - are sending money home. I think it’s quite wrong that if a child is being schooled in Poland and with family there that they should be paid child benefit by the taxpayers of this country.’

He said the PM should be ‘much more assertive’ in its dealings with the EU.

A government spokesman said: ‘Hardworking people expect and deserve a benefits system that is fair to British citizens and migrants who come here to work but is robust and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.’
