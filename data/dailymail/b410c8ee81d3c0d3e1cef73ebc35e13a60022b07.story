Amina Bibi's husband has been charged with her murder after she was found stabbed to death last Friday

The husband of a woman found stabbed to death by her 11-year-old son has been charged with her murder.

Mohamed Ali, 64, from Forest Gate, east London, will appear in magistrates court on Friday charged with the murder of Amina Bibi, 43.

Frederick Best, 46,  was also charged with the murder which happened last Friday

The mother-of-two was tragically found lying in a pool of her own blood by her son who had returned to pick up some homework he had forgotten. Her other son is five years old

It is though the boy may have disturbed the killers in the act by ringing the doorbell just after 9am.

After making the grim discovery the frantic child ran to a nearby house pleading 'help my mum, help my mum'.

Neighbour Jamal Omar, 41, said the boy came knocking on his door, screaming for help, moments after he let him into the block of flat via the intercom system.

The father-of-two said: 'He came banging on my door, shouting for help. When I opened the door he said "help my mum. I don’t know what’s wrong with her".

Crime scene: Mrs Bibi was found dead at her home in Forest Gate, east London, on Friday morning

'I went next door with him and saw Amina lying face down on the floor, covered in blood.

'I rang 999 and they told me to revive her but it was too late for me to do anything.'

A postmortem examination revealed Mrs Bibi died of multiple stab wounds.

Mr Omar added: 'She was a lovely woman. The family have lived here at long as we have, we’ve known each other for 10 years.

'It’s such a terrible thing. They are a good family, nobody deserves this.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
