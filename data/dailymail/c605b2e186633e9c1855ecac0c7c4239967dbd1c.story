A child has been taken to hospital after cowpats in a park caused an E. Coli outbreak.

Seven people, including five children under eight, have been infected with E. coli O157 from the same park in Birmingham in recent weeks.

The Health Protection Agency said the likely cause was cowpats and rabbit droppings.

A child who contracted E. Coli from cowpats in a field in Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield, has been discharged from hospital and is making a recovery

The child has since been discharged from hospital and is making a recovery.

The HPA said the strain of the bacteria was often associated with contact with rural environments that may have been contaminated by animal faeces.

Sutton Park, in Sutton Coldfield, covers around 2,400 acres and is thought to attract around two million visitors annually.

Cows are free to roam around the park - sharing space with the public.

Designated a National Nature Reserve, the former royal deer park is included in English Heritage's list of historic parks and gardens, and includes sites of archaeological interest.

Signs have been put up around the park to warn visitors of the risk of contracting E. coli O157 from s cowpats and rabbit droppings

HPA's Dr Roger Gajraj said: "E. coli O157 can be very serious in young children and can in some instances cause kidney failure.

"The council is increasing hand-washing facilities at the park and the city council and HPA are issuing leaflets and displaying posters to warn visitors of the risks and advise on preventative measures.

"However to minimise the risk of infection parents may want to consider taking very young children to other parks in the local area.

"The best protection against E. coli is to always wash your hands, especially after contact with animals, after going to the toilet and immediately before eating.

"I would also advise cyclists and walkers to wash their tyres, footwear and their hands after visiting Sutton Park as an extra precaution.

"If hand-washing facilities are not immediately available, alcohol-based hand wipes can provide some limited protection but they don't work or give adequate protection when hands are already soiled."

Darren Share, Birmingham City Council's head of parks said: "We are working closely with the HPA to control this outbreak and we have already taken a number of measures.

"But as the infection can be particularly serious for young children we feel it is appropriate at this stage to warn parents and families of the potential risks.

"There are signs throughout the park informing visitors of the outbreak and the steps they can take to protect themselves."
