More than half of women in Britain are still working when they reach the age of 60, new figures have revealed.

According to official statistics, the number of women forced to carry on working into their sixties has risen sharply over the past decade.

In 1993 only 35.1 per cent of women had a job when they reached the age of 60, but just twenty years later this has jumped to 51.5 per cent.

The figures, from the Office for 
National Statistics, highlight the crippling impact of the rising 
pension age on a generation of women who are having to wait longer than 
ever before they can retire.

Women
used to be able to get their state pension from the age of 60. At the 
moment they can claim the money at the age of 61 and nine months. 
However this is set to rise to 65 in 2018, 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028.

With no state pension to replace their income, many simply have ‘no choice’ but to keep on working, experts claim.

They
said the problem has been exacerbated by rock-bottom savings rates and 
poor company pensions as well as the additional burden of grown-up 
offspring who can struggle to get by without financial support.

While some women are keen to work, enjoying the social interaction and the intellectual stimulation as well as the money, experts insisted yesterday that many would choose to retire if they felt that was a viable option.

Neil Duncan-Jordan, from the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Of course there will be individuals who have exciting, interesting jobs which they feel able to keep on doing for years and years.

Outrage: George Osborne caused fury at a conference earlier this year after celebrating the enormous savings he had made from the Pensions Bill

‘But for the vast majority of women, they have no choice but to keep working because their pensions are so poor and the Government is increasing the state pension age. Women have been treated extremely badly.’

The ONS figures show sharp increases among employment rates for all women in their sixties.

For 61-year-old women, the percentage working has jumped from 28 per cent to 43 per cent since 1993, with similar increases among older women.

Under Labour’s old timetable the state pension age was due to increase to 67 between 2034 and 2036. But the Coalition has moved this to between 2026 and 2028 – a hugely lucrative decision.

This measure alone will save the country ‘approximately £71billion,’ according to official estimates in the Pensions Bill.

At a conference in London earlier this year, George Osborne triggered fury after celebrating the ‘absolutely enormous savings’ from the controversial policy.

He said: ‘The savings dwarf almost everything else you do. They are absolutely enormous savings.’ The Chancellor added: ‘I found it actually one of the less controversial things we have done, and yet it probably has saved more money than anything else we have done.’

Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK, said: ‘People are living longer and generally in better health, so many are likely to want and be able to carry on working.

‘However rock-bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they cannot afford to retire.’ While the number of workers in Britain has reached a record high of nearly 30million, it is largely pensioners who are fuelling the boom.

Since 2008, the number of people between the age of 16 and 64 has jumped by 673,000, but those who actually have a job fell by 76,000.

Meanwhile the number of people aged 65 and over who are working has rocketed over the last five years. Between April and June 2008, 695,000 so-called ‘grey workers’ had a job. Today there are more than one million workers in this age group.

This is partly down to the Government’s decision to scrap the default retirement age, which has meant bosses can no longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached the age of 65.

As a result, more and more people are deciding to work into their late sixties and seventies – with many saying they simply cannot afford to retire due to a lack of money.

Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘We took action so older people were no longer discriminated against by abolishing the default retirement age. There are now more older women in work, despite difficult economic conditions.’

Men are squeezed out by rise of the working mum

Jill Kirby, author of The Price of Parenthood said the pressure on working mothers is increasing

The percentage of British men who work has collapsed over the last 40 years, while the number of working women has rocketed, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday.

The figures highlight an extraordinary social change which has been fuelled by the ballooning number of working mothers. While the majority used to stay at home with their children, many now choose to work – or are forced to for financial reasons.

In 1971, 92 per cent of men between the age of 16 and 64 had a job. Today just 76 per cent of men in this age group are working. But the percentage of women in work has jumped from 53 to 67 per cent over the last 42 years.

In fact nearly three-quarters of mothers who are married or living with a partner have a job, compared to only two-thirds in 1996 – a sign of rapid social change, according to the ONS.

At present, there are 15.3million working men and 13.5million working women, but experts predict the number of working women will overtake working men within 15 years.

Family expert Jill Kirby, author of The Price of Parenthood, said: ‘The pressure continues to increase for mothers to work. Yet we know from studies and surveys that mothers would like to have more time for their families.’

Lynne Burnham, from campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘For mothers to be at home, to forego the second income, is a choice fewer families can afford to make. It is coming to be seen as the privilege of a rich elite.’
