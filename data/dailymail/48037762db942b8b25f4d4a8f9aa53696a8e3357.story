Feared dead: The Biggest Loser fitness trainer Angie Dowds battled personal demons

'Angie is someone I have always had huge respect for in terms of her drive to succeed, her competitive streak and because of her willingness to want to help people change their lives.

'Her career has always been one of forging her own path.

'As an individual Angie was always fiercely loyal to her friends and that same passion with which she loved was also the same passion that made her such a successful trainer, mentor and inspiration.'

'What I will remember and miss the most were the times outside of filming where we simply spoke about anything and everything with no holds barred and only the convictions of our beliefs.

'She will be deeply missed.'Paddy Cunningham, Biggest Loser contestant and friend of Ms Dowds, said he felt he had lost a sister.

He said: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Angie's friends and family at this difficult time.

'Personally I feel such a sense of loss, as though I have lost a beautiful, powerful and sincerely loving older sister.'

'Angie, you will forever live in my heart, soul and mind. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me.'

Canadian-born Ms Dowds, who moved to 
the UK when she was four, has appeared on the slimming challenge 
programme since 2005.

She discovered drink and drugs after having moved to Wales when her mother remarried, said The Sun.

By the time she was 13, she was taking drugs and drinking, she revealed, and at the age of 15 she moved to London.

'I was a victim and I had every reason in the world to be,' Ms Dowds would later say.

The Biggest Loser, based on the hit 
U.S. series of the same name, sees competitors battle to lose the most 
weight over eight weeks in a bid to clinch a Â£25,000 prize.

It was first screened on Living TV in 2005 before moving in its third year to ITV. The fifth series is due to air next year.

Witnesses say they saw a woman fall to her death from Beachy Head in East Sussex

A spokesman for The Biggest Loser programme said: 'Everybody at The Biggest Loser is shocked and devastated by the news of Angie's death.

'Angie was a dedicated trainer and a part of the show for four series and our thoughts and prayers go to her family and friends at this time.'

A spokesman for Ms Dowds' agency, London-based Independent Talent, said tonight: 'We were devastated to hear the news of Angie's death.

'She touched and inspired many people, but she had battled for many years with her own personal demons.

'On Sunday she lost that battle. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this terribly sad time.'

But since being recognised as 
Personal Trainer of the Year at the International Fitness showcase 
Awards after she began on the show, she said: 'Getting industry 
recognition felt fantastic. Ten years ago I said to myself, "I want to 
be the best at whatever it is I end up doing". I've always had that 
inside me."

In February, Angie was temporarily 
axed from The Biggest Loser after she had told her team of dieters to 
cheat by going on an extreme diet of just nuts and apples.

Ms Dowds blamed it on her 'competitiveness', and she was allowed to return for the final episode, hosted by Davina McCall.

The fitness trainer and Ms Preece, 37, moved in together in 2003 and got engaged in 2006.

In an interview that year, Ms Dowds said: 'I got her a bigger diamond - how romantic am I?

'I was only two years sober and I'd only just learned to take care of myself.

'It was terrifying, but it helped me develop a stronger sense of myself.'

In the interview with Diva magazine, she added: 'Never give up. I try to live by that motto. I very nearly did once. I really hope I never do again.'
