One of the favourites to win The Voice has become the victim of racist internet trolls.

The BBC called in police to investigate after Ruth Brown, 20, received a
deluge of vile remarks on Twitter targeting her skin colour, appearance
and weight.

The singer said she sobbed when she read the comments. Some users even 
made derogatory remarks about her father, Lloyd, who died of stomach 
cancer days before she auditioned for the show.

But after the BBC reported the comments to the Metropolitan Police, Miss Brown decided to fight back.

She has now spoken out about the growing problem of online bullying and 
racism. ‘Not only have I endured jibes of a racist nature but sick 
comments about my weight,’ she said in an interview yesterday.

‘Things have been said about my dad, too. At first, I was upset and cried my heart out. But I want to speak out because I hope it will encourage other people to fight back against bullies.’

She also defiantly reposted some of the hateful remarks on her own 
account to bring attention to the trolls, but the BBC has since asked 
her to take them down. They have been recorded as evidence.

Defiant: Ruth said at first, she cried her heart out, but then she decided to speak out about it, 'to encourage other people to fight out against the bullies'

Some are from serial trolls, who seem to enjoy targeting horrific comments at those in the public eye.

One Twitter user, called Jay Smith, wrote: ‘u ugly ******g black 
.....b****,’ while another, Rizwan Ali, posted: ‘u are a fat ugly 
******. Your dad must think what monster did I give birth to haha.’

Other trolls joined in, branding her ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’. But scores of 
other social networking users offered the singer their support and 
condemned the abuse.

Writing on her Twitter account, Miss Brown said: ‘I am not gonna lie 
those comments did hurt but I’m getting my dream and have amazing 
support thank you all.’

The BBC has also provided the aspiring star with a counsellor. Miss 
Brown, whose voice has been compared to Aretha Franklin’s, is mentored 
by Sir Tom Jones.

She added: ‘I do think it is wrong that people can bully others while 
hiding behind their computer screens.

'I am glad the police are involved
but for other people who perhaps do not have such strong support 
networks, the effects will be much more severe and traumatic.’

Internet trolls believe that by hiding behind anonymity they can write 
whatever they want.

But their internet service providers can easily 
access their details, which can then be passed on to police as part of a
criminal investigation.

Miss Brown is one of the favourites to win the competition. On last 
weekend’s show she sailed through to the next round with her powerful 
rendition of Oleta Adams’s Get Here (If You Can).

Her case comes only two months after a student was jailed for posting 
offensive comments on Twitter about the collapse of Bolton Wanderers 
footballer Fabrice Muamba in the middle of a match.

Liam Stacey was arrested after other Twitter users – including the 
former England striker Stan  Collymore – reported his tweets to police.

The 21-year-old pleaded guilty to the Racially Aggravated s4A of the 
Public Order Act 1986 and was sentenced to 56 days in prison.

He posted his comments shortly after Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest 
during his team’s FA Cup quarter-final tie against Tottenham Hotspur.

Stacey later said he had been drunk and bitterly regretted his actions.

And police in North Wales made a number of arrests last month after 
Twitter users identified and insulted a teenager who was raped by 
Sheffield United and Wales football player Ched Evans.
