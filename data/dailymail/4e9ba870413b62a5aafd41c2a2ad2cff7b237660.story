Leeds' sporting director Nicola Salerno has resigned, the club's disqualified owner Massimo Cellino is reported to have confirmed.

The 58-year-old Italian's departure comes six days after Leeds' assistant head coach Steve Thompson was suspended.

Cellino, banned from having any executive influence at Elland Road until May 4 due to a tax conviction in Italy, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'He resigned. I'm not there so I don't know why.

'I wanted him to stay and speak about it first when I got back to Leeds but he made the decision. This is the situation.'

Salerno, who worked with Cellino at his previous club Cagliari, has been reported in Italy to be lined up to become sporting director at Serie A club Palermo.

He arrived at Elland Road last summer following the completion of Cellino's club takeover in March last year.

When Leeds were contacted they were unable to comment on the matter.

It is understood Salerno was responsible for the departure of Thompson, who joined Leeds as head coach Neil Redfearn's assistant in December.

Thompson has made no comment since his suspension and is currently consulting with the League Managers' Association.
