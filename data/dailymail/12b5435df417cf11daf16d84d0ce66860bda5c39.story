Two people have died and thousands of people are without electricity and access to roads after heavy rain flooded the French Riviera.

The administration for the Var region evacuated some residents and urged others to stay indoors until the waters recede. 

It said a 73-year-old man was killed in his basement and another man died when his car was washed away by the floods.

Dozens of roads were closed across the region, which includes resort towns such as Saint-Tropez and and villages in Provence.

Up to eight inches of rain were recorded over the weekend in some areas and rivers and streams that feed the Mediterranean flowed into residential areas. 

The prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault visited the region today to assess the damage.

The area, which includes resort towns such as Saint-Tropez and villages in Provence, lies on the stretch of the Mediterranean coast known as the Riviera which is popular with tourists.
