He achieved notoriety as a 10-year-old when he became the youngest person in Britain to be served an Asbo.

But any hope the sanction had helped Robert Heneghan turn his life around were badly misplaced.

The 19-year-old, once labelled the Imp of Satan, was last night starting a life sentence for murder after stabbing a teenager to death at a birthday party.

Sam Bee was stabbed to death after he intervened as a peacekeeper during a row at his sister's birthday party

Sam Bee, also 19, a factory worker, 
had tried to act as peacemaker and calm Heneghan when he became involved
in a fight with another youth.

But Heneghan turned on the teenager 
and, with an ‘evil smirk’ on his face, plunged a knife into his chest 
causing fatal injuries.

Mr Bee staggered away from the house 
unaware of the seriousness of his injury and collapsed and died in a 
back yard of a nearby hotel.

His terminally ill mother Sue Thompson died just days later without being told her son had been stabbed to death.

Heneghan, who pleaded not guilty to murder, was convicted by a jury following a trial at  Preston Crown Court.

Mr Justice Andrew Leggatt told him: 
‘Sam Bee had done you no harm. He hadn’t threatened or attacked you, he 
did nothing to provoke you. He made light of the fact that you had got 
into a fight with your friend.

‘You were angry with him for that 
because your pride had been hurt.

Under the influence of drink, you have
proved yourself to be a serious danger to the public.’

Sam Bee was found in an alleyway between Dean Street and Station Road in Blackpool in August last year

It emerged Heneghan had been sentenced
to youth custody in 2009 when he was 16 after he knifed a man in the 
chest. That victim survived.

His criminal career started before his 10th birthday when he began terrorising his local housing estate in Bispham, Blackpool.

He was arrested up to three times a 
week for a variety of offences including threatening two women at a 
tanning salon with a ball-bearing gun.

With an accomplice, he stripped a 
nine-year-old boy and forced him to run home naked. In other incidents a
charity shop was set on fire, children were threatened with a knife, 
and a faeces-covered football was tossed into a supermarket.

At a court case in Blackpool in 2004, 
police attributed 43 anti-social incidents over a six-month period to 
Heneghan and an 11-year-old friend.

After the case, one resident said: 
‘It may sound like something out of the Dark Ages, but I would describe 
those two as imps of Satan. They have made our lives an absolute 
misery.’

Victim: Sam Bee, 19, was knifed to death at his sister's birthday party by Heneghan as he stood in the kitchen

Eventually both were served with 
seven-year Asbos after a court heard how they burgled houses, stole 
jewellery, threw water bombs and paint at people, cars and property.

Heneghan’s life of crime came to a 
tragic climax last August after Sam Bee went to a party thrown by his 
sister to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday.

Heneghan got into a fight and received
a cut above his eye but Mr Bee stepped in as a peacemaker. His sister 
Sarah, 21, told the court: ‘Heneghan sort of looked at Sam with a bit of
a smirk on his face. He calmly walked into the kitchen and he just 
stabbed him. Sam was just stood there doing nothing.’

Fatal: The alleyway where Sam Bee collapsed and died after fleeing the house party

She bundled her brother out of the 
door to protect him, not realising  he was badly injured. By the time 
news filtered through he had died, Heneghan was at another house. He 
told a friend: ‘I should have punched him instead.’

Heneghan  told the court there was 
only a bit of blood on the knife and he thought it had just grazed the 
teenager.

He said: ‘I ended up picking up this thing and swinging out 
with my arm. It was a knife. I felt it hit him but I didn’t know where 
or how deep.’

Outside court Detective Superintendent Paul Withers said: 
‘This case highlights the most serious consequences of carrying a knife.
I would urge anyone who picks up a knife in anger to consider the 
consequences.’
