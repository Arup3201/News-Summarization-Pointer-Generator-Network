Scientists claim they have discovered how birds find their way across thousands of miles of land guided by the earth's magnetic field.

It seems beneath the feathers they are equipped with an internal navigation system similar to the gadgets used by comic superhero Iron Man.

Sensory neurons called hair cells are found inside the ears and they are responsible for detecting sound and gravity.

To the surprise of Austrian and Australian scientists each cell has a single iron ball, which is up to 2,000 times small than the width of a human hair, in the same place as every cell.

The researchers believe that the iron responds much like a compass - known as magnetoreceptors - to help birds know whether they are flying north or south, the position of 
the sun and visual maps to help them find their way.

Hair cells are also involved in hearing 
and balance in most animals, so the researchers believe the iron may 
help the birds 'sense' the magnetic field, reports the Daily Telegraph.

PhD student Mattias Lauwers, from the Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, said: 'It's very exciting.

Research: The image shows cells from the inner ear of pigeons stained with a chemical that turns iron bright blue in colour. It highlights the balls of iron discovered by the Keays lab. Each one lies directly beneath the hairs and there is just one per cell

'We find these iron balls in every bird, whether it's a pigeon or an ostrich, but not in humans.'

But IMP group leader Dr
David Keays told the paper: 'We're a long way off 
understanding how magnetic sensing works - we still don't know what 
these mysterious iron balls are doing.

'Who knows? Perhaps they are the elusive magnetoreceptors. Only time will tell.'

Dr Keays examined zebra finches, ducks, chickens, ostriches and budgerigars and 
found iron spheres in hair cells in each of their inner ears. Each cell contained just iron 
ball.

But they could not find any iron granules in the hair cells of mammals like 
mice, guinea pigs, humans and even fish.

For decades experts have been puzzled 
how birds migrate a mass movement along a 'flyway' between wintering and
breeding grounds, thousands of miles in formation, often returning to the same location and even the 
same nest year after year.

Arctic Terns fly 44,000 miles per year when they travel from their 
breeding grounds to their feeding grounds in the Antarctic.

Sooty Shearwaters fly up to 40,000 
miles each year from their home in the 
Falkland Islands to the Arctic where they feed in the summer.

British birds, including sparrows
and cuckoos migrate south for the winter, travelling hundreds of miles 
over the Sahara desert.

The latest study published in the online version of Current Biology, builds on previous work by the Keays lab at IMP and the University of Western Australia's Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA).

Last year the collaboration showed that iron-rich cells in the beak of pigeons - previously believed to be the magnetic sensors - were just blood cells.

CMCA research associate Dr Jeremy Shaw, who has studied iron in a range of animals from molluscs to humans, said it was an astonishing finding.

Dr Shaw said: 'Despite decades of research, these conspicuous balls of iron had never been observed previously.

'Nature keeps surprising us with the various ways iron can be utilised by animals."

The scientists are now planning to investigate if the iron spheres react when moving through a magnetic field.
