A father-of-two is slowly turning into a ‘living statue’ after developing the extremely rare Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS).

Former chef Robert McKechnie, 55, first fell ill with flu-like symptoms two years ago and despite dozens of tests, X-rays and scans, doctors were baffled.

But after pain and stiffness spread to his face, arms and legs, he was finally diagnosed with the neurological disorder last month.

Robert McKechnie, 55, has Stiff Person Syndrome which means his muscles are becoming progressively stiffer. He currently needs crutches to get around and fears he will soon have to use a wheelchair

It is thought to affect less than one in a million people.

From walking with a stick in November 2012, Mr McKechnie moved onto crutches in January this year and he expects to be in a wheelchair by the end of the year.

There is no known cure for SPS, which causes progressively severe muscle stiffness.

Experts believe the disease is caused by abnormal antibodies which cause an autoimmune reaction.

Mr McKechnie now takes 11 different types of pill four times a day and will next month undergo a plasma exchange in a bid to ‘wash out’ the problematic antibodies.

Mr McKechnie, of Paisley, in Renfrewshire, Scotland, said: ‘I’m very worried about the future because I don’t know how this disease is going to affect me.

Mr McKechnie thought he had flu when he first developed the condition but within just a few months he required a walking stick. He now has to take 11 different medications four times a day

Mr McKechnie (pictured in 2008 with his grandson, Conor Good, before his illness) is no longer able to work and is afraid of falling over and breaking an arm or hitting his head

‘I used to be very active. I walked everywhere. Now if I walk to the shops and back, which is about 200 metres, that’s me finished for the whole day.

‘I can’t work. I used to be a chef and I’ve worked in B&Q. In both jobs I was always on my feet.

Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare disease of the nervous syndrome.

It causes progressively severe muscle stiffness - typically in the spine and lower extremities.

It often begins very subtly during a period of emotional stress.

Most patients also experience painful muscle spasms that are triggered by stimuli such as a sudden noise or emotional stress.

There is thought to be an auto-immune component and many patients also have other auto-immune conditions.

Symptoms usually develop in the mid-40s.

SPS is extremely rare and is thought to occur in fewer than one person per million.

It is more common in women than in men and is linked to diabetes.

There is no cure but medications can be taken to relief muscle spasms.

In extreme cases, the condition can be fatal if it paralyses the respiratory muscles.

Sufferers also often fall over and can suffer severe injuries as a result.

In most cases, however, symptoms can usually be well managed with medication.

‘But I’m starting to fall over now. I 
get up and my feet and legs feel numb and I can’t walk. I’m worried that
 I’m going to fall and hit my head.

‘I stand up from my chair and I can feel all the muscles tighten in my legs.

‘Recently I’ve started dropping things, like cups of tea. My left hand goes numb. It’s very worrying.’

Mr McKechnie suffers numbness on the left hand side of his face, his left hand and both legs. Nights are especially painful as he gets ‘dead legs’ and excruciating foot and leg cramps.

He first became ill in July 2012 and thought it was just a flu bug but by November he was walking with a stick.

Walking became increasingly painful for him and this January he was given crutches, but finds them painful to use and is worried that he will fall and break an arm.

Now he is coming to terms with the prospect of being in a wheelchair by the end of the year.

He said: ‘There’s no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it’s only going to get worse.

‘I used to be so active. I loved running and playing football, but now I am looking at getting around in a wheelchair.

‘It’s terrible. I try to stay positive but it’s difficult because Stiff Person Syndrome is so rare and there doesn’t seem to be any chance of a cure any time soon.’

Professor Hugh Willison, Professor of Neurology at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘Stiff Person Syndrome is a very rare disease. It’s not a condition that neurologists come across very often.

Mr McKechnie (pictured with his daughter, Evette Good, in 2009 - before his illness) said: 'There's no cure and if the last year or so is anything to go by it's only going to get worse'

‘Because of its rarity, it can be extremely difficult to diagnose and there can be a considerable delay between the display of symptoms and its diagnosis.’

He said SPS is caused by the malfunction of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, which lead to uncontrollable nerve activity, causing muscle spasms.

Professor Willison added: ‘In its most severe form, the symptoms that can occur in SPS can be so severe that the individual is completely incapacitated.

‘In the most extreme manifestation, the person can go as rigid as a block of wood and that can affect movement and things like breathing and eating.’
