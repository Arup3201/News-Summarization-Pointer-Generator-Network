More than 36million items of rubbish have been detected across Britain's coast in two decades.

That equates to roughly 3,200 pieces every mile over 20 years.

In that time, the amount of plastic litter washing up on the shore has more than doubled.

Litter collected included antique items such as a sea-themed glass bottle in Wales valued at £250-£350

However, some treasure has been found among the rubbish, including an antique sea-themed glass bottle in Wales valued at £250-£350.

The rich pickings also include a Victorian tea strainer worth £650, found by a group of volunteers at Greenwich Pier.

And a variety of 16th Century clay tobacco pipes valued between £35-£150 were found in the Thames. 

Each year, the Barefoot Wine project runs clean-ups at 14 locations in partnership with Surfers Against Sewage. 

Those still to be carried out in 2014 will be held in Grimsby, Saltburn, Southport, Cumbria and Cardiff. 

And they warn it also brings huge risks for the local wildlife.

Over 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and a million sea birds die from eating or becoming entangled in plastics.

It's not all doom and gloom, though.

Yona Ellis, marketing manager of the Barefoot Wine Beach Rescue Project, said, 'We're shocked and amazed with the findings and can't wait to see what our volunteers continue to find at our remaining beach cleans.

'Little did we know that eight years ago the British beaches were littered with treasure - it's fascinating!

Hugo Tagholm, Surfers Against Sewage Chief Executive, collaborates with Barefoot Wine tackle marine litter by encouraging local communities to keep their beaches barefoot friendly.

He said: 'Unfortunately marine litter causes long-term problems for our beaches, and the very special wildlife that lives in our oceans which is why projects such as this are so important.'
