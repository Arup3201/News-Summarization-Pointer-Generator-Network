It is the craze that has sweeped the nation, but two British scientists have taken the ice bucket challenge a step further after completing it in -20C temperatures near the South Pole.

Malcolm Airey, 27, from Glasgow, and Chris Walton, 43, from Weymouth, Dorset, completed the challenge in bold fashion by tipping freshly dug ice over themselves at the British Antarctic Survey.

The pair ignored the freezing conditions and donned shorts, sandals and T-shirts to take part in the challenge raising money for motor neurone disease charities.

They did have to dash back inside within seconds however to avoid exposure.

Research field assistant Mr Airey said he took part in the internet craze after keeping up to date with it online.

He said: 'During the winter months it is important to keep in touch with home.

'We don't see anyone else between March and October and one way of staying connected with the outside world is by checking the internet and social media sites.

'That's how we learned of the latest craze for being soaked in ice cold water as a way of raising awareness of motor neurone disease.

'Being surrounded by ice, we thought we too would support this effort by taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge.'

The pair's video sees them digging ice with a large shovel before pouring buckets of freezing cold water over the heads.

The Rothera Research Station, which has been occupied since 1975, studies the movement of ice sheets, glacial retreat and ice coring for the study of atmospheric chemistry and climate.

The Ice Bucket Challenge, which raises money for motor neurone disease charities, has become an internet sensation over the last couple of weeks, with celebrities around the world taking it on.
