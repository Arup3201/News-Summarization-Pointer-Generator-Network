Why age gracefully when you can age with swagger? These portraits of 'gangsta grandparents' show exactly how it's done.

Inspired by pictures of her aunt's teenage years in the 1960s, photographer Linda Dajana Krüger (who also goes by Dai Lyn Power) wanted to capture how the hipper members of Generation Y would look in their dotage, according to XXIV magazine.

Her photo series for VICE Germany, entitled 'Our Generation', captures a gaggle of oldies dressed in iconic streetwear worn by the young adults of today.

Krüger's models, recruited from a German retirement home, are styled in clothing and accessories belonging to her and her friends. They're decked out in the standard uniform of today's more street-conscious hipster: snapback caps and beanies, hoodies and denim jackets.

One sports a T-shirt emblazoned with the HUF-weed logo, another totes a metallic fuschia backpack, a couple wear nerd glasses (although, these could very well be 'model's own').

Ensuring the aesthetic is resolutely anchored in the here and now, Krüger's octogeneraians hold electronic accessories like Macbooks  and iPhones.

To complete the look, Krüger got rid of (your grandmother's) pearls and adorned the models with tons of gold bling. It's pretty evocative of pioneering Eighties rap group Run-DMC - heavy gold chains were part of their signature look.

There are a couple of other references to hip hop - one model wears a T-shirt featuring Los Angeles rapper Ice Cube; several throw gangsta hand-signs. It all just goes to show that, these days, getting your swag on 'ain't nuthin' but a G thang', as Snoop Dogg famously once said. (Of course, here, 'G' stands for 'gran' and 'gramps'.)

Holla at your gran: Krüger accessorized her models with electronic gadgets like a MacBook and iPhone to place them firmly in the twenty-first century

Looking fly: Any Urban Outfitters-habitué would be jealous of this model's paint-spattered snapback, light denim jacket and metallic fuchsia backpack
