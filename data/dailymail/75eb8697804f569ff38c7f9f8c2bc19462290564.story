Everybody has their memories of the World Cup final of 2010 and not all of them are good.

English referee Howard Webb has since described it as one of the worst nights of his career and just this week Holland’s Wesley Sneijder described that sapping night in Johannesburg as the time he hit rock bottom.

It was that kind of game. Ugly, boring, disappointing.

Circle of life: Spain's players train before their match with Holland and they will hope to show tiki-taka isn't dead

For Spain, though, it signalled the scaling of the ultimate summit, as well as a vindication of a style of football born on the fields of Barcelona’s La Masia training ground and then moved forward by national team coach Vicente del Bosque.

Four years on and Spain arrived on Brazil’s north-east coast on Thursday banging the drum for the same principles. For the world champions there really is only one way to play. On Friday they face Holland again in the opening fixture of Group B hoping only to enhance their legacy.

Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the Arena Fonte Nova, Barcelona playmaker Xavi said: ‘Our philosophy is very clear. We want to dominate games by keeping possession.

‘We have had this philosophy for years and had great success. We are going to win or die with this style. We want to make  history again playing this way.’

One of the most attractive games of the opening stages — along with England against Italy and Germany versus Portugal — it is perhaps a shame that it has been cast as Group B’s opener.

Avoiding defeat will be uppermost in the minds of Del Bosque and Holland’s Louis van Gaal but the Spanish begin this World Cup knowing  that to everybody else at least they have a little something to prove.

Spain’s tiki-taka style often brings derision from those around the world incapable of playing it. Once again, many will be willing Spain to fail, perhaps taking heart from Barcelona’s struggles this season.

To Del Bosque, though, his team and their style is all that matters. The rest is just noise. ‘Barcelona is a football club in Spain,’ he said, when asked if Barca’s problems would have damaging consequences in Brazil.

‘The national squad is totally separate. Anyway, we have seen this year how Spanish club football is dominant.

‘There were two Spanish clubs in the Champions League final and another won the Europa League. We draw our players from these clubs but that’s where the relationship ends.’

While the Dutch squad has changed vastly from four years ago, Del Bosque still relies on Barcelona’s Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets.

Are we approaching the end of an era for Spanish football?

‘We hope that won’t happen,’ added Del Bosque. ‘We have an Under 21 squad that won the European Championship. We have 30 per cent new players in the squad compared to last time. I am not afraid of the future.’

Spain’s qualifying record was excellent, even if goals were at times hard to find, and he knows he won’t face a Dutch team with the same brutal approach as Bert van Marwijk’s players in 2010.

‘I can’t criticise them for that now,’ Del Bosque said. ‘Louis van Gaal has worked in Spain and I hold him in high regard.

‘He is a great manager and he has retained the essence of true Dutch football in this squad.’

Ugly, boring, disappointing: Let's hope this match is better than the 2010 World Cup final

Van Gaal has more history in Spain than some may realise. As well as managing Barcelona from 1997-2000 and 2002-2003, he was also responsible for the creation of La Masia and gave players such as Xavi their first experience of top-level football.

‘I have an extraordinary memory of him,’ recalled Xavi. ‘He was basically the first coach I ever had. I owe him and I am very fond of him.

‘He was just marvellous with me and he believed in me 100 per cent.’

On Friday night on the Brazilian coast, master meets pupils once again. Many believe they may be past their best. He certainly will not.

I’ve been waiting to see a top international team play with three at the back and I’m not surprised it’s the Dutch who are experimenting. It’s not an easy system but the squad has had time to work on it. It only works if the two wider men play like full backs. It’s up to Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij to move across and cover the shaded area (right) behind their flying wing backs.

Arjen Robben will almost play like a striker. Free of any defensive responsibility, he can terrorise the Spanish defence.

This game could  dictate the shape of the draw. The loser here is likely to face Brazil in the last 16. That might make for a short tournament.
