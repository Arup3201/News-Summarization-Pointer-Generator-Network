Maintenance staff began working Saturday to replace 40 feet of granite railing. 

Police say weather may have contributed to the incident as roads were slippery because of rain, but fortunately Mr Lopez was not injured.

City officials say this is the third time the bridge has been damaged in a vehicle-related incident. 

The bridge was bought by Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch 46 years ago, for $2,460,000 (£1,029,000).

McCulloch shipped about 30,000 tons of bridge to Arixona and had it rebuilt on dry land 

London Bridge had begun to sink due to the amount of people crossing it on foot, about one inch every eight years, so the City of London put it up for sale.

McCulloch shipped about 30,000 tons of bridge to Arixona and had it rebuilt on dry land.

Only once it had been erected were the sands dug up to allow the water to pass under it.

The bridge was completed in 1971 as part of a larger  tourist attraction called 'English Village', complete with a mock-Tudor mall.
