Southampton goalkeeper Artur Boruc is considering a move to Cagliari. 

The disgruntled Poland international has told Ronald Koeman he wants to leave after being displaced by the arrival of £10m Fraser Forster from Celtic.

Boruc, 36, is keen to play and Serie A Cagliari are willing to give him the chance.

The Italian club, meanwhile, are continuing talks with Leeds United over the proposed loan of Brazilian playmaker Adryan.

Leeds have also agreed a £600,000 deal with Aarhus for midfielder Casper Sloth.

Meanwhile, former Saints striker Rickie Lambert has slammed the ambition of Southampton’s owners for allowing ex-Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino to leave for Premier League rivals Tottenham. 

‘There’s obviously a reason why the gaffa went and that was the moment it became clear to the players what the ambition of the club was going to be,' Lambert told Fox Sports.
