Two teenagers have been arrested after a video emerged showing them chasing, punching and body-slamming a mentally challenged man as he screamed for mercy.

The boys, aged 13 and 14, were arrested by police in New Castle County, Delaware on Saturday, and authorities have said more arrests could be made, Fox29 reported.

The 86-second footage, which was posted to YouTube, shows a group of teenagers chasing the 26-year-old victim outside an apartment complex in Brookside Park as he shouts: 'Leave me alone!'

One boy swings at the man, repeatedly punching him, before picking him up and throwing him to the ground on at least two occasions.

Attack: The victim (in gray) can be seen trying to stop the youths from attacking him in the shocking footage

Violent: One of the boys picks the man up before throwing him to the ground. Others can be heard laughing

Hurt: The man, who can be heard groaning, had to be treated at hospital afterwards for injuries

The boys then crowd around the man - while one teenager who is filming the attack on his cellphone nears the man to get a closer shot as he writhes on the floor.

Later footage also reveals them continuing their attack in a wooded area, Fox29 reported. Again, they body slam him and throw him into some water as they can be heard laughing.

The victim can be heard crying, while a female voice says: 'You guys are so mean to him.' 

In another attack, as one of the group mocks the man, he can be heard saying: 'What did I do?' 

The man was taken to hospital and treated for injuries from the attack and later released.  

Cruel: As the group surround him, one of the teenagers (with the backpack) is more concerned about getting a close-up snap of the victim than helping him. Two teenagers have now been arrested

The man's family said they are sickened by the footage. They said he suffers from Williams syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.

The disorder leaves sufferers with an intellectual disability, heart defects, slight stature and distinctive facial features, including a flat nasal bridge. Sufferers are often extremely friendly.

'He's not doing too good,' his godmother Debra Jackson told CBS3. 'He's ashamed about it happening, he’s embarrassed.'

She added that the man had thought the teenagers were his friends.

Authorities said they believe the video, which was posted to YouTube before going viral on social media sites including Instagram and Twitter, appears to be several weeks old.

They are continuing to investigate the incident and expect more arrests to be made.

Concern: The victim's godmother and sister said that he is ashamed and thought the teens were his friends

The teenagers who were arrested have been charged with offensive touching, assault on a vulnerable adult and third-degree conspiracy, the Delaware News Journal reported. 

Both have been released on a $2,500 each and have been ordered to have no contact with the victim.

One of the teens who was in the video told CBS3 Eyewitness News that he helped file a report.

'The right thing to do was call the cops,' he said, without revealing his identity. 'If you beat up a mentally disabled person, you should be locked away for good.'
