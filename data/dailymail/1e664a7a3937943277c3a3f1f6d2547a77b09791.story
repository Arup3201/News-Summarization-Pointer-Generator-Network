A man dressed as Marvel anti-hero Deadpool got more than he bargained for when he was arrested by police in front of peak-hour commuters on a Sydney train.

Police wearing bulletproof vests boarded the Emu Plains to CBD train on Friday morning after a nervous traveller dialled triple-0 when Reuben Rose got on with what appeared to be an arsenal of weapons.

This included imitation guns strapped to his legs, bullet cartridges on his chest, grenades hanging from his waist and two samurai swords poking out of his duffel bag, The Daily Telegraph reported.

But Mr Rose was let go without being charged after police realised they were plastic replicas of weapons and he was dressed as Deadpool for a fundraising campaign dubbed Superhero Week.

The insurance consultant was raising money for Westmead Children's Hospital's Bear Cottage at Manly.

Mr Rose said he was trying to inspire workmates at St Leonards to donate to the cause by donning the costume.

He took to social media to documented his arrest.

'[And] now I've been pulled off the train. By police,' he wrote on Facebook.

He added as a joke: 'Someone on the train was convinced I was a terrorist in a unitard.'

When police let Mr Rose off the hook, they took measures to make sure this would not happen again on his return trip home.

'They let me go but told me to call the police line before I leave work so that they don't respond if someone calls on the home journey,' Mr Rose posted.

A New South Wales police spokeswoman confirmed a report had been received about the incident.

At 7.20am, while the train was pulling into Blacktown station, passengers had concerns about a man wearing a costume with a number of weapons and other paraphernalia.

After police arrived they found out the weapons and other paraphernalia were in fact toys.

The man was asked by police to put the weapons in a bag to avoid any further confusion from passengers, the spokeswoman said.
