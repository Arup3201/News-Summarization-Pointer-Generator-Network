In training: Terrance Ganaway earns $390,000 a year as a running back for the St. Louis Rams

Most professional footballers while away the off-season lounging by a pool, taking luxury holidays or topping up their ample paychecks by endorsing big-brand products on television.

But one NFL player has cast aside such trappings of the modern-day game - and swapped his helmet for a hairnet to moonlight as a $7.50-an-hour dogsbody in a sandwich shop.

St. Louis Rams running back Terrance Ganaway, who earns the minimum rookie salary of $390,000, fills subs, wipes tables and sweeps the floors at Jimmy John's in Waco, Texas.

'I'm on the line that makes the 
sandwiches,' he told the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch. 'I bake bread, take the cashier spot.

'I had to sweep the other day. Clean the tables. I 
mean all types of stuff. Slice the meat. Wrap the meat.'

He says he took the unlikely three-nights-a-week part-time job after joking on Twitter that he had too much free time and wanted a pastime to keep him busy.

But one enterprising restaurant manager of the fast-food chain called his bluff and offered him a job - which Ganaway gratefully accepted.

'I just wanted to stay fit, stay out of trouble and really just try to save money and not spend a lot of money,' Ganaway told the newspaper.

But the player, who played just three games for the Rams last season, said he was surprised by all the attention his new job has got him.

'Never intended for the story to grow. I am grateful for platform that 
God has provided. Truly honored that so many respect my work ethic,' he tweeted on Friday.

Married Ganaway doesn’t have any 
children, but he jokes that when he does, he’ll tell them he once worked
 two jobs to get them through school.

According to the St. Louis Dispatch, Baylor fans love unexpectedly meeting Ganaway, but not every snack-seeking fan recognises him.

'You know, I’m in uniform,' Ganaway said. 'I’ve got an apron on, with a visor. I’ve got gloves. So unless I recognize somebody and I say, "Hey, what’s up man?" They look at me kind of weird and say: ‘Why are you working at Jimmy John’s?’

The Twittersphere was filled with praise for the committed Christian's work ethic.

Pay day: On Saturday Ganaway tweeted a picture of his first Jimmy John's paycheck

'Reminds me of the old days when most 
NFL players held other jobs in the offseason,' tweeted Denver CBS4 
sports anchor Vic Lombardi.

Stacey Pressman simply said: 'Good for him!', while Josh Abott tweeted: 'Keep it real!'

Drew Mills tweeted a pic of his sub and said: 'Terrance Ganaway made this sandwich. Awesome!'

But he said he has no plans to hang up his gridiron for a pair of rubber gloves just yet.

'My number one job is being an NFL player,' he said. 'So don't get it confused as to me working at Jimmy John's has me lazy... I know what I have to do.

'I know how to get in shape and I know what it takes to perform at a high level. Really, Jimmy John's is just to keep me out of trouble in all the down time we have in the off-season.'

Ganaway played for the University of Houston as a freshman in 2007. He transferred to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, before the 2008 season, where he played until 2011. As a senior he was a starter and rushed for 1,547 yards with 21 touchdowns.

The New York Jets drafted Ganaway using their sixth round selection in the 2012 NFL draft and Ganaway signed a four year contract with the team in May. He was waived in August and picked up by the Rams.

Ganaway's uncle is former NFL linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, the former Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Redskins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker. He is married to the former Jenny Barroso - a graduate student in chemistry he met at Baylor.
