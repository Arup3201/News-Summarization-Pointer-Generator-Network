Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux was taken to hospital after being unseated during the post parade and getting kicked in the chest before a race at Santa Anita on Sunday.

The 42-year-old rider had three wins on Sunday's card before the incident ahead of the eighth race.

Desormeaux was aboard two-year-old filly She's a Big Winner, who was entered in her first race, when she reared and unseated him.
