A thirteen-year-old burglar ransacked a disabled woman's house - killing her pet fish, decapitating her dolls and damaging her wheelchair - a court has heard.

The boy, who cannot be named, even smirked while being interviewed by the police about the attack at the home of cerebral palsy sufferer Maria Hill in Cheltenham.

Now aged 14, the youngster was
sentenced to 12 months detention and training by magistrates last month
- but today appealed against his sentence at Gloucester Crown Court.

Ms Hill, 33, has been left feeling 'petrified' of continuing to live alone, Gloucester crown court heard. The boy asked the crown court to consider freeing him with a supervision and rehabilitation order.

But Recorder Nigel Pascoe QC dismissed the appeal, telling the boy his crime as 'so terrible and so cruel that what you did is more important than the remorse you have since shown and the alternative which is put before the court.'

Mr Pascoe said the court did not think magistrates were wrong to impose the sentence they did.

'While we accept you have shown remorse for your behaviour in the letter you have written to us and in the reports on you we have no doubt the sentence was justified.'

Errina Foley-Fisher, prosecuting, said Ms Hill left her home in Cakebridge Road, Cheltenham, on December 22 to go to stay with her mother in Cirencester for Christmas.

'The details of what happened are quite disturbing,' she said. 'The defendant smashed an upstairs bedroom window to get in. In that bedroom a mattress was turned upside down, a three foot pine cabinet was thrown to the floor and broken.

'The destruction continued into her own bedroom. Every drawer was opened. Her clothes were thrown around. The wires of her electric disability duvet were cut. Presents of geisha dolls from her mother from her trips to Japan were decapitated. Some of the wrapped Christmas presents she had left in the house were opened and stolen.'

Ms Foley-Fisher said there were obvious signs in the house that it belonged to a disabled woman, including a wheelchair in the kitchen 'which was overturned and the gearstick broken off.'

Two 60-litre fish tanks in the living room were smashed and the majority of the fish had been killed, she said, including one which had been thrown against a wall. There were three stab marks in the TV.

'A knife had also been stabbed into her suitcases. Money, jewellery and stamps were taken,' said Ms Foley-Fisher.

Police arrested the boy nearby in the early hours of December 23 and found the stolen property on him, she said. The boy swore at the officers but then admitted that the property came from Ms Hill's house.

In a victim impact statement Ms Hill said: 'Prior to this event I have always been a bubbly, outgoing person. I would talk to anybody. I am nice, not malicious in any way because I have been brought up that way.'

She said she was distressed by the thought 'that somebody could violate me.'

'I live with a disability, cerebral palsy, which is a challenge. To think that someone could or would do this to me makes you question yourself,' she said.

She said she had started questioning the people's nature following the incident, and that it has made her look over her shoulder.

Daniel Cavaglieri, defending, conceded that it was 'difficult to imagine an additional aggravating feature that might have occurred' but submitted that the boy had already had a 'salutary lesson' from spending the last five weeks in custody and would now benefit from supervision to try to correct his attitude and behavour.
