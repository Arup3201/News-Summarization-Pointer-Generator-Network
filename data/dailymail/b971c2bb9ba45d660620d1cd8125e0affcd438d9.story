A man told a woman ‘I’ve come to rape you’ after smashing down her front door in revenge because she had helped to convict him of burglary four years earlier.

Weeks after his three-and-a-half-year sentence for the break-in ended, Ashley Mills broke into his victim’s house and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint.

Speaking yesterday, she said she feared she would die in the ‘brutal and prolonged’ two-hour attack by homeless Mills, 28, who had burgled her home in 2009 after she took pity on him and let him camp on her land.

Career criminal: Ashley Mills, 28, has been jailed after he broke into Linda's home with an iron bar, grabbed a carving knife and told her: 'I've come to rape you' in a revenge sex attack

Linda, 59, who has waived her right to
 anonymity but not revealed her surname, said: ‘It was obvious he had 
been determined to get me. It was blatant revenge.’

Mills
 was jailed for 18 years at Portsmouth Crown Court last month after 
admitting three counts of rape, an attempted rape and one count of 
trespass with intent to commit a sex offence.

At
 her isolated £350,000 home in a village just outside Portsmouth 
yesterday, Linda said: ‘I live off the beaten track and he came all the 
way out here to find me because he was so angry.

Terrifying: Linda, holding part of damaged property, has spoken of her torment following the brutal and 'prolonged' attack after Mills was released from prison

‘He asked if I recognised him and denied ever burgling me.

‘I
 thought he was going to kill me. I was convinced that, as he had 
smashed in my front door to get me, he could completely cross the line 
and kill me so he wouldn’t leave a witness who could identify him.’

Mills had first approached his victim when she let him camp in her garden four years earlier.

She
 said: ‘This fella came up on a bicycle with a tent. He gave his name, 
shook hands with me. He wanted somewhere to camp for two weeks. I 
thought it was a lad living in the countryside.

‘He
 camped here for a couple of days, then he got in through the front door
 and burgled me. That was Ashley Mills. It’s scary how this can happen 
when I was just trying to help someone.

‘I saw that he needed somewhere to camp and said he could pitch up in my garden, I had no idea how dangerous he was.’

After
 being jailed in February 2010 for breaking into Linda’s home and 
committing arson at a church, Mills was released on May 15 this year 
having served his full sentence.

Within weeks, he returned to Linda’s home.

She
 first saw him after he tapped on her window and asked for a glass of 
water. Frightened, she refused and rang her neighbours, who alerted 
police.

But on June 29, he returned and carried out the horrific revenge attack.

Linda
 said: ‘I was asleep in bed and I heard this terrible crashing and 
banging. I opened my bedroom door and there he was in my hallway with an
 iron bar.

‘He had smashed 
his way right through the front door. He promptly head-butted me. He 
said, “I’m not going. I’ve come to rape you”.’

Linda, who lives alone, said: ‘I tried to run out of the house. He went to the kitchen and came out with a carving knife.’

When
 she tried to grab the knife he got angry and threatened to use it. ‘I 
just had to submit and he did what he wanted,’ she said.

Brave: Linda, 59, has waived her right to anonymity to ensure the full story about what Ashley Mills did to her is told

Ordeal: Linda took pity on homeless Mills and kindly let him pitch his tent in her garden but after that he turned her life into a living nightmare

‘I thought he was going to kill me. I just wanted to keep on his good side. I’m not brave.’

After the attack, brazen Mills asked for a glass of water and sat in an armchair to drink it.

She said: ‘He just sat there like nothing happened and made small talk.’

Realising that he had dropped the knife and iron bar, she kicked the blade under the cooker and dropped the bar behind a sofa.

Police
 praised her ‘great courage’ and quick-thinking and say this evidence 
helped to convict him. When he finally left, Linda hid in the garage, 
too scared to go back inside and dial 999.

She said: ‘I didn’t think I was going to get out of it alive as he knows I can identify him.

‘I thought if I came back into the house to ring the police he might come back and kill me.’

She eventually ran to a neighbour who called the police.

Linda
 now plans to move out of the home she has lived in since she was 15. In
 a statement read in court, she said: ‘Since Mills came and attacked me,
 I feel I can’t live here now.

‘I was terrified of being stabbed and how painful it would be.

‘I did survive when I thought I was going to be killed in a horrible manner.

‘Sometimes when victims are killed, I think they are the lucky ones. They don’t keep reliving the horror of it all.

‘The
 survivors have to live with this for the rest of their lives. I’m 
grateful to be alive, but now have all the life-changing problems I’m 
now facing.

‘I’ll never forget it, and the disgusting things he did to me. It fills me with horror.’
