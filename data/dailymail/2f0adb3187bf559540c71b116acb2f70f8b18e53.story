To many, its powers to bring on labour are nothing more than an old wives’ tale.

But speculation was mounting yesterday as to whether Sunday night’s bright full moon had triggered the duchess’s first contractions.

While most will say nature had simply run its course, some believe the theory that suggests the moon’s gravitational pull can influence embryonic fluid around a child in the womb in much the same way as it affects the tide.

Mother nature: Theories as to what kick-started the Duchess of Cambridge's labour include the lunar cycle and the weather

Mervi Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said colleagues often talk of how a full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries.

While she acknowledged any evidence was purely anecdotal, she said: ‘Midwives usually do say “I’m on call. It’s a full moon. I’ll be busy tonight”.’

She added: ‘There was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the Thames which is a tidal river, it showed that on the full moon they did have more births. 

‘The idea is that because the baby is surrounded by water, the time of the full moon and the high tide causes the waters to break.’

Filling time: As the world's media camped outside the Lindo wing at St. Mary's Hospital, news broke that the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour in the early hours of Monday morning

Facts and figures: Royal aide Ed Perkins delivers information on when the Royal baby was born. He is a Cancerian like Prince William with a moon in Capricorn - the same star-sign as mother Kate

Some experts say because the human body is comprised of 80 per cent water, there is no reason to discount the suggestions. It is also thought menstrual cycles are similarly influenced. 

And it was not the only natural phenomenon being credited with encouraging the duchess’s labour yesterday.

Some believe an electrical storm above Kensington Palace may also have had an effect, with thunder and lightning and isolated showers in West London at 6am yesterday.

Old Wives' Tales: Some believe that the moon's gravitational pull can affect the embryonic fluid around an unborn child and bring on contractions

Pat Wood, a midwife of 20 years said: ‘There’s a pressure around the baby in the uterus. There’s change from a high atmosphere to a suddenly low one when a storm comes and the difference in pressure is what the uterus is trying to equal, so your waters can break.

Conceding the theory was ‘anecdotal’, she added: ‘It’s only a tipping point but if it’s your ‘maybe, maybe not day’ – it might be the final straw that does it.’
