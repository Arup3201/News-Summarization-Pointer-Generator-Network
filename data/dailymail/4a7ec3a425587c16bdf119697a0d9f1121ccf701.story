Bin better: Charlie Cavey, pictured with his dog who guards his takings, says he has been stink-bombed by Cambridge students

His unique venue may have made 'bin busker' Charlie Cavey an institution in Cambridge, but his incessant strumming appears to have caused a stink with students in the university city.

Mr Cavey, who busks with his guitar from inside a litter bin outside the university's prestigious Corpus Christi College, has seen his venue vandalised during his most recent sets.

Now university officials have stepped in to warn students, after the bin busker had bleach emptied into his bin and stink bombs let off inside while he was playing.

College president James Black emailed 
students yesterday warning saying that 'such acts of vigilantism and 
vandalism are obviously unacceptable.'

They
said offending students, who continued to harass Charlie, who plays in a
Cambridge City Council bin directly outside their college, would be 
punished by the Dean.

Mr
Cavey, 31, has been busking in Cambridge for 11 years, but says he 
could have been blinded when vandals released a stink bomb into his bin 
while he strummed away.

He has recently bought himself a guard dog, who perches on top of his bin to guard his well-earned takings.

He said: 'The problems started about a month ago when someone complained.

'Then I came back an hour later a whole bottle of bleach had been emptied into my bin.

'I only play for 20 minute sets, then have a 15 minute break and only do about six sets a day.'

Cambridge University students have complained that Mr Cavey plays too loud, and that his six performances a day are too long.

An email sent by James Black said: 'There have been a number of incidents involving students and this busker, most recently seeing fart bombs thrown into the bin during one of his performances, but also extending to the bin being attacked with bleach.'

James Black said it was 'completely understandable' that some students found him 'a real nuisance' and there was evidence to suggest he regularly broke the Street Performer's Code of Practice by playing too loudly and for more than one hour a day.

Local institution: The busker says his unusual choice of venue 'always makes people laugh'

Upset: Students at Cambridge's prestigious Corpus Christi College have complained Mr Cavey's music is too loud and goes on for too long

But he said students should deal with the matter by alerting the council when he broke the code, rather than taking matters into their own hands.

He said so far the city council had received very few official complaints so they were unable to move Charlie from his pitch.

But he assured students 'the problem should hopefully be resolved well before exam term.'
