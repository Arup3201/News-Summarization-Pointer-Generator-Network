He has recently been spotted dining in Pizza Express and Nandos, but David Cameron moved a little more upmarket on his latest 'date night' with wife Samantha.

The couple were spotted leaving achingly-trendy celebrity hotspot The Chiltern Firehouse in north London last night after spending some quality time together away from the hustle and bustle of Westminster and their children.

It was something of a step up for Cameron, who was accused of using vouchers to pay for his £12.75 pizza and Samantha's £10.90 lasagna on a romantic night out last year.

He was also recently spotted in a branch of chicken chain Nandos in Bristol, where he posed for selfies with fellow diners shocked to see the former Bullingdon Club member arrive.

The couple were not the only famous faces partying in the venue last night, U2's Bono and The Edge - real name David Evans - were also seen heading for a meal.

They were joined by model Laura Bailey, The Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie, socialite Lady Victoria Hervey and actress Lindsay Lohan.

But Cameron and his wife seemed keen to hide their following of London's in-crowd, and left via the building's back entrance following their evening together.

The couple are the latest high-profile figures to be seen at the venue, which boasts David Beckham and Lily Allen among its regulars

The meal was something of a step-up for Mr Cameron, who was chided for using vouchers to pay for a previous romantic meal with his wife at chain Pizza Express

The 
Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, which is owned by luxury hotel magnate
 André Balazs, is the current restaurant of choice for London's 
A-listers and elite.

This
 week alone it has hosted singer Lily Allen, model Kate Moss, talk show 
host Piers Morgan and X Factor boss Simon Cowell, who took partner 
Lauren Silverman to the restaurant on Tuesday.

It has also been frequented by Cameron's predecessor Tony Blair, who was seen there with his wife, Cherie, last month.

Set in a converted fire station, the venue was described by reviewer Tom Parker-Bowles as 'hotter than the surface of the Sun,where even God would have to wait for a table'.

The Grade II listed Victorian building 
was built in 1889 by Robert Pearsall, the resident architect for the 
Metropolitan Board of Works, and is regarded as one of the finest 
surviving examples of the gothic architectural style used during the 
pre-war period.

It closed in 2005 and Balazs discovered the building around five years ago with a friend and London property developer Harry Handelsman.

Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne and David Beckham are also said to be among the new restaurant's growing list of regulars.

Mrs Cameron set a patriotic tone for the 
Camerons' latest meal, matching a red and white dress with a blue 
blazer, while her husband kept it simple in a black suit and slightly 
unbuttoned blue shirt.

Model Kate Moss (left) was also seen leaving the venue, built in an old fire station, earlier this month and former PM Tony Blair (right) and his wife Cherie were spotted there last month

The Prime Minister, known for his love of 'chillaxing', used the evening to unwind after he received a battering in the House of Commons over the continuing fiasco at the Passport Office.

He told Now magazine in 2010: '[Sam and I] have one night a week where we either stay in and do nothing or go out on our own.

'We have a couple of favourite Italian restaurants in north Kensington but I can't tell you about them.

'I once named my favourite Spanish restaurant and a newspaper went there and said the food tasted like boiled sawdust or something and totally trashed it, so I don't want to risk it.'

The building's interior - which boasts a bustling open kitchen - was revamped with the help of Paris Studio KO
