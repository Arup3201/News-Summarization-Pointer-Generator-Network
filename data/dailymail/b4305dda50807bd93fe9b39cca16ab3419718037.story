A son who faked his own kidnap in a bid to swindle his wealthy businessman father out of Â£620,000-worth of gold bullion is facing jail today.

Viraj Mashru, 20, enlisted Amit Patel, 26, to help convince his father Rajendra he had been abducted and demand the $1million bounty.

Patel said he had taken his Kenyan-born co-conspirator from Africa to the UK and he would be harmed if his family did not cough up.

Co-conspirators: Viraj Mashru and Amit Patel admitted blackmail at Southwark Crown Court after faking a kidnap and demanding a $1m ransom in gold bullion

Business: Rajendra Mashru runs P N Mashru, a logistics firm based in Mombasa, Kenya, which has more than 300 vehicles according to its website

But Mashru was hiding in Bristol and then in a hotel in Wembley, northwest London, between October 25 and November 1 last year before police swooped.

He and Patel admitted blackmail at Southwark Crown Court.

They will be sentenced at the outcome of the trial of alleged co-conspirators Marcus Bennett, 31, and Liban Mohamed, 34.

Neither Bennett nor Mohamed, who both face the same allegation, entered any pleas during today's hearing.

They are due to appear before the same court later this month, with a provisional trial date fixed for April 22.

Rajendra Mashru runs P N Mashru a logistics firm based in Mombasa, Kenya.

According to its website the firm has more than 300 vehicles and operates across East Africa.

Mashru, of Roxeth Hill, Harrow, and Patel, of Lancelot Parade, Wembley, both Middlesex, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail and were remanded in custody.

Mohammed, of no fixed abode, and Bennett of Church Road, St John's Wood, north west London were also remanded in custody ahead of their next appearance.
