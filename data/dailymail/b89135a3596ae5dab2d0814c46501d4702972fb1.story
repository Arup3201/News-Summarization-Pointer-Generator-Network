Eight people were injured Sunday when a flight from New York to Dublin was rocked by severe turbulence on the descent into Ireland.

An elderly passenger of United Airlines flight 23 was taken to the hospital after the plane landed with a cut to their head, according to Journal.ie.

The seven other injured were treated for 'minor injuries' by emergency crews who met the plane once it landed.

According to a spokesperson for the airlines, the flight to Dublin 'encountered severe turbulence during the flight's descent into Dublin'.

The Boeing 757 was carrying 129 passengers and 8 crew members.

The eight passengers were injured when the plane experienced a quick drop in altitude.

'We hit a pretty bad downdraft and so we have some passengers hurt so we need some ambulance to meet the flight,' the pilot told air traffic control in Dublin Sunday morning.

When asked how many ambulances were needed ,the pilot said that about 6 people were injured so they might need a couple of ambulances to meet them on the ground.

On the ground: When the plane safely landed at Dublin Airport, 7 passengers were treated for 'minor injuries' and one passenger was taken to the hospital for a cut on the head

There also seems to have been a mechanical problem on the flight. When the air traffic controller asks if the passengers are severely hurt, the pilot responds: 'Right now we're not really sure because we are still working on the hydraulic problem'.

Despite the turbulence, the airplane landed safely at Dublin Airport.

The airline is currently investigating the incident.Â
