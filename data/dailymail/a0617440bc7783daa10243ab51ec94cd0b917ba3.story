New Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie has accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of endangering the safety of his daughters by using them while campaigning during last year's federal election campaign.

The Palmer United Party senator pinpointed her dislike of the prime minister to last year's election campaign and his use of his daughters for the cameras.

'What really finished it off with me was when in the last election how he was parading his daughters around ... because that's a security issue," she said, adding that she believed the Prime Minister was a 'political psychopath'.

'That really bothers me that you've got those pretty young girls running around in front of a camera, and I just thought, "is your political career more important than your own daughters' security?"' she told ABC radio on Thursday.

'I think, being ex-military, that was the last straw for me.'

The outspoken former military officer made headlines last month when she called the prime minister a 'bare-faced, uncaring liar'.

Senator Lambie's comments come as the Abbott government continued to negotiate with the three new PUP senators as it attempts to get its tough new budget measures passed.

But Senator Lambie also flagged she would be independently minded, saying her party's leader and founder Clive Palmer did not 'control' her.

'We've all got a head on our shoulders.'

Former rugby league giant Glenn Lazarus, who is also a Palmer United Party senator, said ahead of two-day 'senator kindy' for the new senate team that it felt like being 'back in the front row'.

The new senators have spent the morning filling out paperwork and being briefed by the Senate procedure office on how to be sworn in, electing a president, basic rules of debate and the legislative process.

NSW Liberal Democratic Party senator David Leyonhjelm will be taking notes on how to amend bills and separate them out of packages of legislation.

Senator Leyonhjelm wants to separate the second round of tax cuts and welfare payments out of the carbon tax repeal package so they can go ahead as planned by Labor.

On Thursday evening, the new senators will have dinner with the Senate Deputy President Stephen Parry, who is expected to be elected President on Monday.
