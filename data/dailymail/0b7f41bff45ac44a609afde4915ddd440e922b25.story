The Swiss central bank plans to charge depositors a ‘negative’ interest rate of -0.25 per cent to discourage spooked investors from using it to shelter their cash.

Money has flooded into Switzerland as market turbulence caused by the Russian rouble collapse and oil price slide has prompted a desperate search for safe havens in recent days.

The Swiss National Bank said it would slash its interest rate on balances of over 10million Swiss francs from January 22 - effectively imposing a charge on depositors wanting to hold francs in a bid to keep its currency artificially weak against the euro.

The Swiss National Bank said it would impose negative interest rates on cash held by other banks at the central bank, seeking to discourage safe-haven buying by investors anxious about the crisis in Russia

It also plans to expand its three-month target lending range from -0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent at the same time.

The franc fell after the announcement to its lowest against the euro since mid-October and to its weakest against the US dollar since May 2013.

‘Over the past few days, a number of factors have prompted increased demand for safe investments,’ the SNB said in its statement.

‘The introduction of negative interest rates makes it less attractive to hold Swiss franc investments, and thereby supports the minimum exchange rate.’

The move is also being seen as a pre-emptive strike ahead of the likely introduction of a eurozone quantitative easing programme next year.

The SNB’s minimum exchange rate is a cap of 1.20 per euro for the franc, which it set at the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011 and which it stressed was still its key policy tool.

The franc, the most liquid safe-haven currency after the Japanese yen, has stuck close to the 1.20 limit in recent days as fears of a full-blown financial crisis in Russia and economic weakness globally prompted investors to seek safety.
