Manchester United's European exile means that December dawned before Louis van Gaal has taken charge of his first competitive match under the floodlights at Old Trafford. At this rate, the Dutchman will not have to wait so long next year.

A fourth win in a row last night kept Van Gaal’s team in fourth position in the table and on course for the Champions League place he has targeted in his first season in English football.

United had to do it without the injured Wayne Rooney and Angel Di Maria, and it wasn’t particularly pretty.

Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN at Old Trafford 

They finished the match desperately clinging on as goalkeeper David de Gea produced a magnificent save to keep out a point-blank header from former United striker Mame Biram Diouf deep into added time.

Moments later, the Goal Decision System was called upon to confirm that Diouf’s shot had not crossed the line when Ashley Young somehow kept out a shot.

This time last year, United were losing twice at home in the space of four days to Everton and Newcastle and it’s fair to say this one might well have got away from them as well.

But Van Gaal has obviously instilled some fight in his squad and the signs of progress are clear to see now, even if the manner of victory left much room for improvement.

‘We were lucky at the end but we deserved to win,’ he admitted. ‘As a top club you have to win and therefore I’m very happy with his result.

‘But it was not our best performance. We were not aggressive enough in the first half. 

'The second half was better, we created more chances but we need to score more goals. The last few moments were not necessary.’

News of Di Maria’s expected absence arrived earlier in the day courtesy of his wife Jorgelina, who confirmed on social media that United’s £60million record signing had suffered a ‘small tear’ in his hamstring. 

However, Rooney’s absence came as something of a surprise and the England captain will have a scan on his injured knee on Wednesday.

‘My opinion is that it is not so heavy but I am not a doctor,’ said Van Gaal, who revealed that Daley Blind could be back from his knee injury by the end of the year.

Rooney’s absence gave striker James Wilson the opportunity to make his first start under Van Gaal a day after his 19th birthday following six appearances as a substitute this season.

The youngster impressed but missed a great chance to put United out of sight when clean through in the second half.

In theory, Van Gaal could not have wished for a better opportunity to extend his winning run. Stoke had lost on all 11 previous visits to Old Trafford and their goalkeeper Asmir Begovic almost gifted the hosts a goal with an awful pass to Erik Pieters early on.

Robin van Persie intercepted and squared the ball to Ander Herrera, who opted to shoot first time and clutched his head in his hands as it flew well over.

United went ahead in the 21st minute as they swept down the left and Juan Mata played the ball into the path of Herrera. 

He swung a cross towards the back post and Pieters appeared to be rooted to the spot as Marouane Fellaini rose above him to plant a downward header past Begovic.

Stoke were level six minutes before the break when Fellaini was guilty of undoing his good work.

Quite what the big Belgian was thinking when he pulled away from visiting winger Oussama Assaidi’s high boot clutching his neck, only he knows. 

There had been no contact whatsoever, but even Assaidi stopped momentarily as Fellaini rolled around near the halfway line.

Bojan Krkic did not hesitate, though, breaking forward on a mazy run that seemed to have reached a dead-end on the edge of the United box where the ball got caught up between Chris Smalling’s legs.

Match-winner Juan Mata has scored 10 goals for Manchester United – four of them scored under Louis van Gaal, and three apiece for David Moyes and Ryan Giggs 

It rolled loose towards Steven Nzonzi and he produced a magnificent finish beyond De Gea from 20 yards.

The winner arrived in the 59th minute after Pieters took down Antonio Valencia in full flight. 

Mata floated a free-kick over from the right flank and it bounced through into the corner of the net, even though Marcos Rojo claimed it had brushed his hair.

Either way, Mark Hughes felt the Argentine was offside. 

‘The lad Rojo, it doesn't matter if he doesn't touch it, he is clearly interfering with play,’ said the Stoke boss after a third straight defeat. 

‘So the referee and his assistant should have cancelled that out. It’s the luck we’re having at the moment.’

That should really been that but Hughes threw on Marko Arnautovic and Peter Crouch and the proverbial kitchen sink. It almost worked as well, but De Gea once again came to United’s rescue, and then Young.

It’s United’s Christmas party on Wednesday night. Their team-mates owe them a drink.
