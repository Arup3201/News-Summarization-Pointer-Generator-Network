When asked which professional dancer she wanted to be partnered with, flirty Feltz said she was hoping for somebody ‘virile... but patient.’

The show has also unveiled a new promo teaser ahead of it's 11th series which sees the professional dancers showing off their moves. Familiar faces like Anton du Beke, Brendan Cole, Natalie Lowe and Artem Chigvintsev are returning for another shot at the Glitterball along with five new faces.

One celeb who won’t be hitting the dance floor though is Olympic swimming champ Rebecca Adlington.

The 24-year-old was in talks to appear in the new series but has revealed that despite being invited to meet the show’s producers she was turned down for a spot.

‘I would have loved to have done the show but unfortunately they didn’t want me,’ the disappointed athlete told the Mirror.

‘They didn’t think I would fit in with the balance of the people. I met them but it didn’t work out this time.  I will still be glued to it every weekend though, I’m a big fan.’

Rebecca speculates that the rejection was down to her looks, adding: ‘I don’t think I’d fit into the beauty advertising bracket as much.’

The full line up of Strictly contestants will be announced on Monday 2nd September, live on The One Show with the new series beginning on Saturday 7th September on BBC One.
