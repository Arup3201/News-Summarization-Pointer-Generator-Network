Border Agency police yesterday made a dramatic early morning raid on the home of 80s pop icon Adam Ant.

Immigration police swooped on the star's flat in South Kensington in a dawn raid to arrest a Japanese friend of his over visa offences.

The 36-year-old woman, who according to Adam's lawyer is a 'friend' of the 80s legend, was later removed from the property smoking a cigarette.

Around 10 Border Agency officers had raided the address at 6.40am on Monday morning.

When they entered a small pet dog, called Elvis, dashed from the property past police before retreating inside.

Adam, 57, was also quizzed by officers inside the flat, according to the Daily Mirror.

The Japanese woman was said to have been escorted from the flat 40 minutes after the raid by six officers.

She is suspected of having overstayed her visa permit in this country and now faces deportation.

It is unknown what the exact relationship is between the Japanese woman and Adam.

But a neighbour of the 80s icon told the Daily Mirror: 'People are in and out of that house all day, every day.

'God knows who they all are. There's all sorts who visit. It's like a constant stream of visitors.'

Ant's lawyer Dean Dunham told the paper: 'This lady is one of Adam's 
friends. She had attempted to make the correct applications to extend 
her visa but the authorities had been dealing with the wrong address.'

A
UK Border Agency spokesman said today: 'A 36-year-old Japanese national
was arrested for immigration offences at an address in the 
Knightsbridge area and is now detained pending her removal from the UK.'

Troubled star Adam Ant, real name Stuart Goddard, has endured a string of controversial incidents in recent years.

During a difficult spell for the star he 
was charged with affray in October 2002 after throwing a car alternator 
through the window of the Prince of Wales pub in Kentish Town, north 
London, and intimidating staff with an imitation gun.

The 80s legend, a known sufferer of 
mental health problems, was sectioned in September 2003 after a dispute 
with a neighbour where he threatened to smash in his patio doors with a 
shovel and was found lying naked in a cafe basement.

His bi-polar condition forced him to cancel all touring commitments until his comeback show in May 2011.

At his comeback, he upset a Christian audience at a charity concert in Portsmouth when he launched into a foul-mouthed rant which led to a fight behind the scenes.
