A former Houston, Texas English teacher was sentenced to one year in jail and one year of probation on Tuesday for sleeping with a 15-year-old student.

Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, plead guilty last month to one count improper relations with a student and one count sexual assault of a child. Two other counts were dropped after the former Memorial Middle School teacher agreed to a plea deal.

Murray was also charged for harboring a runaway after continuing to see the teen after her initial arrest - defying a judge's orders.

Inappropriate relationship: Former Houston English teacher Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was sentenced to one year in jail and one year in prison on Tuesday for sleeping with a student multiple times

The inappropriate relationship began in February 2012 when Murray, who is still married, was tutoring the Spanish-speaking eighth grader and the two went on to have 'repeated' sexual encounters, according to KHOU.

On one occasion, Murray picked up the teen from a school dance after his dad dropped him off and took him to a hotel where they had sex for two hours.

The couple were caught the following night by the teen's younger brother who found them in bed at the family home while their parents were away.

Murray was fired that month following the allegations but remained free on $50,000 bail.

Police discovered that the two had sex in a classroom at least twice and that prior to her arrest, Murray had closed her bank account and planned to skip the border to Mexico.

At school: In the course of their investigation, police discovered that Murray had sex with the 15-year-old student she was tutoring at least two times in a classroom at Memorial Middle School

Despite being barred from seeing the teen by a judge, the affair continued.

In January 2013, Murray was arrested again when she was found with the teen at her father's home.

When police showed up at the house, the teen, then 16, tried to escape through the back door.

She was charged with harboring a runaway and this time her bond was revoked.

Sentencing in the case happened on Tuesday.

Won't stop: Murray's affair with the boy continued even after she was arrested. Police found the then 16-year-old with Murray at her father's house and she was charged with harboring a minor

Murray attended Memorial Middle and High School and had been working in the Spring Branch ISD for the previous three years as a language arts teacher. 

Records say she is still married to her husband and they live at the same address in Houston.

To this day, the teen she had relations with insists that they are in love but his mother calls him a victim.

'We are not good, we are very hurt. My son is really confused, hurt. We working with him very closely but he’s not good, not good at all,' the mother said.
