An architecture critic has set the spark to Donald Trump’s latest feud after criticizing a large sign with the real estate developer’s name that has been installed on his building in Chicago.

Trump has gotten into a war of words with Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel over the issue, and Emanuel has since announced that he's looking for a way to undo the 'architecturally tasteless' sign.

The billionaire reality star shows no signs of backing down, however, saying that the sign was ‘done by one of the great sign designers’ and the ‘third-rate architectural critic’ is on the wrong side of public opinion.

Clear sign: Trump stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign that ultimately has been emblazoned on the building

‘This was fully approved, everybody 
knew about it, (Emanuel's) administration knew about it, the previous 
administration approved it and this has been approved for a long period 
of time,’ Trump said in a phone interview with The Today Show this 
morning.

‘The brand is very hot, we're probably the hottest brand there is. We're building all over the world and cities love the brand.’

The
 sign in question spells out his last name with 20-foot-tall letters on 
the side of his gleaming Chicago skyscraper and the controversy began 
when Blair Kamin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the 
Chicago Tribune, wrote an article blasting the addition.

'If
 this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care — but it
 is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from 
the 1920s to the 1960s and onward,’ he wrote.

Trump
 wasted no time disparaging the columnist, telling Today’s Matt Lauer 
that Mr Kamin was someone ‘who I thought got fired, he was gone for a 
long period of time’.

‘All of the sudden he reemerges and to get a little publicity he started this campaign,’ Trump said Friday.

‘The fact is... that people love it.’

Standing tall: Trump has been vocal in his support of the sign and claims to have received 'thousands' of emails and letters from fans telling him to keep the sign

Many
 of the city's tallest buildings have large signs near or at ground 
level, but not even landmarks like the John Hancock Center and the 
Willis Tower have the kind of banner — high above street level — that 
the Trump International Hotel & Tower does.

Trump
 also stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign 
that ultimately was emblazoned on the building. Not only did the city 
zoning administrator sign off on it, he said, but the City Council did 
as well.

Trump pointed out 
that the city had actually approved an even-larger sign when Mayor 
Richard Daley was still in office, then last year the City Council 
endorsed a smaller version of it. A spokesman for Emanuel, Bill 
McCaffrey, said the council approved it, as it routinely approves signs 
at its meetings, and the mayor was not aware of it.

But
 perhaps more important than any legal argument he might make, Trump 
said he's baffled that anyone would object to the sight of his name on 
the side of the building, going so far as to suggest that they should be
 thanking him.

For starters, he said, his skyscraper replaced an 'ugly' Chicago Sun-Times building and its equally unattractive sign.

Not
 only that, he said, but he expects the insignia to someday be as 
revered in Chicago as the iconic Hollywood sign is in Los Angeles.

'I have the hottest brand in the world right now and there are those who are saying I'm doing Chicago a favor,' he said.

'I've got thousands of people saying, “Don't do anything with the sign.”’

Emanuel, clearly, disagrees.

'Mayor
 Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred 
by an architecturally tasteless sign,' his spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said
 in a statement, a day after Kamin reported that McCaffrey used the word
 'awful' to describe Emanuel's opinion of the sign.

What
 the mayor may not disagree with is Trump's contention that the city may
 not have much choice but to get used to his name in big bold letters.

'The
 sign — which was already reduced in size and scope — does comply with 
the provisions of the planned development ordinance and the City Council
 sign order, but he has asked his staff to determine if there are any 
options available for further changes,' Quinn said.
