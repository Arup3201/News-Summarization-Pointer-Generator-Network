Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has revealed that Champions League success has become an expectation at the home of the Barclays Premier League champions.

City begin their campaign with yet another game at Bayern Munich on Wednesday and Kompany has claimed it is time for the club to reach its first final.

Kompany said: 'You start a season at Manchester City nowadays and it's not acceptable not to put all the trophies on your ambitions list.

'It's a case of me and all the players looking at all the trophies and think we have to go until the very end of the season.

'I mean the club is asking us to win now so that's one thing. In which order you can't say.

'We have come so far in the last four years and we have been successful but you always want to take it a step further.

'Let's take it in context. We are not favourites by any means for this competition but we would like to compete and challenge.

'Before we won the league it was more difficult to believe we could do it than with the Champions League.

'My experience of the Champions League is that it's not more difficult to go to the end but everything has to be perfect.

'The Premier League is just a ferocious battle to the end. Eventually it will happen our way.'
