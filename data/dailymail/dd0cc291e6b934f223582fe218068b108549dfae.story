A man has incriminated himself in a foolish crime by using his real name and address whilst on a peculiar shopping spree with a stolen credit card.

Matthew Clifford, 29, from Geelong West used a stolen credit card 22 times in five hours to buy a range of items.

He proved his range of tastes by buying products that ranged from including McDonald’s to expensive whisky, Subway to cognac, as well as fishing lures, a diary, cigarettes and an artist’s sketch pad.

The scammer only went to shops which used the 'PayWave' system

However, police found it all too easy to identify and locate the scammer due to his incredibly mindless mistake.

Whilst using the credit card to buy two mobile phones, Mr Clifford filled out paper work and provided his real full name and Warwick Street address.

Mr Clifford only bought items from stores that used the paywave system but managed to spend a whopping $1653.33.

His lawyer argued that the accused was facing a difficult time in his life when he committed the crime and is now trying to get his life together.

When the stolen card was allegedly offered to him by a friend, Mr Clifford was opportunistic but ‘got caught up in the offending’.

He has struggled with drug addiction in recent years but after he was charged with the latest offences has sought treatment.

Clifford was convicted on all counts and placed on a further 12-month Community Corrections Order, on top of another similar Order he was placed on in 2014.

He must also serve 100 hours’ unpaid community work and undergo a period of judicial monitoring.
