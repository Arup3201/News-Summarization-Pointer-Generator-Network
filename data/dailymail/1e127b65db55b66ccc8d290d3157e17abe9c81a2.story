Sir John Armitt argued power blackouts are the 'best possible' thing for the country

One of Ed Miliband’s most senior advisers sparked fury yesterday by saying that power blackouts would be good for the country.

Sir John Armitt argued that the blackouts would be the ‘best possible thing’ because they would bring home the scale of the energy crisis facing the country.

Sir John’s inflammatory remarks – which coincided with forecasts of the first Arctic blast of the winter – revived the fierce debate over energy prices and supplies which was triggered by Mr Miliband’s party conference pledge in October to freeze gas and electricity bills.

The Conservatives immediately lept on Sir John’s comments, claiming that blackouts would be an indictment of Mr Miliband’s failure to plan for the future when he was Energy Secretary.  

Sir John, who is advising Labour on the future of the country’s long-term infrastructure needs, said: ‘In harsh political terms [blackouts] would be the best possible thing because this country is extremely good in a crisis.’ 

In the interview with construction industry magazine Building, he added that the UK was nearing the crisis because too little was being done to replace ageing coal-fired and nuclear power stations.

He said: ‘We are down to (just a) 4 per cent (surplus of energy capacity) because we’ve gone slower than we should have done on nuclear.’

His remarks are particularly  controversial because of the continuing fury within the energy industry over Mr Miliband’s plans for an energy price freeze.

Energy bosses said that his move would threaten the security of supply and mean ‘the lights would go out’.

The comments have revived the debate surrounding Labour party leader Ed Miliband's promise to freeze gas and electricity bills

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Labour had 13 years to take the long-term decisions to meet Britain’s energy needs, including when Ed Miliband was Energy Secretary, but failed to do so.

'Instead they took short-term decisions. And now Labour’s key economic adviser thinks it would be a good thing for families, vulnerable older people, and even hospitals treating patients to suffer power cuts.’

Last night, Energy Minister Greg Barker said: ‘This is utter madness, but if Sir John thinks power cuts will be a good thing for Britain then he is certainly working for the right man – because Ed Miliband would deliver them.’
