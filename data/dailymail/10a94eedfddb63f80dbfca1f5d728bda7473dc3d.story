Sir Andrew Green, a leading opponent of mass immigration to Britain, is to become a peer.

David Cameron personally nominated the chairman of MigrationWatch for a seat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher for his public service as a former diplomat and for his role in the immigration debate.

The appointment comes amid a growing public clamour for tighter controls on immigration, with Mr Cameron promising to impose curbs on EU migrants as part of his plan to claw powers back from Brussels.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, is to join the House of Lords as a crossbench peer

MigrationWatch is a think tank which campaigns against Britain's open borders with Europe, warning levels of immigration are unsustainable.

Three other people will also become crossbench peers. They include former MI5 boss Sir Jonathan Evans and education expert Professor Alison Wolf.

One appointment which is likely to raise eyebrows in Westminster is that of Sir Robert Rogers, who this year quit as the clerk to the Commons after reports of rows with Speaker John Bercow. 

However, Sir Andrew's elevation to the Lords at a time when immigration is dominating political debate is likely to prove the most controversial.

He co-founded the MigrationWatch think tank in 2001, after a career as a diplomat in the civil service, retiring in 2000 after four years a Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

He has become a leading voice against immigration and a supporter of Mr Cameron's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.

The official citation for Sir Andrew states: 'Sir Andrew Green KCMG was the British Ambassador to Syria from 1991 to 1994, and to Saudi Arabia, 1996 to 2000. 

'He served for over 35 years in the Diplomatic Service. Since retirement in 2000, he has carried out a wide range of voluntary work. This includes MigrationWatch UK which he co-founded in 2001 and still chairs.'

The decision to reward such an outspoken opponent of mass immigration comes as Mr Cameron is in the grip of a major row with the EU over attempts to curb freedom of movement.

The Premier has pledged to put immigration 'at the very heart' of his renegotiation strategy for Europe, which he has promised before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. 

The Tories promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but latest figures show it has topped 200,000. 

Sir Andrew has warned that 'immigration on this scale is simply not sustainable'. He has urged the government to consider 'what reforms can be made to Freedom of Movement in the EU, so as to limit the number of low skilled EU migrants coming to the UK, at least until migratory pressures abate.'

Senior Conservatives are considering a proposal to impose quote on 'time-limited national insurance numbers' to limit the numbers of people able to move to Britain for work. 

But outgoing European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has warned restricting migrant numbers would 'not be in conformity with European laws'.

As Prime Minister, Mr Cameron personally nominates crossbench peers to the Queen in recognition of their public service.

The number of appointments covered under this arrangement is a maximum of 10 in any one Parliament, Downing Street said.
