When it comes to the World Cup, there is always the temptation to forget that England were ever at the tournament in the first place.

After all that’s what the FA, the guardians of the national sport, did after Costa Rica beat Italy on June 20.

To put England’s embarrassing performance into context, 12 teams - Argentina, Bosnia Herzegovina, Nigeria, Iran, Germany, Portugal, Ghana, USA, Belgium, Russia, South Korea and Algeria - had not even played their second match when England were eliminated.

England missed a trick when the kit skips were loaded on to a plane at the airport in Belo Horizonte after their final group game against Costa Rica ended with a 0-0 draw.

It is then that the World Cup began elsewhere, opening up as Brazil, Germany, Holland and Argentina went deep into this tournament. Their arrival in the latter stages was no accident.

All four of those teams, regardless of the outcome of the two semi-finals in Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo, have the mentality of champions. They arrived in Brazil expecting to win it.

Being around these teams is an experience, an education into the attitude and psychological determination these teams have on reaching the latter stages of a World Cup.

Ask most Brazilians about their five World Cup wins and most of them will answer ‘Yes, but why didn’t we win the other 14?’.

Germany have won three and lost four finals, Holland were beaten in the 2010 final by Spain and Argentina won it in 1978 and again in 1986.

They know what it takes. England, as ever, were nowhere.

To watch and learn from these teams is an exercise in itself, something which England and the FA could and should have picked up on. Instead they are monitoring the games from afar.

In between Holland’s 2-1 victory over Mexico and their semi-final with Argentina in Sao Paulo, Louis van Gaal twice threw open the doors to Holland’s training centre.

It was there, on a beautiful pitch at Flamengo’s practice ground in the shadows of Sugar Loaf mountain and Corcovado, that the next manager of Manchester United was at work.

Those two sessions were both open to the public, which meant that any man Jack from the street could have walked in to watch Van Gaal at work. He is certainly an impressive figure.

This is one of the world’s leading football bosses, the most flexible and daring coach at the tournament after his decision to throw on a substitute keeper for a penalty shoot-out against Cost Rica.

Even the loveable Dutch scout Piet de Visser, a 79-year-old man who has been around the block a few times, was sat on the concrete terraces watching Van Gaal at work. It’s what people who want to learn do with their days.

To argue that Van Gaal, who won league titles with Ajax, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar, plus the Champions League win in 1995, is somehow ahead of his time would be wrong.

But let’s also not forget that this is a guy who has coached some of the world’s leading footballers during his career. There is certainly an aura about him.

Whenever he blew his whistle during those sessions - which was rare - his players automatically crowded around him to listen intently to his observations. He is the ring-master.

Off the field, there is a different mentality. The FA’s communications team provides key notes for the players to memorise before they speak with the media.

Contrast that with the attitude of the Dutch, who organised a press conference with Tim Krul and Jasper Cillessen after Van Gaal’s ballsy substitution in the 119th minute in the quarter-final against Costa Rica. It is unthinkable that England would have done the same.

At that same training sessions former Holland striker Pierre van Hooijdonk, an analyst with Dutch television, was soaking up some of van Gaal’s experience. He, like everyone else present, wanted to learn.

Then there is Joachim Low, the man who held up four fingers to signify Germany’s target to win their fourth World Cup when he was on his way the aircraft taking the team to Brazil.

It is what the nation demands, as several players - Philipp Lahm, Andre Schurrle and particularly Per Mertesacker - have referenced at various stages of this tournament.

‘We are not a Mickey Mouse team,’ was Mertesacker’s response to questions about the team’s performance against Algeria in Porto Alegre in the second round. They are a tournament team.

It is incredible to think that England have become obsessed with technique. In doing so, they have lost something else from their game.

England got away with this tournament disaster good and proper when they packed they bags and flew out of Belo Horizonte after they picked up their first point of the tournament.

Still, at least the FA have the benefit of replays when they slide back into the sofa and watch the World Cup on TV.
