Imagine waking up beneath cosy sheepskin in an igloo, walking outside to take in stunning views across the Rhone Valley, before hopping into your skis and carving your way down your own private ski slope.

If overcrowded aprés bars and queues for the chairlift are winter holiday turn-offs, glamping in the snow at Whitepod in Switzerland may be for you.

The remote eco-luxury resort of 15 igloo-shaped 'pods' is located at an altitude of 1,400m in Valais.

Peace and quiet: The remote Whitepod resort enjoy spectacular views... and few neighbours

The seven kilometres of Whitepod piste has blue and red runs, three lifts, and are only open to resort guests.

In the evening, residents are treated to a choice of two menus prepared by the chef - a traditional Swiss dish such as fondue or Raclette, or lighter fare. 

Don't like the cold? In the summer months, the pods are transformed to blend with the green snow-less landscape. Hiking and para-gliding are among the warm-weather activities available.
