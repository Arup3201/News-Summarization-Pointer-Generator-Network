Chelsea frontman Eden Hazard has revealed he will wear the No 10 shirt for the Blues next season.

The Belgium international - who is wanted by Paris Saint-Germain - will change from the No 17 shirt which he has worn since signing for the Stamford Bridge club from Lille two years ago.

Speaking to the club's official website, Hazard said: 'I am very pleased to be able to wear the number 10 for Chelsea.

'It is my 
favourite number and is one I am used to wearing for the national team, 
as well as the one worn by some of my heroes from when I was a kid, like
 Zinedine Zidane.

'I hope it brings me a lot of luck in the future and I look forward to the fans seeing me in it next season.'

However,
 with a number of supporters having already bought the new shirt with 
the 23-year-old's name and number 17 on the back, the club has said it 
will offer anybody who has proof of purchase from an official club store
 a free exchange - subject to availability until July 31.

In
 a special move by the west London club, the Blues will be donating all 
returned shirts to the Chelsea Foundation, the club's charity 
organisation.

Hazard joins an illustrious list of Chelsea stars who have worn the famous No 10 in the past including Juan Mata and Joe Cole.

Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi and current Stoke boss Mark Hughes also donned the shirt during the late nineties.
