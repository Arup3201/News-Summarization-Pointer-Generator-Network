Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, at Thames Magistrates' Court where he was fined after storming the pitch to take a free kick during a Premier League match

A judge joked as he fined a football fan who stormed the pitch to take a free kick during a Premier League match, telling him he 'bent it like Beckham... just a lot slower.'

Footage of Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, went viral on YouTube after he kicked the ball towards the goal West Ham United were defending at Upton Park against Tottenham Hotspur on August 16.

The 'free kick' was saved by West Ham’s Spanish goalkeeper Adrian San Miguel del Castillo  and Dunn was chased from the pitch by a steward as the crowd cheered.

Today, he was fined a total of £305 but spared a ban from attending future matches.

Passing sentence at Thames 
Magistrates’ Court in East London, District Judge Gareth Branston said: 'On the afternoon of August 16 about 35,000 football fans sat down at 
Upton Park to watch 22 men in shorts and football boots kick a football 
around for 90 minutes.

'Those 22 men were paid for that, to entertain.

'Some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch. That was you. You weren’t paid to do that.'

The
 judge said he proceeded to run 'some 70 yards' across the pitch, chased
 by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where
 Tottenham were lining up a free kick.

The judge said: 'You took it for them. To be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball.

'It was a longer run than was strictly necessary.

'You had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like Beckham. Regrettably it was about 30mph slower than Beckham.'

The
 judge said the effort was 'easily' saved by the West Ham goalkeeper but
 referred to Christian Eriksen’s subsequent effort after play restarted,
 saying: 'I understand that the professional footballer who followed you
 did not do any better.'

Judge Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by stewards.

Today
Dunn apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a 
charge under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states 
that it is an offence to go onto the playing area without lawful 
authority or excuse.

The judge said he had seen footage of the incident on YouTube and asked: 'Were you intending to take the free kick?'

Dunn
 replied: 'No. All I was going to do was run and as I was running I just
 saw the ball there so I thought I would just kick it.'

Dunn, who works as a receptionist at a hotel, said he has a ten-month old little boy.

Referring
 to the prospect of a banning order, he said: 'I was a bit concerned 
that when my little boy grows up I want to take him to watch the 
football.'

The judge asked if his mother had 'expressed disapproval'.

Dunn,
 who represented himself, said: 'At first she was concerned because she 
didn’t know the consequences but when she saw the YouTube video she saw 
the funny side but she has had a go at me, as a mother would.'

Today Dunn apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it is an offence to go onto the playing area without lawful authority or excuse

Ben Edwards, prosecuting, told Thames Magistrates’ Court in east London: 'At around 4pm in the afternoon the defendant was seen to jump the barrier separating football fans from the pitch and run along the pitch towards the goal.

'He was then seen to kick the football being placed on the ground for a free kick.'

Dunn told police in interview after he was arrested that he had been a West Ham fan since he was a little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to “run on the pitch and kick the ball”, the court heard.

Mr Edwards added: 'Now he could say he had done it. He also said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it again.'

Dunn declined to comment after the hearing.

The
 pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media, with one fan saying 
the effort was better than Spurs star Eriksen’s free kick once play had 
resumed.

He wrote on 
Twitter: 'Fair play to that pitch invader at West Ham v Spurs.. He got 
the Free kick on target when Eriksen couldn’t.'
