The Scottish mansion of disgraced former RBS boss Fred Goodwin has vanished from Google Street View just weeks after the search giant acknowledged users' 'right to be forgotten'.

The former banker's £3million home, in an exclusive suburb of Edinburgh, can no longer be viewed online - unlike the rest of his street.

Usually, users of the service can use Google to be shown street-level photographs of almost everywhere in the UK.

Vanished: Former RBS chief's Edinburgh home, pictured, can no longer be viewed on Google's street view

Hidden: Most of the area of Edinburgh where Mr Goodwin lives, marked in blue, is visible on the service. But a small area, circled, which contains his house can no longer be seen

But a small section of its map service - which covers the former banker's home and was once freely accessible - has since disappeared.

The search engine automatically blurs and obscures details such as faces and car numberplates to avoid breaching residents' privacy.

Mr 
Goodwin, whose management of the Royal Bank of Scotland contributed to 
the disastrous financial crash of 2008, has been held up as a figurehead
 of capitalist excess.

His house - one of two in the Scottish 
capital - has previously been targeted by vandals, who smashed windows 
at the home in 2009 as a protest against his riches from banking.

Catastrophic: Mr Goodwin, pictured, resigned from RBS in disgrace in 2009. A month later the bank announced a £24billion loss. The former chief executive was stripped of his knighthood in 2012

Close: Users can approach Mr Goodwin's house, but images further than the one shown have been erased

Google could not confirm whether Mr Goodwin had requested the removal, though insiders suggested it was in fact a bug in the system which stripped out the pictures.

But a spokesman for the search engine confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a 'compelling case' to convince them to remove images of their homes.

The company has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after a European court ruled that in favour of citizens' 'right to be forgotten'.

The legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or excessive'.

It is designed to allow people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant.

Services such as Google Street View would not be covered by the ruling - but there are fears that it could make it easier for people such as disreputable businessmen and minor criminals to cover up their past.

Fred Goodwin became one of Scotland’s best-known
 figures after his career in banking took off in 2000 and he presided 
over the Royal Bank of Scotland’s rapid rise to global prominence with 
assets of £1.9trillion

However, the ruling does include an exception for those who have prominent roles in public life.

Mr Goodwin, nicknamed 'Fred the Shred' in the City because of his ruthless approach to business, shot to prominence in 2000 and built RBS into a world financial player with a series of takeovers and mergers.

He was knighted in 2004 for 'services to banking', shortly after being named Global Businessman of the Year by Forbes magazine.

But the bank - once valued at almost £trillion - began racking up huge losses, and eventually needed an enormous taxpayer-funded bailout. The Government continues to own 64 per cent of the bank's shares.

Mr Goodwin's house was targeted by anti-capitalist protesters in 2009, three months after he resigned as RBS's chief executive.

He quit just one month before RBS unveiled a £24billion loss on its 2008 trading - the largest annual loss ever reported by a UK company.

Over the following years a chorus of outrage directed at Mr Goodwin continued to swell, culminating in his being stripped of his knighthood in 2012.

Mr Goodwin could not be reached for comment.
