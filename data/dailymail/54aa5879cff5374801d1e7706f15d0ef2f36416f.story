The selection of Middlesex batsman Robson means Lyth's Yorkshire team-mate and opening partner at county level, Alex Lees, will drop down the order to number three.

Jonathan Trott will captain a side which includes a strong pace attack of Liam Plunkett, Boyd Rankin, Jack Brooks and Mark Wood. Adil Rashid completes the bowling line-up as a leg-spinning all-rounder.

Jonny Bairstow will keep wicket as one of five players in the side who have can boast Test experience with England.

Captain Trott claimed earlier this week he needed to prove himself on the tour before he could think about rejoining the full England squad.

He said: 'I am like everyone else playing county cricket in that I have aspirations to play for England.

'I remember going on previous Lions trips in 2007 and 2008 and having to do my time on those and prove myself. That is something that I need to do again.'
