Hundreds of thousands of unsold tickets to some of the Olympics' most popular events are being secretly sold to corporate sponsors, despite pledges they would be offered to the British public, it has been reported.

The tickets, for events such as the opening ceremony, the gymnastics and the swimming finals, consist of returns that foreign Olympic committees have failed to sell.

The Games' organising committee Locog began offering them to sponsors and key officials through an internal ticketing system 12 days ago, but the public have so far been left out.

Hundreds of thousands of Olympics' tickets including some for the most popular events such as the opening ceremony have been secretly offered to sponsors

Last year, Chairman of London 2012 ,Lord Coe pledged such tickets should be put up for sale to the British public to help meet 'phenomenal and unprecedented' demand.

When tickets originally went on sale last year two thirds of applicants found themselves unable to buy any at all and the opening ceremony was 10 times oversubscribed.

The news that the public are being denied the opportunity to apply for the returns has provoked fury.

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Doocey, who is monitoring the Games on behalf of her party, told the Daily Telegraph: 'It’s absolutely disgraceful.

'The principle is completely wrong —there is no way that ticket returns should go to people who have already been incredibly well catered for.

'They should go to the long-suffering public and especially Londoners who have paid for these Games for the past decade.'

While there are still more than 
400,000 tickets still available to the public through the official 
website, most are for less popular events and are being sold at high 
prices.

They
 include more than 1.1 million football tickets available for between 
£20 and £40 as well as around 400,000 tickets to other sports.

Addressing the International Olympic Committee in July last year, Lord Coe had urged foreign commitees to return unwanted tickets to help meet domestic demand.

He said: 'My message is if you have tickets you have not yet sold then please send them back to us. I know people who would like them.

'Both domestically and internationally the demand for tickets has been phenomenal, I would actually say it has been unprecedented. 1.9 million people applied for 22 million tickets, we have 6.6 million to distribute.

'We have sold out in 23 out of 26 sports, that's an extraordinary vote of confidence in Olympic sport, not just in Britain but around the globe.'

National Olympic committees were given 12 per cent of tickets to sell, with an additional 5 per cent going to sporting federations and the IOC.

A spokesman for Locog confirmed the existence of the internal ticketing system but claimed that tens of thousands' of returned tickets would be put on public sale.

She told the Telegraph: 'We are determined that as many returns as possible will go to the British public.'
