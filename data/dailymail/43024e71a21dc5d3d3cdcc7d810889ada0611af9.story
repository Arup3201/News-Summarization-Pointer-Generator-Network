Regardless of your physical state, many fitness gadgets or apps try and push you that bit further.

But one new sports gizmo has a different approach – it’ll pipe up and tell you to sit back and put your feet up if it thinks a workout will result in an injury.

Called ‘Check’, by FAM Sports, the device searches for signs of fatigue in your nervous system before you set off for a run or begin pumping iron, and warns you if there’s a chance you could be overdoing it.

Assessment: The makers of the Check fitness gadget claim that their device can help prevent injuries by warning you if you're too tired for a workout

The gadget’s website boasts that the check takes just 15 seconds, with the assessment carried out via electrodes that are placed on the forearm (pictured above).

They send tiny pulses of electricity through the body and how your nervous system reacts to these will determine whether the gadget advises you to face the fitness music, or run a bath.

The website says that it’s ‘specifically aimed for sports requiring speed, strength, skill and coordination’.

And there are reportedly a number of Premier League footballers who are fans, so it's undoubtedly a useful bit of kit.

However, those not on a footballers' salary may find it prohibitively expensive.

It costs £225 and many might prefer instead to fashion training regimes for free with the help of common sense and internet research.

Safety first: The gadget measures the response of your nervous system  to electronic pulses before deciding whether you should throw in the towel
