Tasmanian independent politician Jacqui Lambie will miss parliament next week due to a minor surgical procedure on her back.

Senator Lambie said she had contacted the Senate president's office to make arrangements to have her votes recorded. 

In a video uploaded to YouTube, the former Palmer United Party member said she is looking forward to working with former colleague Glenn Lazarus, who has also left the Palmer Party.

In a video message posted on YouTube this week, the Jacqui Lambie said she would be doing her best to represent Tasmania from her hospital bed

Lazarus quit the party via text message and a Facebook post on Friday morning, accusing leader Clive Palmer of being a bully. 

In a statement addressing her operation, which is expected to keep her out of action for about a week, the senator said 'I'm looking forward to leaving hospital soon. However the doctors don't want me flying anywhere.'

The former soldier injured her back during an army field exercise in 1997.

In a video message posted on YouTube this week, the gown-clad senator said she wasn't very well, but would be doing her best to represent Tasmania from her hospital bed.

She said her heart went out to former Palmer United Party senator Glenn Lazarus.

Senator Lambie quit PUP in November after a bitter and very public slanging matche with her leader.

'I know you're feeling it. I know things are going to be a little bit rough over the next few weeks,' she said.

Senator Lambie said she had contacted the Senate president's office to make arrangements to have her votes recorded.

'Between the two of us and the other crossbenchers up there, we will be able to achieve a great deal in the future, there's no doubt about that.' 

There have been reports that Lambie and Lazarus had formerly clashed because Lambie believed she deserved to been made the Palmer Party's Senate leader.
