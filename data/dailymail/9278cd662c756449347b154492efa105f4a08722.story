Chelsea will consider loaning Andrej Kramaric to Leicester City as they look to close a £7.5m deal with his club for the striker on Monday.

Leicester have a £7.8m bid on the table for the HNK Rijeka goalscorer but the player wanted to move to a bigger club.

Juventus have also made a play for Kramaric but only wanted to offer £4.5m plus add-ons. If all is agreed on Monday the player is expected to travel to London on January 5 to have a medical.

Speaking ahead of the proposed move, Rijeka sporting director Ivan Mance told Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti: ‘I can confirm that our office received a formal offer by London's Chelsea’.

The contract is for four-and-a-half years and the player will initially be paid around £20,000-a-week after tax.

Kramaric, who has scored 28 goals in all competitions this season, has already agreed to join the Premier League leaders.
