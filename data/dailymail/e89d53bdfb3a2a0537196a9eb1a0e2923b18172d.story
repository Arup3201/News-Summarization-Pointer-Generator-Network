A cancer-sufferer attending a Christmas party at a Morton’s Steakhouse on Friday night was ordered to remove a beanie hat he was wearing to protect him from the cold in an unpleasant incident that escalated quickly when the manager called the police.

Robert Chambers, who runs and hosts a Tennessee shopping channel show called The Coin Vault,  is currently battling a treatable form of cancer which he was first diagnosed with in March.

Chambers was well enough to take his employees to dinner at the steakhouse’s downtown Nashville branch on Friday, but towards the end of meal he started to feel the cold and so put the beanie hat on his head.

Dress code: Cancer patient Robert Chambers was told to remove his hat because it broke Morton's restaurant rules

‘The chemo I had last gives me a cold sensitivity at the end of the day. It doesn't matter what I've done, there's a certain point.’ Chambers told NashvilleScene.com.

‘So I'm sitting there at the table, freezing and I put my toboggan on. We're two or three minutes away from walking out and the manager comes up behind me and says, “Would you please take that off in the dining room.” I said, “Sure.”’

Chambers was informed that he was in violation of the restaurant's dress code, even though it doesn’t actually say anything about hats and only suggests men wear business attire or smart casual wear.

While Chambers quickly obliged with the manager’s request, other members of the party - including his 23-year-old son - tried to explain that their was a perfectly legitimate medical reason for wearing  the hat indoors.

The manager then told the party that Chambers should have brought a doctor's note if he was going to wear a hat or called ahead and they could have been seated in a private dining area.

The manager then escalated the situation by flagged down a passing patrol car and asking two officer to help get the 14 person group to leave the restaurant.

The party promptly left, but disgusted at the manager’s treatment of Chambers and the group, several members took to restaurant review website Yelp to voice their disgust at their treatment in a restaurant where they had just spent $2,000.

'I will never step foot in this establishment again, and I will tell everyone that listens to take their business elsewhere,' wrote Jason M, one of the party who posted on Yelp.

Morton's COO Tim Whitlock personally reached out to Chambers apologize for his staff's poor behavior on Monday

The appalling behavior of the manager quickly caught other people’s attention online and they too began to leave messages of complaint on Morton’s Facebook page as well on Yelp.

As the incident escalated, the company’s COO Tim Whitlock personally reached out to Chambers apologize for his staff's poor behavior on Monday.

'There was a complete and total misunderstanding by our staff who had no idea that our guest had a medical condition.  Our actions were uninformed and our intentions were not malicious,' he said.

Afterwards Chambers posted on his Facebook page that he had accepted Whitlock's apology.

'He was very apologetic and we had a good discussion. End result, Morton's will make a donation in the amount of our check to St Jude's Children's Hospital. Apology accepted time (to) be on. I have more important things to fight than Morton's.'

Amanda W, a member of the Christmas party on Friday evening, write a one star review of the experience on Yelp not long after and helped to bring attention to the group's shoddy treatment
