A 5-year-old Kansas girl died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers.

The sequence of events began about 7:30 pm on Friday when Cadence Harris of Leavenworth was reported kidnapped, police said. Police said there was some relationship between the child and her abductor but would not provide details.

The suspect, however, has been identified by local news stations as 30-year-old Marcus McGowan. He was reportedly dating the girl's mother, Christie Harris.

Victim: Cadence Harris, 5, died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers

Suspect: Marcus McGowan, pictured, allegedly kidnapped Cadence on Friday night. He was reportedly in a relationship with her mother, Christie Harris

Scene: At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, police said

'The matter unfolded quite rapidly,' said Leavenworth Police Chief Patrick Kitchens, calling the girl's death tragic. 'We are still trying to sort out specifically what happened.'

Police in both Missouri and Kansas were involved in a chase as the suspect crossed the state line before the incident ended in the northeast Kansas town of Leavenworth. At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, Kitchens said.

'Anytime we have the loss of a small child it is devastating,' Kitchens told a news conference, adding that officers on the scene had tried to revive the girl.

He said it was not clear if the child was shot by her abductor, who was seriously wounded and is hospitalized in Kansas City.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) was called in to help investigate. Stressing that the probe only just getting under way, KBI Special Agent in Charge Mark Malick said it did not appear the girl was hit by bullets fired by police officers.

Mother: Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said that McGowan has previously abused her

Brother: McGowan's brother Andree McGowan has said he is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior

'Evidence we have at the scene at this time does not support any indication that gunfire struck the car or the victim, and specifically gunfire coming from law enforcement,' Malick said.

An autopsy was being carried out and would not be completed on Saturday, he told reporters.

Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said McGowan has a history of domestic violence in an interview with 41 Action News. She also told the station that McGowan was under the influence of drugs.

'He's hurt me before lots of times, but he's never hurt her,' she told the affiliate station. 'He's never even spanked her.

'She was perfect, she was beautiful, she was smart, she was perfect,' Harris also said.

McGowan choked Harris in 2009 and was convicted twice in 2011 for domestic battery, the Atchison Globe reported.

McGowan's brother Andree McGowan told KCTV5 he is 'having emotions' and is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior.

'It's testing our [family's] togetherness,' he also told the station. 'It's testing our will to stay together. Is it going to break us up or make us stronger?'
