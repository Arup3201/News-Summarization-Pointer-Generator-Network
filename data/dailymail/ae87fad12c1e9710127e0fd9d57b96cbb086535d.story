It was a hefty withdrawal, so Wendy Cleasby thought taking her cash out inside the bank was the safest option.

But that’s exactly where a pair of conmen were waiting to pounce.

Just inside the high street branch, the two Romanians who pointed out that she had just dropped £5 were actually tricking her into turning away... so they could steal her money from a cashpoint machine.

Wendy Cleasby, 53, was conned by the two Eastern European men as she withdrew money from a cash machine inside Santander bank in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire on May 27

She said scammers Floran Constantin Serban, 28, and Constantin Radu Serban, 22, (pictured behind her) appeared to be 'polite and charming' and told her she had 'dropped a £5 note' before stealing her cash

Footage shows Mrs Cleasby, 53, bending
 down to pick up the note – put there by scammers Floran Constantin 
Serban, 28, and Constantin Radu Serban, 22 – while they take the £300 
she had just withdrawn from  the ATM.

The
 pair have now been jailed for 16 weeks by Teesside magistrates after 
admitting the theft – and ordered to pay back the money between them.

Mrs
 Cleasby said she was withdrawing the cash in a Santander bank in 
Middlesbrough when she was approached by the ‘charming and polite’ men.

She said: ‘It was a perfectly timed con.

‘They knew what they were doing and must have rehearsed it hundreds of times.

One of the men swiped Wendy Cleasby's money from the cash machine while she bent down to pick up the £5 note the scammers conned her into thinking she had dropped. They were arrested after being caught on CCTV

‘It
 was all over within seconds. I had put my pin number in and had pressed
 the button for the money and it was at that same moment that the man 
told me I had dropped the money.’

The former warehouse worker added: ‘I told him it wasn’t mine, but he said it was as he saw me drop it.’

The
 conmen were later arrested after a member of the public recognised them
 from a CCTV image released by police. The footage shows the duo waiting
 behind Mrs Cleasby as she withdraws the money and checking around to 
see if anyone was looking.

They can then be seen swiping the money while she turns around and bends down to reach for the £5 note.

The men were each handed a 16-week prison sentence after they both admitted a charge of theft at Teesside Magistrates' Court but Mrs Cleasby (pictured) is now warning others to remain vigilant at cash machines

The cost of providing interpreters to assist Romanians appearing at magistrates and crown courts for criminal cases has hit more than £800,000.

Freedom of Information requests to the Ministry of Justice revealed that the bill was £804,846 for the period from February 2012 to January 2013.

The money was paid to Capita Translation and Interpreting, which won the contract to provide translations services in January 2012. The bill for the final month was £89,387.

Previously, courts in England relied on local interpreters.

Last month the Mail revealed that the annual cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters to assist all non-English speakers had almost doubled in just one year to £15.5million.

Mrs
 Cleasby, from Acklam, explained: ‘I bent down to get it and when I got 
back up I waited for my cash to come out the machine, but it didn’t 
come.

'It said on the screen, “Your transaction has finished” and my card
 was given back to me.

'It took me a while to register what had happened 
but I then twigged on. Another man had taken the money while I bent 
over. I had been completely conned.’

Mrs
 Cleasby, who is not working because of a bad back, told a member of 
staff what had happened and police were called after the bank’s CCTV 
cameras were checked.

She added: ‘I was completely shocked and stunned. I just couldn’t believe it.

‘It
 is not something you expect to happen. I chose to use the cashpoint 
inside the bank rather than the one on the street as I thought it would 
be safer.

'Those men had zero respect for me. They didn’t care 
whatsoever. They just pounced.

‘It wouldn’t surprise me if they had done it to other people. I was so angry.’

Mrs Cleasby warned other cashpoint users to be vigilant.

She
 said: ‘The man was very polite when he spoke to me and I had no reason 
to doubt him. It just shows that anyone can do these things – you just 
don’t know.’
