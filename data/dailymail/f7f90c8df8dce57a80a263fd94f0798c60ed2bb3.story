Katarina Johnson-Thompson will compete in the 200metres hurdles and long jump at the Great CityGames Manchester in May.

The 22-year-old, who broke Jessica Ennis-Hill's British pentathlon record to land gold at the European Indoor Championships in Prague last week, will compete in the city-centre street athletics event for the first time on May 9.

'I've seen the events on television before and love the idea of competing so close to the public. I can't wait to experience it first-hand for the first time,' she said.
