WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tried to block the memoir

Despite his attempts to block an explosive autobiography, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's story has been published.

The accused rapist was warned that the US government wanted to set him up, according to an unofficial autobiography published today despite his attempts to block its release.

In the book, titled Julian Assange: The Unauthorised Autobiography, the controversial whistle-blowing website's creator also admits sleeping with the two women who have made sexual assault claims against him.

But he says the rape allegations are either part of the US conspiracy against him or motivated by his failure to return their calls.

Publishers Canongate Books decided to put the memoir on sale after Assange, who is on bail in Britain facing extradition to Sweden, attempted to cancel his contract after reading a first draft.

Assange, 40, said he wanted to cancel his 
contract in June, but by this time he had already signed his advance 
over to his lawyers to settle his legal bills for fighting extradition.

The website founder has complained he will have to buy a copy of his own newly-published autobiography to find out its contents after he failed to block its release.

The WikiLeaks founder tried to cancel his contract for the memoir after reading a first draft, but publishers Canongate Books went ahead with its publication today against his wishes.

Assange condemned Edinburgh-based Canongate's publication of the book, billed on the cover as an 'unauthorised autobiography', describing it as a case of 'screwing people over to make a buck'.

He said the published memoir was a 
'work in progress' written by his Scottish ghost-writer Andrew O'Hagan, 
based on interviews and stressed it was 'entirely uncorrected or 
fact-checked by me'.

Battle: Assange wanted the book to be scrapped, but publishers printed it

In a strongly-worded statement, he 
added: 'I will have to buy 'my autobiography' in order to learn the 
extent of the errors and inaccuracies of the content of the book, but 
the damage is done.'

In one excerpt, published today by 
The Independent, the hacker gives his version of the background to the 
sexual assault allegations, claiming he met both women - named only as A
and W - in Sweden during the furore that surrounded his website's 
leaking of sensitive US documents, before having consensual sex with 
them.

The book includes insights into Assange's chaotic life as his group became famous around the world for its leaks of highly sensitive records.

The Australian - who admits he is 'some kind of weirdo' with a reputation for 'workaholism and infrequent bathing' - travelled the world carrying only 'a bag of socks and underwear, and a bigger bag of laptops and cables', and once had his hair cut as he worked at his computer.

His passionate belief in his cause shines through in the book, in which he describes WikiLeaks as the 'first intelligence agency of the people'.

Assange accused Canongate of acting 'in breach of contract, in breach of confidence, in breach of my creative rights and in breach of personal assurances' by publishing the memoir.

'This book was meant to be about my life's struggle for justice through access to knowledge. It has turned into something else,' he said.

'The events surrounding its unauthorised publication by Canongate are not about freedom of information, they are about old-fashioned opportunism and duplicity - screwing people over to make a buck.'

He claimed he sought to draw up a fresh contract with a new deadline so the book could be revised extensively.

Canongate issued a statement in which it accused Assange of offering a 'distorted version of events', adding: 'We believe in the book and maintain we were right to publish it.'

Bookshops only learned about the memoir's publication yesterday, and copies were delivered under strict instructions that the boxes could not be opened until this morning.

'I did not rape those women and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so, except malice after the fact, a joint plan to entrap me, or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them,' he says.

'I may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but I am no rapist, and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one. They both had sex with me willingly and were happy to hang out with me afterwards.'

He claims in the book that a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him just before the rape allegations emerged that the US government was considering dealing with him 'illegally'.

The source allegedly said Washington officials were discussing everything from planting drugs or child pornography to embroiling him in 'allegations of immoral conduct'.

He said he knew he was not safe after the arrest in May last year of US Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, 23, who lived in Wales as a teenager, on suspicion of leaking classified information to WikiLeaks.

'I recognised, even then, that forces would always be after me, and they would trap me in some way or another before long,' he writes.

Assange does not confirm that Manning provided his organisation's biggest revelations, saying WikiLeaks's 'deniability structures' made it impossible for him to know whether he was the source.

But he says the young American soldier would be 'a hero of democracy and justice who had taken a role in saving lives' if he had supplied such information.

Assange, 40, who made headlines around the world with revelations from leaked US military files and diplomatic cable, also reveals how a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him that the American government was considering dealing with him 'illegally'.

He said the source said means such as planting drugs and child pornography or embroiling him 'in allegations of immoral conduct', were being discussed.

Warnings about the potential use of a 'honeytrap' were also made by people close to him, the book says.

In another passage, Assange talks about the 'addictive' thrill of hacking into the networks of high profile organisations, including the Pentagon and Nasa, as a young adult.

He reportedly gave 50 hours of interviews about his life and the work of WikiLeaks to his Scottish ghost-writer Andrew O'Hagan.

But he became 'increasingly troubled' about the thought of publishing an autobiography and after seeing the first draft in March declared: 'All memoir is prostitution', according to the publishers.

Edinburgh-based Canongate said it would pay Assange, who is currently living at his bail address of Ellingham Hall in Norfolk, royalties. The book will go on sale priced £20 for the hardback and £14.99 for the ebook.
