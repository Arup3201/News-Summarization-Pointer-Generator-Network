Steve Bruce has hailed Hatem Ben Arfa’s professionalism and revealed the French winger is putting in extra hours to make his loan at Hull a success.

Ben Arfa arrived at Hull on transfer deadline in September with questions about his attitude, having fallen out with Newcastle boss Alan Pardew. There was a feeling at St James’ Park that he was disruptive influence.

Since arriving at Hull, though, he has made a big impression on Bruce and he was one of their brighter players in the 0-0 draw with Liverpool.

‘I thought long and hard about Ben Arfa, believe me,’ said Bruce. ‘With his ability, why should I be able to loan him to come and play for Hull? Obviously it means he's not everyone's cup of tea.

‘But the past seven weeks, he has been terrific. He's been back in the afternoon, done everything I've asked of him.

‘I told him when he I spoke to that we have created a fantastic spirit. I wanted him to enjoy coming to play and work. As long as you come in and try hard, that's all I ask.’
