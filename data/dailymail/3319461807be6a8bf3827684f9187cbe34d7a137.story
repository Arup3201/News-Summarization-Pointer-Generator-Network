An 82-year-old woman who has a criminal record stretching back to 1955 is back behind bars after being accused of raiding a string of doctors' offices.

Doris Thompson, who has had 25 aliases over her 55-year crime spree, is facing possible charges over eight burglaries in Torrance, California.

Torrance Police Sgt Robert Watt claims Thompson would enter medical offices and hide until closing before searching for the keys to the cash box.

It is said she made off with around $17,000.

The pensioner was arrested after a detective recognised her distinctive wiry grey hair, which has been likened to that of boxing promoter Don King, on a video that allegedly caught her in the act.

She is being held on $80,000 bail after being arrested at an El Segundo hotel, it was reported on KTLA.com.

Thompson has a 20-page rap sheet which starts with her first-known arrest in 1955 for disturbing the peace.

Since then, she has been apprehended 34 times, convicted of several thefts and a forgery.

According to Thompson has been imprisoned at least nine times for burglary in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

She even managed a prison escape, in 1984, while serving a 30-day term.

Her
last offence was two years ago when she was caught prying open drawers 
with a screwdriver at the Children's Medical Group before taking $400 in
cash and checks, and a plastic urine container with a total value of 
about $1,400.

After pleading guilty, she thanked the judge for sentencing her to three years in prison.

Referring to her criminal strategy at the time, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paulette Paccione said: 'That's her M.O.

'What she does is she goes in with her little burglar bag. She takes cash, stamps, whatever she can find.'
