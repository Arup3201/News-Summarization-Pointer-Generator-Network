Householders face being forced to recycle more after the government admitted it is falling behind European targets.

Despite years of efforts by families to meet the demands of fortnightly collections, nine-bin collections, kitchen slop buckets and other compulsory recycling schemes, recycling rates remain too low to comply with EU rules.

Recycling figures flatlined last year, according to figures released by the Environment Department yesterday.

Grinding to a halt: Recycling figures have flatlined in the last year meaning ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to do more

They suggest the great recycling revolution - imposed on a majority of homes in the country when their traditional weekly rubbish collections were withdrawn - has reached its limits and families are unwilling to do more to help.

The failure means ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to put out more of their refuse in a way that can be easily recycled.

Among methods that have been under consideration are compulsory systems involving a string of separate recycling bins for every home, or monthly bin collections which mean that rubbish not separated for recycling is collected by binmen only once every four weeks.

The new figures from Owen Paterson’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that the amount of household waste recycled in the year to the end of March was 43.2 per cent, up just 0.2 per cent on the previous year’s level.

A report from DEFRA said there was ‘much variation across local authorities’.

It added: ‘The rate of increase in the last year is insufficient to meet the 50 per cent EU target by 2020.

Not enough: Owen Paterson's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says recyling of household waste went up just 0.2 per cent

‘The household recycling rate was increasing rapidly until recent years. The rapid rise occurred while local authorities were introducing and expanding their recycling collection schemes.’ According to the report, only just over one in five of the 352 local councils that collect household rubbish succeeded in reaching the 50 per cent recycling target.

Among setbacks were a drop of 10 per cent in the amount of glass and cans collected from homes in recycling bins, and a drop of six per cent in the amount of paper and card separated from other rubbish.

‘This may be due to various factors including more use of co-mingled collections or change in consumer behaviour to minimise waste,’ the report said.

It added that there was a low collection rate for green waste in the first three months of this year ‘resulting from the freezing temperature and bad weather conditions.’

An Environment Department spokesman said that ministers are determined to hit the EU recycling target.

‘We are working with local authorities and communities to meet our 50 per cent target by 2020,’ she said.

‘Local authorities can continue to collect mixed waste as long as the quality of recycling is high enough. It is up to local authorities to decide what works best in their local area within the law.’

Ministers have warned councils that to meet the terms of EU recycling law they must from 2015 do their best to collect household waste paper, plastic, metal and glass separately.

The instructions raise the prospect of every house being given five bins or their rubbish, four for separate recycling materials and one for general waste. However Government regulations on how councils will be expected to put the rules into effect have yet to be published.

More than half the homes in the country have fortnightly collections, kitchen slopbuckets or other compulsory recycling systems.

However material that is set out for recycling is often too impure to be recycled, and is incinerated, landfilled or sent abroad for recycling in Third World countries.

Doretta Cocks of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections said she feared ministers may now revive the ‘pay-as-you-throw’ idea, which would mean families would have to pay to get their rubbish collected. Gordon Brown’s government adopted the idea but dropped it when it proved unpopular.

Mrs Cocks said: ‘I am not at all surprised at the new figures. They have reached the recycling limit.

‘They are not getting the quality of recyclate they need. Sometimes councils are not entirely honest about the amount of material that goes for recycling.

‘The worry is that they will bring out the stick to persuade people to recycle. I am worried they will revive pay-as-you-throw.’
