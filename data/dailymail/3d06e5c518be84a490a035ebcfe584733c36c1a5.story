London's landscape has featured in countless images over the years but none can evoke what it's really like to be among the bustling crowds of the city centre, or to sit under the trees in Regents Park.

To try and capture the unique sounds of the city, archivist Ian Rawes has created the London Sound Survey - an online collection of field recordings, sound maps, early BBC radio actuality and more.

As part of this project, Rawes travelled London's canals and rivers during during 2011 and 2012 recording ambient sounds along the way and has plotted these on his Underground-inspired Waterways map.

Rawes travelled along Regents Canal, Grand Union canal, Beverly Brook and more. Each waterway was assigned a colour from the London Underground map

Although the map follows London’s 
canals and smaller rivers, noises from other landmarks including the M4 
bridge, London Zoo and Victoria Park are also featured.

The recordings are grouped together based by location and tube lines.

the recording plays, the file details are shown above the map.

These
 details include how long the clip is, the date and time it was 
recorded, the location and a brief description about what can be heard.

To listen to a recording, users can click a placeholder name, such as Little Venice, pictured left, to listen to the ambient sounds around that location. The recording of Little Venice, stock image pictured right, was recorded on 15 July 2011 at 6.15am and features a narrowboat's propeller churning through the water

For
 example, the Victoria Park recording was taken on 9 July 2011 at 11am. 
It was recorded by Regent's Canal at Victoria Park, Hackney, in east 
London and includes ‘loud birdsong from nearby trees and buddleia 
bushes, traffic in background, a bicycle passes making a noise on loose 
concrete paving slabs.’

Rawes travelled along canals, brooks and more. Each waterway has been assigned a colour from the London Underground map

‘Listening
 to a recording of the sounds of a place or event gets the imagination 
working and recreates some of the sense of being there,’ explained 
Rawes.

‘It feels like a worthwhile end in itself simply to share those experiences with whoever's willing to listen.’

Ian Rawes got the idea for the project while working at the British Library Sound Archives.

Describing why he feels sound is the best way to document the city, Rawes told Ear Room: ‘I’d lived away from London for about ten years and found it hard to settle for a while when I moved back.

'London struck me as very anonymous and indifferent. Literary attempts to describe the city as an organism or having some sort of enduring spirit just seemed fanciful.’

Rawes admitted that the Thames is one of his favourite places because ‘you get a mixture of industry, scraps of marshland, housing, and seemingly un-owned bits of land which are used for scrambler bikes and clay-pigeon shooting’, along with Brixton that has a ‘wide array of soundscapes because it’s the pole star of Caribbean culture in London and there are several indoor and street markets.' 

The recordings are grouped based on where they were taken. For example, locations along the River Lea, pictured, are shown along the green line, which would traditionally represent the District Line on the original tube map
