Revealed: Just 77 out of 7,963 allegations of racism made against the police have been upheld since 2005

Less than one per cent of racism complaints are upheld against the police, new figures reveal.

Out of 7,963 allegations levelled against forces in England and Wales, just 77 have been followed through since 2005.

And 43 officers singled out for their alleged discrimination have not been disciplined.

The revelations, uncovered by a Channel 4 Dispatches programme using Freedom of Information requests, will cast doubts over the police's repeated pledges to rid the force of racism.

The Metropolitan Police, Britain’s largest force, upheld just 20 out of 4,730 allegations of racism (0.4 per cent) between 2005 and 2012.

Greater Manchester, North Yorkshire and Lancashire upheld none of the allegations reported to them at all.

It is a damning account of police activity over the past decade despite numerous pledges to stamp out racism.

Since 1999, and the release of the Macpherson report exposing institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police Force, bosses have repeatedly vowed to tackle the issue as a priority.

But
 when presented with the new figures, Dame Anne Owers, chair of watchdog
 the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), admitted the force
 was failing to act on complaints.

She told the programme: 'What we’ve found when we’ve dug into the way that forces handle complaints of race discrimination and indeed discrimination in general is that they don’t do it well and the evidence seems to be that those complaints are less likely to be upheld than other kinds of complaints.'

Stephen Lawrence's brother, Stuart, condemned the statistics more than 20 years after the racist murder, which sparked the Macpherson report.

Calling for serious action to be taken, he tells the documentary how his complaint was upheld by the Independent Police Complaints Commission - only to be dismissed by the police themselves.

Mike Cunningham, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'There is no place for racism in the police service.

'That is a fundamental requirement of being a member of the British police service and if an officer fails short of those high expectations... they ought to be dismissed.'

Since filming the programme, due to screen tonight, three police officers in England and Wales have been dismissed.

One of the officers who was accused in a civil court of taking part is still employed by the police, according to Dispatches.
