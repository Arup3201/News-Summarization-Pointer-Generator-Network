For most of its working life it was more often seen thousands of feet in the air, jetting passengers off to far-flung and exotic destinations.

But this decommissioned Airbus A321 ended up causing motorway traffic jams as it made its final journey to an aeroplane graveyard yesterday.

Accompanied by a police escort, the partially-dismantled aircraft was on its way to Cotswold Airport, in Gloucestershire, from South Wales.

Abnormal load: A partially-dismantled aeroplane caused tailbacks as it made its way from South Wales to Cotswold Airport, in Gloucestershire

Tailbacks: The slow-moving load took up two lanes across the M4 and caused tailbacks yesterday

Natural setting: The Airbus A321 in its more usual setting, coming in to land at Heathrow Airport

Measuring 20ft wide, 16ft high and 151ft long, the 'abnormal load' weighed 58 tonnes.

Before the weekend police were keen to warn motorists the plane could cause delays, with a spokesman saying: 'Due to the size of this transporter it will be slow moving and will have the potential to create congestion.

'Wherever possible, disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load.

'Anyone travelling over this period to catch a flight or meet appointments should allow sufficient additional time.'

The massive fuselage, which took up 
two lanes across the M4, was due to travel on the second weekend in 
February but storms delayed its journey.

The A321, which is is the largest member of the Airbus A320 family, was launched in 1988 and first delivered in 1994.

It has an extended operating range of 3,000 nautical miles and can carry 185 passengers.

Cotswold Airport features the biggest graveyard for aeroplanes in the UK.

The team at Air Salvage International, based at the airport, oversee the demolition process which can see a mighty Boeing 747 reduced to scrap metal in just three days.

Air Salvage International was formed more than 16 years ago and by the end of 2013 was due to have dismantled about 550 aircrafts across the world.

It moved from Alton, in Hampshire, to Cotswold Airport in 2009, setting up base in Hangar J1.

It took over 130,000 sq ft of hangar space formerly used by Aeronautic and Delta Jets.

The Airbus A321 is the largest member of the A320 family.

It has an extended operating range of 3,000 nautical miles and can carry 185 passengers.

The model was launched in 1988 and first delivered in 1994. It features a stretched fuselage compared to the standard A320.

The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircrafts of digital fly-by-wire flight controls.

By July 2013, a total of 5,677 aircraft from the family had been delivered, with 5,481 still in service.

It was the world's fastest-selling jet airline from 2005 to 2007, according to records.
