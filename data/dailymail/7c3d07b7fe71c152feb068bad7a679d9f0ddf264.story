With a menu of crisped halibut in ginger carrot sauce, compressed avocados and a mango creme brulee, washed down with a shafer chardonnay, it seems the White House had gone all out for last night's private dinner.

Which made it a bit of a shame that there was only one item on the menu that guest of honor Narendra Modi could order: a simple glass of warm water.

The Indian prime minister was dining with Barak Obama as part of his five-day trip to New York and Washington ahead of formal talks taking place today.

The Indian prime minister was meeting with Barak Obama for a 'working dinner' as part of his five-day trip to New York and Washington ahead of formal talks taking place today

But since Modi was in the midst of a strict nine-day religious fast, he was unable to enjoy the lavish dinner menu and instead made do with sipping on a glass of warm water, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry, told reporters that as Indian and US officials sat down to dinner, Modi told the group: 'Please don't feel embarrassed and please continue with your food.'

So while Modi settled for water, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other officials dined on dishes including crisped halibut, goats cheese and bell peppers, and compressed avocados. 

Modi, who has described the religious fast as 'a source of strength, power and inspiration', forgoes all food during the nine days of the Hindu festival of Navratri.

After the brief statement, there was no additional talk of his fast. 'There were many other important issues to discuss,' Mr Akbaruddin said.

During the 'working dinner', the two leaders vowed  to expand and deepen their countries' strategic partnership and make it a model for the rest of the world.

In a joint 'vision statement' issued after their meeting, they said they would work together 'not just for the benefit of both our nations, but for the benefit of the world'.

They said their countries would cooperate on security and to fight terrorism and would back a 'rules based' global order in which India assumes greater multilateral responsibility, including a reformed U.N. Security Council.

They also vowed to work together against the threat posed by climate change and to cooperate to address the consequences of unchecked pollution.

'We have a vision that the United States and India will have a transformative relationship as trusted partners in the 21st century. Our partnership will be a model for the rest of the world,'  their statement said.

The two leaders also said their countries would work to ensure that economic growth brought better livelihoods for all people and stressed the importance of open markets and fair and transparent practices to allow trade to flourish.

Washington has been keen to expand business and security ties with India, which it sees as a key counterbalance to an increasingly assertive China in Asia. Obama has backed New Delhi's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

However, the relationship has failed to live up to his declaration in 2010 that it would become 'one of the defining partnerships of the 21st Century'.

Modi, who came to power in May, has received a warm welcome in the United States, even though he was denied a visa in 2005 over rioting in his home state three years earlier that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. 

Modi denies any wrongdoing and has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court investigation.

He has maintained a frantic schedule since arriving in America on Friday, even though he is fasting in accordance with Hindu custom.

As part of an effort to spur foreign investment, he met more than a dozen U.S. corporate leaders early on Monday and told them he was committed to liberalizing India's economy, which has underperformed other emerging markets recently after years of breakneck growth.

On Saturday, Modi addressed the U.N. General Assembly and then appeared before some 60,000 people at a musical event in New York's Central Park aimed at ending global poverty and bringing essentials such as sanitation to all.

On Sunday, he received a rapturous welcome from a big crowd of Indian-Americans in an appearance in New York's Madison Square Garden arena. 

Modi's spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, said the dinner meeting was 'extremely convivial' and the two leaders found they had a common interest in technology and shared experience in that they were relative political outsiders before coming to power.

He said they agreed they 'should focus on some big things they can achieve in a finite time period in the next few years'.
