A California man has stolen the crown of husband of the year, by surprising his wife with a birthday trip to London.

And as a reminder of the occasion, the cheeky husband, from Upland, in San Bernardino County, recorded his wife's reaction to the gift.

'My wife wasn't able to travel much growing up,' he wrote online. 'She had always wanted to go to Europe, especially London, and we had always talked about going someday.'

In this sweet video, a woman from Upland, California, receives the ultimate birthday surprise from husband

Unbeknownst to his wife, her loving husband had began saving money for the trip of her dreams.

'I wanted to deliver the surprise to her in a really exciting way,' he explained. 

'She was already so excited to go to Santa Barbara for her birthday weekend that the thought of going to Europe would be totally off her radar.'

'She told me not to get her anything else for her birthday, but I got her a few 'small' presents anyway.'

The woman had wanted to visit London for many years, so her husband made her a travel scrapbook

After flipping through pages of iconic London imagery, his wife unfolded her real gift: airline tickets!

The video starts out inconspicuously enough, with him presenting his wife with a wrapped gift, telling her to open it in front of him. 

'The first one she opened was a dress that she wanted and the second one was the scrapbook,' he wrote later.

'It's just something in case we travel,' her husband explains off camera, as his wife pulls the large travel photo album out of the gift bag.

At first, she was too shocked to believe it, but as it sunk in, she began to cry tears of joy

Her husband had booked the entire two-week getaway unbeknownst to her - including accommodations

As she flips through, she notices that every picture slot is filled with iconic London imagery.

'Just in case we ever go to London, so I decided to fill it with stuff,' her husband explains.

'I decided to sort of play off of our 'dream' of going to Europe some day by filling the book with pictures of our 'would be' trip, since we talk about it so often,' he wrote online after the fact. 

Later, her husband explained the video online, saying that his wife had never really travelled as a child

She had long wanted to go to England and the two had often talked about their 'would be' European trip

And when she gets to the final page of photographs, she finds an airline ticket sticking out. 

'I knew she wouldn't expect there to be actual tickets included - that's why it takes a moment for it to sink in.' 

His shocked wife questions at first whether or not they are really going, before beginning to tear up and bury her face in her hands. 

As she wipes away tears, her husband tells her that the photos are actually of where they will be staying

'Oh my gosh,' the woman exclaims, once she's able to regain her composure. 'I have to get a passport!'

'I've always wanted to go!' she says through her tears.

And just when she didn't think the news could get better, her husband revealed that the images of London that he had filled the book with her actually photographs of the flat that they will be staying in.

'Oh my gosh, I have to get a passport!' she exclaims.
