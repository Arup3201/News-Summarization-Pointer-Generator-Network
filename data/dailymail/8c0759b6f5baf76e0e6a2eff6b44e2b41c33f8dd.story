By time up the sighs of relief from the Celtic directors box very nearly drowned out the howls of outrage and anger from their St Johnstone counterparts. Almost, but not quite.

Celtic will wake on Thursday morning to learn if Legia Warsaw have been judged to be the victims of an over-officious UEFA injustice.

There was no right of appeal for St Johnstone on Wednesday night. No way of reversing the two significant penalty calls from referee John Beaton which saw Ronny Deila’s first competitive domestic game end in a comfortable victory.

Attendance: 6890.

Man of the match: James Forrest

A week after finding himself in the eye of a storm for red carding Hibs player Danny Handling at Ibrox, Beaton was in the spotlight once more. If referees really are looking for a pay rise, this is the kind of game unlikely to help their cause much.

It all hinged on six minutes and two key incidents involving Saints skipper Dave Mackay.

The first saw the right-back race the length of the field to remonstrate after the raised boot of Virgil van Dijk appeared to make clear contact in the Celtic penalty area. No penalty, said the referee.

On the touchline Tommy Wright writhed and gyrated, incensed with the verdict. His mood was scarcely aided by the spot kick given at the other end five minutes later. It was, in truth, a horrible decision.

Derk Boeriggter hasn’t done much to enhance his reputation in Scottish football. His exaggerated tumble as he tried to wriggle clear of Mackay in the St Johnstone area is unlikely to improve the situation.

Mackay – already booked – was shown an instant red card for an alleged infringement. Yet the Dutchman appeared to throw himself to the ground a full step after any semblance of contact, such as it was. The dismissal added insult to substantial injury.

Already a goal down to an Anthony Stokes opportunist finish in 55 minutes, St Johnstone were done for.

Nir Biton struck the penalty kick calmly into the net for his first Celtic goal. The third, a squirming low shot from Callum McGregor which wriggled horribly past Alan Mannus in 84 minutes, even though he got his hands to it, only compounded the St Johnstone anguish.

The home support left at the end muttering their claims of Celtic cheating. The away support were diverted – however briefly – from their state of simmering discontent over Celtic’s transfer spend. Or lack of it.

Seventy two hours before Fergus McCann unfurls the league flag there was a Bunnetesque sense of déjà vu as a banner in the Celtic support read: ‘Back the Team, sack the board.’

It was gone by time up. As was the Maribor assistant coach who travelled to Perth in expectation of hosting Celtic next Wednesday night. UEFA notwithstanding.

His report will surely speak of a scoreline flattering the champions slightly.

In truth Celtic rarely have it easy in Perth, winning just one of their last four visits on league business.

The injured Aleksandar Tonev was missing, while Manchester City’s on loan defender Jason Denayer started on the bench. The opening 45 minutes demonstrated why Ronny Deila’s next priority is to sign a striker.

Leigh Griffiths – a player who might be the best option in the current impoverished circumstances – was axed from the squad completely. That, you sense, is a developing story.

Stoke partnered Kris Commons up front once more in a conventional 4-4-2 – a departure from Deila’s preferred 4-2-3-1. Not for the first time the Irishman frustrated the life out of his supporters in the first half before delivering the goal which changed the game with an opportunist finish.

The goal was well-timed. Without Stevie May, the talisman sold to Sheffield Wednesday, St Johnstone had their best spell at the start of the second half.

The first period had been a non event. James Forrest had a bright 45 minutes on his first start for some time, but limped off in increasingly characteristic fashion in 57 minutes for Boeriggter, a critical change.

Aside from Forrest, a competitive start for Craig Gordon marked the only other bright spot of the opening 45 for Deila.

The former Scotland keeper might soon be the current Scotland No1 if he stays fit. Replacing Fraser Forster he looked assured and confident, producing the only save of note in a pretty dreadful opening period when he pushed away Steven MacLean’s 20 yard drive in the 22nd minute.

Forrest was a bundle of energy, adding more balance and width to Celtic’s play. He played a terrific one-two with Commons in 15 minutes and cut inside before striking a disappointing left foot low drive.

But Celtic’s next chance came a full 23 minutes later, Stokes fouled on the edge of the box by Mackay and striking the free kick narrowly wide himself.

Within five minutes of the restart Saints came close to taking the lead when Michael O’Halloran retrieved Lee Croft’s inviting ball across goal and cut inside, his driven angled shot almost turned into goal by MacLean from close range.

Celtic, it seemed, were on the back foot. St Johnstone were knocking on the door.

Yet that changed completely when Steven Anderson dallied in possession in his own final third and was dispossessed by a pressing Commons. Stokes collected, kept his cool and rounded Mannus to slot an angled low shot into the net for 1-0.

McGregor almost added another seconds later, taking a ricocheted Emilio Izaguirre cross and thumping just wide. His moment would come.

But only after the penalty incidents which defined this game. The Mackay claim after the raised boot by van Dijk. The Boeriggter flashpoint which left St Johnstone flushed and fuming.

At 2-0 it wasn’t over yet. McGregor’s useful knack of scoring goals continued when his low shot at the end of a neat passing move slipped and squirmed and evaded Mannus for 3-0.

The Celtic youngster could have had another moments later but the champions – and Deila – had the win they craved at the end of a difficult fortnight.
