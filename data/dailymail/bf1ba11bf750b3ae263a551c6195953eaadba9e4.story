A truck which caught fire during a mysterious traffic incident that left one man dead had $1million stored in the back, authorities have revealed.

Eric Royster was driving his 18-wheel vehicle on Interstate 20 in Harrison County, East Texas, when it went up in flames.

When he stepped out onto the highway to inspect the damage, he was mowed down and killed by a car coming the other way. 

Mystery: Authorities in Harrison County, East Texas, found $1million in cash inside a burned out truck and are now trying to figure out who it belongs to
