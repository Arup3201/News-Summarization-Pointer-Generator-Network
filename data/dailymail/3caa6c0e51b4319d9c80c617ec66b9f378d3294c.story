'Liar': Patricia Glancy stole almost £11,000 in deposits from brides and grooms-to-be

A wedding planner at the renowned Wentworth Golf Club stole almost £11,000 in deposits from couples hoping to get married at the luxury venue.

Patricia Glancy, ‘lied her head off’, cheating brides and grooms-to-be out of their costly holding fees by transferring them into her own bank account.

The 36-year-old from Ascot, Berkshire said that she stole the money to support cancer charities - a claim the judge said he thought was a lie.

Glancy claimed she had started stealing money from the happy couples when she was forced to call off her own wedding after discovering her fiancé had been unfaithful and got one of his many lovers pregnant.

Glancy, who goes by the name Lee, defrauded five couples of nearly £10,800 between March 1 and June 6 this year - before complaining about being bullied and resigning from her job at the club.

She arranged the transfer of one payment to her account and told four other couples she would stamp their cheques with the club details - only to then insert her own.

Glancy was employed in the role of sales events manager at Wentworth, in picturesque Virginia Water, Surrey between January 16, 2012 and May 31, 2013.

The club is the centre of the golfing world every year when it plays host to the PGA championship on its manicured greens.

Guildford Crown Court heard how a close friend of Glancy’s was dying of cancer and Glancy herself had lost three family members to the disease so she had wanted to financially support her friend and cancer charities.

Trina Little, prosecuting, said the first of five misdirected payments, which ranged between £1,200 and £2.650, had been made by bank transfer but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, she gave her own.

In the other four cases Glancy asked customers for cheques - telling them to leave the payee’s name blank - and she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp. But she filled in her own name instead.

The problem only came to light when when bride-to-be Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email about her booking and a message bounced back saying she had left the club.

Wentworth began an investigation into the activities of Glancy, but they could not find the files as the fraudster had taken them with her when she resigned.

In August after consulting her lawyers, Glancy went to a police station and confessed to her crimes.

She was charged with five counts of committing fraud by false representation, which she admitted.

Miss Little said Glancy had told police she was extremely sorry for her actions and that her friend Thelma Harte had terminal cancer and the money was given to a cancer charity and ‘to make some of her wishes come true’.

Robert Spencer-Bernard, mitigating, confirmed Miss Harte had died and referred to the order of service from her funeral, at which Glancy spoke. in which the deceased’s children thanked those who had helped realise her dream of visiting Canada.

He added that Glancy had also lost her uncle, grandmother and her sister to breast cancer. 

Mr Spencer-Bernard said she had also been jilted by her fiance who ‘had been unfaithful with a number of women and one of them was pregnant by him.’

‘That is the background as to why, at the age of 36, she does something wholly, utterly out of character.’

Judge Peter Moss deferred passing sentence but told Glancy that he thought she was lying.

He said to the defence: ‘Your client has committed a grave fraud, a sustained fraud. She has the propensity to be dishonest.

‘I’m told she has given it to charity. There’s not a shred of evidence to support it.’ 

He added: ‘I’m going to be blunt - I just don’t believe her. I think I’m being sold a dummy.’ 

He told Glancy:‘You are perfectly capable of, and you did, sit in front of people whose wedding you were planning, and lied your head off.

‘You’re a fraudster. Why should I believe you?’ 

The judge said he would need to see some proof cash had been paid to charities or her dying friend.

He said: ‘I suspect very strongly there is no evidence of this because it isn’t true.’

Sentence was deferred until January 30, by which time he demanded proof from Glancy as to what happened to the money and to also show that she is saving money to reimburse the club.

The defrauded couples’ weddings will not be affected as Wentworth has accepted that the payments were made by them and is covering the costs.
