The mother of a small-town girl who dreamed of becoming a Hollywood actress was today reunited with her daughter after she went missing for four months.

Sharon Stratton drove from Tennessee to Los Angeles to see her daughter Satara, who she says was 'drugged and tortured' by a registered sex offender who held her captive.

Ms Stratton told MailOnline of her joy at being able to 'hug her, talk to her, tell her none of this is her fault' - but said Satara was still in 'too bad a shape' to leave hospital.

And the family has refused to reveal Satara's current location, or the hospital she will be moved to, as they fear her alleged captor poses a continued threat to the 24-year-old.

Alive: Police have located actress Satara Stratton, pictured, who went missing in November. She was believed to be addicted to heroin and under the influence of a sex offender

The
emotional reunion brings an end to the harrowing story of the wannabe 
star who saw her ambitions crushed by the reality of life on the dark 
side of Tinseltown.

Satara
had travelled west with dreams of stardom, but was allegedly drawn into
drug addiction after meeting a sex offender who took her into his care.

Her
youthful good lucks were ravaged by heroin, and a series of police 
mugshots taken following drug-related arrests showed the toll that her 
lifestyle was beginning to take on her body.

Although
Mrs Stratton reported her daughter as missing after she stopped 
returning her phone calls, authorities claimed there was no evidence she
had been abducted.

But
after a nationwide publicity campaign, Satara turned up at a Los 
Angeles hospital - apparently left there by the man who allegedly held 
her captive.

Police are now trying to track the man down and bring him to justice for his role in the young woman's dramatic fall.

Ambition: Satara dreamed of becoming a Hollywood star when she was growing up in Tennessee

Mrs Stratton said: 'That man destroyed my little girl. He held her captive for more than four 
months in a place where she could not escape from.

'He drugged her, 
tortured her, attacked her and who knows what else.

'She needs to be with her family and 
we need to get her healthy and back to normal and give her time to 
recover from the nightmare she has been through.'

She added that when Satara is awake in the hospital, she screams uncontrollably - terrified the man will find her and drag her away.

Los Angeles police announced yesterday she had been located in 'good condition' at an unspecified hospital.

Career: Satara (right) has appeared in several films, including the 2010 movie Fairer Blood, pictured

Ms Stratton, who is a university professor, said it was the registered sex offender who had kidnapped her daughter who left her at the hospital after increasing pressure
from police.

He fled soon afterwards and is thought to be still on the run.

Satara, whose screen name was Satara Silver, is now being held in a secure place until he is found. She is being treated for some external injuries and
bruising over her body.

She is also suffering withdrawal symptoms from 
the drugs she was injected with.

Over the last eight months, police
have arrested Satara on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting 
how her life had spiraled out of control. Arrests have 
included possession of narcotics 
in a hospital.

Police are now looking for the sex offender whose offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14.

Her mother revealed that prior to this, Satara was a normal, happy and quiet young girl who loved dancing and soccer.

She had been acting since she was three-years-old and enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie.

It was when she was working in New York that she was advised to move to LA as she had dreams of also becoming a film director.

Determined to make a success of her 
new life, the petite blonde began taking classes and started a job 
at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard.

But
it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, 
causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los 
Angeles Times last month.

Mrs Stratton added that her daughter's 
troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her 
and harassing her.

She said she believes the employee may have been working with the sex offender as the two were friends.

Satara Stratton was said to be a happy fun-loving girl until she moved to Hollywood

'I don't know what their motive was or 
if it was a money thing,' she said. 'But my daughter is very petite and 
young looking and I believe one of the men is a registered pedophile, so 
perhaps that was why he went after her.

'She was very vulnerable. They singled 
her out and preyed on her. My daughter never touched hard drugs in her 
life. She was always a very demure and quiet girl.'

The university professor said she is just glad Satara is still alive after a threatening email was sent to Satara's boyfriend last month saying he was going to kill both her and her mother.

'I spent two weeks in LA looking for 
her after that. I got no help from police who warned me victims aren't 
usually found alive after three months missing,' she said.

'It was only when I made a plea on 
Facebook and then the media got hold of it that the police really 
started to investigate her disappearance.'

Police had considered her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refused to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly.

The
last time Sharon spoke to her daughter before she was located was in 
November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died.

Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times.

Sightings: Stratton, who appeared in a handful of films, was seen 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard

Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began

Though Ms Stratton doesn't know the full details of what her daughter went through, she believes her daughter was stalked before being 'grabbed' after being offered a ride home.

It will likely be a while before her daughter can even talk about what happened, she said.

'I want to get my daughter back and 
give her the love and care she needs. The last four months have been a 
nightmare, I haven't been able to sleep or eat or work or even think.

'Once she is back to normal, I know 
Satara will go back to pursuing her dream. She will not give that up 
just because of what that man did to her.

She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'.

Authorities have never divulged the nature of her health issues.

On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.'

She added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants.

'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections. So where is she?'
