Wanted: Ugandan forces hunting for warlord Joseph Kony (pictured) have hailed the arrest of one of his top commander's as an 'intelligence coup'

U.S. President Barack Obama has reportedly stepped up efforts to capture Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.

Kony is the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, which is accused by the United Nations and human 
rights groups of killing and mutilating innocent civilians and 
kidnapping thousands of children, forcing them to be soldiers and sex 
slaves.

Obama has reportedly dispatched military aircraft to the central African nation to help track the brutal warlord, with several CV-22 Osprey aircraft arriving in the troubled country by the middle of the week.

The Washington Post, which broke the story about the Obama administration's increased effort to track down Kony, reports that the White House began notifying Congressional leaders about the plan on Sunday night.

Officials emphasized that the Ospreys 'will be used for troop transport and that
 the rules of engagement for U.S. forces remain the same as for about 
100 Special Operations troops that Obama first sent to help find Kony in
 October 2011,' the paper reports.

U.S. military personnel will be allowed to 'provide information, advice and 
assistance' to an African Union military task force responsible for tracking Kony and the LRA.

U.S. forces are authorized to track Kony and his forces across Uganda, the Central African 
Republic, South Sudan and Congo. 

The U.S. soldiers are not authorized to engage the LRA unless it is in self-defense.

The number of U.S. forces who will be a part of the operation to track Kony are unlikely to exceed 300.

The new effort to bring Kony to 
justice comes as many believe that much of his organization has been 
decimated in recent years - especially after a 2012 documentary that 
brought the atrocities he's alleged to have committed into the 
mainstream media.

According 
to the Washington Post, LRA attacks have decreased and the number of 
people his regime is suspected of murdering has decreased by more than 
75 percent since 2010.

Additionally, there hasn't been a definitive sighting of Kony, himself, in quite some time.

Kony recently became the focus of international attention after the U.S. advocacy group Invisible Children made an online video seeking to make him famous.

In 2005 the ICC indicted Kony, along with four other LRA commanders, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Two of them have since died.

In 2011 Obama sent 100 troops to help regional governments eliminate the LRA.

But the manhunt for LRA leaders has proved tough, with the rebels moving in very small groups and avoiding technology.

Encounters between Ugandan troops and the rebels are very rare. Only about 200 LRA members remain the jungle, according to Ugandan officials.
