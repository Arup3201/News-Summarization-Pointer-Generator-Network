A Hero teacher who saved the life of a seriously ill pupil by giving her one of his kidney is to be honoured with an MBE.

Ray Coe stepped in to rescue Alya Ahmed Ali, 13, after learning she was desperate for a donor.

The 53-year-old father-of-one said he was left shocked and proud after learning he had been recognised in the Queen's New Year Honours list.

The special needs coordinator at Royal Docks Community School, Custom House, east London, has been awarded the gong for services to education and the community. 

He took part in the life-saving kidney transplant to rescue Alya, who suffers from a deadly condition called hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, which has led to severe learning difficulties.

They have since become very close - and Mr Coe even spent part of Christmas with Alya and her grateful family.

'It was a bit of a shock to be made an MBE,' said modest Mr Coe. 'I was not expecting it at all.

Mr Coe, pictured with Alya and her father Ahmed Ali, said he was still a bit 'perplexed' and added: 'I don't see it as anything that no-one else would do'

'It's a very proud moment and there's a huge sense of honour.It seems like it's just spiralled. 

'I never thought for a moment that it would become as big a story as it did.

'I'm still a bit perplexed, because I don't see it as anything that no-one else would do.

'For me the greatest thing to come out of it has been becoming a real part of Alya's family.'

Alya's dad, Ahmed Ali, 47, of Stratford, east London, said after Ray brought his daughter back from the brink: 'He has given Alya much more than just the gift of life.He's an amazing man, we owe him so much.'

School head Wendy Bower also saluted Mr Coe, saying: 'Ray has gone above and beyond with the call of duty with this selfless and noble act.

'He's a very humble and modest man.The whole staff are in admiration for his kindness.

'He has given a new life to Alya and her whole family.'
