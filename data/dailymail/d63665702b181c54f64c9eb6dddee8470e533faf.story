He may be having a difficult season on the pitch, but on the table Robin van Persie is the master of Manchester United - or at the very least he's  better than Antonio Valencia.

The Red Devils teams were in Table Football action against each other during some downtime after training, and it was the Dutchman who came out on top.

Van Persie netted for 'match point', before  finishing off his Ecuadorian counterpart just moments later.

It was a clinical showing from the 31-year-old, who displayed a level of finishing prowess that's been sorely missing  at times this season in the human-sized version of his game.

Van Persie has managed  10 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions so far this campaign, a creditable tally, but one that doesn't quite live up to his recent excellent standards.

His opponent Valencia, meanwhile, has failed to find the back of the net in 21 games this season, and hasn't scored for United since they beat Swansea in the Premier League last January.

Van Persie missed out through injury as Louis van Gaal's side came from behind to beat Preston 3-1 in the FA Cup on Monday night, but is expected to return for their trip to the Swans on Saturday.

It will be a game where United's boss will want  revenge, after Garry Monk's side soured his first competitive game in charge at Old Trafford by winning 2-1 on the opening day of the season.

Wayne Rooney cancelled out a Ki Sung-yueng leveler on that day before Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a second half winner.

Manchester United currently sit third in the Premier League as they continue their battle with the likes of Southampton and Arsenal to finish in the Champions League places with 13 games to go.
