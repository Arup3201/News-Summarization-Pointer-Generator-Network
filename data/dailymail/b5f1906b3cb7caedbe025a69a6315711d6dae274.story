Lewis Hamilton took one final, forlorn look at the smouldering Mercedes behind him and held his head in his hands, his hopes of  victory at Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix — and who knows what else — ravaged by a fireball.

It was during his first fast lap of qualifying that orange flames came pouring out of the back of his car.

‘Guys. I’m on fire,’ he radioed to his Mercedes engineers. ‘OK Lewis just stop the car where there is a fire marshal,’ was their instruction only for the Briton to inform them: ‘I can’t stop it!’

Inferno: Hamilton's Mercedes caught fire as he was driving around the Hungaroring in Q1

Rush: Hamilton managed to drive around the track and make it to the pit lane before he jumped out of the car

Cloud: Smoke billowed out of the engine as a fuel leak caused Hamilton's Mercedes to catch fire

State: Hamilton's Mercedes was badly damaged by the fire as it spread around the rear end of the car

Sullen: Hamilton cuts a frustrated figure as he walks away from his smoking car

Marshals sprayed their fire extinguishers at the blaze, yet smoke continued to leak out for several minutes longer.

The fire meant he did not record a time and he will start from the pit lane — a disappointment compounded by his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg taking a pole position as comfortably as any of his six this season.

It was impossible to feel anything but sympathy for Hamilton, who is enduring a horrible run of bad luck.

Four times mechanical problems have hindered him in the first 11 rounds of the championship.

Rosberg, his only rival for the title, has suffered two glitches (one of which, in Canada, he managed  successfully whereas Hamilton retired with the same over-heating brake complaint). ‘There’s a lot going through my mind, but I just have to try to turn it into positives,’ said Hamilton, who trails his team-mate by 14 points.

Frustration: Hamilton has now gone six race without a pole position after his withdrawal in Q1

Before going he provided  a few considered thoughts on the incident.

‘I bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so I had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died,’ he said.

‘I was on the pit-lane entry so hoped I could get it back to the pits and they could fix it, but I looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire.

‘I hoped to get it to the garage. Maybe they could have done something but I tried to stop and the brakes weren’t working. It is all pretty bad. I honestly don’t know what I can do tomorrow. I will struggle to get in the top five or 10.

‘I’ll probably leave here more than 20 points behind Nico but there are still races to go. I will try my best.’

Contrasting fortunes: Rosberg races past Hamilton with the Briton's Mercedes on fire in the pit lane

Centre of attention: Rosberg claimed his third consecutive pole ahead of Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas

Last week he produced a dazzling remedial drive from 20th on the grid to finish third at Hockenheim. But this twisty track presents so few overtaking chances that he will have to drive even more outstandingly to find a way to the podium.

So if Rosberg has no problems, he is clear favourite to win. Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel, who was second yesterday, and Williams’ Valtteri Bottas, who was third quickest, are surely left to fight it out with the best of the rest.

Rosberg earned his pole by dealing with the tricky rain that had just started to fall at the first corner during the final shootout for pole. He ran wide, but had cut his speed sufficiently to steer himself back on to the track.

Kevin Magnussen, following behind, was less adroit, thudding his McLaren into the tyre wall to condemn him to start from the pit lane.

The Dane’s team-mate Jenson Button was seventh fastest, seven places higher than he started the race in 2006 — his first victory. It rained that afternoon, mixing up the usual order. Rain is again forecast for Sunday.

Kimi Raikkonen endured another awful afternoon. He was pipped by his possible Ferrari replacement, Marussia’s Jules Bianchi, after his team embarrassingly told him to sit in the garage rather than put in another lap.

By that point, Hamilton was already out of his car, on the way to a blue Mercedes 4x4 and back to the hotel. As he walked out he fiddled with the rosary beads hanging around his neck.
