Tony Benn today revealed how he is 'not frightened by death' after suffering a stroke and spending much of the past year in hospital.

The 88-year-old former Labour minister, whose movement and speech have slowed down, said the experience of losing his wife to cancer in 2000 has helped him feel philosophical about the future.

But Mr Benn admitted that he still misses American-born Caroline Middleton DeCamp, wants to be buried next to her by the River Blackwater in Essex and often thinks: ‘Where is she?’

He told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I’m not frightened about death. I don’t know why but I just feel that at a certain moment your switch is switched off and that’s it. And you can’t do anything about it.

‘I think experiencing my wife’s life and then death has encouraged me to feel like this. She was an amazing woman. She had cancer and was very ill but she said death was an adventure.’

Almost two years ago the Mail revealed how Mr Benn had downsized from a four-storey Regency mansion in Holland Park, west London, to a private, warden-controlled retirement flat in the area.

Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, formerly Viscount Stansgate, a title he renounced in 1963 to continue his career in the Commons, was given only three years to live in 1990 after a leukaemia diagnosis.

And Mr Benn said that the death of his wife - whom he proposed to just nine days after meeting her in 1948 - is ‘very much still part of my life’ and he still feels pain 13 years after she passed away.

Mr Benn is visited at 9am by someone every day to ‘see if I am still alive’ and said he does occasionally feel lonely, but is cheered up by his children and grandchildren who visit regularly.

A one-time friend and supporter of miners’ strike leader Arthur Scargill, he was described by former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson as a man who ‘immatures with age’.

Mr Benn is currently working on a film called Will & Testament about his life inside and outside politics, and will also soon release the final part of his memoirs, entitled A Blaze Of Autumn Sunshine.

Anthony Wedgwood Benn was born in Marylebone, central London, in 1925 and was an RAF pilot during the Second World War.

His political career began when he became Labour MP for Bristol South East in 1951. An hereditary peer's son, he wanted to remove himself from the line of succession.

But when the socialist's father died in 1960 he 
automatically became a peer and was prevented from sitting in the Commons - 
before renouncing his peerage three years later.

The former Postmaster General was  re-elected as an MP soon after and held the seat until 1983, when it was 
abolished, before winning the seat of Chesterfield.

He became extremely popular among 
Labour activists for his radical Left-wing 'Bennism' philosophy, but was 
vilified by the Right as 'The Most Dangerous Man in Britain'.

He served as Minister of Technology and had responsibility for overseeing Concorde's development. He was also Secretary of State for Industry and Secretary of State for Energy.

Mr Benn retired
from Parliament in 2001 but has remained active in politics through the Stop the War Coalition, for which he is president.
