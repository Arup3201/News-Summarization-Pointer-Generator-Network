It may look harmless but the tiny bark beetle, roughly the size of a grain of rice, has been blamed for causing mass devastation in the Colorado wildfires.

The winged pine beetles have killed off millions of acres of woodland, creating wide stretches of tinder-dry dead trees to feed the fires.

More than 75,000 acres have already been scorched in southwest Colorado, forcing 600 people to be moved from their homes in what is considered the worst fire to have hit Rio Grande National Forest.

Despite about 900 firefighters trying to halt the fire, it is unlikely that it will be contained until there is rain and a drop in temperature.

Scientists say that mild winters are partly to blame for the infestation of beetles, and the subsequent wildfires.

'The culprit here is the unusual weather
conditions, which might become the new norm with climate change,' Jesse Logan, a retired U.S. Forest Service researcher, told NBC News.

After months of drought and a mild winter, the temperature has not dropped enough to kill off the insects, which has created conditions favorable to beetles and wildfires.

The wildfires and beetle 
outbreak are considered to be an effect of climate change.

A similar link between the two was made in 1988, when more than a million acres around Yellowstone National Park caught fire. 

'Independent of what the beetle had done in certain areas of Yellowstone, the whole thing went up in flames,' Mr Logan said.

'You can point your finger in various directions. It might be the mountain pine beetles, or it might be lack of response to a lightning strike. But really what was driving that was unusually dry weather conditions, and that's what's happening in Colorado.'

The beetles, which are about 3mm to 8mm long, can be found from New Mexico to Canada. They like to feast on lodgepole pines, which they burrow into.

Once inside, the beetles eat the inner bark and lay eggs, creating an infestation that eventually kills the tree.

Since 1996 the beetles have attacked almost 3.4 million acres in Colorado, and 3.7 million acres in Wyoming and South Dakota.

Scientists are still debating how beetle damage increases the risk of wildfires. If a tree killed by the beetles loses its flammable pine needles, or falls, which creates distance between the trees, the risk of fire is reduced.

'There could be cases where a bad beetle outbreak could have a big effect, or there could be cases where it would have little effect or almost no effect,' Chad Hoffman, a professor of fire science at Colorado State University, said.

A co-author of a Natural Areas Journal paper that examined the impact of bark beetles, has also said that drought rather than beetle damage was the main cause of wildfire.

'It’s natural enough to look at a landscape that is covered with trees recently killed by bark beetles and, therefore, worry about fire risk,' Dominik Kulakowski, assistant professor of geography and biology at Clark University in Massachusetts, told the Seattle Times.

'But if you look into the long-term ecology of these forests, there is a high fire risk under drought conditions, even when the trees are green and the landscape looks beautiful.”

Forest officials have been trying to halt the progress of the beetles by removing infected trees, spraying pesticides or felling mature lodgepole pines which are favored by the beetles.

Killing the beetles off entirely is not an option however. By killing off the pines, which then catch fire, seeds are released from lodgepole pinecones. 

'There's a school of thought that says without the mountain pine beetles, we wouldn't have lodgepole pines,' Allan Carroll, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia, said.
