Manchester United ambassador Bryan Robson believes Louis van Gaal's decision to introduce double training sessions could be the reason behind the club's injury crisis.

Van Gaal has been unable to call on the services of several first team stars during the course of the season due to muscular injuries and Robson believes there is a reason behind the problem.

Robson, speaking to talkSPORT ahead of Manchester United's Premier League clash against Liverpool, said: 'I don’t think you can ever say you’re unlucky when you’re getting a lot of injuries. I think, when you’re a coach, you’ve always got to assess [why they’re happening].

Louis van Gaal could be to blame for Manchester United's poor injury record, according to Bryan Robson

'Manchester United had a long pre-season and they came back with quite a few injuries. Maybe it was because of the travelling and everything they got a lot of muscle injuries early on in the season and I think he [Louis van Gaal] had to adjust his training a little bit but he did want to do double sessions which the players, under Sir Alex Ferguson, were not used to.

'So maybe it’s because of those double sessions players have picked up muscle injuries. The only way you can say you’re a little bit unlucky is if you’re getting twisted ankles like Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw, they got ankle injuries and there is nothing you can do about that.

'When you’re getting a lot of muscle injuries yourself and your staff have definitely got to look at your training and see if you’ve got to adjust to make sure you can get your best players out on the pitch.'

Van Gaal said before his side's home match against Liverpool that he is finally seeing 'light at the end of the tunnel' regarding United's injury problems this season.

The Dutchman will be without just four senior squad members for the match against Liverpool with Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind and Angel di Maria unavailable for selection.
