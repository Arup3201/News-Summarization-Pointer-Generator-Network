Leeds United have asked about Roma midfielder Federico Viviani.

The 22-year-old, who has been on loan at Latina, is thought highly of at Elland Road and has experience in the Italy Under-21 side.

Leeds have been busy and are also talking to Sampdoria about full-back Gaetano Beradi.

Sampdoria, though, are more interested in sorting their own business, which primarily surrounds Crystal Palace midfielder Jose Campana.

Elsewhere, Watford have completed the signing of Ecuador defender Juan Carlos Peredes.
