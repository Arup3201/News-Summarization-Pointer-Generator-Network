Extreme  measures have been taken to fool men into proposing to their partners.

It has emerged that positive pregnancy tests have been advertised on a private Melbourne Facebook page, Fairfax Radio 3AW reports.

For just $20, the post on the Port Melbourne Garden City and Surrounding Suburbs Buy, Swap and Sell page reportedly sold these tests showing fake results.

Positive pregnancy tests were reportedly sold on a private Facebook group - the Port Melbourne Garden City and Surrounding Suburbs Buy, Swap and Sell page

The caption on the post reads: 'Ladies want your man to propose!? Positive pregnancy test for $20ea. Make that man yours!'

The post was soon removed after it caused concerns among members from the Facebook group.

A woman named Sue told 3AW she and many others failed to see the humour in the post uploaded on Saturday night.

'No one found it funny,' she said. 

'This person who actually posted it wrote on there: "It worked for my girlfriend – she said she lost it".' 

Sue further told the radio station that she was more disgusted to find the person responsible for the post works in the nursing field.

It is unknown if the advertisement was genuine or a joke however the post has been deleted and no purchases were made, Yahoo7 News reports.
