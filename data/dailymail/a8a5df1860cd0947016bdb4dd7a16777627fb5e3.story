Passport Office boss Paul Pugh offered a belated apology yesterday and admitted he had considered resigning over the shambles.

Under hostile questioning from MPs, the chief executive – who is paid more £100,000-a-year – said he was 'sorry' for every case where service standards had not been met.

But he denied presiding over an organisation in chaos - and insisted a backlog of around 480,000 cases was 'work in progress'.

Apology: The head of the Passport Office, Paul Pugh gives evidence to Commons Home Affairs Committee at Portcullis House in London

Asked about images leaked by a whistle-blower, which showed boxes of passport applications piled up in Liverpool, Mr Pugh said the picture showed a 'well ordered, well controlled' holding area.

He also defended the decision to launch a 'witch hunt' investigation to find the whistle-blower – saying anybody who had 'unauthorised contact with the media' must be identified.

During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy.

Last week alone, 16,500 of the 165,000 passports that were issued were sent out late.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz asked: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting?

'I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?'

Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely 
recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I 
would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met
 our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the 
customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.'

'Mr
 Vaz, who revealed he had been forced to personally text the Home 
Secretary to sort out the case of one constituent, asked: 'We can take 
that as an apology?'

'Mr Pugh, who promised not to take a bonus next year, replied: 'It is an apology.'

'Labour MP Paul Flynn asked Mr Pugh if he had considered resigning, since that was what members of the public hit by the debacle would want.'

'He said he had considered quitting but it was his responsibility to lead the Passport Office through 'tough times.

Mr Pugh denied a surge in citizenship approvals to migrants, who can then apply for their first passport, was to blame for the problem.

'He also insisted the decision to stop issuing passports from Britain's embassies overseas was not to blame.

However, he admitted forecasts on the impact this decision would have had proved wrong.

'Officials had predicted an extra 350,000 cases would be dealt with in Britain. In fact, the figure was likely to be closer to 400,000.

'Mr Pugh could soon be facing a new crisis, MPs were told, as union leaders threaten to order a walkout at the Passport Office.

Mike Jones, Home Office group secretary at the PCS Union, said senior officials wanted up to 600 new jobs and pay rises for their members.

He said that, if managers do not open negotiations, the union could ballot for industrial action.

Labour MP Ian Austin warned him this would cause severe inconvenience to 'hard-working families' who deserve a summer break.

Mr Pugh said a strike would be 'extremely damaging to our customers and our public.'

'He denied claims by the PCS that a reduction of around 550 in the number of staff working in the Passport Office between 2010 and 2014 was to blame'In comments likely to infuriate the union, he said that, four years ago, some staff did not have enough work to do and would spend their days 'reading books'.

Mr Jones said the Passport Office had 'lost control' of the backlog.'

He said that at June this year the number of applications logged as work-in-progress stood at 493,289, up from 289,892 in March.

This compares to 146,586 applications in June last year and 72,586 in March 2013.'

'MPs were frustrated that Mr Pugh had failed to deliver his own detailed figures to the committee.

'They set him a deadline of Friday lunchtime to comply.
