Strains of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water downstream of a sewage treatment plant, scientists have warned.

The contamination of the River Sowe, near Coventry, has sparked concern over the growing threat caused by superbugs that are resistant to ‘last resort’ antibiotics.

The drug-resistant bugs were detected in samples taken by specialists from Warwick University near the Finham sewage treatment works.

The resistant bacteria, which is carried in faecal matter, were strains of E.coli that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) - enzymes that can destroy many antibiotics including all penicillins.

ESBL infections are particularly dangerous because treatment options are limited and drugs need to be given by injection in serious cases.

Study leader Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at Warwick University, along with colleagues from Birmingham universities and the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England), analysed sediment samples from upstream and downstream.

They found bacteria resistant to important antibiotics used to treat a range of problems, including meningitis, septicaemia, and so-called hospital-acquired infections. 

They also found resistant E.coli were seven times more common downstream of a UK sewage plant than upstream. 

Their findings suggest resistance is spreading because of a gene called blaCTX-M-15 which bacteria collect to adapt to their environment.

The researchers say stricter regulations and higher levels of treatment are needed to halt the rise in antibiotic resistance in the environment.

Prof Wellington said: ‘If you disturb the sediment and then consume just 5ml of the water then you run the risk of getting gastroenteritis, which can make you extremely ill.

‘It would be like getting MRSA up your nose and could be untreatable.

‘If
 the resistant bacteria colonised in your gut and through, say a urinary
 infection, was able to leave the body, then the bacteria would be out 
in the open, no longer just in the river sediment’ she added.

The findings were published in the 
Journal Of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy this month after the tests took 
place between 2009 and 2011.

Professor Neil Woodford, head of 
Public Health England’s Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare 
Associated Infections Reference Unit, said the extent of the health risk
 caused by ESBL-positive bacteria was unclear.

Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at the University of Warwick said the bacteria could pose a threat

He said the agency was undertaking a three-year study to establish the variety of different strains in circulation.

This is not the first time that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water, he added.

He said: ‘This finding causes concern although we have to keep it in perspective. 

‘Just having had skin contact with the river water is not sufficient to cause illness. 

‘For it to become a problem would require a particular chain of events to occur and the likelihood of these all happening needs to be borne in mind.

‘Our advice is that if anyone does become ill after swimming in rivers or streams then they should always advise their GP of their recent activities.’ 

A spokesman for Severn Trent Water, which runs the sewage plant at Finham, said: 'Severn Trent Water takes its environmental responsibilities extremely seriously. 

'Earlier this month we received confirmation from our environmental regulator, The Environment Agency, that we have achieved a four star rating and leading company status for our environmental performance (we were the only company in the UK Water Industry to reach this standard). 

‘The development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is without question an internationally important issue, and we are already engaged in increasing our knowledge to determine whether waste water treatment has role to play in this area.

‘In conjunction with all the other UK water and sewerage companies, we are actively involved in a multi-million pound national research project to look at the levels of pharmaceuticals in the sewage entering our treatment works.’

Antibiotic resistance is a growing worldwide problem, where common bacteria that cause infections are becoming resistant to drugs used to treat them.

Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, suggesting resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well, such as parasites, viruses and fungi.

Many hospital-acquired infections including pneumonia and bloodstream infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

Patients with infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are generally at increased risk of worse health and death - people with MRSA are estimated to be 64 per cent more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection.

As standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist which increases the risk of spread to others. 

Resistance to the treatment of last resort for life-threatening infections caused by common intestinal bacteria – carbapenem antibiotics – has spread globally and many countries lack basic systems to track and monitor the problem.

The evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or when resistant traits are exchanged between them.

But experts say the use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains.

This includes over-prescribing of such drugs – for example to treat viruses that do not respond to antibiotics – and easy over-the-counter availability in some other countries.

Poor infection control practices, inadequate sanitary conditions and inappropriate food-handling encourages further spread.

The use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cattle has also come under scrutiny.

A 2014 report from the World Health Organisation says antibiotic resistance is no longer a prediction for the future; it is happening right now, across the world, and is putting at risk the ability to treat common infections in the community and hospitals.

‘Without urgent, coordinated action, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries, which have been treatable for decades, can once again kill’, it says.
