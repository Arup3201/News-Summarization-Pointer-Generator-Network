In the days before Sky Sports, instant replays and sky-high ticket prices in the Premier League, football was a far more simple sport. Fans stood on huge packed terraces as they watched their local heroes battle it out on the pitch, sometimes attending games with their own hand-made merchandise. These photographs capture life inside and outside of grounds for fans of clubs such as Luton Town, Newcastle United and Manchester United. Also in the collection are images of Fulham footballers clearing snow their pitch before a cup tie and three Everton players crammed into a bath - both unlikely sights in the modern-day game. The images were provided to MailOnline by the The Daily Herald Archive, from the National Collection of Photography at the National Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire.
