Macenzie Campbell almost died after a blister on his foot became infected and sent him into toxic shock

A 12-year-old boy was six hours from death when a blister on his foot became infected and sent him into toxic shock after he wore shoes without socks.

Family members prepared to say goodbye to Macenzie Campbell after his organs began to fail and his body shut down.

His mother Joanne, 38, thought the potentially fatal infection started from a verruca and had applied a treatment, but the next day his foot had swollen and a red rash spread all over his body.

She rushed him to a doctor, as his temperature soared, and he was immediately admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital.

Staff warned him he may not survive and he phoned family members to say his goodbyes after the rash began turning black and his organs started shutting down.

The schoolboy said: ‘It was terrifying. 

'I wasn’t only scared for myself, I was scared for my family. 

'It had seemed like a normal blister, but I gradually started to feel worse and worse.

‘I felt sick, everything was blurry and my heart was racing. I didn’t know what was going on.’

His grandmother, Kate Campbell, said: ‘We thought we were going to lose him. 

'He was ringing all of us in case he didn’t make it.

‘We were told afterwards he was only a few hours from death. 

'The sepsis was gradually shutting his body down. We were distraught.’

It is believed the blister actually appeared on his right ankle after he wore shoes without socks on in April and later burst.

His foot was operated on to remove the infected tissue and he was kept in hospital for just over a week.

Mrs Campell told The Sun: ‘Doctors said six to 12 hours later, he’d have been dead’.

Macenzie is now recovering at home.

Joanne Campbell thought the sore was a verruca at first and applied treatment but by the next day his foot had swollen, his temperature soared and he was covered in a red rash as toxic shock syndrome set in
