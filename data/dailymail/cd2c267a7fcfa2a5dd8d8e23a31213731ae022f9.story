The I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! cast always assembles a lists of curious characters and this year is no different.

With a list ranging from former sporting heroes to ITV 2 (or is it ITV BE these days?) regulars, there seems to be plenty of scope to draw in viewers.

One such sporting hero is Carl Fogarty, and Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the former Superbike champion

So, Fogarty is a former champion - did he have just one fortunate season to win a title?

Behave yourself. 'Foggy' is a four-time World Superbike champion, dominating the sport in the 1990s with title wins in 1994, 1995, 1998 and 1999. The 49-year-old was also runner-up in 1997 and 1993. 

Where has he been since the turn of the millennium?

Unfortunately, after a promising start to the 2000 season and looking in a good position to win a fifth title on his much loved Ducati, Foggy crashed heavily during the fourth round at Australia's Phillip Island which prematurely ended his racing career.

I see, very unfortunate. Was his whole career spent winning WSB titles on a Ducati?

In between his title wins, Foggy had a year at Honda in 1996 where despite struggling he still managed to win four races.

The Brit enjoyed success in other disciplines too, winning Formula One TT championships in the 1980s as well as the World Endurance Championship in 1992 - winning the Le Mans 24 race in the same year (the two wheel version, obviously.)

As well as a handful of MotoGP starts where he had a best finish of sixth, he also triumphed in the Isle of Man TT.

The Isle of Man TT?! No wonder he barley flinched when he came up against snakes - it's fair to say he is a celebrated British sporting hero then?

You said it. Even before he won his third and fourth WSB titles he was awarded an MBE in the 1998 New Years' Honours list.

His abrasive up front character reflects an aggressive approach, but even Foggy has admitted in recent times he is not as mentally tough as many would think.

So what's he been up to since? Apart from putting up with Bush Tucker trials and Gemma Collins' snoring?

Fogarty started his own WSB team, Foggy Petronas, in 2001 which ran for five years and achieved a couple of podium finishes before folding.

Foggy's outside interests include trail riding, motocross, sea fishing and even football with the racing legend a fan of hometown club Blackburn Rovers. 

After his racing career, Foggy started up his racing team with Petronas which folded in 2006
