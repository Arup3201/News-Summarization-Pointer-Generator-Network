A fire captain has been turned in to police by his wife after she allegedly found explicit messages on his mobile phone from a 14-year-old.

The wife of Saul 'Abe' Fiszer from Houston, Texas found he had repeatedly called a number on his cell phone - so posed as him and texted it.

A 14-year-old girl from Casper, Wyoming responded, referring to the 49-year-old grandfather as 'Daddy', according to the criminal complaint.

Charged: Abe Fiszer allegedly swapped images with a 14-year-old girl online. His wife tipped off police, who allegedly found child porn on his computer

She wrote she 'was upset with 'Daddy' because he had not contacted her in awhile', according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the youngster discovered she was texting Fiszer's wife she apologised and begged her not to contact her parents, the paper reports.

When the wife, believed to be called Sandra, confronted him, he admitted he had been chatting to the teen online and trading pictures with her.

She tipped off police, who allegedly found more than 450 images of child porn, as well as videos, on his computer, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Family: Fiszer, pictured with his sisters, has been charged with three counts of possession of child pornography. He could face 30 years in jail if convicted

The photographs and footage allegedly showed boys and girls as young as four years old.

Authorities seized his laptop and storage devices, as well as a computer from the girl's home in Wyoming.

After the discovery, Fiszer's wife said the Houston Fire Department captain started talking about suicide.

He told police he had tried to commit suicide by attaching a hose from his 
car's exhaust to inside the vehicle - but ran out of gas.

Fiszer has been charged with three counts of possession of child porn and if convicted, he faces up to 10 years behind bars for each count.

Workplace: Fiszer has worked for the Houston Fire Department for 18 years

He is being held at the Harris County Jail under $20,000 bail.

It is believed Fiszer has children of his own, as well as a two-year-old granddaughter.

He has worked for Houston Fire Department since 1994, the Chronicle reported.

An official said they were aware of the charges against Fiszer.

'We have been hearing about this, Assistant Chief Tom Munoz said. 'Internal affairs will be taking care of this matter in the following days.'
