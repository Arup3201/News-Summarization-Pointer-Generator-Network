The Co-op has hoisted the ‘for sale’ sign on its farms and chain of pharmacies as it heads towards the biggest loss in its history.

The troubled mutual wants to sell 15 farms, which are used to grow some of the vegetables found in its supermarkets.

It confirmed it is also in the early stages of negotiations to offload its chain of 750 pharmacies, raising fears over the futures of around 6,500 staff.

The Cop-operative Group headquarters in Manchester. The troubled mutual wants to sell 15 farms, used to grow vegetables for its stores, and the chain is in talks to offload its 750 pharmacies

Both businesses were yesterday described as ‘crown jewels’ of the Co-op’s sprawling empire, which spans from funeral homes to supermarkets.

The Co-op set up its first farm in Shropshire in 1896 and has had a pharmacy business since 1945.

But the group has been forced to take the drastic action because of the parlous finances of its bank, which was rescued from collapse in December.

This involved ceding control of the bank to institutional investors, including US hedge funds, to plug a huge black hole in its finances.

The Co-op Group is expected on March 26 to announce it made a loss of more than £2billion last year, mainly driven by losses at the bank.

There are fears that thousands of staff across the group could lose their jobs as the Co-op prepares to slash its costs by £500 million over the next four years.

Yesterday, one of the 200 staff at Co-op Farms accused the Co-op of selling off its ‘crown jewels’ to prop up its ‘floundering businesses’.

The worker, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Co-op is in a mess. I guess there will be a huge amount of redundancies across the business and I don’t expect to be in a job in six months.’

He added: ‘It is selling of the jewels in the crown to prop up the bank and the supermarket chain, both of which are floundering.’

The Co-Op Group is expected to announce next month that it made a loss of more than £2billion last year

The Co-op Bank, which has almost five million customers, had to be rescued in December after a £1.5 billion black hole was discovered in its finances.

It is also fighting to salvage its reputation after the bank’s former chairman the Reverend Paul Flowers was exposed in November allegedly buying hard drugs.

In total, seven investigations have been launched into the bank, including one by the City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority and another by former City minister Lord Myners.

The group will reveal its plans to overhaul the business when it announces its results next month.

This could include scrapping its near £1 million annual donation to the Labour Party.

The Co-op’s farms are spread throughout England and Scotland, including Oadby Lodge Farm in Leicester and Delab Farm in Aberdeenshire.

They are mainly arable, producing wheat and barley to make cereal, as well as vegetables.

Just two per cent of the produce - including apples and potatoes - is supplied to the Co-op’s chain of supermarkets.

But the farms have played a central role in the Co-op’s ‘ethical’ movement for more than 100 years.

The first farm was bought in Roden, Shropshire, to grow potatoes and other crops for local co-operative society food stores.

A Co-op spokesman said it was selling the farms as ‘part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses’.

He added: ‘In addition, it is exploring options for the future of the pharmacy business; this could include the sale in whole or part of the business.’
