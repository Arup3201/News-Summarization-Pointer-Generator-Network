The battle rages over the estate of the Painter of Light, as his mistress today claimed famed commercial artist Thomas Kinkade left her his mansion and millions of dollars.

Mr Kinkade’s mistress, Amy Pinto-Walsh, recently produced a shaky, hand-written will that states she is entitled to his Californian mansion and an additional $10million to start a museum at that location, as well as another $66.3million in original artwork and collected paintings.

Kinkade’s wife of 30 years has been fighting Pinto-Walsh in court in a bitter struggle over the painter’s estate. The two are due in court today in what will undoubtedly be the next chapter of an agonizing spat.

Battle: Thomas Kinkade's girlfriend says that the 'Painter of Light' left her his two estates and an additional $10million in a barely-legible will

Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life'

Pinto-Walsh claims the barely-legible will was written by the 54-year-old Kinkade on November 18 of last year and gives her control over his two properties nestled in Monte Sereno, a wealthy neighbourhood in Los Gatos.

The document, originally obtained by the San Jose Mercury News, was scribbled on what seems to be a piece of paper from a legal notepad.

Entitled: Amy Pinto-Walsh claims the will is Kinkade's and gives her millions of dollars

It reads: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto Walsh $10,000,000 in cash from my corporate policy.’

He also wrote that Pinto-Walsh should have his two properties on Ridgecrest Avenue ‘for her security'.

It is signed and dated November 18, 2011.

Mr Kinkade, who died of an accidental Valium and alcohol overdose in April, was dating Pinto-Walsh at the time of his death.

He was married to Nanette Kinkade for more than 30 years and the couple had four daughters together.

Pinto-Walsh, who was called a gold-digger by the estranged Mrs Kinkade, said after the painter’s death that the two were planning to wed after his divorce was finalised.

In April, lawyers portrayed Mr 
Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down'
the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family.

The
restraining order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a 
confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade
was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal 
secrets.

The artist's 
bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - 
said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to 
'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade
down'.

Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible

Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said

'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online.

'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.'

She didn't make any attempt to hide 
her frustration as she filed a restraining order against his 
mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago.

It is estimated that one in every 20 homes in American contains a piece an artwork by the 'Painter of Light'.

His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is 
the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court 
seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos 
Patch.

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)

Mr Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol
and an anti-anxiety medication, an autopsy report revealed.

The
Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death 
as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as 
'accident,' according to NBC Bay Area.

Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium.

Kinkade, whose work captivated 
millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in 
April at his home in Northern California at the age of 54.

The coroner’s report also said the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives

In layman’s terms, Kinkade had high blood pressure and thickened artery walls in his heart due to high cholesterol.

His
brother said that the painter had 
battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he 
died.

Patrick Kinkade said 
his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his 
wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics.

Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy.

Art galleries reported a surge in sales of Kinkade's paintings following his death.
