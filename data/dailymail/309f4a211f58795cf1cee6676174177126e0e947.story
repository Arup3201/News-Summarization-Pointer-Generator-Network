AB de Villiers hit a sensational unbeaten 162 off just 66 balls as South Africa inflicted the joint-heaviest ever World Cup loss on the West Indies, defeating them by 257 runs.

The 31-year-old smashed 17 fours and eight sixes, and plundered 68 runs from the last 3.2 overs, as South Africa made 408 - the second-highest score in a World Cup.

The West Indies response never came to fruition as they were bowled out for a paltry 151, despite an impressive half-century from captain Jason Holder, with Imran Tahir claiming his maiden one-day five-for.

De Villiers, the No 1 ranked ODI batsman in the world, provided a stunning show of skill, power, precision and ingenuity.

He reached his century off 52 balls as he smashed a six back over Holder’s head. Only Kevin O’Brien (50 balls against England in 2011) has scored a quicker World Cup hundred.

The South African captain then hit the fastest 150 in a World Cup, off 64 balls, and celebrated reaching the landmark by finishing off the innings with back-to-back sixes.

South Africa’s decision to bat first had seemed a poor one initially as they struggled to free the shackles of the opening bowling pair of Jerome Taylor and Holder.

The latter dismissed the horribly out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just 12 who, looking to release the building pressure, went after a short ball and could only pick out Andre Russell at point.

It brought Faf de Plessis to the crease and his century stand with Hashim Amla, who seemed intent on ensuring he batted throughout, helped rebuild their side's innings.

Chris Gayle, fresh from his record-breaking 215 against Zimbabwe, first had Du Plessis caught behind for 62, before Amla was trapped plumb in front for 65 two balls later.

That was perhaps the worst thing that could have happened, as the destructive De Villiers strode out on to the SCG pitch in the 30th over.

Just six boundaries had been hit at that point, five fours and a six, but after 96 runs were thumped off the final five overs, the boundary count stood at 30 fours and 11 sixes.

Holder took the brunt of the attack as he conceded 75 runs off his last three overs, having previously had respectable figures of 1-29 from seven.

Rilee Rossouw made an impressive 61 as he shared a 134-run fourth wicket partnership with De Villiers, while David Miller made a quick-fire 20 and Farhann Behardien an unbeaten 10 as South Africa set a mammoth target of 409.

In order to come anywhere close to the target, Gayle, the West Indies’ enigmatic talisman, was going to need replicate his innings against Zimbabwe.

But with his last century against South Africa in one-day cricket coming in November 2006, the omens were not good.

Kyle Abbott, brought in for the injured Vernon Philander, immediately repaid the faith shown in him as he bowled Gayle for just three in his first over before having Marlon Samuels caught behind for a duck.

It should have gone from bad to worse as Dwayne Smith was twice dropped, first by Dale Steyn off his own bowling and then by Imran Tahir at mid-on off Abbott.

It was the kind of luck the West Indies desperately needed but the slightly controversial dismissal of Jonathan Carter showed that luck was certainly not on their side under the SCG floodlights.

Morne Morkel looked to have overstepped his mark by about six inches the ball before Carter picked out the effervescent De Villiers at mid-on, a ball he was convinced should have been a free hit.

And Smith’s luck came to an end the very next ball as he holed out to a superb overhead catch from Miller at long-on off Tahir for 31.

It induced another collapse that is becoming the mark of a side that continues to blow hot and cold, as Tahir, the leg spinner with roots in Pakistan, removed Lendl Simmons and Andre Russell for ducks and Darren Sammy for just five, reducing the West Indies to 63-7.

Tahir claimed his all-important fifth wicket as Dinesh Ramdin was bowled for 22 by a flighted googly that evaded his defence.

Holder refused to be so easily dismissed, despite suffering from what looked like a hip injury and severe cramp that hindered his running.

The 23-year-old made 56 before sending a Steyn delivery high into the night sky to be caught by Amla.

Sulieman Benn managed to pull Steyn for a single off his last delivery before being caught in the slips by Amla off Morkel.

That run ensured the West Indies avoided the heaviest defeat in a World Cup match, a record they now share with Bermuda.
