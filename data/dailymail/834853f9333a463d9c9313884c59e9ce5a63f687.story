When stuntman Ben Toyer heard there was a role coming up in a Hollywood movie that would require being able to pole dance he thought he’d give it a shot.

The blonde-haired model, who earns a living getting run over and set on fire in films, was 21 at the time and soon realised there was an added bonus to joining his local pole dancing class in Sydney’s Bondi Beach.

‘I copped a lot of flak from my mates until they realised I’m a straight male in a room dancing with girls,’ Ben told Daily Mail Australia.

Stuntman Ben Toyer says learning pole dancing and competing in national competitions gave him strength he'd never get from the gym

The 24-year-old grew up in Sydney and got into the sport of parkour, which involves using only the body and surroundings for propulsion, when he was 14

‘I went down to The Pole Dance Studio and had a go,’ he said.

‘I did my first show two weeks later and did my first competition six weeks after that. For over a year and a half I did shows and competed in the Australian championships, both men’s and doubles,’ Ben explained.

Ben said his friends would come to a show and then ‘realise how good it was’.

‘Women weren’t the reason I joined but it was great, I did meet people through it,’ he said.

Ben performed on cruise boats, clubs and Sydney’s Luna Park.

Ben and his school friends used to train around the city including near the Royal Botanical Gardens, where he is pictured here

He joined a gymnastics class when he was younger but quit when they wouldn't let him do flips 

Asked how women react to his pole dancing he said: ‘They love it, you do get a lot of attention.’

But he never felt like just a ‘piece of meat’.

‘We joke about me being objectified but I’m not really. You are so comfortable with it.

‘There is only one backstage area so you do have people getting changed around you but the woman aren’t like “oh no he’s in the room”.

‘It’s up to you how you act because you are changing in a room full of women in their underwear. There’s a right and a wrong way to act,’ he reasoned. 

As well as working as a stuntman in films, TV shows and commercials Ben is also a model  

Despite the associations that come with pole dancing, Ben thanks the sport for making him as strong as he is now

His time pole dancing taught him how to do the 'flags' move shown in the top photograph in this article, where he hangs off poles horizontally

Ben thinks his pole dancing stint is the reason his strength is so good now.

He describes himself as a stunt man and model first and foremost, but when his friends are around ‘and want to have a dig’ his pole dancing is mentioned.

‘They bring it up before I will,’ he laughed.

‘But it’s great fitness that’s really all it is… it’s a different way of moving your body and you don’t get that strength through anything else or going to the gym.’

The 24-year-old, who happens to be single, said his time pole dancing taught him how to do the ‘flags’ move shown in the photographs in this article, where he hangs off poles horizontally.

Ben got into the stunt business after getting hooked on parkour and free-running as a 14-year-old teenager with his two best mates, growing up in Hornsby, on the Upper North Shore of Sydney.

After leaving school he became a qualified stuntman in 2009 and has now played parts in The Great Gatsby, Wolverine and The Sapphires 

He said his parent’s front yard is filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts

Ben has learned all the skills he thinks he could possibly need for his work as a stuntman including 'drifting' in cars 

‘At 16 or 17 I found out that stunts is a real job when I met a performer… I made the phone calls and did everything I could to get into it,’ he said.

Ben left school and enrolled in a stunt course which taught him how to drive like in the movies and gave him all the technical knowledge needed to avoid nasty accidents.

By 2009 he was a fully-qualified stuntman and his parent’s front yard was soon filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts.

There have been cuts and bruises but Ben’s still never broken a bone in his body.

‘Australia is not a huge industry and more and more people are doing it, everyone knows everybody… it’s not just films it’s TV and commercials,’ he explained. 

Ben once jumped off a cliff for a scene in Home and Away and certainly isn't afraid of heights 

His work has seen him travel across Australia, to India in a live Spiderman show and to New Zealand for a part in the third The Hobbit film

A highlight of his job so far was when he partied at the Gatsby pool party in the 2013 Australian-American blockbuster The Great Gatsby

Since starting out, he’s travelled across Australia, to India in a live Spiderman show and to New Zealand for a part in The Hobbit 3.

He’s appeared on billboards for Bonds underwear, shaved his head to be Luke Hemsworth’s body double in upcoming sci-fi flick Infinity and fallen down a cliff in Home and Away.

He said a highlight so far was when he partied at the Gatsby pool party in the 2013 Australian-American blockbuster The Great Gatsby, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

‘You’re not always doubling an actor and you’re not always doing stunts… A lot of the time you are doing more than they can allow an extra to do,’ he reasoned.

‘In Great Gatsby I was playing a rowdy hanging out of a car and I was also in the pool party as a partier, jumping and flipping into the pools, shaking bottles of champagne and throwing people in the water,’ Ben said.

One of the scariest stunts he's had to do was  being a hit by a motorbike on the show Sea Patrol

As a model, Ben was plastered four storeys high on a giant billboard beside Sydney’s Anzac Bridge for Bonds underwear brand

‘Inside the studio was the whole pool and everyone was dressed up.’

Ben even worked in a scene with DiCaprio, who he said is ‘very professional’.

‘He’s there to do a job, and he’s a great actor.’

When it comes to being scared, Ben said falling down a cliff in Home and Away and being a hit by a motorbike on Sea Patrol was a ‘big head game’.

‘How do you get hit by a motorbike? We strapped a mat to the front of it and practised,’ Ben recalled.

‘It’s all about body placement,’ when getting hit by a car or motorbike.

When something is speeding towards him he's thinking ‘about his training… it’s all timing… it’s a calculated risk’.

Ben doesn’t just spends hours in the gym, his weekly routine will involve a mix of cardio, fight training and gymnastics.

Ben is strict about what he eats and currently follows the Paleo diet, which avoids carbs. 'I train less because I eat quite well,' he explained

He said stunt person jobs in Australia aren't as common and the parts are getting more and more competitive 

He spends his time practising stunts in motorbikes and cars, abseiling, diving, perfecting his rope skills, snowboarding, wakeboarding, riding a BMX and skating

‘You need body control and to be coordinated to control your body in the air during flips.

‘Then you’ve got everything else: motorbikes, cars, abseiling, diving, rope skills, snowboarding, wakeboarding, BMX and skating,’ he said.

‘Anything that an actor can’t do or could happen on a job, you need to learn how to do.’

Ben is also strict about what he eats – and currently follows the Paleo diet, which avoids carbs. ‘I train less because I eat quite well,’ he explained.

But for him the discipline is worth it because he gets to be a stuntman.

‘It’s the best job for me, it’s definitely not for everybody… a lot of people don’t want to be hit by cars, set on fire or fall of buildings.

‘I love it whether there is a lot of work around or if it’s quite, there’s nothing else I want to do.’
