Africa's resources are being exploited by China and it could be a 'disaster' for the environment, a top British wildlife expert has claimed.

Chimpanzee expert Dame Jane Goodall compared China to European colonisers when she said the nation is purging the continent of its natural resources, developing mines and oil wells and setting up construction companies.

China is also a big market for elephant tusks and rhino horns which has fuelled poaching all over the African continent, she said.

Dr Goodall, who is almost 80 and made her name researching chimpanzees in Tanzania, said there is little concern for the environment while the rising super-power concerns itself with its own economic growth.

However, she did point out that the nation had made changes, highlighting Beijing's recent destruction of illegal ivory stockpiles which, she said, it would never have done 10 years ago.

She made the remarks during a series of lectures on threats to earth saying: 'In Africa, China is merely doing what the colonialist did.

'They want raw materials for their economic growth, just as the colonialists were going into Africa and taking the natural resources, leaving people poorer,' she told the AFP news agency.

She warned that the impact of the nation's activities on the environment could be 'a disaster' because the country is larger and technology has improved.

Dr Goodall is best known for her 45-year study the interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania.

She is also the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots program, and she has worked to promote conservation and animal welfare issues.

In addition, she also works with Chinese children teaching them about conservation and says young people all over the world have a love of nature and animals, including youngsters in China.

She also pointed to the 'resilience of nature' and says ecosystems have an ability to bounce back from the brink of destruction.
