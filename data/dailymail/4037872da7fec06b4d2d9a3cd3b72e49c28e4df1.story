Holborn is well and truly on the London map.

The Hoxton Group has opened its second hotel there – a definite seal of approval, as their other London offering is in fashionable Hoxton, seconds from Hoxton Square and the White Cube Gallery.

The new property sits in a Grade II-listed building - at 199-206 High Holborn - which was once occupied by BT. How times change. It is seconds from Holborn Tube station, and five minutes from another lovely accommodation newcomer to the area, the Rosewood, which launched last October.

Heart of the matter: The new hotel brings a dash of east London style to the centre of the British capital

If you are making a weekend of it, there is plenty to see in the area – the Sir John Soane's museum, which is piled high with ancient archaeological artefacts; the elegant enclave of Lincoln’s Inn, where barristers toil day and night; the little boutique stores of Lamb's Conduit Street.

The theatre district is also nearby, so it is perhaps unsurprising that hotel has an arty edge.

It will be hosting events with a cultural theme, including a reading by Kate Mosse of her new novel The Taxidermist’s Daughter.

The entrance is an open-plan space, with a welcoming bar area and a cluster of squashy sofas.

Upstairs, the ambience is a little more industrial, with steel-grey painted corridors and moody lighting.

Antique telephones, school desks and anatomical sculptures of human heads are also dotted about.

The rooms are modest but refined. There are 174 of them, and they come in four categories – Shoebox, Snug, Comfy and Roomy. Mine is Snug in every sense. But with prices from £119 (or from just £69 for the Shoebox) - astonishing for central London – you can’t really complain.

The hotel is recommended for solo travellers, and I can see why.

There are no wardrobes, and you would be hard pushed to store a suitcase.

However, my room is cleverly designed, with a corner shower tiled in black Deco-style, an enormous circular mirror and a fold-out desk with a kettle, plus a matte black Roberts Radio.

I also like the contemporary Toile du Jouy wallpaper. And when I open the beside-table-slash-mini-bar, I find that rarest of hotel extras, fresh milk. Hurrah!

You'll fit right in: The hotel boasts four sizes of room - in this case, Cosy (pretty accurately named, all told)

The bed is supremely comfy, and even on a murky morning, the view - which stretches all the way to the London Eye - is uplifting.

I wander down for breakfast in the Hubbard and Bell restaurant - where the crowd could be described as 'normcore'. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in matching blue shirts, navy trousers and black trainers. People are working at laptops; many are sipping at 'cold-pressed' juices.

The menu is described as 'Brooklyn style', and features spelt pancakes, avocado on toast and (somewhat incongruously) a Full English. Milk is in miniature glass bottles, and the coffee will put a spring in your step. If you want to simply get up and go, the hotel will provide a takeaway breakfast of granola, banana and orange juice, delivered to your room in a paper bag. Handy if you are in a rush.

Swinging a cat, just: Other room sizes include the Snug - where Jenny burrowed down for the night

Great location, surprising prices: The hotel's room rates are unusually low for a property in central London

There is the Hoxton Grind, too - a café next door where you can grab a coffee. This, and their Chicken Shop, located in the basement, will no doubt be popular local additions.

The latter is a classier take on Nando's, with Norfolk rotisserie chicken cooked on a spit - doled out with crinkle-cut chips, butter lettuce and avocado salad, and served at wooden tables on enamel plates with lashings of spicy sauce.

The service is swift and the place is buzzing. There’s no lingering here. Better to head upstairs and park yourself in the main bar for the rest of the evening.  

The Hoxton, Holborn (020 7661 3000; thehoxton.com/london/holborn). Rates start at £69.
