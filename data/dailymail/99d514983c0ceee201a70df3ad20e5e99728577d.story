Women from an Ohio strip club took their tops off Sunday morning to protest a Christian church that has allegedly been trying to undermine their business.

The Foxhole North women were part of a group of protesters filmed by WBNS carrying signs in front of New Beginnings Church.

Members from the Warsaw church 'do everything they can to keep the customers from going in,' Thomas George, owner of The Foxhole North, told MailOnline. 'They ask, "Does your wife know where you're at? Does your mother know where you're at? Does your sister know where you're at?'

Protest: Women from strip club The Foxhole North appeared topless on Sunday, protesting New Beginnings Church. The church has allegedly been harassing the employees as well as its customers

Fight back: The protesters were seen carrying signs in front of the church during Sunday services

'[They tell customers] "We're taking pictures of your license plate, we're taking video and posting it to the web,"' he said.

Those photos and videos once appeared on the now-defunct stopthefox.com, George said. He said he believes they currently appear on a different Christian website.

George also alleged the churchgoers call his female employees 'w*****.'

Despite the women being half-naked, The Coshocton Tribune reported they 'were not a major spectacle, as only a few people turned out to watch for a few minutes.'

However, a protester in support of The Foxhole North was filmed engaging in a heated exchange with a parishioner.

'Love is the answer and you don't have it baby. God is love,' a protester said.

A New Beginnings member replied, 'Ma'am, 
you know nothing about love. You know plenty about lust. You know plenty
 about sex, but you know nothing about love.'

Owner: The Foxhole North owner Thomas George alleged members of New Beginnings church have photographed his customers' license plates and taped them going into the club

Pastor: Paul Dunfee, pictured, has said the club 'has no business in this community'

New Beginnings Pastor Paul Dunfee 'puts a very different face on than when he is [in front of people he thinks are important,' George said, calling New Beginnings 'a cult.'

'I'm sorry that this has come to this and I'm sorry that we've had to come to this extreme measure,' he said.

Meanwhile, Dunfee told WBNS 'I hope [George] will realize that the Foxhole has no business in this community.'

George alleged that two Tier 1 sex offenders were members of New Beginnings church when his strip club protested the church in 2010.

He also claimed to have once been threatened by one churchgoer, who told him 'I could take you out from a half-mile away with my rifle.'

George said he has tried to file 'numerous charges' against New Beginnings, but that 'the city law director refused to do anything [...] and has been on their side and advising them.'

New Beginnings could not be immediately reached for comment by MailOnline.

Taped? George alleges that the photos and videos taken by members of New Beginnings Church appeared on a website called stopthefox.com
