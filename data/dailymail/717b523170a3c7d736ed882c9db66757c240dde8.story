Stoke boss Mark Hughes has admitted he is interested in signing Norwich winger Nathan Redmond.

Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi, who spent last season on loan at the Britannia Stadium, is Hughes' first choice but the Welshman admitted last week the deal had 'gone cold'.

Redmond, 20, joined Norwich from Birmingham last summer and has made 40 appearances for the Canaries, scoring once.

Wanted: Stoke are keen on Norwich winer Nathan Redmond (centre), says Mark Hughes

In action: Redmond had a good first season for the Canaries in the Premier League last time out

Hughes said of the England Under-21 international on Sky Sports News: 'There is interest there - he's a good young player and a player we would like.

'But he's not our player, he's Norwich's player, and they are obviously well within their rights to retain him.

'He's under contract to them and there is nothing moving at the moment. So we'll just have to bide our time maybe.'
