Republican leader John Boehner could see a coup attempt to unseat him as House Speaker as early as this coming week - after hardline conservatives derailed his  bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded.

Conservatives within his own party could try to remove the Ohio representative as Speaker of the House as soon as next week, according to his close allies.

The threats to challenge Boehner's leadership come as hardline conservative Republicans voted against his bill to keep DHS funded for three weeks,

Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner could lose his position atop the lower chamber of Congress in the fight for a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security

Right-wing lawmakers had inserted amendments to block President Obama's executive order immigration reforms in previous bills, which they refused to vote for when the measures were taken out.

A bill submitted by Boehner Friday for three weeks of funding failed to pass 203-224, with 52 Republicans voting against it.

An emergency one-week bill to fund the agency passed 357-60 Friday night, though fifty-five Republicans voted against it as well.

President Obama signed the deal to fund the agency responsible for fighting terrorism for another week ten minutes before its money would have run out at midnight. 

Allies of the speaker say that if he calls for a vote on a bill without the conservative immigration amendments, he may face a vote challenging his role as the party's leader in the House.

Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate, told CNN he had heard that conservatives were using the fight over funding to make a play for removing Boehner. 

Twenty-five Republican legislators voted against the Cincinnati native during a vote for speaker at the beginning of this year.

It was the largest attempt by a party to unseat its incumbent speaker since the Civil War, according to the Washington Post. 

An attempt to unseat him would most likely not succeed, but could embarrass the 13-term congressman.

President Obama signed the deal to fund the agency responsible for fighting terrorism for another week ten minutes before its money would have run out at midnight.

Fifty-five Republicans voted against it when it passed 357-60 Friday night.

The Senate voted through a 'clean' DHS funding bill last week. 

A funding bill from last year gave the rest of the government through the fiscal year that ends in September, but funded Homeland Security through Friday to create a showdown over immigration.

Potential new Republican speakers include Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan and House Majority Kevin McCarthy of California, but both are loyal to Boehner.

The speaker told reporters Thursday that his job was not on the line in the current conflict.

 'He is the speaker of the United States House until he’s not,' Ohio Republican Rep. Frank Lucas, who supports Boehner, told POLITICO.

The speaker led House Republicans to their largest majority since the 1940s in the fall elections and his party currently control 245 seats in the chamber.

He became assumed the role of speaker from California Democrat Nancy Pelosi after the 2010 election.
