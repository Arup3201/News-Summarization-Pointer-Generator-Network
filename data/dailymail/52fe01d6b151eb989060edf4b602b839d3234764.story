Michael Clarke has capped arguably the most remarkable Test match in his long and successful career by bringing up a hundred in the same match in which the cricket world paid tribute to his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes.

Those writing screenplays could scarcely have dreamt up such a script, as it is barely believable even in the often incredible pantheon, which is world sport. Clarke, 33, defying painful back spasms to bat again and only after a night of intense physiotherapy and painkilling injections, joined Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two.

He brought up a magnificent century at the Adelaide Oval after a second rain delay. His celebration was subdued at first, kissing the helmet and hugging Smith before allowing himself a small smile.

Smith had earlier dedicated his own majestic ton to fallen mate Hughes, pointing to the number 408 painted on the ground and then just moments later Clarke brought up Australia's 408th run, the crowd standing as one to applaud the significance of the score.

Some experts said he would be unable to play again in the match, others even dared to suggest this could be the beginning of the end of a glittering career, yet the Australian cricket captain made a truly remarkable recovery from his back injury after retiring hurt on day one to bat again in the first innings.

But Steve Smith knows what his skipper is made of and confidently predicted Clarke's reappearance at the crease when he said before the start of day two 'he (Clarke) has had a few injections and he's keen to get out there and bat today'.

Clarke, joined Smith for the resumption after being forced from the field on 60 during a dramatic first day of play in which David Warner scored a magnificent century and Smith also racked up a half century. Clarke's first scoring shot of the morning was a boundary through the covers to move him onto 64 but he is clearly restricted and in considerable pain, wincing with almost every shot.

When rain interrupted play Australia was 6 for 405.

Physio Alex Kountouris admitted he didn't have much sleep after Clarke's injury and subsequent hospital visit.

'We were certainly treating it into last night. He had an injection while there (hospital),' Kountouris said.

'He's got a chronic back injury, he dived to get back into the crease when David Warner was on 99, it's quite a significant back injury. It's poor timing and he's struggling at the moment.

'I don't think it's directly related to the hamstring injury which is on the other side.'

Down but not out. Michael Clarke succumbed to a chronic back injury on day one but was determined to play on in the first cricket Test, joining Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two

The moment Michael Clarke realised he would have to retire hurt on 60 after re-injuring his back

'He hasn't had anything like this for 18 months, the last time was at the Champions Trophy in England,' Kountouris said.

Australia resumed at 6-354 with Steve Smith unbeaten on 72 and Clarke 60.

The skipper had to overcome a recurring left hamstring injury to play the rescheduled first Test. Kountouris believed his current woes were unrelated to the hamstring issue.

Before he was hurt Clarke was in typical mood, playing shots like this through the off-side on his way to 60 and in support of David Warner's century

'This is his right lower back. This is his old injury, what he's had in the past,' he said.

'I don't think it's directly related to his hamstring, because it's the other side.

'We believe it's related to his old disc injuries. With that comes a lot of muscle spasms and other things that cause pain.

'So we're just trying to relieve those elements of it and make sure we give him the best possible chance.'

The skipper ducked inside a short ball from Indian quick Ishant Sharma in the 44th over and instantly grimaced in pain.

Clarke stretched his back and spoke to Kountouris and doctor Peter Brukner before trudging off the field.

Kountouris revealed the initial flare-up occurred seven overs earlier when Clarke dived to make his ground at the non-striker's end.

'He felt it a little bit there. Then he tried to get out the way of a bouncer and it really grabbed,' he said.
