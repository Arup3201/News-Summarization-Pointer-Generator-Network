Relationship: A woman (pictured) claiming to be the current girlfriend of Rurik Jutting has described the accused prostitute killer as a 'good and intelligent

A woman claiming to be the current girlfriend of Rurik Jutting has described the accused prostitute killer as a 'good and intelligent' person who has never displayed any signs of violence.

Speaking to MailOnline anonymously from Quezon City in The Philippines, the woman said she had been in a relationship with the British banker for two months, and last spoke to him on October 20.

Just 11 days later Jutting was arrested following the discovery of one 'nearly decapitated' woman in a suitcase and another who had her throat slashed at his luxury flat. 

He appeared in court this morning for a short hearing in which the two charges of murder were read out to him and was remanded in custody until November 10. 

The woman told MailOnline that she first met Jutting after he and a group of male friends travelled to The Philippines in July. 

She said the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch employee initially formed a relationship with one of her friends, Ariane Guarin. That relationship is understood to have come to an end in August.

In September, on what the woman described as one of Jutting's many visits to The Philippines, she started a relationship with him. She said the couple had discussed plans for her to travel to Hong Kong to stay with him but they had not yet arranged a date.

This new relationship is understood to have caused a rift between the woman and Guarin, who is said to have been unhappy that Jutting had formed a new relationship so quickly.

Describing his personality, the woman said Jutting was 'very strict' with other women but said it was merely a symptom of his perfectionism and his desire to 'do the right thing'.

She added: 'I can say that he is a good man. A good boyfriend, sweet lover.'

Claims: The woman took to Facebook to defend Jutting - the man she has said is to be her boyfriend

Court date: A handcuffed Rurik Jutting is taken to a Hong Kong court by police car after being charged with the murders of the two women 

A former acquaintance today said Jutting had been in a serious relationship with a British female trader which ended bitterly around two years ago.

The pair had become engaged, but he was left distraught when she reportedly had an affair after moving to New York from London.

The source, who declined to be named, said: 'She wanted to marry him pretty fervently and he proposed, but she ended up cheating on him.' 

The fiancee was forced to fly back to London because Jutting was so heartbroken, the source told the Daily Telegraph.

'It was him ultimately him who broke it off - I think he took her infidelity quite badly.'

'They tried to reconcile. But I think maybe a month or so into it he was not able to come to terms with the fact that she had been unfaithful.'

Horrific death: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after

Victim: One of the two women discovered inside Jutting's luxury apartment in Hong Kong. The woman, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, was 30 years old and originally from the Philippines

Butchered: Sex workers named locally as Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Jesse Lorena Ruri (right) were found dead at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment in Hong Kong after the investment banker called police 

Jutting, a former pupil at the £34,000-a-year Winchester College, was often 'pre-occupied with power and money' and liked going out and buying tables at clubs, the friend added.

It also emerged that Jutting branded himself an 'insane psychopath' in a chilling 'out-of-office' e-mail from his Bank of America Merrill Lynch account days before the bodies were found at his flat.

The e-mail response read: 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. 

'For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody [Last line only really worked if I had followed through].' 

The message would appear to suggest he had meant to kill himself. 

Hanging out: After police were called to his apartment, Jutting was questioned before being driven away for further questioning, leaving a forensic team to examine the scene at his flat

'Insane psychopath': Rurik Jutting has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his Hong Kong flat. He is pictured here with Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie, who is believed to be the trader's ex-girlfriend, but not the British trader to whom he was engaged, nor the woman who spoke to MailOnline

Out with the girls: Jutting, who moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year, quit his high-earning job in the city, where expat bankers lead notoriously hedonistic lifestyles

In another disturbing development, police in the former British colony were urgently investigating whether there were any more victims after photos of one of the dead women were allegedly among 2,000 pictures and videos on a smartphone used by Jutting. 

The American Psycho-style killing spree came to an end on Halloween night when Jutting, from Surrey, reportedly rang police shortly after 3am.

Officers arrived at his blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find a 30-year-old Indonesian prostitute, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died soon after.

Eight hours later, during a forensic examination of the flat, police officers spotted a suitcase on the balcony which had two feet protruding. 

Inside was the decomposing naked body of the second prostitute, 25-year-old Indonesian Sumarti Ningsih. 

Wan Chai – where Rurik Jutting is thought to have picked up £200-a-night prostitutes – is Hong Kong's notorious red light district.

Just two blocks away from his apartment, hundreds of bars and clubs are teeming with mainly south-east Asian sex workers, who offer 'lady drinks' to potential customers before discreetly negotiating prices for sex.

The area was made infamous by the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, about a Chinese prostitute.

|t is understood the two women allegedly murdered by Jutting had travelled from their homes in Indonesia to seek a better life - and earn enough money to send back to their families, it is understood.

Sumatra Ningsih, the 25-year-old whose decomposing body was found on the balcony of the apartment which Jutting was renting, had travelled to the former British colony only a month ago from her home in the central Java city of Cilacap.

Prostitution is legal in Hong Kong, but many women working as 'freelancers' are doing so illegally as they are there on tourist visas – including Miss Ningsih.

The second woman, aged 30, who has been living in Hong Kong for up to eight years, was known as Jesse Lorena Ruri.

Officials who take responsibility for foreigners in the colony said that was not her real name.

MailOnline understands that her real name is Seneng Mujiasih and that she comes from the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi, joining the many thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry.

'Jesse' has told friends that she had earned enough money in her years in Hong Kong to be able to have a house built for herself and her family in Indonesia.

According to a spokesman for Indonesia’s Head of Development and Productivity Placement Miss Ningsih had approached a private ‘placement company’ in Calacap, which found her a job in Hong Kong, although it was not immediately known what that work was.

Officials from several welfare and workers’ organisations said last night that they were still trying to trace family members of both women who might not be aware of the grisley murders.

Referring to the 25-year-old, a spokesman for the Department of Social Welfare and Manpower, said: 'We are trying to trace the address of Miss Ningsih,’

Calacap, a south coast port town lying nearly 200 miles south east of Jakarta, has a population of more than a million and competition for work is said to be intense.

It was cut off from air travel when the airport closed several years ago and travellers are now faced with a tedious journey along roads jammed with motor scooters.

Tourists are put off from visiting because the town’s most well known beaches have become fouled from leakage from shipping vessels that dock nearby.

Despite the authorities' efforts to clean up the area, it is filled with hotel rooms that can be rented by the hour.

One user wrote on the internet: 'The more expensive ones almost seem like normal business hotels – the cheaper ones are like mental hospitals.'

Robberies and money-laundering are also rife and Chinese gangsters are said to run many of the bars.
