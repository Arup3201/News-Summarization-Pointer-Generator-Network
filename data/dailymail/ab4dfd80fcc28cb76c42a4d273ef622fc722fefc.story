Her older sister Kendall may be the model of the moment, but it looks like Kylie Jenner is fast following in her footsteps.

The 17-year-old has been unveiled as the ambassador for Nip + Fab - an innovative skincare and body brand that promises to offer specially designed products to target specific skin and body concerns.

Kylie joins Made In Chelsea alumni Millie Mackintosh, who was the first-ever face of the brand.

She also uploaded another with the caption: 'Time to remove make up - obsessed with these @nipandfab Glycolic pads that leave my skin so clean @ultabeauty #nipandfab #beautyobsession.'

The £12.95 radiance-boosting pads are soaked in exfoliating glycolic acid, which claim to resurface and moisturise the skin in one hit.

This is the latest in a string of successes for the young star, who recently landed herself a shoot in the highly acclaimed fashion bible Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book.

When Kanye West, who is married to her older sister Kim, recently debuted his first collection with sports brand Adidas, it was Kylie who he asked to star in his show in New York.

Kylie also recently landed the cover of Fault magazine and looked high fashion as she posed in an Alexander Wang crop top with her hair pulled to the side in a fishtail plait.

More experimental than her sisters in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie regularly posts pictures of herself trying out different make-up and hairstyles on her Instagram account so her latest coup is perfect for the starlet.

Did you know Kylie and Kendall Jenner created a clothing line for PacSun? No? Then let us enlighten you.

The youngest sisters of the Kardashian/Jenner clan first launched the Kendall & Kylie collection with the brand back in 2013 and it's still going strong. In fact, their SS15 range just came out and Kylie clearly couldn't wait to wear it. Always a good sign!

The reality television starlet was pictured out and about wearing the skinny white jeans and cute cut out cropped top she designed, showing off her toned tummy in the process.

White jeans can be tricky. Stains of all kinds are always a danger but they just look so fabulous on a sunny day that they're well worth the risk.

And if you take a closer look at Kylie's pair you'll notice a cute lace detail at the ankle. Isn't that adorable? It's very Free People-esque and there's nothing wrong with that!

So why not treat yourself to a pair now? Click the right to buy them at PacSun and style with cozy knits in contrasting shades until the weather warms up enough to work them with the matching top (below).

Come on ladies, it's time to ditch the boring black and embrace some spring time white.
