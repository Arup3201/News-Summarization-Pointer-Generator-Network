Muslim men and boys were forced from their villages and herded into minefields and a makeshift 'death camp' by Bosnian Serb soldiers, the trial of the so-called 'Butcher of Bosnia' was told yesterday by a survivor who was just 14 at the time.

Mr Elvedin Pasic, now aged 34, was the first person to give evidence in the war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic yesterday.

Fighting back tears, he described the moment he fled with his mother as 150 people were executed
in his Bosnian village in 1992.

The witness spoke about his harrowing escape and the scenes of horror he had seen in his home village of Grabovica in northern Bosnia.

Face to face: Elvedin Pasic, left, gave evidence against former Bosnian Serb leader Ratko Mladic, right, in the first day of his war crimes trial in the Hague today.

He testified about his village being shelled by Bosnian Serb troops under Mladic's command, but chose not to confront the 70-year-old defendant.

He told the court that his neighbour, who was pregnant, asked him to carry her daughter to safety. 'I remember she said "can you please carry her - if you have to rip her arm out, just don't let her go".'

The Muslim described weeks of wanderings with his mother, being turned away from village after village.

He spoke in English, carefully describing how he and his mother eventually circled back to their home village despite a warning from two Serb soldiers patrolling nearby who told them 'there is nothing for you to go back to: your home is Turkey, this is Serbia.'

He described his excitement as they entered the village anyway and he raced up a shortcut to his family house - only to find the Serb soldiers had told them the truth about there being little for them to return to.

'The house was burned completely, the fridge, the televisions, the walls - what was left of the walls was stripped' Pasic said.

Even a stash of clothing they buried when they left had been found and taken.

Pasic's voice choked with tears as he described how he had hoped to find his dog alive, but found it shot where it was chained.

Most of the handful of people who had remained in his village, notably one elderly religious man whom Pasic knew, had been burned alive in their homes, Pasic testified; one was shot instead.

Judges paused for a recess in the mid-afternoon, with Pasic expected to testify next about Serb forces imprisoning and mistreating men, women and children at a makeshift detention camp in a nearby school.

Mladic's lawyers claimed that recent changes about what can be filed meant prosecutors had put forward significantly more evidence than previously allowed.

The defence motion said the change 'is unprecedented in the history of the tribunal and threatens to be a significant blight to the integrity of these proceedings. Urgent action by the Chamber is required to avoid a very (great) potential miscarriage of justice.'

Mladic's trial started on May 16, but was almost immediately halted because prosecutors admitted that an apparent clerical error meant they failed to disclose thousands of pages of evidence to defence attorneys. If convicted, Mladic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

The defendant nodded his head in agreement at the start of Pasic's testimony, as Pasic told of good relations between Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats before the war. 

The long-awaited trial finally began despite a motion by defence attorneys to adjourn it for six months.

U.N. judges said the prosecution 
could respond to this latest request for a delay tomorrow, and allowed 
Pasic to testify.

Mladic faces 11 charges of genocide, war crimes and 
crimes against humanity. He denies wrongdoing.
