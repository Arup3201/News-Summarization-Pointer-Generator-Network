Charged: Robert Kerns, 66, pictured, a married father of three, faces 19 criminal counts, including charges of rape, sexual assault, tampering with evidence, and lying to authorities

The ex-boss of a Pennsylvania county's Republican Party has been charged with drugging a female colleague and then raping her while she was unconscious.

Robert Kerns, 66, a married father of three, faces 19 criminal counts, including charges of rape, sexual assault, tampering with evidence, and lying to authorities.

He resigned from his position at Montgomery County's Republican Party branch this month, after the alleged attack against a 51-year-old part-time employee at his Lansdale law firm on October 25.

'I give great credit to the victim in this case,' Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told reporters at a news conference Tuesday in Norristown. 'She was extremely courageous in coming forward.'

The alleged victim, who began working at Kerns, Pearlstine, Onorato & Hladik in October 2012, has not been identified and has not returned to work since the alleged rape.

Kerns' lawyer said his client 'vehemently denies' the allegations and he was expected to be released Tuesday after posting 10 per cent of $1 million bail.

According to Philly.com, the firm had a 'post-workday celebration party' at Radice restaurant in Whitpain Township on October 25, in honor of a firm attorney passing the Pennsylvania Bar Exam.

There, the alleged victim told colleagues she planned to go shopping at the King of Prussia Mall after the event but because she had been drinking, she didn't feel she should drive.

Kerns allegedly offered to give her a ride to the mall, but before he left the restaurant he bought a screw-top bottle of Chardonnay and asked for two wine glasses to take with him, the bartender told authorities.

The pair left the restaurant in Kerns' Mercedes at around 6 p.m., prosecutors said.

In the car, he asked the woman to pour two glasses of wine from the already opened bottle and she obliged, not knowing the wine had already been laced with Ambien by Kerns, prosecutors said.

'At some point between the time she drank the wine provided by Kerns and lost consciousness and the time she regained her memory as they entered her neighborhood, the victim has a vague memory of her head up against the car window and pushing Kerns away,' the grand jury report said.

When they got to her house, Kerns allegedly helped her inside and collapsed on her bed before assaulting her again.

The woman didn't return to work the next day and on October 27 she went to Grand View Hospital in Sellersville for blood and urine tests and an internal examination, Philly.com reported.

Her urine showed the presence of Ambien, which she said she had never taken. She was sent for further tests to determine if she had been sexually assaulted. On October 31, she reported the alleged rape to Upper Merion Police.

Kerns turned himself in on Tuesday morning, following weeks of rumors. He had already resigned from his party position November 14.

'It's a very sad day,' former county commissioner James R. Matthews told Philly.com. 'I've known Bob for a very long time, and it's a sad time for his family and his firm . . . and the alleged victim.'

Kerns had served as the party chairman since 2008.
