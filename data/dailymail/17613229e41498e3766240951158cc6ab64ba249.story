Passengers on board a Qantas flight that had to turn back to Los Angeles after a pipe burst have told of the moment water poured down from the ceiling and flooded the floor.

Flight QF94, a Melbourne-bound A380 jumbo, was forced back to LAX airport an hour into its flight when the malfunction occurred on the upper deck. It landed shortly after 8pm on Tuesday local time.

Those on board have described how people jumped up from their seats in alarm and stood in the aisles to dodge the water.

Ken Price was home to Melbourne after a six-week holiday with his partner.

'We just saw all this water just flowing down from the overhead compartments,' he said.

'We were right at the back of the plane and the stairs to go up were just a raging torrent of water.'

Because of the gushing water, Mr Price, a hotel owner, said the aircraft's entertainment systems and ovens were turned off and passengers were given 'survival packs' of food.

'Everyone was just standing in the aisle and wondering what was going to happening. It went on for about 45 minutes I'd say before they decided to turn the plane back,' he said.  

Unable to get another flight to Melbourne until Wednesday, Mr Price said he and other passengers were getting frustrated as it was 'time to go home'.

Fellow flyer Susanna Halliday tweeted pictures of the wet plane, posting photos of the water-soaked seats and isles.

In one image, blankets can be seen soaking up the water on the drenched floor, while in a second, Ms Halliday shows an image of her wet seat on the plane.

In a later tweet, Ms Halliday said she was not happy with one of the 'worst' hotels that she was staying in after returning to LA.

On Wednesday, a Qantas flight bound for Melbourne turned back to Los Angeles after a water pipe burst on board

US actress Yvette Nicole Brown, who is best known for her role as Shirley Bennett on television show Community, was onboard the flight.

'Pipe burst on my #Qantas flight over the Pacific. We were diverted back to LA. River running thru the aisles #ScaryTimes #WillKeepYouPosted,' she tweeted to her 468,000 Twitter followers.

The actress later tweeted that she was safe and pleased with how Qantas handled the situation.

'Thanks for the concerned tweets! All is well.  :) @QantasAirways & their flight & gate crews were so awesome to all of us. #SoVeryGrateful,' she posted.

Brown was travelling to Melbourne for Oz Comic-Con.

A Qantas spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the leak came from a pipe that carried drinking water and water used to wash hands.

The decision to turn back to Los Angeles was made as a precaution and there was no major issue in terms of the safety of the plane or passengers.

Passengers aboard the flight were provided with accommodation in Los Angeles.

The flight has been rescheduled for Thursday, with the spokeswoman saying they would be flying again within 24 hours.

The aircraft was examined by engineers in Los Angeles and Qantas was in contact with Airbus to establish the cause of the fault.

'A flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne has returned to LA about an hour after take off as there was a water leak on board the aircraft,' the spokesman said.

The flight left Los Angeles at 4pm on Wednesday.

A Qantas statement said: 'Crew on board did everything they could to help customers, including moving them to unaffected areas and providing spare blankets so they could stay dry.'

The airline apologised to customers for the inconvenience but stated there were no safety of flight concerns with the water leak.

But their words didn't placate all the passengers, with some claiming they didn't get enough support or information from airline staff.

'#@QantasAirways terrible support from your staff flight. #flood we are in this creepy hotel,' the Twitter post reads and finishes with 'nobody knows anything,' one tweeted.

One passenger, who wanted to remain anonymous,  said the water landed on up to 80 economy passengers after flowing down from the back of business class on the plane's upper deck, where the leaked is believed to have started, reported reported Fairfax Media.

In the wake of the incident, passengers expressed they were not happy with the accommodation once they returned to LA
