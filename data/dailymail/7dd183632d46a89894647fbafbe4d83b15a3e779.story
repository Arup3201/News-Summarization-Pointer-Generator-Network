This extraordinary photograph shows the unexpected bond between a tiny tree frog and a huge beetle.

The image was captured by an amateur photographer, and is one of the entries for a prestigious photography competition showcasing unique images from around the world.

Nicolas Reusens Boden, from Sweden, took the picture of the red-eyed tree frog, which is around 2cm long, at the moment it landed on the back of a beetle.

Another striking image, taken by Carlos Duarte, shows the aftermath of a sandstorm which whipped through the Omo Valley in Nigeria.

Sinan Dinis, from Portugal, took an eerie panoramic photograph of a ring of wooden posts standing on a beach in Amsterdam, which he dubbed 'The Reunion'.

'God offered me this moment,' he said. 'No one around, total silence and harmony, giving me the sensation that I was in the presence of a reunion, an assembly - all listening to the one in the middle, the wise one.'
