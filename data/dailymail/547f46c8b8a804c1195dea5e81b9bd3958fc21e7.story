People are being urged not to overact after the Northern Territory’s third fatal crocodile attack this year - as the government considers crocodile culling, safari hunting and a renewed safety campaign.

Following the shooting of popular albino-headed crocodile Michael Jackson after it killed a fisherman, Chief Minister Adam Giles said the incident proved it was 'a sign that the density and population of crocs in the NT is becoming somewhat of an issue'.

‘We don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction,’ he said adding the cabinet would consider culling as a long-term policy as well as safari hunting.

‘It's not about going out and randomly killing crocs, it's about having a well-developed plan that protects the interests of the animal but also the interests of the general public,’ Mr Giles said.

Half-albino crocodile 'Michael Jackson', who killed a 57-year-old fisherman on Adelaide river, was shot as a result of the attack

The 57-year-old man, named last night Tran Van Lanh, as was attacked and killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while they were fishing at the Adelaide River on Monday afternoon about 60km east of Darwin.

The unusual crocodile, that was shot and killed, was 'one in a million', a tour operator said.

The Vietnamese farmer was taken when he got into the water to unsnag his fishing line.

Police and rangers scouring the crocodile-infested river by boat on Monday night shot and killed a 4.5m crocodile around 9.30pm and the man's body was recovered later that night.

His wife was treated by paramedics at the scene for shock.

Charles Darwin University crocodile researcher Adam Britton said although it was an obvious shame that the well-loved crocodile had to be shot - it was the appropriate action to take.

He said albinism is 'incredibly rare' in crocodiles, and Michael Jackson was a main attraction for tourists on the numerous Jumping Croc cruises based along the river, where boats travel the river dangling meat attached from hooks for crocodiles to jump up and snatch.

'It was always a thrill when he appeared,' Dr Britton said.

The man was standing on the bank of the river east of Darwin trying to retrieve a fishing hook when he was taken by the crocodile. Signs near where the man was attacked show warnings about fishing near crocodiles

Dr Britton said territorians are becoming complacent, and deaths are not the way people should be reminded about crocodile safety.

'This man almost certainly would have known there were crocodiles in the river, and he probably even knew the croc that took him,' he said.

'For a fleeting a moment, he should have thought about that; he took a little risk and that was enough.'

The Adelaide River is well known for its Jumping Croc tours, where boats travel the river and crocodiles jump for meat attached to hooks.

'Michael Jackson was one in a million, and unfortunately being an albino would have been picked on by all the others, its a big pecking order,' said Rob Marchand, owner of Wallaroo Tours, which runs Jumping Croc cruises across the river from where the man was taken.

He told the ABC on Tuesday that the crocodile had been in that part of the river for several years, and that the crocodiles had been fighting a lot recently, jockeying for position and preparing to breed.

He said only the strongest and most aggressive crocodiles reached four metres or longer.

'The croc has only been doing what nature intends it to do, and that's survive,' Mr Marchand said.

'They know how to do three major things: eat, reproduce and aggression ... if you're not going to look after yourself, you'll find yourself being eaten.'

Crocodiles shouldn't be blamed for their natural behaviour, he said, and rejected the suggestion that the Jumping Croc tours were encouraging predatory behaviour on the Adelaide River.

'I'm sure crocs knew how to eat people a long time before we come along,' he said.

The attack is the third this year, after a boy was taken at a billabong at Jabiru in January, and another fisherman was snatched off his boat as he emptied a bucket in a Kakadu River two months ago.

A crocodile was also shot on the Tiwi Islands two weeks ago, suspected to have killed a local man who disappeared and has yet to be found.

But tests on the organic matter found in its stomach haven't yet produced a conclusive result.
