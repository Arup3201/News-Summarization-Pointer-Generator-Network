William Shatner has defended his decision to miss Leonard Nimoy’s funeral on Sunday and attend a charity event in Florida instead.

Star Trek legend Nimoy passed away on Friday following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and his funeral was held on Sunday in Los Angeles.

Shatner had led tributes to the late actor saying he loved him like a 'brother', but found himself the target of a barrage of abuse over the weekend from Twitter users condemning his decision to skip his friend’s funeral.

Star Trek legend William Shatner has defended himself for not attending the funeral of late co-star Leonard Nimoy after being criticized for honoring a charity commitment in Florida instead

Speaking to Inside Edition on Monday, Shatner stood by his controversial decision to honor a charity commitment he had made months ago.

‘My understanding is mourn the dead but celebrate life. I chose to celebrate life by going to the Red Cross gathering in Palm Beach, raised a lot of money for the Red Cross,’ he said.

‘In that ceremony, in that time, I asked over a thousand people to remember Leonard Nimoy and Maury Hurley, another wonderful writer and another dear friend of mine who died this week. 

'And to take a moment to remember them, but also remember them by doing good deeds. And those good deeds will be remembered long after any other kind of memorial.’

Shatner’s daughters Melanie and Lisabeth attended the funeral in place of their father.

Nimoy's widow Susan Bay was surrounded and comforted by friends just hours her husband was laid to rest during an intimate service on Sunday.

Embrace: Nimoy's wife Susan Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air on Sunday

Actress Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air.

The 71-year-old was hugged by a close companion as they remembered her husband of 26 years, who passed away on Friday morning.

Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock in the sci-fi franchise for 47 years, was reportedly buried at the Hillside Memorial Cemetery and Mortuary in Los Angeles, surrounded by close family and friends.

According to reports the service was restricted to a small number of guests, including the couple's children Adam and Julie, and the star's stepson Aaron Bay Schuck.

Afterwards, his family wrote a statement on Facebook saying: 'Thank you for all the love and kind words to Leonard. We lost a wonderful, talented, sweet man, a great father, husband, grandpa, and friend.

Tributes: Shatner tweeted tributes to Nimoy (together, left, in 2009) as he attended an event with his wife (right) Elizabeth for the 58th International Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach

'Lame excuse': A Twitter user condemned the decision by Mr Shatner. Others questioned why he didn't pay for a flight back from the event 

'Again thank you for all the love and good wishes. R.I.P and LLAP.'

It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours of their passing. But, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, Nimoy was buried on Sunday.

Although fans were barred from attending, they found their own ways to pay their respects.

A moment of silence was held at the the Long Beach Comic Expo, a two-day comic book convention in California, with many attendees also dressed as Spock.

Meanwhile, the actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was adorned with flowers, photographs and tribute messages.

Shanter revealed on Saturday that he would not be able to make it back for the service.

In the post, the 83-year-old Canadian actor wrote: 'I am currently in FL [Florida] as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight. Leonard's funeral is tomorrow. I can't make it back in time.

'I feel really awful. Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.'

When he revealed he was in Florida attending the Red Cross Ball and couldn't make it back in time, one of his followers said: 'Lame excuse. Man up.'

Social media users demanded to know why Shatner did not pay $30,000 to fly back from Palm Beach to LA immediately after the Red Cross event on Saturday night.

Relationship: The couple were married for 26 years. The actress and Mr Nimoy's son Adam announced his death on Friday 

Defence: Shatner responded to comments condemning his decision, saying he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago, adding that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth will be there

'Priceline? Do Red Cross event and then private jet to LA,' wrote Todd Schnitt, a host of a morning talk show on WOR AM 710.

Another said: 'Why not fly back right after?'

Answering one post addressed at him, he said: 'Walking out on a major fundraiser wouldn't have you calling me a jerk for leaving a charity high & dry? Hmm?'

In response to people who expressed anger toward him for not flying to Los Angeles, the actor wrote: 'One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long.'

He then used the social media platform to share his memories of Nimoy and answer questions from his followers about the late actor using the hashtag '#leonardnimoy.'

'I do want to thank everyone for coming here and sharing their memories and celebrating the life of LLAP! MBB,' he tweeted.
