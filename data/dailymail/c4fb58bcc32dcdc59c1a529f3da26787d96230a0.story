Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell has hit back after he was caught on CCTV in a bitter altercation with a member of the public.

CCTV footage shows the former press secretary to Tony Blair push away a man who abused him in a back street in Hampstead, north London.

Mr Campbell has now denied claims he punched and spat at the man, who called him: 'The biggest piece of s*** I’ve ever seen in this street.'

Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell has denied hitting and spitting at a man during an altercation in a north London street, which was captured on CCTV. The footage shows Mr Campbell (right of picture) enter the street after he had been jogging and a man (left of picture) walking towards him

The man appears to say something to the controversial political figure and later revealed he told Mr Campbell he was 'the biggest piece of s*** I’ve ever seen in this street'

The footage came to light after the man, who has not been named, went to former Labour MP George Galloway to tell him about the run-in with Mr Campbell.

The 61-year-old father-of-three involved later told local paper Ham & High that Mr Campbell 'struck out' and 'hit me on my shoulder' after he made the remark.

He added: 'I turned to confront him and said "That is assault, you should be in prison".

'At which point spitting ensued and then I aimed a blow with my foot that did not connect. Nothing that I did was illegal and he had no right to punch me.'

Mr Campbell, 57, has completely denied spitting at the man, but says 'minimal' contact was made  to stop the man coming any closer.

The CCTV appears to show Mr Campbell push the man away from him before they go out of shot as the argument continues. The man involved then comes back into shot and appears to shout something down the street before walking off.

Mr Campbell has been a senior figure in Labour  for many years and is currently advising Ed Miliband

Mr Campbell says he put out an arm to keep the man away from him as they came together in the road

Mr Campbell wrote on his website today: ‘I was walking down Perrin’s Lane last Monday after a run in Hampstead when a man walking towards me began shouting in abusive and aggressive terms as he approached.

'As I passed him I did not look at him, did not respond to his insults and put my arm out to his shoulder to stop him coming any closer. If there was any contact at all it was minimal.

'I walked on a few steps, thought he was doing the same but he turned back, followed me, continued to abuse me and when I turned around he came towards me and aimed a kick at me which came into brief contact with my leg.

'He then moved back but he came forward again and spat at me, most of the spit landing on my shirt, some on my face. I then turned and walked away.

'He continued to shout abuse as he walked in the other direction. I am confident that any full CCTV coverage of the incident would show all this to be the case.'

The man then turns and an argument appears to ensue as he follows Mr Campbell down the road

Moments later, after Mr Campbell says he was kicked and spat at, the man re-appears and walks off

Mr Campbell says the response to the incident was stirred up by former Labour MP George Galloway, who tweeted this message after the man spoke to him

Mr Campbell added: 'The claim he subsequently made to George Galloway and to which Galloway drew attention on social media – suggesting that I punched and spat at him – is totally untrue, indeed close to being the opposite of the truth.

'The fact that he went to Galloway rather than the police, does not wish to be identified, and wishes to have his claims made anonymously through Galloway’s office, speaks volumes.

'I have kept the shirt unwashed should this go any further, though given the police have better things to do with their time, I have no interest in pressing charges.'

He has called on Camden council to release any CCTV which may show the whole incident.

Mr Campbell, who lives near where the incident happened, gained a reputation for having a hot temper while working with the Labour government.

His management style is said to be the inspiration for Malcolm Tucker, the foul-mouthed fictional spin doctor in The Thick Of It TV series and the  film In The Loop.
