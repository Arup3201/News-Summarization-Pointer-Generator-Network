The Democratic Party is licking its wounds after losing a special election in Florida that turned into a referendum on Barack Obama, suggesting that the president has become an albatross around the necks of congressional candidates – and spelling election doom for November.

Election prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote in January that the 13th Congressional District race was one that Democrats 'can't afford to lose.'

Alex Sink, the losing Democrat, also lost a statewide race for governor in 2016 by a razor-thin margin, but carried the 13th district by 2 percentage points. Obama, too, prevailed there in both of his elections.

But the special election, created by the October death of longtime Rep. Bill Young, was a different story. Jolly won by nearly 2 points in a race that cost the candidates a whopping $12.7 million. And Republicans of all stripes are crowing about it.

Congressman-elect: Republican David Jolly was all smiles after defeating Democrat Alex Sink in an election that is seen as a referendum on Democrats' policies

The agony of defeat: Losing congressional candidate Alex Sink (C) was consoled by her son Bert McBride and her daughter Lexi Crawford (R) after she delivered a concession speech Tuesday night

Sink was 'ultimately brought down because of her unwavering support for Obamacare, and that should be a loud warning for other Democrats running coast to coast,' said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden Tuesday night.

David Jolly, the former Young aide who won the contest, told Fox News Channel viewers on Wednesday morning that Sink lost because her party embraced Obamacare.

'I think it gives Democrats reason to worry going into November,' he said.

Chris Cox, who runs the National Rifle Association's Political Victory Fund, blasted Sink for 'align[ing] herself with Michael Bloomberg and his anti-gun agenda,' and said Jolly prevailed because of his 'commitment to protecting our fundamental Right to Keep and Bear Arms.'

The Florida Faith & Freedom Coalition took credit for mobilizing evangelical Christians. Jim Kallinger, the group's chairman, said in a statement that Jolly's victory showed the November elections 'will be a referendum on the failure of Obamacare.'

The Susan B. Anthony List, a conservative group that promotes candidates who favor restrictions on abortion, claimed that the outcome was 'an early win for the pro-life movement.'

Sink’s 'extreme pro-abortion views,' said the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, 'put her far outside the mainstream.'

When Rothenberg handicapped the race in a January  Roll Call column, he wrote that 'a Republican victory in March would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the president.'

'And that possibility should worry the White House.'

High-fives, for now: Jolly celebrated Tuesday night but will have to defend his seat in November

Jolly's victory was cheered by the late former congressman Bill Young's sons Patrick (C) and Billy (R), whose father succumbed to cancer in October

Jolly's win came despite Sink outspending him 3-to-1 on television ads. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee insists special elections are usually a 'poor predictor of November success.' 

Renowned political prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg set the bar high for Democrats two months ago, saying they couldn't afford to lose in Florida's 13th District.

That theory will be tested this year, since Jolly must stand for re-election along with the other 424 members of the House of Representatives

The Tampa Bay Times reported that as Sink conceded 
the race, some of her supporters 
shouted, 'November! November!' according to The 
Democrat did not, however, say whether she would run again for the seat 
in this year’s general election, the newspaper reported.

Outside political groups, whose attention was focused on the only congressional race this month, spent heavily on attack ads slamming both candidates. That money will be spread thin in November, especially in U.S. Senate races that have drawn the most attention as indicators of Obama's potential lame-duck status.

'I have very good news tonight,' Jolly told supporters are his victory party: 'No more commercials.'

Famed game show host Bob Barker introduced him in a video message, shouting his well-known line from The Price Is right: 'Congressman David Jolly, come on down!'

Jolly's win could indicate broad disenchantment with the White House's handling of Obamacare, the IRS tea-party targeting scandal, the Benghazi terror attack in 2012, the National Security Agency's broad digital surveillance programs, or any of several other negatives that the president will carry into November.

The president didn't campaign with Sink despite flying to Florida for a golf trip less than a week before Election Day.

David Jolly's win over Alex Sink in Florida's 13th Congressional District may be a bellwether for Democrats' November woes

@highlight

The Florida 13th District race was the first real test of how well – or how poorly – Democrats are handling the White House's scandals

@highlight

The contest could be seen as a referendum on Obamacare, although Republican special interests are spinning it as a victory for gun rights, anti-abortion policies and a host of other narrow positions

The campaigns spent $12.7 million on the only national election fought this month, but the victor will have to stand for re-election in November
