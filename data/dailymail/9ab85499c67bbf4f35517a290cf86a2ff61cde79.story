European politicians will sit down for a special lobster and foie gras lunch today – subsidised by British taxpayers.

The European Parliament restaurant is laying on a three-course Christmas feast despite continuing austerity across the Continent.

MEPs, who earn around £75,000 a year, can enjoy the lavish menu for just 20 euros – which works out at less than £16.

For that price they can sample smoked duck breast and truffle oil, pheasant with foie gras and truffles, lobster au gratin with lemon sabayon or vegetable broth with quail eggs and smoked garlic.

Side dishes range from piped potatoes with chestnuts and chopped dried fruits, samphire flan, bundles of green beans, or an assortment of asparagus, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, the Evening Standard has revealed.

For those not wanting a hot meal, the salad bar offers a range of pâtés, meat, fish and charcuterie terrines.

The meal is finished off with Bûche de Noël - Christmas log - or fresh fruit salad.

Paul Nuttall MEP, Ukip’s deputy leader, said the subsidised feast was ‘a kick in the teeth for hard pressed families across the country’.

The European Parliament authorities defended the price of the meal as “eminently reasonable”.

They stressed that the menu was a Christmas special, therefore “exceptional”, and that it was being served in a canteen-like staff restaurant.

There had also been a drive to push down “substantially” the costs to public funds of the catering services over the last two years.

But animal rights groups have slammed the restaurant for serving foie gras.

A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said: 'The scientific consensus on force-feeding is crystal clear: it's cruel and should be banned.

'Every animal-protection organisation in the world condemns the production of foie gras.

'The EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare has catalogued a long list of ways in which foie gras production is inherently abusive.’
