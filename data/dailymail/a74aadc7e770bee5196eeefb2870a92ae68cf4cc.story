It is a question to challenge some of the finest legal minds in the land: when is a cake not a cake, and a biscuit not a biscuit?

Two judges solved it today by letting their taste buds decide – after testing a plateful of Snowballs, a chocolate and coconut covered marshmallow treat that has been popular with the sweet-toothed masses for generations.

Verdict: Snowballs are cakes. And that means the snack’s manufacturers are in line for a £2.8million rebate from the taxman after a lengthy legal wrangle over whether Snowballs should attract VAT (which biscuits do) or be zero-rated (as a cake).

Two brand-leading confectioner companies had each been ordered to pay the tax after HM Revenue and Customs insisted Snowballs do not enjoy the same exemption from VAT as tea cakes.

Cake or biscuit: The makers of the celebrated Snowball (being enjoyed by Emily Jack) will enjoy a £2.8m VAT rebate after judges decided it was a cake - based on its taste, texture and when it's eaten

Tunnock’s and Lees of Scotland refused to accept that their bite-size classics - devoured in their millions each year by Britons - are ‘standard- rated confectionery’.

So the sticky issue was decided instead by the might of a First-Tier Tax Tribunal - and the combined culinary wisdom of judges Anne Scott and Peter Sheppard.

At a hearing in Edinburgh, they were presented with a plate of Jaffa Cakes, Bakewell tarts, tea cakes, Lees Snowballs, Waitrose meringues and mini jam snow cakes as they deliberated. Later they also sampled some Tunnock’s snowballs.

‘We found that the plate looked like a plate of cakes,’ Judge Scott observed dryly. ‘We tasted all of them, in moderation, either at the hearing or thereafter. A Snowball looks like a cake. It is not out of place on a plate full of cakes. A Snowball has the mouth feel of a cake. Everyone agreed that a Snowball is certainly not a biscuit.’

Comparison: The judges ate Snowballs, bakewell tarts, teacakes and other sweet treats and said it had the characteristics of a cake not a biscuit

Through further explanation, it immediately became clear that the landmark decision was not reached without considerable research.

‘Most people would want to enjoy a beverage of some sort whilst consuming a Snowball,’ she concluded. ‘It would often be eaten in a similar way and on similar occasions to cakes - for example to celebrate a birthday in an office.’

The tribunal was ‘wholly agreed’ that a Snowball is a ‘confection to be savoured but not whilst walking around or, for example, in the street’.

‘Most people would prefer to be sitting when eating a Snowball and possibly, or preferably... with a plate, a napkin or a piece of paper or even just a bare table so that the pieces of coconut which fly off do not create a great deal of mess. Although by no means everyone considers a Snowball to be a cake, we find that these facts, in particular, mean that a Snowball has sufficient characteristics to be characterized as a cake.’

The ruling comes after a similar decision recently that Jaffa Cakes should be VAT free. Lees and Tunnocks both insisted their snowballs should also be exempt - and were appealing against a 2012 decision that rejected their claims for a £2.8million rebate.

Philip Simpson, for the companies, contended that the titbit should be VAT exempt. But Luke Connell, for HMRC, insisted the taxman should be allowed to take his bite. After digesting all the evidence, the tribunal ruled that the appeals should succeed.
