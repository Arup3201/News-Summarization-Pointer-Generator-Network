Clueless star Stacey Dash has reportedly begun talking with Fox News executives to become a network contributor.

Dash, 47, is best known for her portrayal of valley girl Dionne Davenport but she has been making a name for herself in the political realm over the past few years.

Her Republican beliefs caused a firestorm for the actress during the 2012 election when she publicly announced her support for Mitt Romney.

New role: The specifics about Stacey Dash's possible role on Fox remain unclear but she could either be a contributor or she may be given her own show

Coming back: Though Dash's big political debut came in 2012 when she tweeted her support for Mitt Romney, she was brought back into the fold with an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April

Dash has made several visits to Fox News as a guest commentator in the past two years but now she may become a more permanent fixture on the network.

‘I just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of show business but California and show business is the purest form of capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April.

She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs.

‘For the federal government to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say "We're all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy" is just a bit ridiculous,’ she said.

The New York Post reports that Dash is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series.

The basic plotline of the show, which has the tentative title of 'Stacey Dash is Normal', follows Dash's life as a Republican single mother living in Hollywood.

Dash became a conservative darling in 2012 when she started speaking out about politics after post revealing that, unlike many African American voters, she was supporting Romney.

‘I believe that if you stand for something you have to stand for it, you can't hide behind it or it won't get done,’ she told the Fox and Friends crew last month.

She said that her career has not been negatively impacted as a result of her Republican beliefs, perhaps because she said that there were more conservatives in Hollywood than many would expect.

‘If you make movies and the movies make money, they're going to make the movie. You know for example, if Obamacare were a movie they would not make a sequel, let's just say that,’ she joked.

During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, she used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'.

The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'.

While many took issue with Dash, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her.

'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Ms Dash told CNN's Piers Morgan.

She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to now endorsing his opponent is 'because of the state of the country'.

'I want the next four years to be different,' she said at the time.
