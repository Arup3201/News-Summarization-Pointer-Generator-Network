A young Eddie Redmayne is pictured with his family at the idyllic French farmhouse where he spent his childhood holidays... and now you can spend a week in the villa, but it will cost you an eye-watering £9,000.

Holiday websites describe it as a Provençal farmhouse and a 'much-loved family home' with six bedrooms. 

They fail to mention, however, that it is owned by the parents of arguably the biggest British film star of 2015 and is undoubtedly one of the places that shaped the actor as the man he is today.

The property in Grimaud, Var is nestled into the hillside close to luxurious St Tropez and just two hours from the ski slopes. 

It boasts a 12-metre swimming pool and tennis court and according to holiday rental sites it can be yours for the week for £9,100.

The villa, which sleeps 12 people, is surrounded by forests and the views from the house stretch over its very own vineyard into the Prignon Valley. 

It belongs to his parents, Patricia and Richard Redmayne, who will surely see a surge in interest now it's revealed as the childhood holiday home of an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe-winning actor. 

Eddie, now 33, spent holidays, half-terms and even weekends at the villa from the age of six.

On Sunday night, he scooped the Best Actor prize at the 87th annual Academy Awards for his performance as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything - something which has 'thrilled' his family.

Speaking in the wake of Eddie's Oscar success, his 93-year-old Scottish granny Mary Burke said: 'We’re just delighted. We’re a very close family. We’re thrilled.'

She continued: 'He’s one of six grandchildren. I’m very proud of them all.

'We’re a very close family. He still pops up from time to time.'

Eddie's uncle, Thomas Burke, was not at home yesterday but his wife congratulated her nephew's success.

Karen Burke said: 'We just want to say very well done, we're very proud of him.'

Eddie thanked his family in his emotional acceptance speech at the Oscars, where he fought off competition from Benedict Cumberbatch.

The photographs of the stunning holiday home come as no real surprise - the star has previously admitted his life has been 'insanely privileged'.

The Redmaynes posed for the images outside their then-home with a professional photographer, as part of a feature on ‘cross-continental commuters’ for the London Evening Standard in 1999.

At the time, Eddie’s father Richard, then 61, told the newspaper: ‘I work these crazy hours in the City, which always forced us to live in central London.

'Then there came a point when we decided that we needed somewhere in the country for the weekends, where we could unwind with the children. 

'This is where a bit of lateral thinking came in. It suddenly dawned on us - why not have our weekend place abroad?’ 

At the time of the photographs, Patricia was 50, Eddie was 17 years old and his brothers Thomas and James were 11 and 20 respectively. 

His father is now chairman of the leading financial house Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.

The 76-year-old has also been a director of the television company TV-AM, as well as helping raise finance for Eurotunnel.

Further back in the paternal line, there is Eddie's grandfather, John, an Army major turned stockbroker, and his great-grandfather Sir Richard Redmayne, who in 1908 became the first Chief Inspector of Mines.

As for the family wealth, it can be traced to the early 19th century and a successful linen and drapery business based in London's Bond Street.

Eddie's mother Patricia comes from a somewhat more humble background and is the daughter of a customs and excise officer. She was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed.

While studying at Edinburgh University she met and married her first husband. But the marriage did not last long and, after relocating to London, she met Richard Redmayne, also a divorcee.

Eddie has two brothers - James and Tom - and also has a half brother and half-sister from his father's first marriage: Charles is the CEO of publishing giant HarperCollins, Eugenie an investment banker.

The family were raised in a stunning £2.5million townhouse on the Chelsea embankment with vacations spent at a sprawling holiday home in the South of France. 

Eddie went on to win a choral scholarship to Colet Court - a private school in London - then another to Eton College, which his father also attended.

By the time he arrived at the £34,500-a-year public school, a taste for the bright lights was emerging.

He attended weekend classes at the Jackie Palmer Stage School in High Wycombe, where classmates included actor Aaron Johnson (his wife is Sam Taylor-Johnson, director of the Fifty Shades of Grey film) and comedian James Corden.

Then Eddie landed his first West End role aged 12 in Sam Mendes' production of Oliver!.

'I had one line: "Books you ordered from the bookseller, sir",' he has recalled. 

While sport was not his passion, he represented the school in rugby, playing alongside Prince William, a classmate.  

But throughout his time at Eton it was in drama that he would excel.

The budding actor appeared in a succession of annual school plays including Richard III and A Midsummer Night's Dream.

As his final year approached, Eddie considered going to drama school but accepted his parents' advice that it would be good to have a degree to fall back on.

International spotlight: It was his portrayal of Professor Hawking in The Theory of Everything that has made him a household name

Next stop for Eddie was Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied art history. He left with a 2:1 — achieved despite the slight disadvantage of being colour blind.

During his three years there he also managed to fit in the Edinburgh Fringe, land a contract modelling for Burberry and do an internship at City broker Cazenove. 

But his biggest achievement came in the shape of his first professional role. 

His old teacher tipped off the actor Mark Rylance (currently starring as Thomas Cromwell in the TV adaptation of Wolf Hall) who was searching for a teenage Viola to play opposite his Olivia in an all-male Twelfth Night.

Performed at Middle Temple Hall in 2002, it was this production that launched his career.

In the years that followed, Eddie played a series of challenging and diverse characters on stage and on screen.

Recognition: Redmayne's role in Les Miserables made him a household name and his popularity has been heading in the right direction since

More mainstream recognition came with his role as Stephen Wraysford, the tortured hero in the television adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's World War I novel Birdsong

These included a psychotic schoolboy in the thriller Like Minds, then Angelina Jolie's son in The Good Shepherd, after which he played Julianne Moore's incestuous son in Savage Grace. 

More mainstream recognition came with a lead role in the film of Les Miserables, in which his choral training came into its own, and as Stephen Wraysford, the tortured hero in the television adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's World War I novel Birdsong.

He also starred in My Week With Marilyn, playing Colin Clark - the Eton and Oxbridge-educated movie studio gopher who befriends Marilyn Monroe during the filming of the 1956 The Prince And The Showgirl movie in London.

But it is his portrayal of Professor Hawking that has turned the international spotlight on him.  

After leaving Cambridge he was in a lengthy relationship with fellow student Tara Hacking, who read languages and acted at university and afterwards, too.

After that he was briefly linked to actress Carey Mulligan in 2011 before being spotted cosying up to pop star Taylor Swift. But he denied any relationship.

It turns out he was actually dating Hannah Bagshawe, a financial-PR turned-antiques-dealer, whom he had known since meeting her at a charity fashion show arranged with a girls' school near to Eton. 

The couple married before Christmas at Babington House in Somerset but they had to cut short their honeymoon so that Redmayne could throw himself into the acting awards season.

He had promised to make up for that by taking his new wife on holiday as soon as the Oscars were over.

Perhaps he already booked his childhood holiday home... but it's unlikely he'll have to cough up the £9,000 per week for the pleasure.
