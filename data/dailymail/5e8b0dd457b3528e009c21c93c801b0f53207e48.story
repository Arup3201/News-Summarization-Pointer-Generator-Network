Affluent residents of an upmarket New York street have called for a parking ban after complaints of motorists having sex in their cars.

Revellers are said to be getting frisky in vehicles and littering the area with condoms after leaving night clubs in the Chelsea district of Manhattan.

And sleep-deprived tenants of $9,500-a-month apartments say a ‘controlled riot’ of ‘drugs, sex and double parking’ is unleashed on their strip on Friday and Saturday nights.

Suffering: Residents of this strip of West 30th street have sent a petition to New York City Hall to ban weekend parking in a bid to stop drivers having sex in cars

They want authorities to take the unusual step of banning weekend nighttime parking on their section of of West 30th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues.

The Department of Transportation is now reviewing the proposal after the CB5 community board – a local council – voted to send a petition to City Hall.

‘There’s all kinds of problematic activity going on, like noise, violence, sexual activity and drug use,’ Raju Mann, the chair of CB5’s Transportation Committee, told the New York Post.

 ‘The cops are called all the time — drugs, sex, double parking, cars honking their horns, traffic blocked up,’ resident Richard Schwartz also told the newspaper.

If parking was banned at weekend it would mean that any car that risked pulling over there could be towed away.

At other times, the area is controlled by parking meters and residents permits – although few residents themselves have vehicles.

New York is the only city in the United States where car owners are the minority.

Complaints: The Parlour - one of two night clubs on the strip - has recently had a request to renew its liquor licence denied after alleged violations

And in Manhattan – its most built-up borough – only 20 per cent of residents own a vehicle.

The midtown Chelsea area, which includes Madison Square Garden sports and concert venue, is a well-known night life hotspot in New York.

Thousands of people travel into the district at weekends to enjoy themselves in the district’s many night clubs.

Two - Rebel NYC and The Parlour - are located on the on the strip of West 30th streets where the demand for a parking ban was made.

Recently, the the State Liquor Authority recently denied The Parlour’s request to renew its licence following several complaints.

The bar — which is allowed to stay open pending the conclusion of the review — could be forced to close.

Rocco Sergio, a manager at The Parlour, said they are now trying to work with the community.

Rebel NYC did not comment.
