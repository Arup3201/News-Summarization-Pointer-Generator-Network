Savannah Guthrie, the replacement for Today show presenter Ann Curry, is already failing to impress audiences with her Olympics coverage.

TV network NBC flew fellow presenter Hoda Kotb to London this weekend to help 'bring the show to life' following poor viewing figures on the first day of broadcast last Thursday.

The dramatic move comes after Today's Olympics build-up fell short fell in the ratings war with rival network ABC's Good Morning America.

Centre of the action: Hoda Kotb is bringing her unique brand of fun to the Today show's Games coverage

'They called Hoda on Thursday begging her to go to London because they said it wasn’t working like they thought,' an insider told the New York Daily News.

She joined Guthrie and co-hosts Matt Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in London.

Former frontwoman: The news that Guthrie needed rescuing may have caused ex-Today host Ann Curry some glee

Kotb, who usually co-hosts the raucous fourth hour of Today with Kathie Lee Gifford, was set to be starting a two-week break from the show, but instead headed to the UK to join in the action.

The 47-year-old tweeted on Friday after completing her
 show: 'Packing my bags and heading to London 
this weekend — thx for all the story suggestions. You know I will do 
them!'

The Kathie Lee & Hoda blog currently says the show is 'on Olympic hiatus for a little while.'

Kotb was rumored to be the front-runner for Curry's position around the time of the former Today 
show anchor's teary departure on June 28.

But when asked at the time if she was
 interested in the role she reportedly said she was 'joyful 
where I am.'

Guthrie, the show's co-hosts, and 
special prime-time Olympic correspondents, Meredith Vieira and Ryan 
Seacrest have all had their roles established for months, the source 
said.

'They're just shoehorning Hoda into the show to help bring it alive', the source added.

Guthrie, 40, was promoted from host of the 9am hour but Today has not once beaten Good Morning America in the ratings since she arrived on July 9.

Neilsen ratings showed that in her first week on Today, ABC’s GMA drew 4.598 million viewers compared to NBC's comparatively lacklustre 4.245 million.

Since her sudden and unexpected promotion
 Guthrie is said to be taking migraine medication and visiting doctors 
regularly to cope with the stress of declining figures.

At 40, Guthrie is 15 years younger than 
ousted host Ann Curry who returned to TV screens earlier than she had 
anticipated to cover the Colorado shootings.

The two women appeared professional 
during the coverage as Curry reported from the field to Guthrie who was 
seated in the studio on the very sofa that Curry warmed for 15 years.

But
 sources have told Radar Online that with the news of Guthrie's poor 
performance in London, Curry is secretly rubbing her hands in glee.

'Ann
 feels completely vindicated by the TODAY show's poor ratings since she 
left,' said the source who claims to be close to the situation. 'She 
feels she was fired completely unfairly and wasn't given a fair shot at 
the gig.'

'Ann feels she was made a scapegoat by the network and that it's the whole show that needed an overhaul, not her replacing,' the insider continued.

'She feels they should have booked better guests and had a more exciting line-up and better stories to cover and better writing.

'Ann believes that point has been proved by the show's ratings declining even further since she left.'

Despite
 these beliefs, however, the source insisted that in her new role as 
anchor-at-large, Curry does not harbour any personal resentment for 
Guthrie.

'She has no 
hard feelings towards Savannah,' the insider told Radar, adding that 
when it comes to Matt Lauer, however, 'there's definitely no love 
lost...

'She feels [he] threw her under the bus completely.'

 

NBC has the exclusive rights to televise
 the Olympics in the US, so the network will be hoping for a rapid 
improvement on the coverage now that the quirky, upbeat Kathie Lee &
 Hoda host has arrived in London.

During the Olympics, Today’s audience reportedly usually increases by around 30 per cent on average.

But when Thursday's pre-Olympics coverage did not beat Good Morning America, Kotb 'didn't hesitate in saying yes'.

A spokeswoman for Today did not respond to a request for comment.
