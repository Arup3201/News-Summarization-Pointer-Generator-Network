Chiller Cabinet: Owen Paterson, who was promoted to Environment Secretary in the Cabinet reshuffle, wants to see British desserts outsell foreign imports

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson yesterday urged patriotic diners to help close Britain’s ‘dessert deficit’ by buying more British puddings.

Mr Paterson, who was appointed this month with a brief to kick-start the rural economy, said it was time for Britain to ditch fancy foreign dishes.

He said diners should swap desserts such as panna cotta, crème brulee and tiramisu for traditional favourites like treacle tart, apple crumble and spotted dick.

In an interview with Farmers Weekly he said there was a ‘big job to be done’ in boosting Britain’s food exports and persuading more people in this country to eat British produce.

Mr Paterson singled out desserts as an area where there was great scope for ‘import substitution’, if diners could be persuaded to buy British.

He said he is particularly alarmed at the 
level of dairy-based desserts which are imported from overseas, at a 
time when UK farmers are struggling to recover the costs of producing 
milk.

‘There is a huge dessert deficit in this country,’ he said.  ‘We have a huge opportunity to replace imported desserts with desserts made here.’

Peter Henderson, chairman of the Gloucestershire-based Pudding Club, which promotes traditional British desserts, welcomed the intervention.

‘I would be delighted if the 
Government wants to put its weight behind British puddings. Anything 
that promotes British food is a good thing.

‘Promoting British recipes and British products has to be a good thing for our economy - and our tums as well.’

Britain imports twice as much ice cream as it exports, according to official figures, something the minister wants to reverse

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not keep detailed figures on the trade gap in puddings.

But officials pointed to the dairy sector as a particular cause for concern.
Recent figures reveal that Britain imported 115,000 tonnes of ice-cream last year – more than double the 50,000 exported.

Yoghurt imports reached almost 150,000 tonnes – six times the 25,000 sent abroad.

This summer British farmers blockaded 
milk processing plants in protest at the price their received for milk, 
often lower than the 30p per litre it costs to produce.

While just two per cent of liquid milk is imported, the level of cheap processed dairy products coming from overseas is much higher.

He believes if everyone in Britain bought a dessert made here they would help to reverse the trend, and provide a welcome boost to the farming industry.

The Great British Bake Off with Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry has been a uige hit, and reignited interest in old-fashioned desserts

The UK is currently a major net importer of dairy desserts, something the new minister hopes to reverse.

Officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are examining ways to persuade shoppers to buy British.

It
is thought the success of cookery shows like The Great British Bake Off
will reignite interest in traditional desserts, after a drift towards 
lighter puddings like panna cotta and sorbet.

Mr Paterson also revealed plans to increase the amount of British food sold abroad, saying there ‘is a big job to be done in exporting.

Former farm minister Jim Paice, who was ousted in the reshuffle which saw Mr Paterson promoted to Defra, had been spearheading a drive to sell British pork to China.

‘There is also a real job to be done promoting dairy products, promoting food production and adding value,’ Mr Paterson said.

‘More generally, there is a real job for Defra to get out of people’s hair – to help businesses start up and prosper in all sorts of small ways. But basically to make it simple, to encourage the kaleidoscope of business ideas across the countryside.’
