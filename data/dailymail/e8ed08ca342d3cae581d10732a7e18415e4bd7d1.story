Michigan police pulled a dog with a rock tied around its leg from a river last week and are looking for the person responsible.

A Dearborn Heights police officer rescued the trapped canine Aug 26 after a passerby called 911 after seeing it marooned in the river. The dog made it through the disturbing ordeal relatively unscathed, and mostly muddy.

‘It took the dog, which appears to be a Golden Retriever-Labrador-hound mix, a couple of days to calm down from what I’m sure was a horrifying experience for him,’ a Dearborn Heights Police spokesperson told the Detroit Free-Press.

The dog, now called River, was taken the local animal shelter where it is now being cared for, according to reports.

 ‘He was a little frightened and initially wasn’t responding to staff very well because I think he was very scared,’ the spokesperson told CBS Detroit, ‘but he has since calmed down and he has been looked after and he is a really nice dog.’

The dog tested positive for heartworm, according to the Free-Press, and the shelter will pay for treatment of the potentially deadly condition while the dog stays in a foster home. The plan is to eventually find River a permanent adopter.

‘It hurts me because I have a golden retriever, and I would never think of doing something like that to the dog,’ local Gregory Gritu told WXYZ.

Police are offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever is responsible for this depraved act as River begins to return to normal.

Police hope that spreading the word also leads to an arrest.

‘Someone has to know this dog,” the spokesperson told the Free-Press. ‘So-and-so’s dog has been gone for 10 days. This looks like so-and-so’s dog. We’re hoping they leave tips to help the Dearborn Police solve the case.’
