Tourists were astonished to see the Fab Four belting out their most famous songs at some of the capital’s most famous landmarks on top of a bright red open-topped London double-decker bus.

But for the cast of the hit West End Beatles musical ‘Let it Be’ it almost became ‘let’s be having you’ as the long arm of the law took exception to their antics outside the Broadcasting House headquarters of Britain’s BBC.

The mobile open air concert which included stops at Trafalgar Square and the palace of Westminster which houses ‘Big Ben’ was to promote the first night of the musical’s summer run at London’s Garrick Theatre in Charing Cross Road where the Beatles bus tour came to its final stop attracting hundreds of fans, many singing along.

A production is also underway this week in Monaco, home of the super-rich with show producer Jamie Hendry said at the ‘Let it Be’ after-show party: ‘I thought at one stage we were going to get arrested. It was a bit tense. I think they were going to call the police if we hadn’t moved along.’

He said: ‘Obviously we were careful to make sure we had all the right paperwork and permissions to perform where we did, but we may have been pushing it a little when we tried to play an impromptu gig in the foyer of Broadcasting House – their security people very politely but very firmly made it plain that we should clear out before we were thrown out.’

But he added generously: ‘We’d like to offer all the security staff who were on duty that day a free pair of tickets to the show so they can see what they were missing out on!’

The Fab Four cast’s run in with the law had echoes of the real Beatles’ final public performance  on the  open roof of the  Apple offices of London’s Savile Row on January 30, 1969.

The 42 minute set which included ‘Get Back’ ended when police arrived to stop the performance. John Lennon declared to watching office workers, media and police officers: ‘I’d like to say thank you on behalf of  the group and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition.’

Playing the Fab Four on Thursday night’s Let it Be’ opening performance which brought the house down were Michael Gagliano (John),  Emanuele Angeletti (Paul), Liverpudlian Paul Mannion (George) and Luke Roberts (Ringo).

The ‘Let it Be’ musical showcases the music of the world’s most successful rock’n’roll band which sparkd ‘Beatlemania’ .

It charts the band’s meteoric rise from their humble beginnings in Liverpool’s Cavern Club, through to breaking into America at the Shea Stadium, and Sgt  Pepper and the psychedelic flower power era.

Big hitters: The show is packed with over forty of The Beatles' best songs including Twist and Shout, I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Hard Day's Night

The production originally opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre in September 2012, before transferring for a year-long run at the Savoy Theatre from January 2013  to  February 2014, and then a UK and worldwide tour. 

It has been  seen by more than 700,000 people worldwide  and recently delighted audiences in Germany, Japan, Moscow, and on Broadway in New York.

The show is packed with over forty of The Beatles’ greatest hits including Twist and Shout,  I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Help, Hard Day’s Night, Day Tripper, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, When I’m 64,  I Saw Her Standing There and Yesterday.
