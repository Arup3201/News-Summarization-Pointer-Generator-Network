It was last sold prior to that when Ms Fischer pocketed $2.8 million back in 2000, Property Observer reports. Â 

Packer's development company transferred the 210 square metre property into Ms Fischer's name in 1998 when the pair ended their relationship.

They had been together for five years and engaged for two.
