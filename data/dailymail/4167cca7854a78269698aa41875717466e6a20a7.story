She's more often seen in elegant tailored suits and neat tea dresses but it seems the Duchess of Cornwall looks just as good in academic robes.

Camilla, who is known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, was at Aberdeen University to present degrees to graduating students in her role as Chancellor.

Elegant in a traditional black and gold robe worn over a cream and blue polka dot dress, the sophisticated Duchess beamed as she congratulated the new graduates.

Proud: Camilla beamed as she walked in the procession on the way into the beautiful Elphinstone Hall

Camilla was made ambassador of the university in February 2013 when she was elected by the graduate body.

She succeeded Lord Wilson of Tillyorn who stepped down after having served the role since 1997.

The
 role comprises ceremonial duties including awarding degrees to 
graduates at the end of each academic year, as she was doing today.

And it's a duty she certainly seems to enjoy, after she was pictured beaming with pride as she walked in the procession through beautiful Elphinstone Hall in Aberdeen.

Earlier
 in the day, the Duchess carried out more duties as
 she officially opened the new Aquatics Centre at Aberdeen Sports 
Village.

Greeted by cheering crowd, she looked thrilled as she was handed by a huge bouquet of flowers, before being introduced to Team GB divers James Heatly and Grace Reid and swimmers Robbie Renwick and Jack Ness.

The Duchess has had a busy few weeks and spent most of the last seven days in Wales with Prince Charles for their annual tour.

During their visit, the royal couple paid tribute to the miners killed while working in the coal mines and laid a wreath after meeting with families.

They also toured the beautiful St Illtud's Church in Vale of Glamorgan, where they were greeted by huge crowds of cheering schoolchildren - much to their visible delight.
