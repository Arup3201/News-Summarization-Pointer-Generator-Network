Scotland will be plunged into a deeper economic crisis than the 2008 crash if it breaks away from the UK, Danny Alexander warned.

The Lib Dem Treasury minister said the devastating financial collapse which took Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink would be 'dwarfed' by the impact of independence.

It came amid claims Scotland will lose its £300million-a-year share of the UK's EU rebate if it votes for separation.

With barely 50 days to go until Scots have their say in the independence referendum, warnings about the economic impact have escalated.

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said Scotland would face a devastating combination of falling North Sea oil revenues and an ageing population which would imperil the economy. 

He told The Sun: 'If you're a Scot and you're worried about public expenditure and austerity, if you vote for independence you ain't seen nothing yet.

'The financial pressures that an independent Scotland would face would dwarf what I've had to do in the last four years.'

It follows a similar warning earlier his month from former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling who said the risks of Scotland going it alone ‘are colossal’ and there will be no going back.

Mr Darling, who was Chancellor in the Labour government when the banking crisis hit in 2008, said the ramifications of independence would be even greater.

The UK taxpayer spent £66billion bailing out failing banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds.

‘Being told the world's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system,’ Mr Darling told The Independent.

‘But the decision on Scotland is forever. It's irrevocable, irreversible. If we get it wrong, it will have a profound effect, not just on Scotland, but the rest of the UK. The stakes in the banking crisis were big; this is so much bigger.’ 

The economic challenge an independent Scotland would face were laid bare with a fresh warning about its £300million-a-year share of the EU rebate.

Professor Carlos Closa of the European University Institute in Florence said Alex Salmond has no right to the UK's hard-won windfall.

The First Minister had claimed the rest of the UK and a newly separate Scotland would share the rebate in the event of independence.

But Professor Closa has become the latest expert to dismiss the idea. 'There is no right to a rebate. It is just something the UK has negotiated,' he said.

Gordon Brown has warned that losing the rebate would cost the Scottish Government £20billion over seven years.

An independent Scotland may also have to contribute to the money the UK gets back, which would cost £540million, also over seven years. That would be a major blow to Scotland's finances, with the country £12billion in the red last year - a proportionately higher deficit than the rest of the UK.

Despite this, the SNP Government has promised to continue high public spending, which Finance Secretary John Swinney plans to bankroll with £3.6billion of borrowing over two years.

There was at least some good news for Mr Salmond, as Professor Closa predicted Scotland would be allowed to rejoin the EU if there was a Yes vote.

He admitted other member states - any one of which could block an independent Scotland - were concerned about a domino effect among separatist regions of their own countries.

But he expects them to admit Scotland - then close the door to those who try to follow.

Professor Closa said: 'Scotland has a very good position because it is the first one in the line. But there is real fear of a domino effect across Europe, and not just in Spain's Catalonia or Basque Country. 'There are other member states which fear Scottish independence might trigger claims in their own territories. Italy, France and Hungary, for example, have minorities.

'After Scotland, you may expect moves to prevent other member states splitting apart. Even if Scotland gains recognition and becomes a member state, other countries will want to close this option.' 

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'Scotland has a huge amount to offer the EU, including almost 60 per cent of its oil reserves and around a quarter of Europe's wave and offshore wind energy potential, which is why we will be in a very strong negotiating position - and why it will be in other countries' interests for Scotland to continue in membership.

'The current EU budget has been agreed until 2020 and prior to then Scotland's share of the UK rebate will be a matter for negotiation between the Scottish and UK Governments. For subsequent budget rounds, an independent Scotland will be in a position to negotiate the best deal for Scotland.'

A beleaguered Alex Salmond is failing to convince Scots on separation as the country approaches the last 50 days of campaigning before the referendum, a major study shows.

The British Election Study (BES) of about 6,000 Scots - a far higher number than other polls - shows 51 per cent plan to vote No.

The Yes campaign is winning over more undecided voters, but not enough to close the gap. The BES also becomes the latest observer to say that Mr Salmond's failure to deliver a credible economic case for separation - with no answers on currency and start-up costs - will cost him.

It says the economy is the biggest issue among undecided voters considering a Yes ballot.

According to BES, 51 per cent of Scots plan to vote No, 39 per cent Yes, and 10 per cent remain undecided. 

The BES asked 5,896 people how they intended to vote in February and March, and another 6,182 in May and June.

The results show some undecided drifting towards Yes, but not in high enough numbers.

The pro-Union Better Together group said it was another encouraging survey showing most Scots want to stay in the UK.

But Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: 'Support for Yes is solid and as we move into the final eight weeks of the campaign we will be working hard to continue the flow of undecided voters to our side.'
