You'll soon be able to know the time like the back of your hand with the world’s first ‘projection’ watch.

The Ritot is fitted with a projector that beams the time, as well as notifications from a connected smartphone, on to a hand or wall.

The time is projected by tapping or shaking the Ritot and projections last for 10 seconds.

The watch was designed by Ukrainian-based Michael Medvid and its projector displays notifications and the time on the back of the wearer's hand (pictured). Called Ritot, notifications are projected by tapping or shaking the bracelet

The Ritot syncs with a smartphone via Bluetooth.

Shaking the wrist reveals the time, and notifications are beamed automatically as they are received on the phone.

Projections reveal the caller’s name, text messages, reminders, emails, tweets, Facebook posts, and more.

These notifications, including the colour of the projection, can be customised using the Ritot app, and can be dismissed by shaking the device.

Alternatively, the watch will vibrate when notifications are received, and comes with a built-in alarm.

Medvid said: 'Inspired by future technologies we wanted
 to create a completely different, original timepiece. Ritot is the 
first projection watch.'

The company is hoping to start shipping watches to buyers by February next year.
