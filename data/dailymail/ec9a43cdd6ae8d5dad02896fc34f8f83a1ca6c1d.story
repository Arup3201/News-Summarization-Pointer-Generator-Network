Crackdown: 'Accidental landlords' will no longer be able to take out buy-to-let mortgages to cover their costs under a new EU Mortgage Directive

Tens of thousands of ‘accidental landlords’ could struggle to secure mortgages under new EU rules designed to clamp down on buy-to-let investors.

‘Accidental landlords’ are home-owners who have not intentionally purchased a buy-to-let property.

They may have been forced to take out a mortgage to buy a second home because they were not able to sell their house, or have inherited a property while wanting to buy another elsewhere.

But under the new EU Mortgage Credit Directive, Britons who fall into this bracket could be denied loans or pay more for their mortgage.

A document published by the Treasury to interpret the new directive describes an accidental landlord as someone who has become one ‘as a result of circumstance rather than through their own active business decision’.

This contrasts with deliberate buy-to-let investors, who will usually have set up a company into which their rental income is paid. They will not be affected by the changes, and will still be loaned money on the basis of the rents they are bringing in.

But the new rules will create extra affordability tests for those who fall in the ‘accidental’ category - roughly one fifth of the 1.6 million existing buy-to-let mortgages.

They will have to pass criteria in the same way as traditional house buyers.

This would mean that, rather than looking at how much the buy-to-let owner would make in rental income, mortgage providers would also have to consider salary and spending habits.

The rules could mean that older buy-to-let customers could be denied mortgages because they would not be able to re-pay the full amount before retirement.

Rosanna Bryant, a partner in retail financial services at Addleshaw Goddard, said the new rules will cause huge confusion about where to draw the line.

She said: ‘Essentially it will be looking at buy-to-let that isn't done for business purposes - “reluctant landlords”.

‘That may be people who are unable to sell a property and rent it out, or who can't live in a property because they have moved away for work, or who have inherited property. The line that is drawn isn't that obvious.’

Uncertainty: The Treasury was unable to confirm how many people would be hit by the rule changes

The changes, which will come into force by March 2016, could be a further blow for the housing market which has slowed because of changes in the mortgage system.

The Treasury was unable to confirm how many people would be hit by the rule changes.

Experts in the mortgage industry voiced their concerns about the new rules coming into effect in such a short time frame.

Fiona Hoyle, head of consumer finance at the Finance and Leasing Association, said: ‘Firms will only have nine months to get to grips with it, and that’s not really how mortgage lending works – there is a pipeline.’

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, warned of ‘higher mortgage rates and heftier fees’ when the new rules come into force.
