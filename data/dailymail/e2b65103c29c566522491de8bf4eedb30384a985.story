The former Bank of England governor risked an angry backlash  after describing the economic crisis as ‘great fun’.

At a time when thousands of Britons lost their jobs and struggled to pay their bills, Mervyn King appeared to be having the time of his life, as head of the UK’s central bank.

Lord King said that it was ‘exciting’ working at The Bank of England as they battled to prevent a repeat of the economic depression of the 1930s.

Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, described having 'fun' with Ben Bernanke when chairman of the US Federal Reserve

His admission comes at a time when the effects of the financial crash are still keenly felt around the world, with the eurozone still facing crisis.

The economist fondly reminisced about his turbulent 10-year reign as the governor of the Bank as he guest edited Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday.

He said he wanted his staff to ‘enjoy’ working during the financial crisis and said ‘moments when laughter plays a big role’.

But he also issued a stark warning that Britain was not yet strong enough to withstand another economic meltdown, saying: ‘I don’t think we have yet got to the heart of what went wrong’.

Interviewing the ex-chairman of the US Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke about working together during the crisis, he said: ‘It was great fun and fascinating to work with you during the crisis despite the fact we were dealing with really serious problems.

‘I hope the experience was also fun for you?’.

Mr Bernanke denied it was fun, instead describing it as ‘challenging’ and ‘incredible stimulating’.

‘Fun wouldn’t be quite the right word’, the American said, adding that while it was ‘very satisfying’ to help to solve the world’s financial problems, but was ‘not an experience I would voluntarily repeat’.

Lord King, as head of the Bank's monetary policy committee between 2003 and 2013, was at the heart of the response to the global crash as he was in charge of setting Britain's interest rates and controlling the supply of money. 

The peer revealed that once US banking giant Lehman Brothers collapsed in late 2008, triggering the beginning of worldwide economic collapse, he found the crisis easier to handle. 

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It was exciting and it was fascinating and it was the sort of problem that we had trained to deal with over many years.’ 

The two men exchanged memories about the boring meetings and 'fun' had during the financial crisis, which saw the collapse of US banking giant Lehman Brothers in late 2008

But Lord King suggested that, while Britain was on the road to recovery, it was not yet able to survive another economic crisis.

He said: ‘We have made the banking system safer, that is true, but is it really safe enough?

‘Would we survive another big financial crisis which could yet come?

‘I don’t think we are yet at the point where we can be confident that the banking system would be entirely safe.’

He added: ‘I do not think that the next financial crisis will come from the banking sector.

‘I think it will come from somewhere else, but who knows where it will be.’
