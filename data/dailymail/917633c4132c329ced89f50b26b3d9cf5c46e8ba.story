Donors who gave political parties £14million were later appointed to the House of Lords, a report revealed last night.

That was the total sum handed over from 2001 to when the Peers were ennobled by the parties to whom they donated the money, anti-corruption campaigners found.

In total, members of the upper house gave £39million over 13 years to the major political parties, Transparency International said.

The group warmed that the new figures would reinforce the suspicion that peerages could be bought.

Transparency International's executive director Robert Barrington warned that the system was 'highly vulnerable to corruption'.

Former sleaze watchdog Sir Alistair Graham, who was chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life said the research showed House of Lords reform was a ‘top priority’ if we ‘want to safeguard the integrity of our democratic system’.

The figures were reported by The Sunday Times, who said all the individuals and parties involved deny any link between donations and a seat in the Lords.

The research, in the Sunday Times, showed that 11 Lords appointed in the last four years donated more than £100,000 each to either a political party or an individual MP between 2001 and receiving their peerage.

Labour's Lord Haughey had given the party £1.3million by the time he was elevated to the Lords in September last year. He has since donated another £166,400.

Lord Haughey told The Sunday Times he had donated over more than 10 years and ‘if there was any hint that my peerage was connected to my financial support, I would have point-blank refused to accept it’.

Other donors named in the paper are Conservative peer Lord Fink, the hedge fund manager and former Tory Party treasurer, gave the party a total of £2.4 million between 2001 and 2011 when he was appointed to the Lords. He has since handed over a further £728,941.

All three parties at the last election pledged to end the ‘big donor culture’ in politics.

Lord Bew, who chairs the committee on standards in public life said: ‘Suspicion about the motives of political donors and recipients comes as no surprise when all three main political parties rely on a small number of big donors for the funds they need.’

Earlier this month, a former Liberal Democrat treasurer, Lord Razzall, said he was repeatedly offered cash for seats in the Lords – prompting a report to the Metropolitan Police and demands for a formal inquiry. Critcs demanded the Peer name those involved to the police.

He admitted he received approaches from business people 'several times a year' but instead of reporting them he just told them to 'keep quiet'.

The research showed that Labour peers collectively gave the party just under £21.6m since 2001, compared with the Conservatives' £15.6m and the £1.2m given to the Lib Dems.

All lords who responded to requests for comments denied any link between donations and their peerages.

Mr Barrington said: ‘We are not accusing any of these individuals of being corrupt. In many cases individuals have made substantial contributions to public life.

'But they are operating within a system that is highly vulnerable to corruption.

'These statistics will inevitably reinforce the perception that a peerage can be bought.'
