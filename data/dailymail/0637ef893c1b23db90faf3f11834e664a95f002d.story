As New Zealand international Jesse Ryder smashed a six over the square leg boundary at the Otago Volts' Seddon Park, veteran broadcaster Ian Smith's first thought appeared to be right. 

Smith mused immediately that the left-hander's destructive flick off his legs was bound for his car and soon enough, with an almighty thud, the dent was there for all to see on his roof.

'That's out of the ground, that's gone, it's downtown,' Smith said as the delivery from Wellington Firebirds' Grant Elliott - no mug with five Tests to his name - disappeared over a hot dog stand.

The significant dent on the roof of a car that Ian Smith was convinced was hit as soon as the ball left the bat

'It's on my car! It is! I think it hit my car! Oh, the downside of getting a park so close!'

The upside for Smith was that the car was a rental, Smith revealed when asked by unsympathetic co-commentator Mark Richardson if he was insured. 

'For God's sake, Jesse,' Smith said, taking the hit in good humour. 'Another report. It's not the first one, I suppose. Usually it's a scrape on the door ... how am I going to explain that? At least I have evidence.'

After a lengthy wait to find the ball, or a replacement, there was hope from Smith as he had second thoughts about whose car it was. 

'I don't think I was that far down,' Smith said. 'For some reason I was more behind the hotdog stand 30 yards back. I might be OK.' 

Otago Volts opener Ryder whipped his shot way over the square leg boundary and into a car

Ryder appears non-plussed by the six, one of four in his blistering innings of 56 from 25 balls 

Either way, Ryder's six was among few highlights for the Otago side in their clash with Firebirds in the New Zealand Georgie Pie Super Smash. 

The big-hitting opener top-scored with 56 from 25 balls, hitting four sixes and six fours as the Volts reached 169 for 7 off their 20 overs. The Firebirds chased it down with two balls to spare.

In the same match a fan took a spectacular catch in the crowd, sliding barefoot down a grass hill for a one-handed grab off Volts batsman Michael Bracewell. 

As it turned out, the man who took the catch, Andrew McCulloch, was the partner of Bracewell's sister who was also in the crowd.
