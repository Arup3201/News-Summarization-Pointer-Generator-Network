These photographs depict one of the most legendary and intrepid polar expeditions in history.

Taken by Captain Robert Falcon Scott himself more than 100 years ago, they illustrate the fearless explorer’s ill-fated trek to the South Pole, which cost him and his four companions their lives.

The black-and-white negatives have only recently been discovered, but they could soon be lost to Britain forever unless enough money is raised to stop them going to auction and potentially ending up overseas.

They will be lost unless enough money is raised to stop them going to auction and potentially going overseas

Acclaimed explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes is spearheading the campaign, along with the Scott Polar Research Institute, to raise enough money to save the negatives, which he describes as being ‘of major significance to the national heritage’.

The 113 negatives are owned by a private vendor, who is seeking £275,000.

Due to complications over copyright, many of the negatives of the photographs taken in the 1911-12 trek were kept in a private collection, before they emerged in 2012.

Sir Ranulph, 70, said: 'The negatives of Scott's lost photographs are of major significance to the national heritage.

'Scott's
 attainment of the South Pole and his subsequent death captured the 
public imagination on its discovery in 1913 and continues to exercise an
 extraordinary fascination.

'The negatives are a key component of the expedition's material legacy as an object and as a collection in themselves.

'Although
 the Scott Polar Research Institute holds prints of a number of these 
photographs, acquiring the negatives is very important. 'They take us 
right back to the point of origin, a fact made all the more exciting 
given that the Institute also holds the camera on which they were taken.

'Unlike
 a print, of which any number can be made, the negatives are unique and 
would be a huge asset to the Institute.' Bridget Cusack, of the Scott 
Polar Institute in Cambridge, said the negatives will be available for 
the public to come and view them if they are successful.

The
 institute's director, Julian Dowdeswell, said: 'There has been an 
extraordinary generous response to the appeal, proving how important 
Scott remains in the national imagination.

'Every donation, however small, brings us closer to reaching our goal of £275,000.'

The Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge said the public will be able to come and view the negatives if their bid to acquire them is successful and it appealed for donations.

Captain Scott, 44, set out with four 
companions in 1911 to become the first people to reach the South Pole, 
but when he arrived there in January 1912, he found that a Norwegian 
team led by Roald Amundsen had already beat them to it.

Scott's
 entire party died on the return journey from the pole from a 
combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. Some of their 
bodies, journals and photographs were discovered by a search party eight
 months later.
