The vehicle of a missing pregnant woman has been found with a body inside in California. 

The Toyota Prius, belonging to Aubrey Andrews, 20, was found on Monday night in a parking lot in Sacramento.

Police have not released the identity of the woman found in the car, but say there does not appear to be obvious signs of foul play.

Missing: The vehicle of a missing pregnant woman (left)  has been found with a body inside following a massive search. Aubrey Andrews, 20, left her husband (both right) and three-year-old son at home in Sacramento when she drove off 'distraught' at 10pm on December 6

Mrs Andrews left her husband and three-year-old son at home in Sacramento when she drove off 'distraught' at 10pm on December 6. 

The next day her purse appeared on the family's porch, although she has not been heard of since.

Her husband of three years Edward Andrews said she suffers from post-partum depression.

In an emotional interview this week he cried as he said he thought she was going to a friend's house. 

'If she doesn’t want to be here, she doesn’t have to be,' he told KTLA.

Emotional appeal: Mr Andrews said he thought she was driving to a friend's house and now he's scared

Family life: The couple, married for three years, have a three-year-old son at their home in Sacramento, CA

'But at least let us know. Tell us you went somewhere, that you’re safe.

'The baby could come at any time at this point.'

Mrs Andrews had allegedly become frustrated with doctors' orders to stay and home and rest in the time leading up to her due date.

She did not use her bank card since driving away in her white Toyota Prius and her cellphone goes direct to voicemail.

Police said they were treating her disappearance as 'unusual' but not suspicious.

They said they believe she may have traveled to south California where she has family and friends. 

The Coroner’s office will release the identity of the woman after proper notifications have made.
