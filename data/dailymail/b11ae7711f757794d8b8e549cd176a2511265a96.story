A meteorologist for ABC affiliate WATE in Knoxville, Tennessee recently received some rather unwelcome fashion advice from an elderly viewer in a handwritten letter.

The letter tells Julya Johnson that while she's a 'great meterologist [sic],' she would get a lot more compliments if she didn't wear 'those high bodice dresses.'

The letter-writer left no return address, so Johnson posted the letter on her Facebook page along with a polite but firm response to the advice therein.

Weathering the storm: Julya Johnson says that after 12 years on-air, she's realized she'll never please everyone with her appearance

Unsolicited: In a letter apparently penned at 2am, an 'elderly person' told Johnson not to wear dresses that 'fight snugly' under her bust

The letter begins by complimenting Johnson at her proficiency at her job but quickly gets to the point: Johnson's appearance.

'Please change your appearance!' reads the letter from someone who describes themselves as an 'elderly person.'

'Do you Have any dress or dresses that don't fit snugly under your (Bust)? Please! You are Beautiful – But you need a change,' it goes on.

Johnson, rightfully, was annoyed at the unsolicited fashion advice.

Accurate forecast: Julya Johnson says that if she knew people would value her more for her appearance than her work she could have saved a lot on her meteorology degree

'Does the fact that I bring an accurate forecast mean nothing? I was a straight A student. If I had known being on People's list of "best dressed" mattered more than an accurate forecast, I could've saved a ton of money on that meteorology degree,' she writes.

The WATE meteorologist has been on-air for 12 years and says she's tried to change herself to please other people before, and that she's realized it's pointless.

'I will never, ever be able to please everyone with my appearance,' she writes.

'I have "changed my appearance" to try to please people before. It never works. So, I please myself. I like my dresses. I feel good about my appearance. I am always covered, dressed modestly and professionally.'

As Julya Johnson points out, commenting on other people's appearance is 'very rude.'

Viewer letter:

Hello Julia [sic],

You are a great meterologist [sic]! I am at [sic] elderly person who depends on WATE 6 News for my daily news and weather – my daily beginnings – I watch this news from 2 a.m. – thru the day. I observed every one gets great compliments about their job, How they give great forecast [sic]. There are not any compliments about you! Why? Please change your appearance!! Those high Bodice dresses are Not (for) you. Do you Have any dress or dresses that don't fit snugly under your (Bust)? Please! You are Beautiful – But you need a change. Please don't feel like I'm putting you down. Allow me to apologize. This letter is meant for the beautiful lady you are. Go forward (Be happy!)

Julya Johnson's response:

So, it's not fun to wake up to things like this. No return address was left, so I'll address it here. I will never, ever be able to please everyone with my appearance. It's not possible. I have tried for 12 years on-air to do that. I have "changed my appearance" to try to please people before. It never works. So, I please myself. I like my dresses. I feel good about my appearance. I am always covered, dressed modestly and professionally. Yet, she mentions that I am a great meteorologist! And she also says I get "no compliments"? Does the fact that I bring an accurate forecast mean nothing? I was a straight A student. If I had known being on People's list of "best dressed" mattered more than an accurate forecast, I could've saved a ton of money on that meteorology degree.Don't do this, people. Just don't. It's very rude. That's my opinion, and it is as valuable as anyone else's opinion.
