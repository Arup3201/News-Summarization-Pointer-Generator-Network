West Ham are showing an interest in Atletico Madrid midfielder Mario Suarez. 

The 27-year-old had been lined up as a short-term option to replace Alex Song, who was expected to line up for Cameroon at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations. 

But Song's shock decision to retire from international football could have a bearing on West Ham's decision process.

West Ham however, will face competition from AC Milan, who are also exploring the option of taking Suarez on loan.

Manager Sam Allardyce meanwhile, will take a £7million offer for Winston Reid in this window should clubs come forward. 

Allardyce has admitted that Reid has 'no future' at West Ham and expects the defender to leave when his contract ends in the summer.

Reid has refused to sign a new deal with the east London club and it now appears his five-year stay will come to an end on June 30 when his contract expires.

Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are monitoring the situation.
