Wayne Rooney switched his attention from boxing to golf as the Manchester United striker enjoyed a round in Cheshire on Wednesday.

The England captain caused a stir at the weekend when a video emerged of him, appearing to be knocked out cold by Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley after an impromptu sparring session in his kitchen.

The 29-year-old followed it up just hours later on Sunday with one of the best celebrations of the season after he scored the second in United's 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over Tottenham at Old Trafford.

But he may have a different swinging celebration up his sleeve if he scores against United's arch-rivals Liverpool this Sunday.

A smiling Rooney, who is known to have strong passion for the golfing greens as he does with prize-fighting, was dressed head-to-toe in the latest Nike Golf Vapor range as he hit the course for 18 holes.

The star, who is pals with Manchester United-supporting world golf No 1 Rory McIlory, tweeted: 'Finally got out for a game of golf today and tested my new @nikegolf driver. It's the best one yet!'

Rooney will return to training on Thursday as Louis van Gaal's side ramp up their preparations for their must-win trip to Anfield, where they look to strengthen their grip on a top-four place to qualify for next season's Champions League.
