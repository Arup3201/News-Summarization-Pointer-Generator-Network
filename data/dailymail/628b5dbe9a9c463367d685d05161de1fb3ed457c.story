Roll over Beethoven there's a new maestro in town - and this one still wears nappies.

An adorable little girl becomes utterly lost in the music after apparently taking it upon herself to conduct her church choir.

Displaying and immaculate sense of timing and rhythm, the youngster named Lara waves her armsÂ  passionately as she appears to send the music into a dramatic crescendo.

Just like the world's top conductors her face is a picture of pure emotion as she leads the choir through the performance.

The hilarious clip was filmed inside a church in Kyrgyzstan in central Asia, where most of the worshippers seemed completely unaware of the little star in their midst.

But thankfully one person managed to capture Lara's brilliant performance on their mobile phone and uploaded it to the internet where it is fast becoming a global sensation.
