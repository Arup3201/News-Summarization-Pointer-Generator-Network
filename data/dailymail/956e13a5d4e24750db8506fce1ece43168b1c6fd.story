A Royal Navy veteran who threatened to torture two City traders over unpaid business debts was jailed for eleven-and-a-half years today.

Joseph Fontan, 34, told Charlie Thomas and Andy Ritchie they would be kneecapped and killed if they didn't pay the debt.

Fontan threatened to torture Mr Thomas with barb wire and told him he would chop off his fingers as well as making horrific threats about his children.

He added interest to his £10,000 debt, more than doubling it to £25,000, and demanded he hand over thousands of pounds in weekly installments.

Mr Ritchie, a former newspaper executive who helped take the Evening Standard free, handed over the £7,500 he owed because he feared he would be killed.

Fontan told both his victims he would bury their dead bodies on a patch of land he owned in Essex.He first won their trust by claiming he was a top City broker setting up a lucrative oil deal - but was in fact jobless and claiming dole.

He denied blackmail but was convicted after an Old Bailey retrial.

Jailing him, the judge, Mr Recorder William Clegg QC, said: 'There are many feature in this case that are akin to robbery.

'The sentence is a reflection of the cruel and sinister threats that you made.

'They cannot be compared, in my judgement, to bullying.

'These are bad cases of blackmail with threats of serious physical violence.

'It is an unusual feature that, by dint of your aggressive personality, you were able to convince your victims to pay substantial sums of money which they didn't have had to borrow for fear they would terrible violence inflicted upon them.

'You had the ability to terrify your victims and you used that ability.'

Fontan now faces having to pay back the cash he frightened his victims into handing over.

Fontan's 'enforcer' Gurdal Sherifali, also known as 'Tony', was jailed for two years after he admitted assisting with the blackmail of Mr Thomas.

But the 39-year-old will walk free within weeks because he has already served the equivalent of 340 days in custody awaiting sentence.

Prisoners are automatically released on licence when they have served half their term behind bars.Fontan reeled in his victims by inventing a bogus business deal he claimed could make them profits of £70 million.

He said he was trying to broker the sale of three million barrels of Iraqi oil recovered from Somali pirates by special forces.

After they agreed to join his syndicate, he told them the deal had collapsed and demanded each man hand over his share of the £30,000 costs.

During one phone call, Fontan told Mr Ritchie: 'You have no f****** honour.

'I don't care if you beg, borrow or steal the money.

'If I don't have it in a week I'm going to come round and kneecap you.'

Mr Ritchie said: 'I was very scared. This guy I know to be exceptionally violent.

'I've seen him attack people. I was scared for my life. I believed he was going to do that - and maybe more.'

He added: 'When he's had a drink and he's aggressive, he turns into a psychopath.'

Fontan started making threats to Mr Thomas during a meeting at City pub The Wall on June 14, 2011, after finding out he also owed money to Dickon Adam, who was also involved in the oil deal.The thug said: 'I don't f****** like you.

'Dickon told me you owe him some money, I'm going to take that debt on and you will owe me the money.

'You don't want to owe me because I am a nasty, aggressive man - you don't know who you're f****** dealing with.'

Another meeting was set up at the Corney and Barrow winebar in Paternoster Square on June 17, where Fontan announced the debt had been increased to £25,000.

He then lit a cigarette, threatening to burn Mr Thomas's eye and telling him to 'choose which finger you don't want'.

Fontan also told him he would insert a copper pipe wound with barbed wire into his rectum and send 'two black men' to rape his children.

He chillingly added: 'There are people buried out in Essex and you will join them.'

After demanding an immediate payment of £2,000, Mr Thomas rang his brother Marc, who agreed to pay the money and then spoke to Fontan - secretly recording the conversation on his mobile.

He then called police after hanging up.

After hiding microphones on his clothing, Mr Thomas later met his tormentor in the same bar on June 24 after promising to pay £9,000 in cash towards the debt.

Fontan, who has a previous conviction for kicking a Tube worker in the groin when he was refused entry to a locked station, was arrested by undercover cops as soon as the cash changed hands.

He tried to blame Sherifali for the blackmail plot, but later claimed he thought his victims had conned him out of the cash.

Giving evidence during his trial, he grinned in the witness box as he boasted: 'I don't have to intimidate anyone.'

Prosecutor Lucy Kennedy said: 'Fontan was the one making the orders, and he used his technique of instilling fear in others to have his demands met.

'Like most bullies, he talks a big game and enlists others to do his dirty work for him.'

Fontan, of  Fulham, southwest London, denied conspiracy to blackmail and three counts of blackmail relating to Mr Ritchie, Mr Thomas and Mr Thomas's brother.

He was convicted after two retrials. The first case had to be for legal reasons in December 2011, while jurors in a second trial in August last year failed to reach a verdict on the blackmail charges.

Fontan was cleared of false imprisonment and two counts of common assault relating to an alleged attack on Mr Thomas in the Corney and Barrow toilets during their June 17 meeting.

Sherifali, of  Wimbledon, southwest London, admitted a single count of blackmail.
