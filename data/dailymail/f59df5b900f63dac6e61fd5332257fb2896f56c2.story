One Great Wall isn't enough for China - but this latest creation won't do too well at keeping out advancing armies - because it is made from a staggering 85,794 Rubik's Cubes.

The giant mosaic, the biggest of its kind in the world, is 220ft long and 13ft tall and shows the skyline of Macau.

Each Rubik's Cube had to be solved by hand and placed onto panels before being assembled.

The amazing mosaic has been designed by Toronto-based Rubik's enthusiasts Cube Works Studio.

Toronto-based Josh Chalom has been creating art out of the toy for five years in his Cube Works Studio

Each of the 85,794 Rubik's Cubes had to be solved by hand before being assembled into panels then built up - taking five weeks alone

To buy so many of the toy in the UK would mean splashing out Â£857,082.

And the unusual piece of art has been certified the largest Rubik's Cube mosaic ever created by Guinness World Records.

Designer Josh Chalom, an insurance worker from Toronto, Canada, spent two weeks designing the mosaic.

Each cube has nine pixels and Mr Chalom had to make sure that not one of the 772,146 pixels was out of place.

The 53-year-old said: 'I've always been a fan of reading the Guinness World Records and wanted to create something magnificent, that made people go 'wow'.

'The Rubik's Cube has always fascinated me - it's one of those things that everyone can relate to, all around the world.

'At some point in our lives, we've all picked up one and either managed to crack it and complete the cube, or we've got fed up and given up.

'It just shows that you can create huge pieces of work from everyday items.'

The designer, who has been creating art using Rubik's Cubes for five years, worked with graphic architect Nick Hall, who made blueprints for the designs.

It took 90 days to complete the mosaic - and solving the Cubes one-by-one took five weeks alone.

A team of 25 pitched in to assemble the final model.

Mr Chalom said: 'I was inspired by the brilliant architecture that I saw in China. There are a lot of old and special churches, combined with new and advanced buildings.

Mr Chalom said he was inspired by the old and new architecture of China, so recreated Macau's skyline in toy-form

Judges from Guinness World Records measured the mosaic from side to side and top to bottom to decide if it could be named the largest Rubik's Cube mosaic ever made

It's the biggest! Josh Chalom pictured accepting the piece of paper that says he's a record breaker

'I wanted to create something that showed the old and new China.

The cubes came from a local Chinese factory and Mr Chalom was delighted with the final version.

He said: 'I wanted to create something monumental and breathtaking - the reaction that we've had from people has been amazing.

'Some people have been blown away by what they saw. It's good to create something that makes people so intrigued and fascinated.

'It's also a great way to get younger people involved and interested with the unique ways you can create pieces of art.'
