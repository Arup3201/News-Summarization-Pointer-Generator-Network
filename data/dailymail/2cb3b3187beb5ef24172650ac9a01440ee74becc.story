Chief economist at The King's Fund John Appleby it is time to think more 'long-term' about health spending

Health and social care could account for half of all Government spending in 50 years’ time, warn leading analysts.

By 2060, 50 per cent of UK public spending could be allocated to treating and caring for people - a stark rise from the 20 per cent currently spent.

Analysts at The King’s Fund, an independent health policy body, based their predictions on economic growth and current levels of taxation and government expenditure.

Population changes, increases in wealth and medical advances will put relentless pressure on health and social care spending in the future, says a new report.

People living longer will also be a factor, but will play a smaller part than assumed.

A massive rise in spending was not inevitable, said the report, but possible alternatives include controversial measures such as increased taxation or limiting the scope of publicly funded services.

It calls for an ‘informed public debate’ about the choices, with ministers commissioning regular reviews of spending pressures.

John Appleby, chief economist at The King’s Fund and author of the report, said ‘While there is nothing inevitable about spending on health and social care continuing to increase in line with historic trends, the pressure to spend more is likely to see it consuming an ever-larger proportion of national income.

‘It is time to think much more long-term about how much we should spend, the benefits of this spending and how it should be paid for.

‘By turning the spotlight on these issues now, we hope to stimulate an informed debate about the difficult choices ahead.’ The UK currently spends around 9 per cent of its national income on health and social care, more than twice as much as 50 years ago.

This could more than double again to nearly 20 per cent by 2061, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

Based on projections for economic growth and current levels of taxation and government expenditure, the report estimates this would translate to around half of public spending.

NHS Confederation chief executive Mike Farrar said the financial pressures ‘coming down the tracks’ meant there was an urgent need for a sustainable solution.

He said ‘There is a growing consensus that the NHS must change to meet the needs of our changing population, make the most of healthcare technology, and live within its means.

‘Addressing these issues will require 
some tough choices and it is essential that we have open and honest 
conversations with the public about what we can afford in the future and
 how we will fund it.

‘We 
urgently need an all-party debate about how we can establish a 
sustainable health and social care system, with radical solutions very 
much allowed.’

Dr Peter 
Carter, Chief Executive & General Secretary of the Royal College of 
Nursing said ‘The health care needs of the country are becoming more 
complex and the NHS needs to adapt to these changes while maintaining its core principles.'

‘It is equally important, however, that increasingly scarce funds are not diverted from the frontline into major reorganisations.

‘Nursing staff are integral to supporting patients with long-term conditions and carrying out preventative work in communities. Removing these vital skills and services now is only going to cause greater problems, and higher costs, in the future.

‘We hope this report encourages a longer-term approach to workforce planning to ensure that there is the right number of staff and sufficient resources to effectively deal with patients’ needs.’

A Government spokesman said ‘While The Kings Fund’s predictions are speculative, we agree it is vital to look in detail at the long-term pressures placed on health spending.

‘That is why the Office for Budget Responsibility’s annual assessment of the future growth of health spending will continue to inform the decisions we take. These forecasts will help to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for the future and continues to meet the needs of the entire population.’
