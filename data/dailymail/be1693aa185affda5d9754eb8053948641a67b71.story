Sting: Emails showing how councils are delighted when there's an increase in the number of parking fines dished out

Damning evidence of how councils use CCTV cameras to ‘sting’ motorists with unfair fines to raise extra cash is revealed today.

Emails expose officials’ delight that rising numbers of traffic fines are being issued, with one saying: ‘Another record month, guys. Well done.’

Hundreds of the documents were released to a motoring campaigner under the Freedom of Information Act and will be screened tonight in an investigation by BBC1’s Panorama.

They show how surveillance cameras are catching out cars performing U-turns and being stuck in box junctions as part of a ‘target-based, revenue-raising culture’.

The programme highlights Britain’s most notorious yellow box junction, which has been dubbed ‘the money box’ for raking in £2.7million a year by trapping and photographing up to 40,000 drivers before sending them a £130 fine in the post.

Motoring groups say such tactics ‘verge on entrapment’ and fear they will spread across Britain.

The programme obtained hundreds of emails between employees at the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham which show staff being congratulated on increasing the number of fines.

Among the comments in the emails are: ‘Another record month, guys. Well done’; ‘Another increase ... holidays, as expected, bring back the traffic’; ‘Another good month last month. That’s despite the systems problems we had. So well done to everyone.’

A note to the head of parking services about the council’s procurement of specialist ‘close circuit TV equipment’ says: ‘Aim of project: To increase parking revenue (target: additional £5m.)’

The council said the email was from a management trainee temporarily seconded to the council and ‘wrongly’ suggested the aim was to raise revenue.

Other messages between traffic officials reveal dismay that not enough cash is being raised from traffic and parking fines.

One notes: ‘A worrying start as Penalty Charge Notices seemed to reduce.’

Another adds: ‘We may get a negative hit on the U-turn tickets for this month.’

Panorama says the council is ‘exploiting a sophisticated new camera system to fine motorists for moving traffic offences, such as stopping in a yellow box junction or making a banned turn’.

No cash cow: Hammersmith and Fulham Council has denied issuing tickets to raise money

Critics say the ‘money box’ junction, controlled by traffic lights at the intersection Bagley’s Lane and New Kings Road, is badly signed and designed.

Only four spaces are available for cars leaving the junction, so drivers can easily get trapped in the box and fined £130.

Researchers who put up clearer warning signs at the junction recorded a 25 per cent fall in cars getting stuck – before being told by the council to remove the signs.

The council has spent £500,000 installing a round-the-clock camera system called Zengrab which spots errant motorists automatically.

Motoring groups fear that more drivers will suffer because more than 20 cash-strapped councils have lobbied ministers for extra powers – currently available only in London – to fine motorists for a range of 26 moving traffic offences.

Solicitor Jeanette Miller, a specialist in motoring law, tells Panorama that the Hammersmith & Fulham emails ‘indicate to me that this local authority is motivated primarily by revenue raising’.

Professor Stephen Glaister of the RAC Foundation said: ‘You could understand if drivers thought this behaviour verged on entrapment. Councils have a legal obligation to keep traffic moving.

‘Bulging bank balances, swollen by penalty charges, should not be viewed with pride but as a sign that something is wrong with the way traffic is managed.’

Hammersmith & Fulham denied issuing tickets to raise money and described the emails as ‘office banter’.
