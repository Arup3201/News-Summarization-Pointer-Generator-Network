Distraught residents in the heartbroken town of Machynlleth today pleaded for searchers to never give up looking for April Jones - after a police chief admitted she might never be found.

Families are buying supplies to help the searchers continue the hunt, with a trolley at the entrance to one supermarket being filled up once every hour - then delivered to the search headquarters.

And locals in the Welsh town say they will keep filling it up for as long as the search parties keep looking for the five-year-old schoolgirl, who was abducted from outside her home nine days ago.

Local shopper Bev Roberts, 37, said: ‘Please, please ask the searchers never to stop. We will never rest here until April is found.

'No-one can even imagine the scale of the pain that her parents are going through. She is out there somewhere and she needs to be found.’

But hopes are fading that April will ever be found. Superintendent Ian John, who has headed the search, said: ‘We have to prepare for the time when we accept that we might never find April.

‘We are optimistic that the work we are doing is going to give us the best possible chance.

'But if we have to face that consequence,
then we will do so and we will share that with the family and the wider
community of Machynlleth.’

However,
the food trolley at the Machynlleth Co-operative has become a symbol of the 
town’s refusal to give up hope - and it has already been filled up 40 
times.

Supermarket staff 
deliver the supplies of bread, coffee, tea, crisps and sandwich fillers 
to the search headquarters. The community is also supplying pain 
relievers to the search parties.

Store manager Mark Thomas, 38, said: ‘We started making sandwiches to feed the police, mountain rescuers and search teams.

‘But our customers were asking what they could do to help, so we put a trolley by the tills and it is being filled up every hour. We then take whatever is in there down to the search and rescue base in our delivery van.’

Mr Thomas said some shoppers were donating money, with one chipping in £40 to feed the army of searchers. Searchers have also asked for specific items such as shower gel.

He added: ‘The response has been amazing -
everyone in the town is helping by making sure the search party is 
well-fed and cared for.

‘The donations have been greatly appreciated by everyone in the search for April.

'They’ve been away from their homes for days and the search is taking its toll. That’s why they’re now asking for these items.’

Supermarket worker Shellie Davies, 34, said: ‘We are taking it in turns to deliver the donations while we still try and do our day jobs as well.

'The police and searchers have said thank you to us. It made all of us at the store feel better knowing we could do something'

‘The police and searchers have said "thank you" to us - people we have never seen before just saying "thank you" as we are passing them.

‘It made all of us at the store feel better knowing we could do something even though we have to be at work.’

Mark Bridger, 46, has been charged with April’s murder, child abduction and attempting to pervert the course of justice. He is due to appear before Caernarfon Crown Court tomorrow.
