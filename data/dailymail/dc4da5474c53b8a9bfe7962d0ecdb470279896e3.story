While wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, and Alexander Fleming, the inventor of penicillin, managed to get away with it, new NHS advice has revealed that those with less than lovely desks are much less likely to triumph in the workplace than their tidier counterparts.

According to NHS life coach, Jayne Morris, a cluttered desk leads to a cluttered mind, meaning those who work in the midst of a mess are less likely to get things done - and will be less successful as a result.

The same goes for anyone whose home or office is a disorganised mess - even if you've had a cleaning binge and stashed the clutter out of sight in the attic.

Mess not success: According to NHS life coach, Jayne Morris, a messy desk can seriously hinder your career

While it might sound ridiculous, Morris might well be right. Microsoft boss, Bill Gates, is famously tidy, as are fellow tycoons, Richard Branson and Donald Trump.

Morris said: 'Having an untidy desk covered in clutter could be stopping you achieving the business success you want.'

The life coach, who claims to have worked with everyone from celebrities to major business figures, added: 'Clearing clutter from your desk has the power to transform your business.

'How? Because clutter in your outer environment is the physical manifestation of all the clutter going on inside of you.

'Clearing clutter has a ripple effect across your entire life, including your work.'

Morris also said that women were more responsible for clutter than men because women are less likely to make room for themselves and have too many other commitments to tidy up.

Among other recommendations, Morris says that simply tidying a desk at work and an overflowing filing cabinet will instantly have a positive impact on 'your internal world.'

Untidy: Wartime prime minister Winston Churchill was notoriously messy but still enjoyed a successful career. Richard Branson, however, is both tidy AND successful

Anything that is no longer used should not be put into storage but thrown away completely.

Keeping something in the loft, garage or other part of the house, does not help because it is still connected to the person 'by tiny energetic cords' she claims.

She continued: 'The things in your life that are useful to you, that add value to your life, that serve a current purpose are charged with positive energy that replenishes you and enriches your life.

'But the things that you are holding on to that you don't really like, don't ever use and don't need anymore have the opposite effect on your energy.

'Things that no longer fit or serve you, drain your energy.'
