Pregnant women can drink alcohol and coffee and dye their hair – but should avoid gardening, according to an expert who  aims to dispel ‘motherhood myths’.

Economist and author Emily Oster contradicts conventional wisdom and advocates a much more relaxed approach to pregnancy.

In her book, Expecting Better, she claims a glass of wine a day is fine, plenty of coffee won’t harm the baby and gaining too little weight while pregnant is far more worrying than gaining too much.

Safe? According to Emily Oster, a glass of wine a day is fine during the second and third trimesters

The Harvard-educated associate 
professor of economics at the University of Chicago used her data skills
 to rewrite the rules of pregnancy.

Last
 night she told the Daily Mail that food restrictions were ‘overblown’ 
and that alcohol consumption does not affect the IQ or behaviour of the 
child.

She said her book – 
which found the best studies often painted a different picture from 
official guidelines – was ‘simply to show women the evidence and let 
them decide for themselves’.

Miss
 Oster said: ‘Actually getting the numbers led me to a more relaxed 
place: a glass of wine every now and then, plenty of coffee, exercise 
when I wanted it.’

Controversial: Oster's research contradicts received wisdom on drinking during pregnancy

Miss Oster’s quest began when she became pregnant three years ago and was advised to give up her four cups of coffee a day.

Unwilling
 to do so and frustrated by ‘one long list of rules’, she investigated 
and found that research linking coffee consumption to higher rates of 
miscarriage was flawed.

She 
wrote in one article: ‘I ultimately decided that the weight of evidence 
didn’t support limiting my consumption very much. I decided to 
continue.’

Her next port of 
call was alcohol. She looked at a study in the journal Pediatrics, which
 had concluded that just one drink a day was enough to put unborn 
children at risk of behavioural problems.

But
 the research did not reflect that 18 per cent of the women studied 
didn’t drink at all and 45 per cent of those who enjoyed a daily drink 
also took cocaine.

She 
concluded that women should feel comfortable with one or two drinks a 
week during the first three months and up to one a day after that.

Her
 research found that dyeing hair was fine and there was little evidence 
that exercise, while not unsafe, had any benefits. But she found 
gardening could raise the risks of exposure to a toxoplasmosis parasite 
living in the soil.

Toxoplasmosis
 is caused by a parasite and is acquired from contact with cats and 
their faeces. A woman contracting it just before or while pregnant can 
transmit it to her baby.

Miss
 Oster said: ‘There is some risk to increase birth defects if you do a 
lot of outdoor gardening when you are pregnant. That can increase rates 
of toxoplasmosis.’

She discovered sushi was fine and sardines and herring were good for a child’s IQ, but advised against raw milk cheese.

Sceptics
 were less convinced. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Drinking 
during pregnancy can be associated with miscarriage, foetal alcohol 
syndrome and low birth weight.’

‘Our advice remains that women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant should avoid alcohol.’

Netmums
 website founder, Siobhan Freegard, said: ‘Official guidelines may seem 
stringent but they are there to err on the side of absolute safety.’

Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong-and What You Really Need to Know, £10.04, is released next week by Orion.
