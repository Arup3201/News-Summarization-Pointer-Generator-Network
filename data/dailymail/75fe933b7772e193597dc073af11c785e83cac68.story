A Florida jury has recommended a 21-year-old killer be sentenced to death for the 'cold and calculated' murder of a teenager after a dispute over his ex-girlfriend.

Michael Bargo and four others were found guilty of killing 15-year-old Seath Jackson by luring him to a home where they beat him, shot him to death, burned his body and hid the dismembered remains in a paint bucket in a rock quarry.

Bargo's accomplices have all begun life sentences for their role in the brutal murder; a jury at Marion County Court, Florida recommended late yesterday, by a majority of 10 to two, that Bargo receives the death penalty. He will be the youngest criminal on death row in the southern state if the judge agrees with the decision.

Convicted killer: Michael Bargo was convicted in less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson. A jury late yesterday decided he deserved the death sentence

The court heard yesterday, Bargo 
'wanted Seath alive in the bathtub, so when Seath took his last breath, 
the last thing he would see is the defendant standing over him,' 
prosecutor Amy Berndt is quoted by wftv.com.

The
mother of 21-year-old killer took the stand yesterday and blamed her 
ex-husband for her son's troubled childhood that she claims led him to 
murder, telling Michael Bargo, Sr, 'It's your fault.'

His defense attorney argued that Bargo didn't act alone and he was clearly mentally ill.

But prosecutors convinced the majority of the 12-person jury at Marion County Court that Bargo was the mastermind of a cold, calculated and premeditated murder and deserved the death sentence.

His mother, Tracey O'Brien, 38, said before the decision yesterday her son, Michael Bargo, Jr, had grown up with an alcoholic father with an explosive temper.

His
lawyers attempted to avoid the death penalty by arguing that Bargo, Jr 
suffered abuse at the hands of his mother and was traumatized by his 
parents' divorce.

Tracey O'Brien, 38, wept throughout 
her testimony as the prosecutor questioned her about Michael Bargo, Jr's
childhood and her marriage to his father, Michael Bargo, Sr.

Devastated: A court heard testimony from convicted murderer Michael Bargo's mother Tracey O'Brien yesterday as the jury decided what sentence to recommend

The devastated mother was summoned to the Florida court from her home in Michigan to testify at her son's sentencing hearing.

O'Brien
reportedly did not testify at her son's murder trial because, according
to testimony from Bargo, Sr, her son didn't want her there.

She
told the court that the hearing was the first time she'd seen her son 
in four years and detailed her unhappy marriage with Bargo, Sr, who she 
described as an abusive alcoholic who regularly lashed out in anger.

'He would throw 
dinner if it wasn't warm, or I said something wrong or we got into an 
argument, he would start throwing things,' she said.

Disturbing: Seath Tyler Jackson was brutally murdered and his body burned in a pit. His remains were then shovelled into paint cans and thrown in a dumpster

As his son grew older, Bargo, Sr 
would encourage the boy to demean and disrespect his mother. She 
recalled arriving home to find that her son had scrawled 'Tracey is a 
whore' on the front driveway of their house.

When
Bargo, Jr was 14 his father moved to Florida. During that time, the 
teen was diagnosed with ADD but his father would encourage him not to 
take his prescription Ritalin.Â 

Bargo,
Jr would explode in fits of uncontrollable rage that O'Brien couldn't 
control, having to call the police a number of times, she told the 
court.

Bargo, Sr 
began to call Social Services in an effort to discredit O'Brien as a 
parent and gain custody of his son.

She testified that 
Bargo, Sr put through so many false calls about her, he was 
eventually told that if he called again he would be charged for filing
a false report.

The father owed more than $20,000 in child support for Bargo, Jr, which O'Brien never received.

Eventually, when Bargo, Jr was 16, he went to live with his father in Florida.

Ex-girlfriend: Amber Wright (left) and her step-brother Kyle Hooper (right) were both sentenced to life in prison without parole

Six people were arrested in 
connection to the brutal murder of Seath Jackson and four have already been 
convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

Bargo is the only one who faces the death penalty.

Jackson was lured to a home in 2011 by his ex-girlfriend Amber Wright under the pretense of rekindling their relationship.

Once Jackson arrived at the house, her new boyfriend Bargo, along with Wright, Justin Soto, Charlie K Ely and Kyle Hooper beat him, shot him multiple times, tied 
him up, broke his knees and burned his body alive, disposing of his remains in paint cans
which they threw into a quarry.

Tracey O'Brien told the court that until she found out about the horrific crime, she had been under the impression that her son was thriving in Florida.

His father would lie to O'Brien, telling her everything was fine and that Bargo, Jr was doing well at school when in fact the teen had dropped out.

Bargo,
Sr neglected to tell O'Brien that her son wasn't even living at 
home and that he was on drugs and drinking heavily.

'Every time I would ask about Michael, everything was great,' she said.

As
the prosecutor wound up his questioning, O'Brien looked out into the 
courtroom at Michael Bargo, Sr and, almost choking on her tears, said, 
'It's your fault.'

According to WFTV reporter Jeff Deal, Michael Bargo, Sr nodded his head at this comment.
