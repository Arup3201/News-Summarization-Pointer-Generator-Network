The average British male resembles pop star Olly Murs, while Dancing on Ice presenter Christine Bleakley is the celebrity most women look like, it emerged yesterday.

Essex-born Murs, 28, was revealed as the typical man's lookalike by an iPhone app which measures facial contours before telling users which star they most resemble.

Bleakley, 34, was the face which appeared most frequently when female users took photographs of themselves.

Former Eastenders actresses Natalie Cassidy, 29, and Cheryl Ferguson, 48, finished second and third in the female list.

Morning presenter Holly Willoughby came fourth in the list and former 
Daybreak host and Lorraine stand-in Kate Garraway finished off the top 
five.

Runner-up in the men's list was X 
Factor host Dermot O'Leary, 39, while Liverpool FC captain Steven 
Gerrard, 33, was the third most matched man.

Roly-poly
funny man Johnny Vegas was the fourth most common face in Britain, and 
loveable comedian James Corden rounds off the top five.

Not so hot celebrity resemblances were Manchester City mid-fielder James Milner and Radio 1 presenter Nick 'Grimmy' Grimshaw.

Yesterday a spokesman for the Celebalike app, said: 'Many people want to look and dress like their favourite celebrities and they are a huge part of modern culture.

'We often look to emulate celebrities and they can often have a big influence on the way we act and look and some of us might have someone famous we might think we resemble a little or a lot.

'Now there's a chance to find out for real. Some people might be pleased to see who they are matched with, but of course that might not be the case for everyone.

'We've made millions of matches since the app launched and while we can't guarantee every one of those has been flattering, the feedback has been fantastic.'

The app uses a high performance face identification and facial feature recognition computer program.

Millions of women have had a major 
confidence boost by being told their Celebalikes are Welsh opera beauty 
Katherine Jenkins, Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and Harry Potter 
starlet Emma Watson.

Other celebrities who crept in to the top 20 list of most common Celebalike results were; shamed Chelsea football star John Terry, family favourite Vernon Kay and popular TV chef Jamie Oliver for men.

It seems Britain might be a nation of football look-a-likes too, along with Milner and Terry; Alan Shearer, Michael Carrick and Aaron Lennon also appeared in the results.

Britain's Got Talent runner-up Susan Boyle were in the women's list of
