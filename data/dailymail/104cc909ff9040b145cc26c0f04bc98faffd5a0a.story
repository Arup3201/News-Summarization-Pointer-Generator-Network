When we look for the ideal holiday destination, one of the most important factors must surely be what sort of welcome we are likely to receive from the locals.

So travellers will be delighted by a new list which ranks the friendliest cities in the world - as well as naming and shaming the least friendly.

It turns out that the most welcoming places are in famously chilled-out countries such as Brazil, Australia and the mountain kingdom of Bhutan.

By contrast, the U.S. dominated the list of the least friendly cities, along with Africa and the Middle East, with Newark, New Jersey crowned the most hostile destination.

Bleak: Newark, New Jersey, is known mostly for its airport and has been named the world's least friendly city

Danger: The terror-wracked city of Islamabad is also not thought to be a very friendly place to visit

The lists emerged from the annual Readers' Choice survey compiled by Condé Nast Traveler, reflecting the opinions of thousands of jetset readers.

In
addition to the global rankings of friendly and unfriendly cities, the 
magazine has put together a list of the friendliest American 
communities, with the South taking most of the top spots.

The 'winner' of the competition for 
the least friendly global city was Newark, which is known more for its 
airport than any other attractions.

One
reader polled said: 'I visited Newark on business and would not 
recommend this city for anything, except a cheaper/less busy airport to 
fly into while visiting other cities.'

Protests: Oakland, California is a hotbed of radicalism which frequently erupts into violence

Slums: Luanda, the capital of Angola, is another city said to be distinctly unfriendly

Other
American cities in the top 10 included Oakland, California, New Haven, 
Connecticut and Detroit, Michigan - as well as New Jersey's Atlantic 
City, which despite being a casino resort was denounced as 'a pale 
shadow of Las Vegas'.

Most
of the rest of the list was made up of cities which are not usually 
thought of as popular tourist destinations, such as Islamabad in 
Pakistan, Angola's capital Luanda, Kuwait City and Lome, Togo.

The friendliest city of all, 
according to the survey, is Florianopolis, in southern Brazil, a seaside
community located on an island and packed with historic colonial 
architecture.

The city 
is known as the 'Island of Magic', while visitors reported that locals 
were keen to offer expert advice on how best to make use of their time 
there.

Friendly: Florianopolis in Brazil has been named the most welcoming city in the world

Runner-up: Hobart, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is the second friendliest city in the world

Next is Hobart, capital of the 
Australian state of Tasmania, which is one of three cities Down Under to
make the top 10 of the list, along with Queenstown in New Zealand and 
Margaret River, Western Australia.

Another country to have multiple entries in the list is Bhutan, a tiny country in the Himalayas between China and India.

The
nation's king has a policy of boosting 'gross national happiness' 
rather than economic output - and it appears to have paid off, with the 
cities of Thimpu and Paro both named among the 10 friendliest in the 
world.

Perhaps more 
surprisingly, Mandalay in Burma also made the list - even though the 
country is currently emerging from decades of brutal military 
dictatorship.

The
only British city to appear in the top 20 was Edinburgh, at no. 18, 
although Ireland did rather better as Kilkenny, Dublin and Cork were all
named among the world's friendliest.

Idyllic: Bhutan, in the Himalayas, has two entries in the top 10 list thanks to its laid-back culture

Charm: Charleston, South Carolina, is the friendliest city in the U.S. and the fifth friendliest in the whole world

In case Americans are worried that 
every city in the U.S. has a poor reputation, Condé Nast Traveler has 
also published its list of the country's friendliest cities.

The famed Southern hospitality propels the Deep South to the top of the ranking, with Charleston, South Carolina in at no. 1.

It
is followed by Galena, Illinois - a rare Midwestern interloper - 
Savannah, Georgia, Asheville, North Carolina and Austin, Texas.

Western
states also get recognition for their chilled-out demeanour, with 
Telluride, Colorado and Sonoma, California sneaking in to the top 10.

But
not everywhere in California is considered welcoming - Los Angeles, 
Anaheim and Sacramento have been named among the 10 least friendly 
cities in the U.S.
