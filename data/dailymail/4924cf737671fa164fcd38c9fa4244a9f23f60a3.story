A career criminal who was the youngest person in Britain to be handed an ASBO when he was 14 will not have to repay £26,000 in drug money following a new arrest after claiming it was stolen. 

Declan Madigan, now 27, was labelled a 'one-boy crime wave' in 2000 after being arrested 100 times for violent crime, burglary and car theft when he was just a teenager. 

He was jailed this year for 11 years after being convicted of a drive-by shooting and drug offences in Nottingham despite having been paralysed from the waist-down in an earlier car crash.

But of the £47,000 he made illegally, Madigan will only have to repay £22,762 as the remainder, kept beneath his kitchen sink, was allegedly stolen. 

Nottingham Crown Court heard how the 27-year-old did not know what had happened to the haul of cash and changed his story when questioned, first telling prosecutors the money had been taken by masked robbers and later claiming a carer had stolen it.

In November last year Madigan was jailed after coercing two men into firing shots at the house of a man losing some of his drugs money, the court heard. 

He admitted to possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, two charges of using another person to hide a firearm and three drug offences. 

The career criminal was jailed last year for a drive-by shooting and three drug offences following more than a decade of offences. He is pictured, right, leaving youth court as a teenager 

The 27-year-old's lawyer told Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) his 'relationship with police is not always at the forefront of his mind' 

All the money available in his bank account - some £22,000 - has been seized but the remainder of the proceeds from his criminal activity will not have to be repaid. 

Madigan was paralysed from the chest down following a car accident and is now in a wheelchair. 

Michael Evans QC, defending, told the court: 'My Lord will understand his relationship with police is not always at the forefront of his mind.'
