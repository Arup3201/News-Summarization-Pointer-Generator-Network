A Ugandan newspaper has published a list of the country's 'top 200' homosexuals a day after the president enacted harsh anti-gay legislation.

The Red Pepper, a Ugandan tabloid, ran the names of 200 people it claims are homosexuals, including several who have not previously come out as gay, under the headline 'EXPOSED!'

The list includes prominent Ugandan gay 
activists such as Pepe Julian Onziema, as well as a 
popular Ugandan hip-hop star and a Catholic priest.

The Red Pepper, a tabloid in Uganda, has printed the names of 200 people it accuses of being homosexuals on its front page

The list, which appears under the headline EXPOSED!, features names of people not previously identified as gay

The news comes on the day after Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni signed a bill into law which punishes 'aggravated homosexuality' with life in prison.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the bill marked 'a tragic day for Uganda and for all who care about the cause of human rights' and warned that Washington could cut aid to the East African nation.

He said: 'Now that this law has been enacted, we are beginning an internal review of our relationship with the Government of Uganda to ensure that all dimensions of our engagement, including assistance programs, uphold our anti-discrimination policies and principles and reflect our values.'

Few Ugandans identify themselves publicly as gay, and the tabloid's publication of alleged homosexuals recalls a similar list published in 2010.

A prominent Ugandan gay activist, David Kato, was killed after the Rolling Stone newspaper - which has no affiliation with the American magazine - called for him to be hanged.

In 2011 the then-editor said he had 'no regrets' over the article, as it was exposing wrongdoing.

A Ugandan judge later condemned the 
outing of homosexuals in a country where gays face severe 
discrimination, saying it amounted to an invasion of privacy.

Today Jacqueline Kasha, a well-known Ugandan lesbian activist who is among those listed in the Red Pepper story, tweeted: 'The media witch hunt is back.'

The bill originally proposed the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality,' defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults and acts involving a minor, a disabled person or where one partner is infected with HIV.

The law also calls for first-time offenders to be sentenced to 14 years in jail.

In signing the bill, Museveni said the measure is needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa, rejecting international criticism as interference in Uganda's internal affairs.

Museveni accused 'arrogant and careless Western groups' of trying to recruit Ugandan children into homosexuality.

In 2010 a now-defunct Ugandan paper Rolling Stone - which has no affiliation with the Us magazine - published a similar expose

Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said on Tuesday that no homosexuals have been arrested since Museveni signed the bill but that at least two had been taken into custody since lawmakers passed the bill last December.

Onziema, the gay activist, said he had counted up to six arrests and said that more than a dozen Ugandan homosexuals had fled the country since December over safety concerns.

Homosexuality has long been criminalised in Uganda under a colonial-era law that outlawed sex acts 'against the order of nature.'

Some Ugandan lawyers and activists have said they will challenge the law in court as unconstitutional and impossible to implement.

The Ugandan law — which came just over a month after Nigeria passed a similar measure against gays — has been condemned around the world, although it is widely popular among Ugandans.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the law would institutionalise discrimination and could encourage harassment and violence against gays.
