A powerful committee of MPs today demand a ban on fracking in Britain’s National Parks, ancient woodlands and other protected countryside.

The Environmental Audit Committee says there should be a moratorium on drilling for shale in the rest of the UK amid concerns including noise and pollution of water supplies.

Its report is published as ministers face a rebellion from senior Tories who have warned they could vote against fracking in the House of Commons today.

The Infrastructure Bill contains measures designed to encourage the controversial energy extraction process, which has slashed energy bills in the US.

Former Tory environment secretary Caroline Spelman has called for a ‘moratorium’ on drilling, and Anne McIntosh, chairman of the Commons Environment Committee, whose North Yorkshire constituency contains a proposed fracking site, said the technology was ‘not appropriate’.

David Cameron and George Osborne are keen proponents of fracking. The Prime Minister has said the Government was ‘going all out’ to exploit the technology.

Ministers also say it will create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country’s reliance on gas imports.

But critics claim the process carries potentially serious environmental risks, and question whether the benefits for the UK would be as great as those enjoyed by the US.

Ministers’ enthusiasm for fracking last year was at a time of high energy prices and pressure for action to ease pressure on household power bills. This has since eased with the falling oil price and action by energy firms to cut prices.

In its report, the Environmental Audit Committee warns of a an ‘extensive range of uncertainties’ about the possible hazards resulting from fracking, ranging from polluting groundwater and water supplies to noise and disruption.

Committee chairman, Labour MP Joan Walley said: ‘We cannot allow Britain’s national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty to be developed into oil and gas fields.’

Proposed changes to trespass laws to allow fracking without residents’ permission are, she said, ‘profoundly undemocratic’.

The report says extensive development of shale would not be compatible with the UK’s goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

It said fracking should be ‘prohibited outright’ in protected areas such as national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and ancient woodlands, and banned in all water source protection zones – where drinking water is taken from.

Fracking will not be commercially viable unless it is developed on a large scale, but widespread extraction would lead to greater carbon emissions which would breach Government targets.

Some MPs on the committee have tabled an amendment to the Infrastructure Bill calling for a moratorium on fracking for shale gas to reduce the risk the UK misses its targets to cut carbon emissions.

The Infrastructure Bill includes measures to make it easier for energy companies to drill under people’s homes without their permission and allows them to leave “any substance” deep underground.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We disagree with the conclusion of this report. We have one of the most robust regulatory regimes for shale gas.

‘UK shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and does not detract from our support for renewables; in fact it could support development of intermittent renewables.’
