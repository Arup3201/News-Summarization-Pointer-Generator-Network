No longer on the rise: Baguettes are falling out of favour compared to hamburgers in France

The hamburger is threatening to overtake the baguette as France’s staple sandwich.

Three-quarters of traditional French restaurants now sell hamburgers and nearly half of all sandwiches sold in France last year were burgers, up from one in nine in 2000 and one in seven in 2007 according to research by marketing firm Gira Conseil.

The market is dominated by fast food chains such as McDonald’s, for which France represents the second largest market in the world after the US.

The report also revealed that the French are the second-biggest  consumers of pizza in the world, after the Americans.

Last year it emerged that the market share taken by the traditional sit-down restaurant, historically a sacrosanct part of the French way of life, had been beaten by la restauration rapide (fast food) for the first time – partly because meal breaks have fallen from almost 90 minutes in 1975 to less than half an hour today.

Last year a quarter of the 970 million burgers eaten in France were sold in traditional restaurants.

Bernard Boutboul, Gira’s director, said the study found that '75 per cent of traditional French restaurants offer at least one hamburger on their menu' and that in a third of these cases burgers were out-selling entrecotes, other grilled meat or fish dishes.

The sales of burgers in traditional restaurants have rocketed by 40 percent in the last two years, Mr Boutboul said.

'La restauration rapide' (fast food) swiped 54 per cent of the market in 2012 for a turnover of 34 billion euros (£29 billion) - a huge jump from 2011, when fast food only claimed 40 per cent of overall market share.

The rise was attributed to shorter meal breaks in France  and the growing range of new products on the market, not just sandwiches but thematicoutlets offering salads, bagels or kebabs.
