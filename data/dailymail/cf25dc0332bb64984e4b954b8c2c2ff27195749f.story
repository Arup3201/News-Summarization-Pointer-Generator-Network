A Russian family has survived a fire on board a hot air balloon by jumping from the basket as it plunged towards the ground following a dramatic explosion.

Mihail Popov, 43, his wife Lena, 41, and daughter Dasha, 10, were left with severe burns and broken bones after leaping from the balloon when its engine malfunctioned 500 feet above Nizhny Novgorod.

The pilot of the craft, Gregoriy Karolev, 49, had been wresting with the balloon's gas valve for several minutes before a explosion of burning gas hit him and his guests like a flamethrower.

Flames: Eyewitnesses on the ground saw fire suddenly spread across the basket. After the explosion, Mr Karolev managed to get the balloon back under control and was able to make it descend rapidly

After the explosion, Mr Karolev managed to get the balloon back under control and was able to make it descend rapidly.

When it was just 20 feet from the ground - but in danger of rising again - the pilot told his guests to jump from the basket. He followed them seconds later.

Later in hospital Mr Karolev said: 'There was a malfunction with the gas distribution. I tinkered with it and suddenly there was a jet of fire that came from nowhere.'

'The next thing I remember was a savage pain in my arms from the burns and the screams of the unfortunate people aboard,' he added.Â

Eyewitnesses on the ground saw the flame suddenly spill out across the basket.

Ivan Demnyansky, one of the ground workers at the Fifth Ocean club where the balloon was based, said: 'I could see that there was trouble aboard.'

Describing the scene after the family and pilot jumped from the balloon, Mr Demnyansky added: 'They looked to be quite badly burned in places but I think all of them are expected to pull through.'

Police are investigating accident, which took place over the weekend.

Officers are focusing on the fact the pilot took to the air with a flight certification document that was a month out of date.

'The prosecutor's office will assess the actions of all participants of the accident and will respond with measures designed to bring the perpetrators to the statutory responsibility and prevent similar events in the future,' a spokesman for the local prosecutor said.

The incident comes just days after two University of Richmond basketball coaches were killed in a fiery hot air balloon crash in Caroline County, Virginia.
