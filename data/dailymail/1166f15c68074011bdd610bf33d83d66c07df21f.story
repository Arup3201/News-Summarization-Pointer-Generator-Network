They celebrated their second anniversary on Monday by indulging in a large wedding cake featuring lyrics from their wedding song.

So for LeAnn Rimes, 30, and husband Eddie Cibrian, 39, it was back to their regular exercise and healthy eating routine on Thursday.

The couple were seen leaving a Whole Foods after a spin class in Toronto, Canada, where Eddie is currently shooting a film.

Back to reality: LeAnn Rimes and husband Eddie Cibrian went for a grocery shop following a spin class on Thursday in Toronto, Canada after indulging in cake on their second wedding anniversary on Monday

LeAnn showed off her slender figure in tight black workout pants paired with a grey sweater emblazoned with the word 'Boys' on the front.

She wore black trainers with neon pink lining and shielded her eyes with brown aviator sunglasses.

The singer scraped back her highlighted blonde hair into a bun and appeared to have gone without makeup.

Making a dash: LeAnn held onto Eddie as they walked speedily along the street, no doubt looking forward to putting her feet up after their workout

Eddie, meanwhile, showed off his buff physique in a fitted black Nike sweater and grey shorts teamed with neon green trainers.

The pair each carried a paper bag from Whole Foods after stopping by the health food mecca for some snacks.

Prior to their shop, they had worked up a sweat in a spinning class at a local health club, no doubt to work off the cake and dinner they had enjoyed on Monday night to celebrate their anniversary.

LeAnn tweeted a snap of the cake featuring lyrics from their wedding song, Patty Griffin's When It Don't Come Easy: 'If you break down, I'll drive out and find you.'

As an anniversary gift, LeAnn is said to have given Eddie matching his-and-her necklaces encrusted with old keys to their new Hidden Hills, California house, reports RadarOnline.

A source close to the couple said: 'LeAnn surprised Eddie with the one-of-a-kind rose gold necklaces from designer Roger Canevar of Mantis 7 jewels.'

'She helped designed the pieces,' said the source.

'They are being dipped in rose gold with chocolate pave diamonds and being engraved with "home" and the date they moved into the home — 3/18/13.'

LeAnn told Eddie that she wanted to remember the special date because it was the moment they both felt like they we were complete,' added the source.

The pair dropped a cool $3 million on a Spanish-style mansion in the posh Los Angeles neighborhood earlier this year.

Still smitten: LeAnn tweeted a snap from their vow renewal last year in Mexico, on Monday

On Monday,  LeAnn also tweeted pictures of her anniversary blessing in Mexico last year.

She captioned one of the pictures with a hopeful declaration: 'Love my hubby for the sweetest card and bring [sic] framed pics of last year's anniversary to TO.... Just beginning.'

Eddie, who has only had bit parts since his series The Playboy Club was cancelled by ABC, obviously framed the pictures as romantic gifts.

He's still best known for his performance as hunky Cole Deschanel in '90s favourite, Sunset Beach and his looks have stayed the test of time, much to LeAnn's delight.

LeAnn and Eddie married in her Malibu home in 2011. They met on a television film called Northern Lights in Calgary a year earlier when they both were still married.

The controversy has dogged them ever since, but LeAnn - who checked into rehab last autumn for anxiety issues - is keen to show the world it was really worth it.
