A 22-year-old woman has been accused of arranging an armed shakedown of her ex-boyfriend   because he cheated on her.

Sarah Matherly was identified locally as the alleged organizer of a stick-up scheme targeting her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Szwadjer.

Szwadjer has claimed he was attacked and robbed in a Hollywood, Florida motel room - and that Matherly also tried to force him to give her more money in a second incident.

Citing an arrest report, WPLG reported that Szwajder was instructed by Matherly to visit her at a motel. However, two men were there lurking in wait.

According to the television station, Szwajder told authorities he was placed in a choke hold by a man who said: 'You know what this is. Give me everything.'

At the same time, Matherly reportedly entered a bathroom.

Referring to the arrest report, WPLG said Szwajder claimed he was held at gunpoint by the second man and handed over $46, a debit card, a wallet, an identification card and a gold chain.

Szwajder claimed Matherly said in a phone call 'That's what you get for cheating on me' following the holdup, the television station reported. 

Szwadjer reportedly told authorities that his ex-girlfriend warned if he failed to hand over more money she would 'send these guys over to your mom's house'.

Szwajder identified a man from the first incident when he went to the designated spot, kept going in his car and contacted authorities, according to WPLG. 

NBC 6 South Florida reported that Matherly faces charges of extortion and robbery with a firearm. 

Broward Judge John Hurley ordered that she be held on $7,500 bond, the television station reported. Hurley reportedly mandated Matherly submit to weekly drug tests upon getting released, and that she must either return to school or find an occupation.

According to NBC 6 South Florida, a lawyer for Matherly said the 22-year-old knew nothing of the holdup, having been in a different room. 

A Facebook profile for Matherly says she graduated from Western High School in 2010.
