Accusations: The 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund chief will be formally accused of attacking Nafissatou Diallo, 32, at the Times Square Sofitel in Manhattan

Civil proceedings against Dominique Strauss Kahn for a ‘sadistic and violent’ attack on a New York hotel chamber maid will heard in New York next month, it emerged today.

The 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund chief will be formally accused of attacking Nafissatou Diallo, 32, at the Times Square Sofitel in Manhattan.

The ‘oral motions’ hearing will come less than two weeks before Strauss-Kahn re-appears before examining magistrates in Lille, northern France, where he faces ‘pimping’ charges which could see him imprisoned.

Criminal allegations of an attempted rape by Strauss-Kahn in America collapsed last year because of a lack of evidence.

But the new hearing, to be heard in New York on March 15th, will allow Diallo a further chance to bring Strauss-Kahn to justice.

Claims: Nafissatou Diallo, 32, has complained of a 'sadistic and violent' attack, asking for unspecified damages which are likely to amount to millions of dollars

He has admitted that the pair were involved in a sex act in his suite at the Sofitel in May last year, but insists that they both consented to it.

Now Diallo has complained of a ‘sadistic and violent’ attack, asking for unspecified damages which are likely to amount to millions of dollars, said a legal source close to the case based in France.

William Taylor, one of Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, has indicated that Strauss-Kahn will submit a defence of ‘diplomatic immunity’ based on a United Nations convention covering ‘acts committed in a personal community.’

Arrival: The car of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former International Monetary Fund (IMF) head, enters the Gendarmerie surrounded by the media as he arrives for questioning by a judge investigating about the 'Hotel Carlton' scandal

Strauss-Kahn argues that his decision
to ‘allow’ Diallo – a stranger he had known for a few minutes - to 
perform the sex act on him was legal, although he had admitted to a 
‘moral fault’.

The 
case, which will be heard by judge Douglas McKeon in a court in the 
Bronx, where Diallo lives, could take a number of years, unless the two 
parties ‘come to an agreement’, said a source close to the procedure in 
Paris.

Today it was 
unclear whether Strauss-Kahn will attend the hearing in person, although
Diallo will almost certainly be there, said the legal source.

Strauss-Kahn
was released on bail from a police cell in Lille on yesterday after 
being interviewed about an illegal vice ring based in the city.

He
is facing charges of ‘complicity in pimping’ and ‘misuse of corporate 
assets’ in relation to a prostitute network centered on the upmarket 
Carlton Hotel in Lille.

A prostitute has claimed that former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get her a visa to work in the USA.

Judges have already charged a number of men with organising orgies, and a building company executive is accused of using its money to entertain guests at sex parties held in cities around the world, including Paris and Washington DC.

Strauss-Kahn admits attending many of
the parties - but claims he did not know the girls were prostitutes 
because they were 'all naked at the time'.

Now it has emerged that one of the women involved claims she flew to Washington DC when Strauss-Kahn was IMF chief.

'There
Strauss-Kahn is said to have tried to get her a visa for her to remain 
in the USA,' said a legal source close to the case.

'This
would have huge ramifications on Strauss-Kahn's defence as it would 
prove he was assisting a prostitute in her work - something which is 
illegal in France.

'The allegation that an IMF chief was trying to get visas for prostitutes would also create a huge scandal.'

The woman, who has not been named, is said to have documentary evidence, including pictures of her with Strauss-Kahn.

Phone records suggest Strauss-Kahn was in contact with at least 10 call girls.

All
of the women, who are mainly French and Belgians from immigrant 
backgrounds, claim to have had paid sex with him while he was IMF chief.

But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said his client was 'totally unaware' that the women were receiving cash.

'At these parties, people were not necessarily dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman,' said Mr Leclerc.

Strauss-Kahn's night in a 10ft by 12ft police cell in Lille was his seventh in custody in the past year - but all the rest were spent in the USA where he faced an allegation of attempted rape.

While in America Strauss-Kahn complained about having to wear handcuffs, and his humiliation in France also looked likely to lead to protests from his lawyers.

His stark cell contained a four inch high foam mattress, a hole-in-the-floor toilet, and an observance window which allowed a police officer to watch him constantly.

Strauss-Kahn admits taking part in orgies and said he had an 'uninhibited sex life', but that he 'never paid a centime' for it. 'I have a horror of prostitutes and pimping,' he said.

Judicial officials say he will be summoned again next month by three judges who will decide if there is enough evidence to file charges in a case focusing on the alleged prostitution ring in France and Belgium.

Strauss Kahn spent just over a week in prison in America following Diallo’s original complaint to police on May 14th last year.

When he returned to France Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, accused him of attempting to rape her.

Prosecutors found prima facie evidence of sexual assault, but said the alleged attack – which happened in 2003 - was too old to pursue.

Strauss-Kahn has consistently denied any wrong doing, although he admits that he had a ‘libertine’ sex life.

His wife, the wealthy heiress Anne Sinclair, has stuck by him throughout the legal saga, paying for many of his legal fees.
