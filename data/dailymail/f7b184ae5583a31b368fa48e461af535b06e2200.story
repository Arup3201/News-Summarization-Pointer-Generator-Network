If Texas Governor Rick Perry
jumps into the Republican presidential contest, there has been at least one supporter pushing him to do so - his wife.

After a meeting on state finances on Tuesday, the governor admitted for the first time his wife, Anita, has been encouraging him to run for the White House seat.

The governor said: 'My wife was talking to me and saying: "Listen... get out of your comfort zone. Yeah, being governor of Texas is a great job, but sometimes you'reÂ  called to step into the fray."'

Support: Texas Governor Rick Perry takes the oath of office as his wife, Anita and daughter, Sydney, look on during his inauguration on January 18, 2011

Anita Perry has seen her share of the political spotlight, having first stepped out with her husband publicly before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1985.

Perry, who is flirting with 
joining the 2012 race, has been travelling the country in recent years -
giving him a rapport with national Republicans.

And as chairman of the 
Republican Governors Association, he has ties to big party donors.

Harvey Kronberg, who writes a report
on Texas politics, said: 'He's
got a pretty robust Rolodex.' He noted that Texas is one of the top money states 
in the nation for Republicans.

Perry told the Des Moines Register recently that he feels 'called' to run for the presidency and said he would make a decision within a few weeks.

The three-term Texas governor reported $2.1million in contributions through a group called Texans for Rick Perry as of June 30, according to a Texas regulatory filing.

As governor, he has raised 
$103million since 2001, with nearly half of that coming from big donors 
giving $100,000 or more, according to Texans for Public Justice. During 
the last cycle alone, he raised about $39 million.

The funds cannot be used for a presidential run but is an indicator of his ability to garner support.

A Republican fundraiser who has attended some of those meetings: 'He has held an amazing number of small group get-togethers in the key fundraising centers around the country.'

Backers in June formed a California-based group called Americans for Rick Perry - which can raise unlimited funds.

Former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney leads the money race among 
Republicans, reporting a $18.4 million haul in the second quarter. But 
less-than-robust fundraising on the Republican side suggests there is 
room for another candidate.

There is significant Republican money sitting on the sidelines. The current crop of candidates have raised only a third of the more than $100 million raised at this time during the 2008 election cycle.

Al Cardenas, president of the American Conservative Union, and former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said: 'People are sitting on the fence. They don't want to risk a mistake,' that would get Obama re-elected.

Some polls show Perry has some momentum going into the race, despite taking his time to decide.

Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said: 'He's not even said he's running but he hits double digits.'

Perry averages support of 11 per cent against potential rivals, according to a compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics, behind Romney and U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, and slightly ahead of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.

A major donor to Perry is Texas homebuilder Bob Perry, of no relation, who has given $2.5million over about a decade. Governor Perry's biggest donor has been the Republican Governors Association political action committee.

Bob Perry is a major funder of the national group American Crossroads, conceived in part by strategist Karl Rove, the former top White House adviser who also was an aide to George W Bush when he was Texas governor.

Governor Perry has been president of the Republican Governors Association since November.

After changes federal law changes put limits on donations, Perry helped lure Republican cash to the group, said Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who has represented Tea Party favorite Representative Jim DeMint and many others.

'Many, many conservative donors who used to be big donors to the RNC (Republican National Committee) have gravitated to the RGA and Perry's been a big part of that,' Mitchell said.

Any Republican presidential nominee faces a financial juggernaut in President Barack Obama and national Democrats, who raised $86million for his campaign in the second quarter.

Jan Baran, former general counsel for the RNC, said: 'The president has a stronger fundraising base than any other candidate in this election or in history. Perry will have to demonstrate he has broad appeal to raise money.'

Baran does not think Perry has done that yet.

In addition, Texas allows unlimited donations, while running for president limits individuals to giving $2500 each for the general and the primary elections.

In a state fundraising report filed on Friday, many donations blew past that limit. One donor gave $150,000 alone. Several gave $25,000.

And Perry has not faced the harsh spotlight of an actual contender. A bad debate performance or a revelation about his record could depress support quickly. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich suffered a collapse in backing after a series of missteps, for example.
