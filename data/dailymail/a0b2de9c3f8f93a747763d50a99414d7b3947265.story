Liverpool are expected to be cleared of any financial fair play breaches on Friday but Hull City will be handed a small fine by UEFA.

The Reds have been one of several clubs absent from European competition last season who have been under investigation by the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB).

The CFCB will meet on Friday and is expected to announce that investigations into Liverpool have ended without any sanctions to be brought against the Merseyside club.

Hull City have agreed to settle for a small fine, thought to be around 200,000 euros

It is understood that Hull, who played in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League, have agreed to settle for a small fine for FFP breaches.

Last year Levski Sofia and three Turkish clubs each received a 200,000 euro (£145,529) fine and Hull's sanction is thought to be of a similar level.

The CFCB is also expected to announce that investigations into Monaco, Inter Milan, Sporting Lisbon and Roma are to continue.

Liverpool made a loss of £49.8million for the 2012-13 season, and £40.5m for the 10-month period before that but have been able to write off a big chunk of losses as allowable stadium expenditure - the 2011-12 accounts reported that £49.6m was associated with Liverpool's stadium costs, £35m coming from former co-owner Tom Hick's aborted plan to build a new stadium on StanleyPark which new owners Fenway Sports Group had to scrap.

Manchester City and PSG were the clubs hit hardest by UEFA for breaching FFP rules last season

Manchester City and Paris St Germain were the clubs hit hardest by UEFA last season for breaching FFP rules - they were each fined £49m and handed restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size.

UEFA is continuing to monitor the two clubs this season and auditors are due to visit City next week.
