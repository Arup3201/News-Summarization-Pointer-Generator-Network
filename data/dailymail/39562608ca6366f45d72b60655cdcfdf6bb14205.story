Dwayne 'Megaman' Vincent has avoided jail for punching a clubber in the face during a mass nightclub brawl

A founding member of rap group So Solid Crew punched a nightclubber in the face during a mass brawl, in which a teenager was stabbed and another slashed with a champagne bottle. 

Dwayne ‘Megaman’ Vincent hit the fellow clubber after two rival groups clashed outside a club in Birmingham last February .

The 32-year-old was at the popular city centre nightspot the Sugar Suite to support his fellow So Solid member Romeo, also 32, who was making a guest DJ appearance.

However, trouble flared after they turned up late.

A court heard bottles were thrown from the crowd at the stage and as two groups fought on the dance floor a 19-year-old man was stabbed in the back and another teen suffered slash wounds from a broken champagne bottle.

The controversial hip hop group were then led by their minders out of the club via a rear exit before the violence spilled outside and into the city’s Broad Street entertainment district.

Warwick Crown Court heard Vincent had then punched a man in the face who he believed was carrying a knife. 

The London-born rapper was arrested on March 2 last year, two weeks after the incident on February 17.

Vincent pleaded guilty to affray at an earlier hearing and on Monday walked free from court.

He was given a conditional discharge for two years and ordered to pay just £60 costs at Warwick Crown Court.

Sentencing Judge Alan Parker said he was taking into account the delay and set the costs at the level which would have been imposed if the matter had remained in the magistrates court.

The So Solid Crew founding member floored the reveller after two rival groups clashed outside the Sugar Suite club in Birmingham (pictured) last February. The 32-year-old had gone to the popular city centre nightspot to support rap pal Romeo, 32, who was making a guest appearance on the decks

Vincent, from Hammersmith, London, entered his guilty plea to one charge of affray on the basis he became separated from the others and heard there was a man with a knife.

Defending Alice Jarrett claimed after seeing someone with his hand at his side, Vincent believed that was the person with the blade and punched him.

Ms Jarrett said her client had been waiting a long time for the case to be dealt with, which had caused him a considerable amount of stress.

So Solid Crew soared to national fame in 2001, reaching number one with their first single ‘21 Seconds’. 

But the Brit Award-winning band have been dogged by controversy and their debut tour in 2001 had to be called off after a series of incidents.

A youth who had been to one of their concerts was killed by fans using baseball bats and knives and two people were shot during another show at the London Astoria.

At least two members of the band have been stabbed and another was shot and wounded.

Vincent was quizzed over the stabbing of rapper Dizzee Rascal in Cyprus in 2003 but was quickly eliminated from inquiries. 

He was also cleared of murder in 2006 after a jury acquitted him of encouraging his friend Carl Morgan to shoot Colin Scarlett.

The 24-year-old was gunned down in a south London street after he 'dissed' Morgan - another So Solid Crew member by beating him up.

An original jury convicted Morgan but could not agree a verdict on Vincent - and a later retrial was then aborted.

But a third jury returned a not guilty verdict after two days of deliberation.
