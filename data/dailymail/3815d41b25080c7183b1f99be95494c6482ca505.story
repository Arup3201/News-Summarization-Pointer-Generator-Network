When fitness guru Kayla Itsines announced a free Australian boot camp, thousands travelled to the major cities to take part.

However none travelled as far as Vanessa Tan, who flew over 6000 kilometres from Singapore to Sydney to participate in the 45 minute work out.

The 27-year-old Canadian woman from Singapore heard her idol would not be bringing the free work outs to Asia and consequently booked the next flight to Australia and arrived the night before the session.
