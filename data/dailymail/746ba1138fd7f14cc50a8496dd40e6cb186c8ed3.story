A German luxury goods company has produced a stylish brush that costs around 1,000 times as much as a standard toothbrush – at £2,643.

Made of super-strong titanium, the brush is designed to last a lifetime and features replaceable heads and an antibacterial coating.

A German luxury goods company has 
produced a stylish brush that costs around 1,000 times as much as a 
standard toothbrush – at £2,643. It has a titanium body (pictured left) as well as a special antibacterial coating on the head to boost oral hygiene

Price: £2,643

Material: Titanium body with removable bristle heads.

Hygiene: The brush features an antibacterial coating between the head and replaceable bristles.

Durability: It is built to last a lifetime with servicing.

Colours: Four choices.

Manufacturing: Uses German 'precision engineering.'

Extras: The brush comes with a matching titanium stand and users are sent five replacement bristle heads every six months. It can be engraved and serviced for years at additional cost.

The company claims to have created the ‘first everlasting hygienic toothbrush - a fine accessory and an exclusive gift’.

The body uses ‘German precision engineering’ to give it its streamlined shape and is lightweight as well as being durable.

It also has an antibacterial coating applied in the interface between the head and replaceable brushes to reduce the amount of germs hiding among the bristles.

The antibacterial alloy claims to bring 
hygienic and medical advantages as the protective layer ‘guards against 
bacterial attack on the most important part which is present between the
 socket and the bristle head,’ Reinast said.

‘This coating is one of the latest innovations in medical technology. It is durable, safe and at the same time shields against resistant germs,’ the company added.

As if the initial price tag was not 
enough, the German company offers a serving package to keep the brush in
 peak condition, which costs up to £991 for 11 
years.

However, the 
luxurious toothbrush does come with a three year servicing package which
 includes the company sending the user five replacement bristle heads of
 their choice every six months.

The
 toothbrush, which was inspired by a simple tree branch and claims to be
 the perfect balance between ‘medical function and aesthetic beauty’ can
 also be engraved for £330.
