The entire photo spread of Lindsay Lohan posing nude for Playboy has leaked online today - prompting the magazine's founder Hugh Hefner into releasing the magazine early.

Earlier in the week the cover, featuring the 25-year-old actress posing nude on a bunny shaped chair hit the net.

But now a further 10 snaps started doing the rounds.

Revealed: Lindsay Lohan's highly classified Playboy magazine photo spread has leaked on the web, just days after a snap of the cover got out. Founder Hugh Hefner says the magazine will now be released early

Playboy has confirmed to MailOnline 
that 'someone took photos of Lindsay’s pictorial in an advanced copy of 
the January/February issue'.

It was not due to hit newstands for 
another week (December 15) and it was earlier reported how bosses feared the sales of what they 
hoped would be the biggest selling issue of the year could be severely 
hit, according to TMZ.com.

Now Hefner has come up with a solution, tweeting: 'Because of the interest & the Internet leak, we're releasing the Lindsay Lohan issue early.' He has not confirmed the new date of release yet.

Crest of a wave: Lohan was pictured in Hawaii watching the Pipe Masters Surf Contest from the balcony of a private residence today

Payday: The actress was paid a reputed $1m to take part in the nude Playboy shoot, seen here with a friend

What a drag: The Mean Girls star was spotted puffing on a cigarette

Lohan - who was today pictured in Hawaii watching the Pipe Masters Surf Contest from the balcony of a private residence - was paid a reputed $1m to bare all in the Marilyn Monroe-inspired shoot.

The newly-leaked photos capture her in a series of provocative poses as the Mean Girls star channels the tragic screen siren.

Lindsay appears entirely naked, save for a pair of terracotta platform heels, in most of the inside shots.

The most clothing she wears is a black
fur shrug in one frame as she kneels with a red cushion covering her 
lower half while raising her hands above her head.

The shoot is set against a sexy red 
backdrop; in some of the photos she lies on ruffled material - while in 
another she perches on what appears to be a lip-shaped couch.

Looking lasciviously into - and away 
from - the lens in the spread, Lohan is wearing lashings of red lipstick 
and has Marilyn's trademark beauty spot above her lip.

She wears and assortment of long and 
short blonde wigs, and completes her look with long fake lashes and 
heavy black make-up on her eyelids.

Props such as cushions are used to 
cover her lower half in many of the photographs, although in one she 
stands entirely naked - only slightly crossing her leg over.

Another frame shows her lying back seductively while holding her breasts with her hands.

One blog has published pages of the magazine and the accompanying interview.

Lohan tells the mag: 'Sex and 
sexuality are part of nature and I go along with nature. I think Marilyn
Monroe said that, and I agree with her.

Marilyn Monroe style: Lindsay's shoot was 
inspired by celebrity photographer Tom Kelley's nude
pictorial of Marilyn Monroe, shot in 1949 for a calendar before 
featuring in the first edition of Playboy in 1953. One of Lohan's poses 
is in very similar style to this one of Monroe

'Knowing your body and being in touch 
with your body is important because it gives you confidence, and in 
life, women need confidence.'

The actress had to pose for the magazine photographers twice, as the original attempt did not satisfy Playboy boss Hefner.

Speaking
about the snaps, Hefner revealed the inspiration behind them.

He
said: 'It's a classic tribute, inspired by the original Tom Kelley nude
pictorial of Marilyn Monroe. [It's] classy, very classy,' the New York 
Post reported.

'It turned out very well. I would say
that I had some reservations early on, but after a couple of false 
steps, everybody came on board and it's going to be very exciting,' 
Hefner added.

At the time Lindsay posed for the photos, Dina Lohan, Lindsay's mother said the shoot was 'tastefully done'.

Speaking
to The Insider's Christina McLarty she said: 'It was an opportunity for
her and she's done thousands and thousands of covers, so this was just 
something...she's 25 now.

'It was just something that was her 
decision...we have a contractual say in how far it goes and her and Mr 
Hefner will decide.'

Blonde ambition: Lindsay sported casual jean shorts, black vest top  and flip flops as she stepped out in the sunshine

Getting away from it all: The actress looked happy and relaxed as she chatted to a male friend

This
is not the first time that Lindsay has bared all for a magazine, in 
2008 she covered herself in just a sheer pink scarf posing on the front 
of New York magazine.

Lindsay
has been keeping a fairly low profile of late and last month she spent 
just four and a half hours in jail, after being released early from her 
30-day sentence, due to overcrowding. 

The
sentence also requires Lohan to undergo 18 psychotherapy sessions and 
appear monthly at court hearings between December 2011 and March 2012, 
she also has to complete more community service.

Taking action: In the wake of the second leak, Hefner says the mag will be released early

Offering their opinion: Playboy boss Hugh Hefner said the shoot was 'classy' and Dina said they were 'tastefully done' 

Oh la la: The Playboy cover isn't the first time that Lindsay has stripped off for a magazine and the actress bared all for New York magazine in 2008
