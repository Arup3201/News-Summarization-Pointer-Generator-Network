Bournemouth squandered their chance to claim top spot in the Sky Bet Championship as they surrendered a two-goal lead against Millwall.

First-half goals from Steve Cook and Brett Pitman had given the hosts firm control of the match. But Edward Upson pulled one back for the Lions before substitute Magaye Gueye struck two minutes from time to make it 2-2 and rescue a point for the visitors. 

David Cotterill and Paul Caddis were on target for Birmingham as they edged past Nottingham Forest 2-1. Rudy Gestede rescued a point for Blackburn as his stoppage-time strike cancelled out Patrick Bamford's effort, holding Middlesbrough to a 1-1 draw at the Riverside Stadium

Bolton's resurgence under new boss Neil Lennon continued as Craig Davies' strike was enough to down Huddersfield 1-0. Cardiff claimed a win at Watford by the same margin courtesy of an Adam Le Fondre goal.

Malky Mackay tasted his first defeat as Wigan boss as they were edged out 2-1 by Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. A Stevie May brace cancelled out Chris McCann's strike.

Steven Davies' late strike rescued a point for Blackpool in their 1-1 draw at Rotherham, who had led through Jordan Bowery, while a Jake Cooper brace cancelled out Gary Hooper's strike and gave Reading a much needed 2-1 win away at Norwich.
