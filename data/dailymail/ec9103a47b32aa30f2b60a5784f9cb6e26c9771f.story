Those with a fear of flying may want to look away now.

Lukla Airport boasts the dubious honour of being known as the world's most dangerous airport and one look at its unique airstrip will explain why.

With a fall of 9,200 ft awaiting passengers at the end of the runaway, flying to or from this Asian destination is not for the faint of heart.

Pressure: Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, Khumbu, eastern Nepal, doesn't have a control tower, radar or navigation devices - meaning pilots have to rely on what they can see from their cockpit to land and takeoff

Tenzing-Hillary Airport, also known as Lukla Airport, is a single landing strip in the town of Lukla, in Khumbu, eastern Nepal, and has been named by the History Channel and many seasoned travellers as being the most dangerous airport in the world.

These photographs, captured by photographer Wojciech Zwierzynski, 34, capture the petrifying landing.

'It was a very scary experience flying in the airship, mainly because two days before my flight, the plane from the same company had crashed and 14 people died,' said Wojciech.

'This airport in Lukla does not have any radar or navigation devices; so the pilot can only depend on what they can see from the plane's cockpit.

'Because the airport is on the mountain ridge, when you start descending you have to land. There is no option to stop descending and have a second try.'

With a sloped runway just 20 meters wide and 460 meters long, less than a tenth of the length of the standard 5,500 metres at international airports, this is one of the steepest approach pathways in the world.

Since the 1970's, Lukla airport has had an astonishing amount of accidents, with the number now reaching into the double figures.

The most severe accident to date being the 8th October 2008 flight, where the aircraft crashed on final approach and caught fire, killing eighteen passengers and crew.

Challenging: The 460 metre long runway - less than a tenth of the length of those at international airports - is also situated on a steep incline

And for those looking to scale Mount Everest, Lukla Airport is the nerve rattling start of many expeditions.

Wojciech says: 'There are two ways to reach the Everest Region - fly 45min from Lukla Airport or hike for approximately five days. Needless to say most of people chose the first option.

'Tourists are the "golden vain" for local community. They spend money in lodges, hotels and restaurants.

'Without the airstrip the number of tourists visiting the area will be significantly lower.'
