From a sawn-off shotgun to a catapult and crossbow, these are the previously unseen weapons of the infamous gangsters Ronnie and Reggie Kray.

The remarkable collection, which also includes memorabilia belonging to the pair including reading glasses, a comb and a pen-set, has been revealed in full for the first time.

It is owned by Andy Jones - who runs a museum in a converted jail in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire – and gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the East End mobsters.

Mr Jones, 53, was left all of the items by Reggie after he struck up a friendship with him when visiting him in prison.

Reggie Kray's penknife is also part of the collection which has been released ahead of a film about the twins

One interesting piece of memorabilia in the collection is a letter from Violet Kray to a friend (pictured) in which she describes her sons Ronnie and Reggie as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet'

As well as the weapons, the collection also features a letter sent from Ronnie and Reggie's mother Violet to a friend, in which describes her sons as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet.'

The items have been photographed comprehensively for the first time by renowned photographer Peter Dazeley, ahead of the release of a film about the Kray twins which will star actor Tom Hardy and is due to be released later this year.

Mr Dazeley, from London, said: 'The brothers were among the last prisoners to be held in the Tower of London in 1952, for failing to report for National Service.

'They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and the murders of George Cornell in the Blind Beggar Pub in Whitechapel and Jack 'the Hat' McVitie.

'They were arrested on May 9, 1968, and convicted of the murders at the Old Bailey in 1969, by the efforts of a squad of detectives led by detective superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read of the Yard.

'About 60 plain-clothed policemen kept a 24-hour watch on the jury throughout the trial, following them home from court and even into public houses.

'The brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders, the longest sentences ever passed at the Old Bailey.

'Their memorabilia is from the private collection of Andy Jones, of the Littledean Jail, and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at Her Majesty's pleasure.'

Experts said the collection of weaponry and personal items shows the two different sides of the Kray twins. Pictured: Ronnie's draughts set is one of the items which has been photographed by Londoner Peter Dazeley

A hair comb belonging to one of the brothers, who have both since died, is also part of the private collection

Mr Dazeley said the memorabilia showed the different sides to the Kray twins, who have now both died. 

He said: 'The low level of weaponry is extraordinary by today's standards. There's a pellet gun, crossbow and what looks like a child's catapult.

'Some of the items are somewhat more serious like Reggie's bayonet and knife, but then there is also his artist's paint set.

'These really are the personal effects of the twins. Amongst Ronnie's objects there is his cigarette case, comb and draught set as well as a sawn-off shotgun.

'And then again showing another side there's his pen and his infamous glasses.

'Also in a letter from their mother to a friend discussing her sons, she mentions that they 'are the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet and they have never hurt anyone only their own kind.'

The twins were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in Bethnal Green, east London.

During adulthood, the pair quickly certified themselves as the most 'notorious' brothers in the East End gangland.

Ronnie was eventually certified insane and lived the remainder of his life in Broadmoor Hospital, where he died on March 17, 1995, of a heart attack at the age of 61.

Reggie was freed on compassionate grounds with inoperable cancer on August 26, 2000, when he was almost 67, and died in his sleep on October 1, 2000.

Mr Jones, curator of Littledean museum in the Forest of Dean, said he was given the items by Reggie and his family.

He told MailOnline: 'I used to visit Reggie in prison before he died and I’ve had them for a number of years. They were gifted to me after a visit to see him at Maidstone Prison.

'I became friendly with him and he basically donated quite a number of items for display at what we call the "Crime Through Time" collection at Littledean.'

Mr Jones said the pair became friendly after Kray contacted him with a view to donating some of his items.

He said: 'He contacted me with a view to introducing himself and a number of other notorious gangland figures who have since donated a number of items for display at the museum.

'I visited him several times in prison in the 1990s. He was very, very quiet, a gentleman.

'He was able to provide me with a lot of other contacts who have been able to donate to the prison including Charles Bronson, Charlie Richardson, Freddie Foreman and many notorious villains.'

Mr Jones said the items will go on display for the first time when the museum reopens for the season on March 28.

He added: 'These items will all be on display along with many other personal artifacts from the Krays and their many acquaintances, both from the criminal underworld and friends from their celebrity circles.

'It’s the biggest private collection of Kray memorabilia on display to the public.'

He added that the museum is a 'very controversial and politically incorrect museum' and said it's 'not everyone’s cup of tea'.

The Krays were almost born into a life of crime. 

Their father, Charlie senior, was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was called up to join the Army, but deserted.

Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father.

It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle.

For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition. However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang.

When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot.

In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder.

Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept.

Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair.

Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. 

It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear.

In the middle of 1968, the twins’ older brother Charlie were arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders.

Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. Ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and Reggie died in 2000 aged 66.
