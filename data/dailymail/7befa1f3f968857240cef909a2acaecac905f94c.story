Gary Neville hailed England's 'brave and bold' performance against Italy on Saturday as the best by the national team for 15 years.

Mario Ballotelli's header condemned Roy Hodgson's men to a 2-1 defeat in the World Cup opener.

But England coach Neville said the players could take plenty of encouragement into the next two games against Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Brave: Coach Gary Neville and manager Roy Hodgson took plenty of encouragement from England display

Neville told BBC 5 Live: ‘I thought it was some of the best football an England team has played in a competitive game – and definitely in a World Cup – for ten or 15 years.

'At times when we have beaten big teams like Argentina we have been resilient and backs to the wall, get a goal and defend it.  But I thought the other night, relative to the game two years ago when we were on the ropes with our gloves up, defending and we lost on points, this time we won a few rounds.

'We can see where we are going, that doesn’t diminish the disappointment of losing, but it does give us encouragement.

‘We lived in a football match of real quality. I said on the bench during the game that this was a top football match, it didn’t feel like the first game of a World Cup, it was far more like a quarter-final.

‘It’s risk and reward.  I felt we risked in the game.  The manager has been very brave and bold in selections, and when you live with risk it can go the other way.  But it is not something to regret. 

'We could easily have drawn or won and they are a top team, and they have a number of players who are world class in their team, but we lived with them.  We didn’t just defend.  We did things in the game that shocked them.’
