The U.S. Men’s Soccer Team returned home heroes to a crowd gathered Friday morning at Los Angeles International Airport, even in defeat.

Members of the team took the time to pose for pictures and sign autographs for the fans greeting them after their flight from Brazil landed at 6.00 a.m.

Experts are divided over whether the Americans’ advancement from the ‘group of death’ constituted any major progress, but what is clear is that the American public is starting to embrace the sport.

‘It was a long flight, but I'm happy to be back,’ defender Omar Gonzalez told KNBC. ‘I think we gave it everything we had. We left everything on that field.’

The U.S. battled through injuries to key players, including striker Jozy Altidore to a grade-2 hamstring tear, he told the ‘Mike and Mike’ radio show Thursday morning.

Also part of the entourage were star goal keeper Tim Howard and team captain Clint Dempsey, both of whom shared a Wednesday conference call from President Barack Obama.

Howard, who plays for English Premier League club Everton, smiled and talked to fans as their parents snapped once in a lifetime photos with their hero.

‘I think we did very well,’ said Howard. ‘We're proud of what we did. The fans were fantastic and it's good to be back home.’

Howard single-handedly kept the U.S. in a one-sided match against a more skilled Belgium team with a World Cup-record 16 saves during their quarterfinal match.

Happy to be back: Midfielder Omar Gonzalez said it felt good to return to the U.S. and that the team 'left everything on the field'

His inspired play caused the #thingstimehowardcouldsave meme to take over the internet even after the Americans fell 2-1 to the Belgians.

It was the second-straight tournament in which the U.S. fell in the first game after escaping the group stage – but coach Jurgen Klinsmann, a former star of the German international squad, saw progress in the tournament.

‘I think they made their country proud with this performance,’ he said.

Ratings for the tournament set all-time records when 24.7million people tuned in top watch the match versus Portugal, which the US tied 2-2 after a last minute goal from the Portuguese side in stoppage time.

A further 16.5million watched the U.S.-Belgium match Tuesday afternoon on ESPN, and 5.1million more tuned in on Univision while almost 1.7million watched the game online, according to various sources.

Those numbers easily beat out the recent NBA Finals that aired on ABC.

Those numbers do not account for bars and the various watch parties that saw thousands of people jam public parks, stadiums and squares to watch the World Cup all over the country.

Enthusiasm in the country for this World Cup was unrivalled by any other. The players have only now returned to what may never be the same country they left -  one filled with soccer fans.
