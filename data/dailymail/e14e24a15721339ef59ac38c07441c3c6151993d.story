A Canadian teenager has been arrested for a series of 'swatting' incidents across the United States.

The 16-year-old boy has not been named but is reportedly to blame for upwards of 30 hoax calls in the U.S.

He has been connected to false calls in California, Maryland, Florida, New York and Connecticut.

He also faces 60 unspecified charges in Canada and was arrested on Thursday.

Target: The Canadian teen, who has not been publicly identified, is believed to be behind four different threats posed against Melbourne High School in Florida over the past month

Arrogant: A Twitter account connected to the suspect shows that he publicly taunted the police

String of incidents: The threat of a shooting on May 8 was the fourth such incident that the same teen is believed to be behind

Florida Today reports that the teen is the one responsible for a series of threats posed against a high school in Melbourne, Florida over the past month.

He reportedly called in a bomb threat on April 15 that led to a three-hour search and evacuation, the claim that he had a knife and stabbed someone a week later, a threat that he would start shooting a gun at Melbourne High students unless he received a large sum of money, and another threat of violence on Wednesday.

Police reports claim that the suspect is a boy and Florida Today links the suspect to a Twitter account where he repeatedly taunted the FBI following his May 8 threat against the school.

In one of the tweets, he laughed at the fact that two Melbourne High students had been arrested for soliciting the Canadian's help in swatting their school.

All over the map: The teen has been connected to 'swatting' incident in five states and two countries

Before the slew of incidents involving Melbourne High, his April 17 target was further north in Connecticut.

The Hartford Courant reported that tactical teams were dispatched to a house on Round Hill Road in response to a call where someone told police that they had a weapon and had taken several people hostage in the home.

The road, which extends through the lengthy, wealthy neighborhood was closed for hours and armed police carefully approached the house, thinking that they would have to deal with a dangerous stand off.

Moving up north: On April 17, the teen swatted a house in Connecticut, telling police in Greenwich that he was armed and holding hostages in this home but they later realized that there was no one inside

'No one responded from inside the house and no one answered the phone from which the initial call was made,' police captain Robert Berry told Greenwich Time.

'Officers eventually made entry into the house and no one was found inside.

'At this time, we do not believe that there was any actual hostage situation.'
