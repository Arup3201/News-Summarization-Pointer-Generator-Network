After releasing a slew of more exotic flavour combinations, the makers of Pot Noodle have dialled things down a notch with their latest flavour, the Sausage Casserole Pot Noodle.

Departing from the realms of Sticky Rib, Brazilian BBQ Steak, Bombay Bad Boy, Jamaican Jerk and Piri Piri Chicken, makers Unilever were inspired by classic British supper for their latest creation. 

The new flavour will be launched in April 2015 and is accompanied by a £3m advertising campaign.

Unilever marketing manager Monique Rossi said to The Grocer: 'Pot Noodle Sausage Casserole will appeal to both male and female consumers looking for a satisfyingly simple snack with excellent taste credentials.'

As well as their fancier offerings, the student staple is famous for more conventional flavours such as Chicken and Mushroom, Original Curry and Beef and Tomato.

Last year the brand worked with inventive celebrity chocolatier Paul A. Young, who devised the Marmite truffle, to launch Choc Noodle for 2014's National Chocolate Week.

The flavour – will took only four minutes to make – consisted of noodles in a creamy chocolate sauce and bite-sized chunks of butter fudge, milk choc chips and maple-covered pecans for added crunch.

A thoroughly British brand, Pot Noodle was established in 1979 in Wales.

In 1992 the company introduced their famous sauce sachets to each pot.

By 1995 around 300,000 Pot Noodles were being eaten every week.

Hot Chicken Curry and Barbecue flavours arrived in 1996, which also saw the introduction of And Christmas limited-edition Turkey and Stuffing flavour

In 2000 Unilever acquired Pot Noodle as one of its brands, and kicked things off with the mighty King-size Pot Noodle.

In 2002, the factory in Crumlin factory was producing 175 million pots per year.

Pot Noodle’s spiciest flavour Bombay Bad Boy was launched in 2002.

It is estimated that five Pot Noodles are being wolfed down every second.

Posh Noodle made an appearance in 2003 with three Thai flavours: Oriental Sweet and Sour, Spicy Chicken and Spicy Chilli.

The following year Seedy Sanchez Mexican Fajita pots were launched and Southern Fried Chicken was added in 2005.

The strapline ‘Fuel of Britain’ was born in 2006. The brand’s new adverts featured a Pot Noodle mine in Crumlin, where a stream of ‘Noodle Fuel’ had been discovered by miners. The miners in the ad were the genuine Pot Noodle workforce.

In 2008 Harrods in London sold a limited-edition luxury Pot Noodle. The swanky Poulet and Champignon flavour was £29.95 and proceeds went to Action against Hunger.

Pot Noeldle, a Christmas Dinner flavour, was launched in Christmas 2010. The lid could even be used as a bauble.

The Pot Noodle GTi range was launched in 2011 with three varieties: Chilli Beef, Spaghetti Bolognese and Chicken Tikka.

Chilli Beef was added to the regular Pot Noodle range in March 2012.

Piri-Piri Chicken flavour is currently the hottest Pot Noodle and was launched in 2013.
