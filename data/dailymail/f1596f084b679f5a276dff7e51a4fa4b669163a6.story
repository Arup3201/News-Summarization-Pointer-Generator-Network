Fernando Torres will turn down the chance to move Roma or AC Milan and stay at Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho insisting that the £50m striker still has a part to play in the squad despite not even making the bench for Saturday's 2-0 win over Leicester.

Both Italian clubs have made inquiries about Torres but the striker is not keen on a move to Italy and Mourinho claims that the Spaniard, who has two years left on his contract, cannot leave as he needs three strikers for the season.

Mourinho said: ‘I want three strikers in the team. Sometimes I want to play with two and have one on the bench. At other times, someone will be suspended, another will be injured.

'Someone will be needed as a third striker. I can’t do a season without a third striker. Our squad was made carefully the top structure of my club to give me what I want.

‘I believe he will remain. I want him. He will play. He will score goals. He will be very useful for us. He is a fantastic guy, fantastic professional, so no problem. 

'I told the players yesterday that at this moment we are playing one match a week and they feel: “Oh, I’m playing, I’m not playing. I’m first option, I’m second, I’m third.” 

Staying or going: Torres has been out of favour so far this season but could stay and fight for his place

Options: Costa and Didier Drogba are Jose Mourinho's preferred frontmen 

'But this is over next week. After that we have Capital One cup and Champions League and three matches a week. Everything is much easier for them then because all of them will be playing.

‘The reason he wasn’t on the bench today was that I decided to have a balanced bench with one defender, one full back, one defence midfielder, one attacking midfielder on winger and one striker. Sometimes I can have two strikers on the bench sometimes I can’t.’

Didier Drogba was chosen ahead of Torres on the bench, with Diego Costa starting and Drogba received a rapturous reception on 79 minutes when he came on for first competitive game at Stamford Bridge since leaving in 2012.

Costa has scored two goals in two games since signing for £32m from Atletico Madrid in the summer and Drogba returned to the club on a free transfer.
