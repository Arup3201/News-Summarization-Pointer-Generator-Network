Andy Murray was back at the O2 Arena on Wednesday afternoon to prepare for Thursday's crunch ATP World Tour Finals clash against Roger Federer.

Despite having a day off following his straight-sets win over Milos Raonic on Tuesday night, Murray returned for a hit on the venue's practice courts.

Murray had earlier posted pictures on Instagram from behind the scenes as he chilled out by taking advantage of the miniature basketball hoop in the physio room.

The British No 1 then warmed up for his afternoon practice with some stretching as coach Amelie Mauresmo kept a keen eye on the afternoon session's doubles match on television.

After a dismal start to his campaign here with a tame straight-sets defeat by Kei Nishikori, Murray was much improved on Tuesday as he saw off big-serving Raonic to keep alive his hopes of reaching the semi-finals.

Murray paid credit to Mauresmo for some pre-match words of recalling her own experience of tamely losing her first match in the 2006 WTA Tour Championships before going on to the final. 

World No 2 Roger Federer will top Group B at the ATP World Tour Finals if he beats Murray on Thursday 

Kei Nishikori will give himself a good chance of qualifying for the semi-finals should he beat Raonic 

Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic could still qualify if he beats Nishikori in the afternoon session 

                   Wins   Sets     Games

Federer       2-0      4-0      25-12

Nishikori     1-1      2-2      17-20

Murray        1-1      2-2      21-20 

Raonic         0-2      0-4      15-26

He said: 'Amelie was saying one of the times she made the final of the year-end championships, she lost her first match 6-2, 6-2 against [Nadia] Petrova.

'[She] obviously wasn't feeling great, then went on to reach the final. It's nice to have those sort of discussions, having someone that's experienced having been in a tough situation after the first match.'

Although there are a whole host of qualification scenarios at play in Group B, Murray will know exactly what he needs to do when he walks onto court at night to play Federer after the afternoon match between Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic.

The British No 1 gets an enthusiastic cheer from his box as he wins in straight sets over Raonic

Murray and Federer are currently locked at 11-11 in their head-to-head record and though Murray expects another tough match, he relishes the chance to take on the 17-time Grand Slam champion.

Murray said: 'It will be obviously a very difficult match but it will be an exciting match. A good one to be part of.

'I hope I can play well. We've had some very good matches over the years. I hope on Thursday it will be the same.

'Hopefully I can get through the group and keep going. If not, playing against Roger is a good way for me to finish the year as well.'
