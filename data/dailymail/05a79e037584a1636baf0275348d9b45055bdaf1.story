A designer has created a clutch bag which costs a wallet-busting £105,000.

Christopher Shellis, who runs the House of Borgeize in Birmingham’s famous Jewellery Quarter, designed the bag, which is studded with 345 diamonds and embellished with 18ct gold clasps.

The Du Palais clutch bag, which measures 7in (17cm) by 5in (12cm) and weighs 542g, also comes with a 1,000-year guarantee alongside its £105,000 price tag.

It took Mr Shellis and his dedicated team of goldsmiths and diamond setters more than 100 hours to create the bag

Mr Chellis, 48, claims his bling creation is the world’s most expensive clutch bag.

But, in fact, the world's most expensive handbag is the Mouawad 1001 Nights Diamond Purse, which is made up of 18ct gold and encrusted with more than 4,500 diamonds.

The bejeweled purse costs $3.8 million, earning a place in Guinness World Records in 2010 for being the most valuable handbag in the world.

Mr Chellis said of his creation: 'Like all Borgezie creations, the bag is designed to be a true treasure and comes with the usual 1,000-year guarantee - basically, it’ll never break.

'The inspiration and design was drawn from the Buckingham Palace gates. Like the palace gates, it conveys its very own regal presence.

The Buckingham Palace gates inspired the design of the clutch bag

'It would not look out of place among the collection of the jewels in the Tower of London itself. It could easily be worn by any royal princess.

'The bag is practical and is big enough to hold a purse, make-up or phone - but whoever buys it will probably have staff to hold those items for them.'

Earlier this year Chris Shellis created the world's most expensive pair of stilettos which were encrusted with 1,290 diamonds

It also comes with a secret sliding compartment, which is big enough for an iPhone.
