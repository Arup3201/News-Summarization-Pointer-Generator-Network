A British illustrator has taken the publishing world by storm and sold more than a million copies of her colouring book for grown ups.

Johanna Basford, from Aberdeenshire, was delighted when her first book, Secret Garden, proved such a success it was translated into 14 different languages across the world.

The book has been a particular hit in Paris where it outsold France's best-selling cookery books.

Ms Basford started drawing the illustrations  as a way to relax in 2013.

Now, her hand drawn illustrations have also been used by numerous brands, including Absolut Vodka, Sony, Nike, Smart Car and Tate Modern. 

Her popular website and blog features her intricate and whimsical illustrations for adults to colour in as they wish.

Following the success of her first book she has now created a follow up called Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Colouring Book which features 60 illustrations.

Johanna said her second book was inspired by visits to her grandparents and the surrounding woodland on the Isle of Arran, in Ayrshire

Following the success of her debut book  she has created a follow up called Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Colouring Book

The new colouring book takes readers on a inky quest of 60 illustrations through an enchanted forest to discover what lies in the castle

She said the new book was inspired by childhood visits to her grandparents on the Isle of Arran in Ayrshire.

Ms Basford said: 'Enchanted Forest takes its inspiration from the woodlands that surrounded my grandparents' house on the Isle of Arran.

'The woodlands were wild, unpredictable and scary and I love the playful way children see the world, as if through a wonderful lens that turns the mundane magical.

'In Enchanted Forest, tree stumps become curious little dwellings, rivers flow into treasure laden caves and at the heart of every forest lies an enchanted castle.'

As well as drawings to colour the book also features hidden objects to be found along the way including wild flowers and animals

Ms Basford added: 'Every piece I create starts life as a simple pencil sketch, evolving into a rambling pen and ink drawing usually spanning several sheets of paper. 

'For me, computer generated graphics can feel cold and soulless whereas hand drawing captures a sense of energy and character which no pixel can ever replicate.'

The new colouring book takes readers on a inky quest through an enchanted forest to discover what lies in the castle at its heart.

As well as drawings to complete, colour and embellish, there are hidden objects to be found along the way including wild flowers, animals and birds, gems, lanterns, keys and treasure chests.
