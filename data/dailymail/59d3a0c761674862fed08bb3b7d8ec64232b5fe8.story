A toilet attendant in Germany has been charged with tax evasion after change worth £35,000 was found in her garage.

The 53-year-old woman, who has not been identified, is being investigated following the discovery of the 1.4 tonne pile of coins at her home in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia.

Investigators are understood to have found coins ranging from one to 50 cents were piled high in the woman's garage.

The woman allegedly took €50 a day from her team of employees' tips, The Local has reported.

She has now been charged with 12 counts of tax evasion.

The website reported how the woman would drive to a number of toilets across the country in her Mercedes collecting the money.

Prosecutors have said the woman should have paid €550,000 in income tax and VAT between 2005 and 2010.

If found guilty she could face a year in prison along with a fine.

Police started investigating the woman after she fell out with an employee.

Officers were called to one of the toilets after the pair started fighting but they later opened investigations into how the company was run after suspicions were raised.

Meanwhile in the UK, it has emerged that 10 new alleged tax-dodgers have been added to the Government’s most-wanted list but only one of the original 20 has been caught in the past year.

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) last year published the names and pictures of 20 people accused of fleeing while owing hundreds of thousands of pounds - and in many instances millions.

The appeal helped provide intelligence on 15 of the alleged offenders, no update on four and one was captured, according to HMRC.
