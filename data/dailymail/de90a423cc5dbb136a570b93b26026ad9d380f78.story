Kate's girl: The Duchess' private secretary Rebecca Deacon at the Lindo Wing on Monday

The Duke and Duchess will not be hiring a nanny to help them with their young son, but there is no doubt that their team of trusted advisers that supported them through Monday's Royal birth will be there every step of the way.

Including the medical team, their private secretaries and their security guards, the Cambridges have a close group of people to stand by them.

THE GIRL FRIDAY

No twin-set and pearls for Rebecca Deacon, a vicar’s daughter who has worked as the duchess’s private secretary since her engagement was announced in 2010.

When the Mail bumped into her yesterday, she was, as almost always, a virtual ‘copy Kate’, in skin-tight skinny jeans, sling-back canvas wedge heels and a pair of over-sized sunglasses.

But don’t let her casual get-up fool anyone. Becca, as she is known to her friends, is Kate’s indispensable Girl Friday.

The 30-year-old is typical of the young team who have set up shop at Kensington Palace, where blue blood counts for remarkably little.

The youngest of three sisters, she was brought up by her mother, Selina, after her father, Michael, an army major, died in 1986.

After working as a house mother at Port Regis prep school in Dorset, her mother was ordained as a priest and is now a vicar at St John’s Church, in the tiny Wiltshire parish of Upper Studley.

Rebecca was a pupil at the exclusive Royal School in Bath before studying English at Newcastle University.

Her ‘big break’ came when she worked behind the scenes on William and Harry’s 2007 Concert For Diana as a producer’s assistant and won plaudits for her coolness under pressure.

She was subsequently absorbed into 
William and Harry’s private office and, when William’s engagement was 
announced, moved to work for Kate.

Last year she was officially promoted to private secretary, the most senior role in the duchess’s household.

‘In a very short time, Rebecca has become one of the central figures in the duchess’s life,’ said a source.

THE RIGHT-HAND MAN

Prince's aid: The Duke of Cambridge's private secretary Miguel Head

Affable but sharp as a tack, Miguel Head is William’s private secretary and is at the heart of a core band of advisers guiding the couple through the early stages of their public life together.

Educated at Bancroft’s, a small public school in Essex, the 34-year-old is not much older than his employer but brings to the role a wealth of experience outside of royal circles.

He joined the Ministry of Defence press office in his early 20s and worked his way up, serving as the liaison with Clarence House when Harry went to war in 2007.

Editors agreed a media blackout to allow Lieutenant Wales to serve in Afghanistan, but he had to be pulled out when foreign media broke the embargo.

Miguel’s performance in handling such a delicate situation – not least because of Harry’s ire – hugely impressed the princes, who hired him to head their press office.

In the role, Miguel, who owes his name to his Portuguese mother, managed to earn both the respect and trust of his principals.

As a result he was promoted to the coveted position of private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge last year after his long-standing predecessor Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton (a more traditional ex-army and ex-courtier figure) withdrew to an overseeing role.

Mig, as he is known to his friends, is believed to be the first senior royal aide to enter into a civil partnership with his long-term partner in 2011, the same year his boss wed.

Like many members of William, Kate  and Harry’s ‘unstuffy’ private office, Miguel  and his staff prefer to undertake their team bonding sessions over karaoke and chardonnay.

THE MEDICAL TEAM

'He was this big!' Obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston and Surgeon-Gyneacologists Marcus Setchell and Alan Farthing depart the hospital after delivering the baby boy of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

The Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell, was in charge of the birth.

A devoted grandfather himself, the 69-year-old has attended the Queen for more than 20 years.

He also delivered both of the Countess of Wessex’s children, Lady Louise, nine, and James, Viscount Severn, four.

The countess collapsed and was close 
to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the 
placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the 
medical care following Sophie’s ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and performed 
the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007.

Obstetrician
Guy Thorpe-Beeston is a specialist in high-risk pregnancies and dealing
with women who have had repeated miscarriages.

He works at London’s private Portland Hospital and on Harley Street having amassed 16 years’ experience as a consultant.

The
doctor, who says he like to ‘keep things simple’ by ‘offering honest 
advice’, specialises in pre-natal diagnosis, deliveries and ultrasound.

Dr Sunit Godambe is a consultant neonatologist at St Mary’s. He grew up in Mumbai, India.

The' Vegas cop': Bill Renshaw, famous for being photographed with Prince Harry during his trip to Las Vegas earlier this year, was leading the Cambridges' security team yesterday

THE VEGAS COP

The couple’s team of Scotland Yard police  bodyguards were yesterday led by one of their most experienced officers, Bill Renshaw.

Married Mr Renshaw was photographed organising the convoy that whisked the duchess to hospital (a far more sober experience given that the last time he was photographed was sitting with Prince Harry in a pool in Las Vegas).

He was also in charge of the prince when he was partying in the private suite at the exclusive Wynn Hotel, where Harry was photographed with a young woman playing naked billiards.
