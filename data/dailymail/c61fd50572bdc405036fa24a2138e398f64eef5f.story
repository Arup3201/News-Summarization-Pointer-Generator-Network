Former Hull KR boss Craig Sandercock is back in the NRL as Rick Stone's assistant at Newcastle

Australian Craig Sandercock has been given his old job back at Newcastle Knights.

The one-time schoolteacher, who spent three years with Hull KR after being appointed as the successor to Justin Morgan before being sacked by the club in July, will once more assist head coach Rick Stone at the Knights

Sandercock believes his stint in Super League will help him kick-start his career in the NRL.

'It was a really good experience,' Sandercock told Knights TV.

'It's a bit different over there but it was a massive learning curve for me and hopefully I've brought a few little things back here to the Knights.' 

Stone, who was Knights boss from 2009-2011, has also returned to the Knights after being cast aside by the club in favour of Wayne Bennett, who has gone back to the Brisbane Broncos.
