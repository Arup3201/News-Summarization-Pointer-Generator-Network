Three more Premier League managers have given their strong backing to Sportsmail’s Hands Off In The Box campaign.

Newcastle’s Alan Pardew, Queens Park Rangers’ Harry Redknapp and Garry Monk of Swansea yesterday all called for tougher action to put an end to wrestling, grabbing and shirt-pulling in the penalty area.

They want the rules to be made clearer to officials in charge of their matches and for clubs to be given a detailed explanation of their application.

Pardew has called on referees’ chief Mike Riley to make it clear what sanctions will be taken against the practice ahead of this weekend’s round of Premier League fixtures.

Pardew said: ‘It’s very important, because there has been the Daily Mail’s campaign and a lot of media talk, a lot of talk on the radio, that Mike Riley actually gives us an indication of what they’re going to do.

Harry Redknapp and Garry Monk have also spoken out about illegal defending in the box this week

‘I would hate for them to do a crackdown without a prior warning. They have done that in the past. Suddenly we start getting decisions: “Oh yeah, we have made it a policy and we’re going to change that”. Why not let us know then?

‘Some managers perhaps think it is an advantage and they can get away with it.

‘It would be nice to know what Mike Riley is going to do. This question is really for him and he needs to answer it.’

Pardew is growing tired of inconsistent decision-making and would accept if his team were penalised for holding in the box against Liverpool tomorrow, provided the same decision is given at the other end.

‘Those big decisions need to be made,’ he added. ‘If we have a decision against us about grappling we are going to have to accept it. Likewise if Liverpool, who are struggling at set plays, decide to use that tactic then I expect to see a penalty.’

Redknapp believes grappling in the box has come into the English game due to players and youngsters watching foreign football on television.

Eliaquim Mangala was clearly seen hauling Paul Dummett to the ground on Wednesday night

Stuart Attwell, despite glaring evidence, did not give Newcastle United a penalty during the first half

He claims the practice did not take place back when he was a player and that children are taught from a young age to mark correctly from set pieces — so it is not down to coaching.

Redknapp said: ‘No-one grappled in those days, it’s a new thing. It was watching foreign football. In Italian football they used to mark like that years ago. It didn’t happen in England.

‘Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner’s being played in. I’ve said it for years.

Referee Mark Clattenburg, never one to shy away from controversy, did not give a penalty

‘You don’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That’s happening more and more. Hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.’

Monk, in charge at Swansea, wants referees to be handed clearer rules so they can act when defenders pull back attackers at set pieces.

‘Referees need to be more consistent but the rules can be clearer too,’ Monk said. ‘It’s an art to defend and to take contact away completely with everybody marking zonal would take away from the game.

Ryan Shawcross has made a conscious effort to not pull, but was seen with his arms around Graziano Pelle

‘But there’s a line you don’t cross and it is making sure the line is clear. That line is when you have been beaten by the man, he’s got away from you and you are pulling his shirt and grabbing his arms. That’s what you have to stamp out. The refs need to be given a clear rule as it would be an easier decision for them.’

Leicester boss Nigel Pearson discourages his players from doing it in training. He said: ‘If I see it in training, I give a penalty because that’s what happens in a game’.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.'

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' 

Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker

'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.'

Graham Poll, Former top referee

'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.'

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.'

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.'

Alan Pardew, Newcastle manager

‘It’s very important, because there has been the Daily Mail’s campaign and a lot of media talk, a lot of talk on the radio, that Mike Riley actually gives us an indication of what they’re going to do. 

Harry Redknapp, QPR manager 

‘Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner’s being played in. I’ve said it for years.  You don’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That’s happening more and more. Hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.’ 

Nigel Pearson, Leicester manager

‘If I see it in training, I give a penalty because that’s what happens in a game’

And the readers of MailOnline...

'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath

'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I've ever seen.' Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
