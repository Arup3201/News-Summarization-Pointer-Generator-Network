Distinctive cyclones whirling in the skies could be seen over Lincolnshire today, heralding a weekend of powerful storms.

Forecasters have issued severe weather warnings for most of the UK this Saturday, with heavy rain predicted alongside thunderstorms and 'intense' hail.

Twister: Logistic manager Geoff Hill saw this tornado-like cloud in the skies over Lincolnshire this afternoon

One of the twisters above Lincolnshire was found today by logistics manager Geoff Hill, whose company is based near Market Rasen.

Twisting cloud formations like those pictured only technically qualify as tornadoes if they make contact with the ground - those pictured are believed instead to be funnel clouds.

Mr Hill managed to capture an image of the wild winds, which started to form around 3pm today.

He said: 'It was spotted by one of our store staff working outside looking up at the sky. Somebody rushed in and said there’s a tornado.

'So we 
went outside and I grabbed my camera and took a picture. I actually 
caught it on the second go because it had formed for five minutes before
 and then disappeared.

Things to come: The images emerged as forecasters issued a severe weather warning for most of the UK

'Then it formed again and appeared for another five minutes.'

Later on the same day photographer Stuart Morant captured an array of other powerful winds to the north of Lincolsnhire, near Scunthorpe.

The dramatic images come as the Met Office issues a severe weather warning for the whole of England and Wales, and southern parts of Scotland.

Predicting 'lively weather' which could 
make the roads a nightmare and sink any plans of staying outside, a Met 
Office forecaster told MailOnline there was a risk of 'heavy, thundery 
rain with the chance of some quite intense hailstorms' across the 
country.

An official warning issued today said: 'The public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding due to the intensity of these storms, although at this stage the location of the heaviest rainfall is uncertain.

'Warm, humid air is likely to be pulled northwards from France late on Friday and during Saturday.

'Within this air mass, there is an increasing likelihood that heavy, thundery showers will break out... over the next few days it may be possible to focus on the areas most at risk.'
