With only two weeks to go and snow forecast for this week, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

But whether you're trimming the tree or getting ready for the office party, the song to get you rocking around that Christmas tree is Fairytale of New York, according to a new survey.

She said: 'We all have the songs we love and look forward to hearing every year.

'But the songs that means the most to you can say more about your personality that you'd think.'

If you're a fan of Mariah Carey's Christmas hit All I Want For Christmas Is You, you're cheerful, good natured and like a bit of retro glamour, while disco divas favoured Wizzard's I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday and Slade's Merry Xmas Everybody. The old-school classic Let It Snow by Dean Martin were the Christmas song of choice for fashionistas, while Chris Rea's Driving Home For Christmas and Wham's Last Christmas proved popular with romantics.

And the Christmas crackers you perhaps shouldn't admit you like? Stop The Cavalry and Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? According to Flic, if Bob Geldof's charity single is your favourite festive tune, you 'lack confidence', while fans of Jona Lewie's hit are 'unusual'.

The festive tunes that failed to make the top ten included Wonderful Christmas Time by Paul McCartney and Elton John's Step Into Christmas.
