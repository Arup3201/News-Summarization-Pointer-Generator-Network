The Brazilian town of Cândido Godói is truly one of a kind... all because the same can't be said for the locals.

The municipality, in the state Rio Grande do Sul, has been been nicknamed 'Twin Land' due to the phenomenal number of twins there.

With more than one pregnancy in every ten being a multiple birth, the town has a twin rate nearly 1,000 per cent higher than the global average.

And most bizarrely, while many attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon, many observers blame the Nazis.

Known about town: Neslson and Norberto Riske have lived together since they were born. They like to drink the tradional 'mate' and like to play with their dogs. They worked together in a soja plantation before retiring

They say it is down to one of Adolf Hitler's most ruthless underlings Dr Joseph Mengele - also known as the Angel of Death.

Some historians believe the Auschwitz physician fled to Brazil following the collapse of the Third Reich where he continued the medical experimentation for which he had become infamous during the war. He is alleged to have been responsible for the deaths of some 400,000 Jews.

On a mission to create an Aryan master race for his Fuhrer, Mengele was resident medic at Auschwitz from May 1943 until his flight in the face of the Red Army advance in January 1945. 

While working at the death camp, he 
carried out often horrifying human experiments as he tried to discover 
the genetic quirk that produces twins – in a bid to artificially 
increase the Aryan birthrate for his master.

Identical: But it was not until he arrived at Cândido Godói, under the guise of a roaming doctor, that historians say his attempts finally bore fruit

Roaming doctor: Residents say Mengele visited the town many times in the 1960s, posing first as a vet but then offering medical treatment to the women of the town

Ahead of his time? They claim he gave them an ahead-of-its-time, twin-inducing mix of drugs or hormones

Eight-year-old Andrian and Andrei Da Silva Kunzi: The locals recalled him by different names, Camarasa explained, but each interviewee had the same reaction when shown a picture of Mengele: 'That's him.'

Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa cited
 interviews with locals in his book, Mengele: The Angel of Death in 
South America, who say they remember the visits of a traveling German 
doctor who provided mysterious potions or drugs.

Wilmar and Delmar Lebens: Another theory: Brazilian scientists have studied this case and say the phenomenon is down to the fact a gene linked with twinning occurs at a much higher rate in the village than it does elsewhere

Ten-year-old Leandro and Lisandro Gorsak: This concentration within the town, which was settled by a small group of German-speaking immigrants, has been compounded by decades of intermarriage

50 years of twins: This is the grave of the first couple to have twins in Candido Godoi

Proud heritage: Even murals of twins adorn walls across the town

'Terra dos Gemeos': Even upon entering the town, visitors are reminded of its famous nickname
