Hull City will pay Blackpool £2million for Tom Ince after a tribunal determined the fee plus add-ons for the player's sale back in July 2014.

The initial payment of £2m could be boosted by a series of additional instalments, such as Ince making a set number of appearances and if Hull avoid relegation.

The son of former England captain Paul Ince was linked with several clubs after his contract expired at Bloomfield Road.

After interest from the likes of Liverpool and Inter Milan, he subsequently joined the Tigers on a two-year contract.

Ince’s first club, Liverpool, will also benefit from the deal, with 35 per cent or £700,000 of the fee going to Brendan Rodgers’ side for their part in developing the player.

The 22-year-old started the first three games of the Premier League season before being sent out on loan to Nottingham Forest on loan.

Ince has made four appearances for Hull since returning to the KC Stadium - including the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal.
