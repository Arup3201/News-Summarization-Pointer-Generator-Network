A man accused of masterminding the theft of a $5million Stradivarius violin pleaded guilty to robbery robbery Friday.

The plea deal for Salah Salahadyn comes nearly eight months after the 300-year-old instrument was snatched from a musician who was attacked with a stun gun following a performance in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Salahadyn, 41, was taken into custody after changing his plea during a hearing in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. He could face up to 10 years in prison when sentenced November 10.

Music man: Salah Salahadyn, 41, of Milwaukee, has pleaded guilty to masterminding the theft of a Stradivarius violin from a concertmaster in January 

Masterpiece recovered: The stolen $5million Stradivarius violin is displayed at the Milwaukee Police Department February 6, 2014, a day after police recovered the instrument in good condition in an attic

The instrument was missing for nine days before police found it, in good condition, in a suitcase at the Milwaukee home of Salahadyn's acquaintances. 

Police said the homeowner did not know what was in the suitcase, which was recovered in the attic.

Court documents allege that Salahadyn told a friend that such a robbery would be his dream crime because of the instrument's value and the ease of grabbing it from Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond  walking down the street. 

It wasn't his first being involved in such a crime: He pleaded guilty in 2000 to trying to resell a $25,000 statue to the owner of an art gallery in the Pfister Hotel, from whom it had been stolen in 1995. 

Salahadyn's ex-girlfriend told investigators that while he had not stolen the artwork himself, he did orchestrate the heist.

The other man charged in the violin case, Universal Knowledge Allah, 36, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty in May to being party to felony robbery, the same charge to which Salahadyn pleaded guilty. 

Prosecutors said Allah provided the stun gun used to attack Frank Almond.

Almond was ambushed January 27 in a parking lot after leaving a performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee. 

The musician has said he was lucky he didn't suffer a career-ending arm or wrist injury when he crumpled to the icy pavement that night.

Stradivarius violins were crafted by legendary Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari. Many are owned by private collectors who lend them to top violinists to be played in symphonies. 

Experts say a Stradivarius violin deteriorates if it's not used but remains in good condition when played regularly.

The owner of the stolen violin has remained anonymous. But she filed a victim-impact statement when Allah was sentenced, extolling the virtues of the Stradivarius, calling it a direct link to history.

'It is, after all, an amazing work of craftsmanship that in the right hands is capable of producing matchless, exquisite sound that expresses every emotion,' her statement said.

Experts estimate that about 600 to 650 Stradivarius instruments remain, or about half of what the master produced. 

Although they can be worth millions of dollars, they are rarely stolen because they're cataloged so well that a thief would have a hard time selling one.
