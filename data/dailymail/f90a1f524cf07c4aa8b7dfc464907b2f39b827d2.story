Lord Best (pictured) chairs the all-party group which has suggested a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes.

Stamp duty should be waived for millions of pensioners to encourage them to downsize, a group of MPs said last night.

They quote analysis that found a third of over-60s want to move into smaller houses – but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax.

It means they are forced to continue to live in family-sized homes which are far bigger than they need, and which are expensive to heat.

The all-party parliamentary group on housing and care for older people said the answer was to exempt them from stamp duty on homes worth £250,000 or less.

They could then move into smaller homes more appropriate to their needs – freeing up their larger houses for families who need more room.

The Help to Move idea is contained in a report by the all-party group, which is chaired by Lord Best, the former head of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It suggests a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes. 

‘More and more people in their “extended middle age” are thinking about downsizing,’ said Lord Best. ‘This can mean much reduced fuel bills and maintenance costs, perhaps the release of some capital, and can prevent a forced move in later life. 

‘Our report recommends a Help to Move package of stamp duty relief, financial advice and mortgage support – like the Help to Buy assistance for younger purchasers – to generate the demand that will get more high-quality homes built for this age group.’

The report cites analysis by the think-tank Demos that shows 58 per cent of over-60s – around 8 million people living in 7 million homes – are interested in moving.

A third of over-60s specifically wanted to downsize, while a quarter said they were interested in buying a retirement property.

The MPs say exempting older people from stamp duty on homes worth up to £250,000 would lead to a net gain to the Treasury because of the consequent moves in the property market. 

The report also calls for loans for older homeowners with lower value properties to allow them to get mortgages to buy higher-value retirement homes.

Research found a third of over-60s want to move into smaller houses, but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax - forcing them to continue to live in family-sized homes which are far bigger than they need and are expensive to heat 

At present, many older people cannot access mainstream mortgage lending. 

The report said a scheme like Help to Buy, which helps younger people get on the housing ladder, could help pensioners at the other end of their lives.

Claudia Wood, chief executive of the think tank Demos and author of the report, said: ‘Politicians from all parties are committed to helping first time buyers get onto the housing ladder, while ignoring the problems at the other end of the market.

‘Many older people would like to downsize and are stuck in properties that are hard to manage and heat.

‘A lack of suitable properties and the practical and emotional upheaval of moving can’t be underestimated – but affordability is a major barrier for many.

‘The government needs to commit to really helping this group of people with concrete policies – not just to ensure older people enjoy a better quality of life but also to stimulate their entire housing market by helping more older people move from family-sized homes.’

While some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free, many people in their 50s will still have a home loan.

If you are thinking of downsizing there are plenty of decent mortgage options out there to help you cut the cost of your monthly repayments.

Even if you're not thinking of moving, with rates near record lows, it could be a good time to remortgage and reduce the cost of paying off your home before retirement - and even save the extra money into a pension if you want to.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. 

Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way
