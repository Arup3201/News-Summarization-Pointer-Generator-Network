Troubled supermarket giant Tesco was facing fresh questions last night after it emerged it had purchased a new corporate jet worth £31million.

The Gulfstream 550 aircraft arrived just days after it was revealed profits at the struggling supermarket had been overstated by £250million.

The jet - which was ordered in early 2013, ironically, just as the group was scaling back its international operations - will raise further questions over the tenure of former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was ousted in July.

The Gulfstream 550 aircraft (like the one pictured) arrived just days after it was revealed profits at the struggling supermarket had been overstated by £250million

Tesco sparked a storm of shareholder fury in 2012 when it emerged they had spent nearly £29million on private plane journeys since 2005 despite falling sales and the rising cost of the jets.

The supermarket giant had pledged to put all its executive jets up for sale in a bid to rebuild investor confidence.

A source close to the company told the Financial Times: ‘If you want an indication of what has gone wrong at Tesco [it was that] we ordered another Gulfstream.’

The news comes as the group attempts to recover from a spate of bad news, including three profit warnings in three months and the revelation that the Financial Conduct Authority was investigating its accounting practices.

Tesco’s new chief executive Dave Lewis was brought in on September 1 from Unilever to replace Mr Clarke after the second profit warning a month ago.

People inside the company said one of his first decisions was to sell the aircraft, though the group has not yet announced this publicly.

The retailer was this week registered as the new owner of a Gulfstream 550 on the website of the Civil Aviation Authority, according to the Financial Times.

The 29-metre-long G550, which can seat up to 18 passengers, has a range of up to 12,500km and can fly non-stop for up to 12 hours.

To charter a G550 for a 12-hour flight would cost nearly £67,000 – more than twice the average UK salary of £26,000.

Since the financial crisis, companies have been unwilling to be seen flying corporate jets, for fear of being attacked by investors and the public for extravagance.

One senior executive in the private aviation industry told the Financial Times: ‘There has been a fundamental change – corporates don’t want to be seen owning aircraft in Europe.’

Tesco shares have sunk to an 11-year low since the latest profit warning last week.

The jet may prove to be the most short-lived purchase for the group. Tesco said last night: ‘All aircraft operated by Tesco are in the process of being sold.’
