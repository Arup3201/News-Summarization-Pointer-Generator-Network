He may be off to live in the lap of luxury but 4.4m long croc 'Shrek' 
wasn't particularly keen to move home.

As up to five members of staff at Crocodylus Park in Darwin prepared to transport the notoriously ill-tempered croc to a new world-class enclosure, he decided to show them who was boss.

Despite being given a good scrub down and having his teeth brushed in preparation for the move, the 400kg salt water managed to wrestle free from handlers and swung his head so ferociously that he gave one park ranger a black eye.

You are coming with me: Shrek finds out he is moving home when a ranger ties him up and film crews arrive

Easy does it: Slow progress is made as handlers remove Shrek from his pool

Spa treatment: Handlers set to work on Shrek, giving him a good scrub before taking him to his new home

Croc manicure: Handlers give Shrek a once over, checking his claws are trimmed and all is in working order

Gagged: Handlers prepare to give Shrek's huge teeth a good clean

Pearly white: A scrubbing brush is used to clean Shrek's teeth. No toothpaste in sight, mind

Strength: Despite having five handlers on his back, blindfolded, gagged and tied down with a rope, Shrek manages to free himself enough to swing his head, knock over a handler and give him a black eye

The crocodile was christened Shrek because he is big, green and looks like an ogre and he certainly lived up to his name.

Handler John Pomeroy was headbutted twice by the reptile as he freed his head as five handlers tried holding him still.

Mr Pomeroy told NT News that it was painful but that it could have been a lot worse.

'Of course it hurt', Mr Pomeroy said.

'When a 400kg crocodile swings its head at you with all its strength it tends to hurt.'

'A lot more people die on our roads than get killed by crocodiles," he said.

Shrek is off to a state-of-the-art 
enclosure at Port Macquarie wildlife park in New South Wales, where he 
will have his own pond.

Mr
Pomeroy, 65, was in charge of transporting the 400kg saltwater crocodile from 
Darwin's Crocodylus Park to the Port Macquarie Wildlife Park in New 
South Wales.

Later that day,
once he was brought under control, Shrek was flown to Brisbane on a 
Qantas passenger jet and then trucked to Port Macquarie.
