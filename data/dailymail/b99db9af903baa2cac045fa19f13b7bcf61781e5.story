A lance corporal has been arrested accused of kidnapping two young soldiers and torturing them overnight.

The unnamed soldier, 23, from 1 Mercian regiment, is said to have tied the victims up and subjected them to a series of beatings at Catterick Garrison, in North Yorkshire.

The ordeal ended when one managed to break free from the car and raise the alarm after he bundled one into the boot and forced the other onto the back seat before attempting to drive out of the base, a source claimed.

History: The incident comes four years after five military instructors were suspended amid allegations of physical abuse and harassment at Catterick Garrison - the British Army's largest base in the world

They were said to be 'traumatised' by the ordeal.

The incident comes four years after five military instructors were suspended amid allegations of 
physical abuse and harassment at the same base - the British Army's largest in the world.

An investigation has been launched by the Ministry of Defence into what drove the Afghanistan veteran to 'flip' in such dramatic fashion.

One suggestion is that the soldier suffered a mental breakdown sparked by his experiences on the Afghan battlefield in 2010.

A source told The Sun: 'He tied them up, tried to suffocate them — and kicked and punched them overnight.

'It was a horrific ordeal. The two victims have been left traumatised.

'They have only just joined the Army. It sounds like he just flipped. He lost it.'

An MoD spokesperson said: 'A soldier from 1 Mercian was arrested following an incident at Catterick.

'The matter is subject to an ongoing Royal Military Police investigation.'

The British Army has been rocked in recent years by claims of abuse on bases.

In 2008 five army instructors were suspended after allegations of 
physical abuse and harassment were made public in an undercover 
investigation by the BBC at a training base in Catterick, North 
Yorkshire.

A report in June also claimed that soldiers are still not being protected from bullying and abuse, years after the scandal at the notorious Deepcut barracks.

An inspection of dozens of health 
clinics, GP services and trauma units for troops has found that many 
doctors and nurses do not know how to report suspected abuse cases or 
how to identify possible victims.

The inspections - carried out at 
military bases in the UK and abroad by the Care Quality Commission, at the Ministry of Defence’s 
request - reported that there
were no clear guidelines on how to safeguard those vulnerable to 
bullying.

It also found that there was little advice available to soldiers on how to deal with it.

Between 1995 and 2002, four young recruits died in mysterious 
circumstances at the Deepcut barracks in Surrey amid allegations of bullying.

While an open verdict was recorded for all four deaths, a 2007 report found 'clear evidence of foul abuse' at the base, concluding that 'on the balance of probabilities' the deaths of at least three of the four soldiers were self-inflicted.
