If you are the kind of person who will wrap yourself in the St George's flag as you shout 'ROO-NEY' at the TV this summer, the bulletin on Luis Suarez is good news.

No doubt many England fans punched the air when it emerged that Suarez had suffered a knee injury at Uruguay's training in Montevideo and might be out of the clash on June 19.

'Suarez is out of the World Cup - get in!'

'I hope it's a bad one.'

'Right, all we need is Cavani to break down now.'

Feeling down: Suarez is an injury doubt for Uruguay's second group game against England

Sensational: Suarez played a key role in Liverpool's title challenge this season with 31 league goals

And on and 
on. Any advantage to the team you support is always welcomed, whether 
that's your star striker returning from injury, or your rivals' No 9 
pulling his hamstring.

England
 vs Uruguay with Suarez sitting in the stands is wholly more appealing to England fans 
than the same fixture with Suarez walking out of the tunnel in his 
blue shirt.

But what about the entertainment? What about watching the stars? What about those goals you'll still be talking about in 30 years?

The Champions League comes along every season and if your team gets to the final, they will play a total of 13 matches. So, even if a star player picks up an injury, you're still likely to see him at some point during the tournament.

Now compare that with the World Cup. An unfortunate knee niggle - one diagnosis on Suarez is that he'll miss four to six weeks, another said he'll be fit in three - can ultimately rule you out of a tournament that only takes place every four years. That's what you call a bad break.

Stars: No-one would want to watch the World Cup without Lionel Messi (left) or Cristiano Ronaldo

Whether you fall into the Messi or 
Ronaldo camp, few would claim they are not excited about watching one or
 the other - or both - this summer. We want them to turn it up to 11 in 
Brazil.

And it should be the same for Suarez. This is the man who enjoyed an exceptional season with Liverpool, scoring 31 goals as he took them to the brink of a first title since 1990.

There's no-one who watches Match of the Day on a regular basis that wasn't blown away by Suarez at some point this season.

Taking that form into the World Cup, he would be a joy to watch. You hope the same for Andres Iniesta, Neymar, Robin van Persie, Yaya Toure and the other leading figures of the game.

The World Cup has a history of high-profile injuries (Pele in 1966, Michael Ballack in 2010) and there are already a few decent players out of Brazil (Thiago Alcantara and Theo Walcott, for sure, and they may be joined by Radamel Falcao.)

So, if you want to sit back next month and watch the best players in the best tournament, start crossing your fingers that Suarez is an exceptionally quick healer.

If we want the best competitions we need the best players to be available

@highlight

If Messi or Ronaldo were out we would be sad, why aren't we for Suarez?

@highlight

Too many big names have already been ruled out through injury

Suarez may never hit this sort of form again so we need to enjoy him
