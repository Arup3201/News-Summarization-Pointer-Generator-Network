November 20, 2014: With the news of Mike Nichols death, the MailOnline is re-running this article originally published in September

 

When Diane Sawyer met Mike Nichols, the Oscar, Grammy and five-time Tony winning director was a drug addict, hooked on the sleeping pill Halcion, and floating in a black depression.

He was having a nervous breakdown and lost in ‘Halcion madness’ with thoughts of going crazy, losing all his money and dying.

For that brief moment in time in 1986, when they first met in a Concorde lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, they professed to be each other’s hero and it was profound love at first sight for both the Ice Princess and the Golden boy.

Diane's choice: Always asked why she didn't have children, Diane responded that she would have had them under different circumstances ‘but I chose Mike and Mike already had three children with two other women, and he was fifty-eight when we married'

Isn't it romantic: 'I think one of the most romantic things is simply the way he reaches for my hand all the time, ' Diane says of her director husband

He was fifty-four and Sawyer, then a 60 Minutes correspondent, was forty-one. They were swept up into each other’s universe within moments, made a lunch date that confirmed their affection. 

But then Nichols disappeared.

Diane was in disbelief and hurt. She had achieved so many of her ambitious dreams but now it seemed like the most desired dream of all had evaporated and she had no control, reveals a sensational new book, The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour – and the (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women in TV News by Sheila Weller, published by Penguin Press

Mike Nichols didn’t want Diane to see his madness. ‘I didn’t want her to see me as I was. I went totally crazy. As soon as I was okay, I called her up’, the author quotes Nichols.

The director had been introduced to the medication that is used to treat insomnia while in the hospital for a minor heart procedure. He was quickly addicted and then his world began to fall apart.

Hallucinating that he was losing all his money, he began selling his prize collection of Polish Arabian horses he kept on a farm in Bridgewater, Connecticut.

Diane was the impetus for Nichols getting help.

He had another bombshell secret to confess. He was left permanently hairless after a botched whooping cough vaccination at age four. He’s always worn a wig, fake eyebrows almost his entire life. There is not a hair on his body.

One of the first things Nichols did was break up with an unnamed media professional he had been involved with for two years after his third divorce.

At the time, Diane was living with Richard Holbrooke, a former assistant Secretary of State for Asia who was an investment banker with Lehman Brothers.

With an impressive Foreign Service career, Holbrooke was a ‘superbly connected high achiever’ as well as being Diane’s ‘primary guidance counselor’, writes Weller.

Green with envy: Jackie Kennedy dated Nichols herself. 'She was possessive. She didn't like him dating Diane,' according to a friend

He was shocked and devastated by his sweetheart’s sudden decision to move into her own unfurnished apartment. She owned no furniture, bought no furniture.

‘I have no taste’, Sawyer admitted. ‘When I’ve had the option of going to a movie or looking at [furniture fabric] swatches, that wasn’t even close. I’d rather send out for pizza and sit on my floor pillows’.

Nichols, the director of such iconic films as The Graduate, Carnal Knowledge and Working Girl, was shocked by her style of living at the height of her glamour and success. But that all changed when the couple moved into a Park Avenue hotel penthouse apartment. Nichols took care of furnishing it with an exquisite collection of art and furniture while ‘Diane stayed proudly un-domestic for years, leaving niceties to Mike.

She learned how to cook --- in a way. She cut out multiple versions of a recipe and they sometimes cooked together but it wasn’t something she had a desire to master. Twenty-eight years later, she is now the vegetable police making sure Nichols eats well.

The couple married in April 1988 on Martha’s Vineyard where they have a second home when not in residence at their Upper East Side Manhattan apartment.

‘My ultimate happiness began in 1988 when I married Diane. She is the perfect wife’. 

It was the director’s fourth marriage.

‘In the first ninety seconds’ of meeting the iconic director in the airport lounge, she knew ‘that my life was changing’, and that ‘he was the center of the dance’.

But she wasn’t considered the perfect wife for Nichols by his erudite theatre friends. ‘The arts circle thought that Diane was not up to Mike and they still feel that way’, Weller quotes a long-time friend of Nichols.

Say cheese: Barbara Walters referred to Sawyer as ‘That Girl’. Diane was always one step ahead in booking wars, writes the author.

Three's a crowd: ‘I don’t have a husband who’s a Hollywood director! I don’t have what she has! That Girl can book everybody,' Walters complained 

Add Jackie Onassis to that list of disapprovers. ‘Mike was a love of her life. Jackie was very covetous of Mike. She was possessive. She didn’t like him dating Diane,' according to a friend.

Lila Diane Sawyer was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, in December 1945 but the family soon moved to Louisville, where the little girl was enrolled in talent classes at an early age to prep for future beauty pageants staked out for her by her mother.

She captured the crown for America’s Junior Miss in her senior year at Seneca High as well as ‘most likely to succeed’, which she viewed as embarrassing. But the Junior Miss title won her a cash prize that allowed her to pay tuition at Wellesley College, an elite, liberal women's college in Massachusetts. 

It was a major transition into a sophisticated arena for the 5’9” southern blonde. In the 1970s, she worked for the Nixon Administration and after the president’s disgraced resignation in 1974 following the Watergate scandal, she headed out to his hometown in San Clemente, California, to help him research and write his memoirs. 

Media liberals in New York had a hard time coming to terms with her loyalty to Nixon in the early years.

Diane’s work ethic and successful lifestyle infuriated Barbara Walters who referred to Sawyer as ‘That Girl’. Diane was always one step ahead in booking wars for the big-get interviews. Barbara put in her request only to find out that Diane had already requested that person.

Balancing act: Diane learned how to juggle her two worlds – ‘the sweatpants and Nellie Bly stories in the office, the sophisticated evenings with Mike and his friends,' write Weller

Barbara talked about Mike Nichols. ‘I don’t have a husband who’s a Hollywood director! I don’t have what she has! That Girl can book everybody! I don’t have these dinner parties. I don’t go to Martha’s Vineyard. I don’t even have a house’.

But it was an exaggeration because Barbara had her own ‘axis of connections’ and at one time had been married to Merv Adelson, one of Hollywood’s most successful network television show producers.

‘There was a New York media elite, and Barbara always felt like an outsider, and that feeling is what drove her’. Diane was in the media elite with a style so different from Walters. She was part of the team and willing to go to the edit room and work with the producer on a script. 

Diane learned how to juggle her two worlds – ‘the sweatpants and Nellie Bly stories in the office, the sophisticated evenings with Mike and his friends, sometimes with campy repartee’.

This was Diane’s element.

She could be working up until midnight in the editing room, eating plastic-bagged okra, collard greens and salty potato chips – Southern comfort snack food. A quick trip to the bathroom, she’d emerge in fresh makeup and high heels to go home to her husband.

They became a media power couple. If a high profile friend of Diane’s was being pursued by Katie Couric for an interview, Mike Nichols picked up the phone and told their friend ‘that he and Diane would essentially cut off all social contact if they appeared on Today’ with Couric, the author claims.

Always asked why she didn’t have children, Diane responded that she would have had them under different circumstances ‘but I chose Mike and Mike already had three children with two other women, and he was fifty-eight when we married. And I chose him’. ‘He is my only marriage’.

The spark in their love affair has not diminished. She admits he is more romantic that she is. ‘He puts little notes in my sock drawer or in my suitcase before I leave for a work trip. 

'I think one of the most romantic things is simply the way he reaches for my hand all the time’.

‘We rarely fight and I remember once when we were arguing he stopped in the middle of it and said, ‘Well, this is sort of fun, too’. And it was! 

'It was good to know that we could get out our strong feelings but that we were indestructible at the same time’.

‘Falling in love really does have a sort of going-over-to-the other-side feeling to it. Giving something up. Dying. Giving up balance, equilibrium, some kind of safety, and just sliding through this unknown and slightly terrifying country, where you become unnervingly like the enemy’, Weller quotes Nichols. ’The other side. Just belonging to somebody: the end of all games’.

‘I had loved other women before but not like this’.
