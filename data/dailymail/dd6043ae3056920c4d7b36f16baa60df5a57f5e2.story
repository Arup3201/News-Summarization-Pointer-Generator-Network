He's working hard to maintain a respectable handicap of about 16 or 17, but President Obama is playing straight into the hands of his Republican rivals while doing so.

The Leader of the Free World skipped the gym on Wednesday to hit the links at Mid Pacific Country Club golf course in Kailua’s Lanikai neighborhood with scenic views of the water and lush green mountains.

The game came just days after the Republican National Committee designed six e-cards of mock presidential resolutions, posting aspirational messages alongside ironic images of Obama.

Republicans captioned a snap of the President putting on the green while dressed to the nines in a suit and tie as part of a mock series of resolutions for 2014

The headlining 'resolution' was to 'spend less time on the gold course', with the President playing an estimated 155 rounds since he assumed office in 2009.

On Sunday, after playing nearly five hours of golf Sunday at Marine Corps Base, veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler from White House Dossier said his latest game was the 156th game since the inauguration and the 45th outing this year.

Through the first 10 days of his end-of-the-year vacation in Hawaii, President Obama has largely fulfilled one goal: Staying out of the public eye.

While his administration has sent out formal statements, and campaign organizations have e-mailed fundraising solicitations under his name, Obama has also gotten in daily workouts, hiking and beach trips, dinners with friends and family and six golf outings in his home state.

Obama has also signed bills into law and conducted a series of briefings, all behind closed doors.

Obama's vacation lasts until Sunday and the $4 million price tag that some news outlets have put on the stay has prompted some grumbling: The Hawaii Reporter notes that Obama and friends pay for the private vacation rental in Kailua that fetch $25,000 a week -- but that taxpayers pick up the majority of the bill for the rest of the trip.

The website says Michael Tasselmyer of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, estimates the 18-hour round trip flight to Hawaii and back aboard Air Force One at $3,235,500. That's $179,750 per hour for flight and operation.

The Reporter says the cost for cargo aircraft that transports the presidential limos, helicopters and other support equipment to Hawaii has never been disclosed, but the round trip flight time between Andrews Air Force Base and Hawaii is 21.5 hours, with an estimated operating cost of $12,000 per hour. 

The Obama's are generally warmly received in Hawaii, although demonstrators protested Saturday against unmanned drones in an area near the first family's vacation home.
