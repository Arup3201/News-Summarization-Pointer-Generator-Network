This is the astonishing moment a Polish man solved a Rubik’s cube in just 21.17 seconds – while blindfolded.

Marcin Kowalczyk set a new world record in the same amount of time that it takes most people to make a few turns and become frustrated with the 3-D combination puzzle.

But what makes it so remarkable is the fact that Marcin accomplished his incredible feat without seeing what his hands were doing.

The speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the Rubik’s cube and then, while blindfolded, he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in Szczecin in western Poland.

A judge held a piece of paper between Marcin's face and his hands to make sure he couldn't peek under his mask.

His celebration was subdued, however, as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle.

This isn’t the first time Marcin has set a world record with his special talent.

He was already the record holder with a time of 23.19 seconds, which he set earlier this year.

In November 2013 he solved 41 Rubik’s cubes in 54 minutes and 14 seconds while blindfolded. He studied all 41 cubes and memorised their patterns before putting on a blindfold and solving each one.
