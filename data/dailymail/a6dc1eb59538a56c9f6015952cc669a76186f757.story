Chelsea have announced Ron Gourlay is to leave his role as chief executive.

The Scot, who joined the club in 2004 and worked as chief operating officer before succeeding Peter Kenyon as chief exec in 2009, departs on amicable terms to seek new opportunities.

Marina Granovskaia, one of Roman Abramovich's advisers, is set for a bigger role behind the scenes at Chelsea.

Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the situation at Stamford Bridge.

GOURLAY’S GONE, WHAT’S NEXT?

'Chelsea Football Club announces that Ron Gourlay, after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive, is leaving Chelsea in order to pursue new business opportunities.

'The club, and in particular the owner (Roman Abramovich) and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges.

'Ron's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world.

'Pending additional appointments, chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia will assume additional executive responsibilities.'

Marina Granovskaia. Keep hold of her coat-tails, she is the next big thing at Chelsea Football Club and is clearly going places after the announcement that Gourlay is on his way out.

Gourlay was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club from Stamford Bridge. He was initially commercial director at Chelsea and filled Kenyon's shoes in 2009.

Thankfully, we have never had to endure the type of press conference Kenyon squirmed through when Avram Grant was appointed Mourinho’s successor in September 2007. ‘He’s the right man for the job, we are absolutely convinced.’

Gourlay - or ‘Galloping’ as he was affectionately nicknamed by the media - negotiated Chelsea’s massive kit deal with Adidas, although as one industry insider said: ‘They pay, we wear, not difficult’.

Gourlay was in the boardroom suite at Crystal Palace on Saturday and there was no hint the chief executive was about to quit Chelsea.

Director of football Michael Emenalo was there, along with affable secretary Dave Barnard, chairman Bruce Buck and the up-and-coming figure of Granovskaia. She runs the show now.

HOW POWERFUL IS A CHELSEA CHIEF EXECUTIVE?

The most powerful man at Chelsea is Roman Abramovich, period. Beyond that Eugene Tenenbaum, chairman Bruce Buck and the highly-influential Granovskaia jostle for position within Abramovich’s inner circle.

To be fair to Gourlay he has overseen a period when Chelsea have become an acceptable face in European football and they are now respected by some of the biggest clubs on the continent. He is a decent, all-round nice guy.

Gourlay was famously at the club's training ground on the day Jacob Mellis set off a smoke bomb. Mellis was later fired.

Public speaking was never his thing and he gave an awkward interview with Buck to talkSPORT when John Terry had been banned for insulting Anton Ferdinand.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR CHELSEA IN THE SHORT-TERM?

The accounts department at Chelsea might notice fewer receipts coming in from Lucio Italian restaurant on Fulham Road. It’s a regular haunt for the power-brokers at Stamford Bridge and takings won’t be down for long.

Beyond that, Jose Mourinho will give a gushing tribute to Gourlay at his press conference on Friday and his departure will be recorded in the matchday programme for the fixture with QPR at Stamford Bridge on November 1.

AND FURTHER DOWN THE LINE?

The next chief executive will come under pressure to find a solution to Chelsea’s long-running problem over a new stadium. Rebuilding Stamford Bridge appears to be impossible and they have lost out on the regeneration project of Battersea Power Station.

'It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges.

'I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.'

They floated the idea of ground-sharing with the RFU at Twickenham for a season while they remodelled Stamford Bridge, but it was met with fierce opposition from local MP Vince Cable.

Finding somewhere in the borough to build a new super-stadium - to compete with the biggest clubs in Europe in terms of attendances and matchday revenue - will become more acute over the next few years.

WILL THIS AFFECT JOSE MOURINHO’S ROLE?

Mourinho was used to being the main man in his first period in charge at Chelsea, but he accepted a different set of conditions and criteria when he returned to the club at the start of last season. 

He reports to the football club board now and they make the big decisions in terms of policy. Mourinho has his say, but his job is to coach the team and make transfer recommendations.

MARINA GRANOVSKIA WILL ASSUME 'ADDITIONAL EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES' - WHO IS SHE?

Abramovich’s former PA. She has been close to a number of players in the past and has been on texting terms with them, which is not unusual for a modern-day executive.

ANY WORD ON A LONG-TERM SUCCESSOR?

Marina Granovskaia. Her time is now.
