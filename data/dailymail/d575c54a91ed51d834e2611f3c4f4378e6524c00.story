A former cheerleader who reached 16 stone after giving up on her exercise regime has shed almost six stone in just 18 months - and landed a spot in the final of a modelling contest.

Jaime Anglin saw her weight soar after she left school where she had always been an active member of the track and cheerleading teams.

But with her active days behind her, the 31-year-old admits she became complacent and began to eat what she wanted without paying any attention to her health.

Back to her former glory: Jamie, left, has reached the finals of lingerie brand Curvy Kate's modelling contest after shedding six stone. Right, she was fit and slim at school but saw her weight soar to 16 stone after she left

Ballooned: Jaime, 31, reached 16 stone after leaving school - and exercise - behind and overindulging in unhealthy foods

It wasn’t until Jaime, from 
Marysville in Michigan, USA, outgrew all her clothes that she became 
uncomfortable with her image and decided she needed to shed some weight.

After
slimming down to 10 stone Jaime, now with a newly slender body and 32F breasts, entered the Star In A Bra competition held by British full bust lingerie brand Curvy 
Kate.

Full-time mother Jaime, who has two children Mia, aged four, and Kara, 18 months, said:

'Keeping
in shape stopped being part of my daily routine so I got lazy - I 
didn’t pay attention to what I was eating. I just ate whatever I wanted 
when I wanted it.

'At
my heaviest I reached 220lbs aged 30 and in the end finally snapped and
grew tired of way I looked - I grew out of all my clothes.

Athletic: Jamie at Marysville High School aged 17 in 2000

'I
felt uncomfortable where when I was at Marysville High School I was 
always active. So I decided I needed to pick that up again at find the 
activity in my life I knew would help me stay in shape.

'I
picked up some fitness DVDs and slowly worked my way up to running 5k 
races before signing up for swimming classes and then eventually 
entering my first triathlon in the summer.

'Within 18 months I managed to lose 80lbs and felt great again - now I look for exercise to get me through my day.'

Jaime found Curvy Kate lingerie - which offers D-K cups - on Facebook while searching for places to find underwear for curvy women and spotted their ‘Star in a Bra’ competition.

She added: 'I’m always looking for bras which will fit me and look cute and eventually began learning more about the company and how it encourages people to love their bodies no matter what.

'When I saw the competition I thought I’d be a good candidate for the company - I wanted to celebrate my accomplishment and my new body so thought I’d go for it.

'I would love to win as I feel I could be an inspiration to other mums who might feel their bodies are ruined after giving birth.

And I also want to set a good example for my daughters as a lot of images of women in the public eye are unrealistic - I hope they would be proud of me.

'My husband Chris loves me no matter what size I am but we’re both excited about how much weight I’ve lost because I’m more beautiful when I’m confident.'

Hannah Houston, marketing manager for Curvy Kate, said: 'The world is made up of different shapes and sizes and we feel not all sizes are represented.

'We want all our customers to feel that they are being catered for and that being above a D cup and curvy is something to be proud of.'

Voting for the next Star in a Bra begins on November 12 and ends at midnight on November 19.

The winner will be announced on November 21 and will gain a 12-month modelling contract with Curvy Kate and a year’s supply of Curvy Kate lingerie.
