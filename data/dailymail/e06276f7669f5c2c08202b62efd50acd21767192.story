regular troops are forbidden to play an active role in political organisations

Serving
 members of Britain's Armed Forces have secretly joined a pacifist 
organisation directly opposed to war and the carrying of weapons, The 
Mail on Sunday can reveal.

In a remarkable breach of military law, 
members of the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy have joined Veterans
 For Peace UK, which campaigns against armed conflict.

It also 
campaigns to stop the UK Government 'intervening in the internal affairs
 of other nations' and has organised protests at the Cenotaph on 
Remembrance Day as well as visits to schools to teach pupils the 'true 
nature' of armed conflict.

Last night there were calls for the 
Ministry of Defence to launch an investigation over fears the group's 
members will seek to undermine discipline in the Forces.

Veterans For
 Peace UK founder Ben Griffin, 36, refused to nameÂ  the troops because 
they would face disciplinary action if their identities were known. Mr 
Griffin, who resigned from the Special Air Service (SAS) in protest over
 its role in secret US operations in Iraq, said: 'While retired troops 
are free to declare their membership, those in uniform are not. They 
would almost certainly face official sanction, and perhaps personal 
reprisals that may threaten their safety.

'These men have taken the 
brave step of joining us because they have come to the conclusion that 
war is not the answer to our problems.

'Given the issue with Queen's 
Regulations and membership of political organisations we were not 
actively seeking to recruit serving troops. But we were not going to 
turn them away and will not do so in future.'

Under these 
regulations, regular troops are forbidden to play an active role in 
political organisations. But Mr Griffin confirmed the troops had done 
so.

In the past year, the group - which was founded in the US by 
veterans of Vietnam and has 120 UK members - has undertaken fasts in 
solidarity with prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and highlighted 'lies' told 
by the Army in recruitment campaigns.

The troops, who are believed 
to include soldiers who saw frontline action in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
have agreed to abide by the group's principle of non-violence and to 
increase public awareness of the costs of war. Veterans For Peace UK 
also obliges its members never to carry weapons of any kind.

The 
former commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp,
 said: 'The authorities should investigate the group to ascertain 
whether they are encouraging servicemen to break the law by joining.

'It is also wrong for the taxpayer to be paying wages to people whose principles do not allow them to do the job.

'These
 troops should undergo disciplinary procedures and either sever their 
association with the group or cease to serve in the Forces.'

Last 
night an MoD spokesman said: 'If an individual's beliefs were 
incompatible with their commitment to the Army then both the Army and 
the individual would need to consider whether it was appropriate for 
them to continue serving.'
