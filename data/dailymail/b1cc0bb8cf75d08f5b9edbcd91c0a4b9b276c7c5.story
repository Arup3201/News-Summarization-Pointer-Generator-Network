She is the French, Oscar-winning actress who won hearts with her turn as Edith Piaf in Oliver Dahan's La Vie En Rose in 2007.

They are the French luxury fashion brand founded in 1946.

Together they have already formed a beautiful friendship with Marion Cotillard being the face of the Lady Dior leather bag line. And the pair are now taking their relationship one step further as the actress has been invited to design her own handbag for the range.

A behind-the-scenes video released by Dior reveals exactly how the design process for the bag - named The 360 Degree Bag - is coming along.

Naturally, it's in French, but the subtitles tell us that Cotillard will be putting her own personal spin on the Lady Dior arm candy.

She explains in the three-minute video that she is 'torn between a rock and roll type or something extremely simple'.

She goes on to say that she would 
like to put a 'strong Dior symbol on it', and that she 'adores 
houndstooth', quilting, knots and a big letter 'O'.

The short documentary also shows Cotillard getting inspiration from trees, a number of catwalk shows and music.

A statement on Dior's website read: 'She has been the face of the Lady Dior 
bag since 2008, the epitome of a sophisticated and vibrant woman.

'It was, of course, 
completely natural that Marion Cotillard would go on to design her own 
bag, her personal Lady Dior, as modern as it is timeless.'

The 37-year-old is loyal to Christian's company by rarely being pictured wearing any other designer at red carpet events.
