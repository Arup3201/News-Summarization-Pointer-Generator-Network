Kitten, called Nightmare, taken in by animal welfare and put up for adoption

A pet owner has been charged with animal cruelty after he charged at his kitten and kicked it 18 feet in the air through football goal posts before raising his arms for a field goal.

Percy Love, 22, laughed as he was arrested after the assault on the black cat on Monday afternoon.

The man was picked up by police, who witnessed the attack, on the south side of Chicago and was being held on a $50,000 bond.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Love told arresting officers: 'This is my cat, Nightmare. He is tough, we play like that all the time. It’s just a cat.'

Nightmare the kitten was being looked after by the Animal Care and Control workers on the southwest side of the city.

Cherie Travis, executive director of the Chicago animal centre, told CBS Chicago: 'He seems to be doing fairly well. He’s a very, very friendly cat… which somehow makes it all the more unbelievable that somebody would do that.'

Vets were trying to determine if the kitten had any broken bones and then the animal would be put up for adoption. 

Love is set to appear in South Misdemeanor Court on February 1 on a charge of animal cruelty but was being held at Cook County Jail because he violated his parole for a burglary three years ago.
