Manchester City booked their place in the knockout phase of the UEFA Youth League with a 4-2 victory over CSKA Moscow on Wednesday afternoon.

A double from Brandon Barker, plus goals from Jack Byrne and Thierry Ambrose, ensured City preserved their 100 per cent record at Hyde and progressed to the round of 16.

Patrick Vieira's men sit six points clear of closest challengers Roma and can guarantee top spot in Group E with a point in their next fixture, at home to Bayern Munich on November 25.

City won 2-0 in freezing cold Moscow a fortnight ago, courtesy of two Jose Angel Pozo goals, and it was no surprise to see Vieira field pretty much the same team at Ewen Fields.

With qualification at stake, City seized the initiative from the first whistle and gained the lead after just seven minutes.

Barker saw his shot saved by CSKA goalkeeper Ivan Zlobin after cutting in from the left-hand side and Pozo set up Byrne for the simplest of far post finishes.

Cheered on by a sizeable Wednesday afternoon crowd in the Manchester sunshine, City continued to surge forward with Angelino firing over the bar and Olivier Ntcham striking the crossbar with a long-range shot.

City squandered two or three other presentable openings and paid the price when Alexander Golovin tucked away the rebound after his initial effort had been saved at point-blank range by City goalkeeper Angus Gunn.

The Russian weren't on level terms for long, however, as Barker pounced on a loose ball and sprinted into the box to fire across the keeper and into the far corner.

Zlobin was helpess to keep that one out but he saved at the feet of both Barker and Ntcham before half-time to keep the contest in the balance.

CSKA started the second half brightly and levelled the game at 2-2 five minutes after the break. Timur Zhamaletdinov capitalised on a defensive slip by Gunn and Kean Bryan to score.

City gradually reasserted their authority and retook the lead when Barker tapped home the rebound after Smith-Brown's effort was blocked by a defender.

This time there would be no CSKA fightback and City made sure of the three points - and their passage to the next round - when Ambrose headed in a Javairo Dilrosun cross in stoppage time.
