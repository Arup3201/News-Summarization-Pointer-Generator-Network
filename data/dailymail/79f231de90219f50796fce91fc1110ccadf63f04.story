America’s largest jewelers is facing a massive sexual harassment lawsuit after a dozen women claim they were paid less than men and passed up for promotions. 

Sterling Jewelers, which is the parent company of 12 chains in the U.S. including Jared the Galleria of Jewelry and Kay Jewelers, is accused of gender discrimination in its pay and promotion practices since 2003. 

Among the 12 is Dawn Souto-Coons, 55, who came across paperwork when she was an assistant manager in 2005 which showed how men were earning more than women.

Speaking to the New York Times, she said: 'I was so mad. It was just an old boys' club.'

The lawsuit also describes a workplace where sexual harassment was widespread. 

Maria House, a former saleswoman at a Kay store in California, says an assistant manager would announce that he had a 'reward' for her, opening his legs and telling her to sit on his lap.

However, Sterling says the claims are without merit and that employees who violated discrimination and harassment policies had been disciplined.

Sterling is based in Akron, Ohio, and has 1,400 stores in 50 states. 

It is a subsidiary of Signet Jewelers, which is based in Bermuda and has 500 stores in Britain.

Months after Ms Souti-Coons discovered men were being paid more, she quit but made sure she took copies of the records with her.

The lawsuit also claims how a plaintiff was asked to write a complaint about a male employee sexually harassing another female employee but then discovered her report was watered down and the male employee was promoted.

In 2009, the civil rights division of the Department of Law and Public Safety in New Jersey found Sterling knew or should have known about harassment reported by a woman who said her manager had 'rubbed up against her'. 

The lawsuit also details a company meeting when CEO Mark Light 'jumped into a swimming pool with female managers who were in "various states of undress." '

One situation also noted in the complaint involves a rape case. 

A manager was assaulted by another manager in a Florida hotel room during an annual meeting in 2003.

In the wake of that case, a third manager, the victim's hotel roommate and a witness, was fired, accused of withholding information from company management, according to a complaint she filed.

The dispute with the company is described in the roommate's 2004 lawsuit against Sterling. 

Months after the assault, the roommate was called to the firm's headquarters, 200 miles from where she worked, and asked personal questions about her sex life, according to her suit. 

Eight days later, she was fired. 

The woman sued for invasion of privacy and wrongful termination.

Sterling won a court fight that kept her case in private arbitration. The case went to mediation and was settled.

A Sterling spokesperson told the Times that women are fairly represented in sales clerk, assistant manager, and manager positions in all of the company's store, saying, 'Fairness, equal opportunity and respect for our female employees — and all employees is central to who we are.'
