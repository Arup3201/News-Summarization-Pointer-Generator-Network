Taken from the edge of a scyscraper, hundreds of feet above the ground, these images offer an extraordinary glimpse into life among the enormous buildings in the desert city of Dubai.

With its gleaming buildings reaching for the skies and its vast network of roads and transport links on the ground, the UAE capital certainly appears to live up to its nickname, the 'City of Gold'.

The pictures, which include incredible shots of the First Interchange road junction as well as the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, were captured by a group of Russian tourists.

The group were previously responsible for capturing the views from the top of Egypt's famous Giza Necropolis, according to English Russian.

The latest pictures, published on the group's blog, show some daredevil photography, as they stand on ledges hundreds of feet above the ground to capture the revealing images.

The images also show a side to Dubai less familiar to many - people playing cricket in the desert on the outskirts of the city, along with some of the poorer residents in the area.

There are also shots of people sunbathing on balconies, along with impressive pictures of some of the world's most famous hotels.

Oil-rich Dubai is home to the tallest building in the world, the 2,722-foot Burj Khalifa, and the city is about to begin building works on the world's largest Ferris wheel on a fake island off its coast.

Last week MailOnline reported how a group of Russian tourists waited until official visiting hours were over at Egypt's famous Giza Necropolis, before scaling the enormous Great Pyramid as the sun began to set.

The Russians managed to escape the attention of security guards at the ancient site, allowing photographer Vitaliy Raskalov to snap pictures of the surrounding desert and the majestic Sphinx from the top of the 455ft structure.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one to remain largely intact.

It is thought to have been built as a tomb for an ancient Egyptian pharaoh over a period of around 20 years up to 2560BCE.

Officials
 in Egypt put a stop to people attempting to climb the pyramids in the 
1980s, but it thought some guides will still take tourists part of the 
way up the structures in exchange for bribes.
