Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has revealed he is 'enjoying learning to adapt' playing in a more central role following his magnificent solo goal against Chelsea.

The 20-year-old ghosted past Nemanja Matic and Gary Cahill on his way to netting a brilliant individual goal past Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois during the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday night.

Sterling was deployed in a central role up top by Brendan Rodgers against Chelsea, as he has been in recent weeks, and the England international has started to thrive with the added responsibility.

And the challenges of adapting to the 3-4-2-1 formation employed by Rodgers have excited Sterling in recent weeks.

He told the Liverpool Echo: 'It's a role that I am learning and adapting to, but if you want to be a good player, it is something you've got to do, you've got to adapt and play in different positions.

'I want to learn as much as I can, and I'm enjoying it at the moment. It's good for me.'

Chelsea went ahead at Anfield when Eden Hazard converted from the spot following a foul by Emre Can on the Belgian forward.

But Sterling's memorable solo strike ensured Liverpool head to Stamford Bridge for next week's second leg all square in the tie at 1-1 - although the Reds could and probably should be visiting west London with a lead.

And the England forward is hoping he can continue playing up top with such responsibility next week. 

Sterling continued: 'I want to get on the ball as much as possible. As long as it's not too high in the air, I will fight for it and try to make something happen.

'It's good to play with players like Adam (Lallana) and Philippe (Coutinho) who like to get on the ball and try to create for you. I enjoy being on the receiving end of their great play and trying to finish off the chances they create.'
