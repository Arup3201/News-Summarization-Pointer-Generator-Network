A father has made surgical  history by having his face reconstructed by 3D printers.

Stephen Power suffered terrible  injuries in a motorbike accident 18 months ago, fracturing his skull and breaking both cheek bones, his jaw, eye socket and nose.

After early operations the 29-year-old still had a lopsided face and collapsed cheek – and feared he would never have the confidence to appear in public again.

After: He has now made surgical history after having his skull reconstructed by groundbreaking 3D technology in a world-first operation

However surgeons were too worried to carry out any further procedures in case his eyesight was damaged.

Now revolutions in surgical technology have allowed them to reconstruct Mr Power’s face with 3D-printed titanium implants – thought to be the first operation of its kind anywhere in the world.

Despite wearing a crash helmet, Mr Power, from Cardiff, spent four months in hospital after the accident.

After preliminary operations, doctors at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, decided they had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face.

Painstaking: The facial models, guides and implants which were all 3D printed by the team at Swansea's Morriston Hospital

Design engineers at Cardiff Metropolitan University used CT scans to create and print a 3D plastic model of Mr Power’s skull and the section of his cheek to be repaired.

A series of 3D-printed cutting guides allowed the surgeons to accurately cut and reposition broken bones.

In the final stage of the eight-hour operation, two printed titanium implants were slotted into Mr Power’s broken eye socket and cheek, and the cutting guides were removed.

His surgeon said: 'Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments'

Dr Dominic Eggbeer, head of  surgical design at the university’s National Centre for Product Design and Development Research, said: ‘It was like solving a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of bone had been  displaced in the accident and had reset in the wrong place. The aim was to cut them apart and then pull them back into place.’

Surgeon Adrian Sugar says the 3D printing made the reconstruction far more accurate than previous methods.

‘The results are in a different league from anything we’ve done before,’ he said.

‘Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments. It made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3D printing came in, and successive 3D printing, because at every different stage we had a model.’

Mr Power's surgeon said he was pleased with the results of the operation, adding: 'Stephen's eye is now a little bit raised, but that might settle over the next few months'

Mr Power, who worked in a bar before his accident, said his face is now almost back to normal.

‘It is totally life changing,’ he said. ‘I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery.’

Mr Power, who used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation, added: ‘I’m hoping I won’t have to disguise myself. I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street.

‘It has just made me look a lot  better. I take my hat off to them.’

Stephen Power was involved in a motorbike crash in September 2012

@highlight

He suffered two broken arms and a badly damaged right leg

@highlight

He also sustained fractured cheek bones and eye sockets

@highlight

His upper jaw and skull were also smashed in the crash

@highlight

He has just had an eight-hour operation to repair his skull and face

@highlight

Medics scanned his face and used 3D printer to produce model of his head

This made it easier for them to plan the surgery and to repair his face
