A restaurant manager died of Deep Vein Thrombosis just hours after flying home from a holiday in the Canary Islands, an inquest heard.

Liz Cooper first started to feel ill while she was staying in a hotel complex in Tenerife with her life-long friend Jennifer Robinson.

The 32-year-old had started to feel better on the flight back to Manchester Airport after the week's holiday in September last year.

But within three hours of landing she was dead after her condition dramatically deteriorated once she arrived home at her house in Wray Crescent, Kendal, Cumbria.

Liz Cooper, 32, died just three hours after landing at Manchester Airport having been on holiday in Tenerife with her life-long friend

The inquest heard how she called her friend in the early hours of the morning complaining of feeling ill having landed at 2am.Family members and medics rushed to her aid, but she died under an hour later.

Alan Sharp, assistant coroner for South and East Cumbria, said the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower leg.But Miss Cooper had also been suffering from a genetic condition known as Factor V Leiden, which also affected her family and may have added to the risk of her suffering DVT.

DVT is when a blood clot forms in a deep vein in the body - usually a leg vein which runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh.

It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.

This is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs.

Each year, one in every 1,000 people in the UK is affected by DVT.

Anyone can develop DVT but it becomes more common with age along with other risk factors.

These include a family history of the condition, other medical conditions such as cancer and heart failure, obesity and inactivity.

Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines or being prescribed compression stockings to wear every day.

Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is a genetically inherited disorder of blood clotting.

It is a Factor V Leiden is a variant of human factor V that causes an increase in blood clotting or hypercoagulability.  

Up to 30 per cent of patients who suffer deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have the condition.

The risk of developing a clot in a blood vessel increases by fourfold to eightfold if a patient is suffering from the condition.

It is a particular gene that is passed on from parents to children.

It can increases your risk of blood clots and many are not aware they suffer from the disorder.

Although it is much less common in non-Europeans the condition is said to affect around one in 20 in the UK.

The condition is said to affect one in 20 people in Britain.

Mrs Robinson said her friend had been fine for the first three days of the holiday, taking part in aqua-aerobics and walking on the beach.

But she became ill, breathless, hot and listless and was prescribed antibiotics by a doctor on the island.

'She seemed fine on the way back. We landed at 2am and were picked up by her dad who took us back to Kendal where he dropped us off at our respective homes,' Mrs Robinson told the inquest.

'About 20 minutes later she rang up to say she was having trouble breathing and could hardly speak. I alerted the family and the ambulance and got dressed to go round. But tragically she had died.'

The inquest heard how 'lively and bubbly' Miss Cooper had previously been diagnosed with DVT in 2011 and had been advised not to fly at this point.

But in 2013 she sought medical advice about flying to Tenerife and she and her GP, Dr John Wood, discussed the need for using the drug Clexane, an anticoagulant.

The inquest heard that the GP told her that the Factor V Leiden condition she suffered from made her four to eight times more likely to suffer DVT.

The evidence about its benefits and risks seemed uncertain, the doctor said in a statement to the inquest at Kendal County Hall, and he said it was Miss Cooper who decided not to use it.

He advised her to use in-flight stockings, take aspirin either side of the flight, take lots of liquid and maintain mobility during the flight.

A flight to Tenerife passed without incident in April, the inquest heard, but prior to her second trip of the year she had suffered from migraines and vomiting.

In his summing up Mr Sharp said this may have been the pulmonary embolism may have been in its early stages, and the DVT may even have been spontaneous.

He had originally been concerned whether not taking Clexane had contributed to Lizâ€™s death but after seeking medical advice found that the benefits of taking it to prevent DVT were not clearly defined.

Mr Sharp is to write to the National Institute for Health and Care Efficiency (NICE) and the General Medical Council urging them to produce a leaflet outlining the risks and symptoms of the condition, which is a genetic predisposition to blood-clotting.

He said it should be given to all members of a suffererâ€™s family.
