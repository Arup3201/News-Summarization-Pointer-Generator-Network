A school prefect killed himself after going on a three-day drink and drugs binge with a new circle of friends.

Declan Edwards, 16, swallowed huge quantities of amphetamines and Ecstasy tablets as part of a plan to stay awake and party with the group for a whole weekend.

But the teenager was unaware of the effects such a binge would have on his mind and on the Sunday afternoon he slipped away from the group and vanished in secluded woodland.

Declan Edwards, pictured left and right, was found hanged after a 'mad weekend' in which he and three friends binged non-stop on drink and drugs, an inquest heard

The popular schoolboy was found hanged four days later following a major police search.

An inquest
 into his death heard that Declan, who attended Unity College in 
Burnley, was ‘a popular, loving and affectionate’ boy who had a Saturday
 job at Burnley Football Club and had been selected for a Btec diploma 
in sport.

Tragedy 
struck in May, just days after he met the new group.

Declan told his 
family he was sleeping over at a friend’s grandmother’s house before the
 four boys went out and bought 35 Ecstasy pills and up to five grams of 
amphetamines on a Friday night.

They washed down the tablets with cider 
bought from a petrol station. The four boys – Declan, Lewis Clarke, 
Jordan Kaye and Charlton Nowell – then wandered around town attending 
house parties all night.

At around 9am on the Saturday they went into Burnley town centre and spent several hours in a park.

Declan briefly returned home to get changed and eat, before the boys got together again.

That evening they went to buy more drugs at a house and Declan emerged with around ‘ten to 15 tablets’, the inquest heard.

Charlton 
said he saw Declan ‘bombing’ amphetamines – taking them orally – in 
Rizla cigarette papers and drinking cider and vodka. Declan’s close 
school friend, Trafford Brotherton, 16, saw him at around 1am on Sunday 
and claimed he looked ‘a mess’.

The group went to another party that night and then went back to the park on the Sunday morning.

At around 
2pm Declan said he was going home. ‘He was still off his head but he 
appeared to have a bit more sense now,’ said Charlton.

One of the boys Declan Edwards, pictured, was with described the youngster as looking 'completely out of it'

Declan left but did not return home and his body was found days later. His mother Mandy Edwards, 42, said she had not been aware he had taken drugs recreationally.

She added: ‘He did not intend to end his life, definitely not. When it was explained what was in his system, that is what has contributed to him ending his life. Declan was happy. He had always been involved in helping people. He was a very positive young man.’

Toxicology tests revealed Declan had taken amphetamines, cannabis and MDMA. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Richard Taylor said he did not believe Declan had intended to take his own life.

Declan's close college friend Trafford Brotherton, 16, who was not involved in the binge said the teenager had been 'very excited' about his sport diploma and about finishing his school exams and attending their prom

The coroner described Declan Edwards as 'a son who had an awful lot to live for, very popular, loving, well liked, a young man who had a lot of friends and a very lovely family'
