Charges have been dismissed against a West Virginia man accused of torturing his wife, in part because the woman denied the allegations and refused to cooperate with prosecutors.

On Monday, Stephanie Lizon had a joyful reunion with her husband, Peter, outside the Jackson County Courthouse in Ripley, holding their 4-day-old baby daughter in her arms.

About a year ago, Mrs  Lizon fled from her husband and told domestic violence shelter workers she had been captive for the better part of a decade — beaten, burned and shackled.

The woman even claimed at one point that she had delivered a stillborn baby while she was being held captive.

Peter Lizon, 40, was arrested and charged with malicious wounding and domestic battery.

Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Evans tossed out those charges. Lizon's attorneys contended authorities waited too long to prosecute him and said the original prosecutor who brought the charges had a conflict of interest.

‘It feels good to have this hurdle behind us,’ Mr  Lizon said. ‘But we have a long way to be done with this.’

Mason County Prosecuting Attorney Craig Tatterson, who is serving as a special prosecutor, left open the possibility for future charges, saying the case was still under investigation.

Tatterson also requested the charges be dropped, saying there wasn't enough evidence. In court documents, Tatterson said Stephanie Lizon denied the allegations against her husband and refused to cooperate.

He also said the couple was the victim of an overzealous prosecution and unfounded stories by people who don't know them.

The original prosecutor, Kennad Skeen, removed himself from the case last month due to a conflict of interest because he previously represented the Lizons in criminal and civil matters.

'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies

Last July, Mrs Lizon fled from her husband while at an equipment rental company, looking gaunt and limping.

When
she told staff she was trying to escape, an employee gave her the 
number for a domestic violence shelter and cash for a cab ride.

At
the shelter, Stephanie Lizon told of being held captive. The criminal 
complaint said she had ‘mutilated and swollen’ feet, and dozens of 
photographs showed burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying 
pans. She also had scars on her wrists and ankles.

Peter
Lizon, a native of the Czech Republic, was under home confinement while
awaiting trial and barred from having contact with his wife.

The judge allowed Lizon to be present for the birth of their daughter last week.

Stephanie
delivered a baby girl on her husband's farm last Thursday. The couple 
named the newborn Bozena, which means 'from God' in Slovak, WV Metro News reported.

On
Monday, another judge removed the restrictions against the Lizons 
seeing each other, and the couple was together with the baby outside the
courthouse.

‘That's a great
relief to see these charges dismissed,’ Stephanie Lizon said. ‘We've 
been waiting for this for a very, very long time.’

Earlier
this year, the Lizons were arrested on charges they violated a custody 
order for their 2-year-old son, Mojmir. Stephanie Lizon's parents in 
Alexandria, Virginia, now have custody of him. A custody hearing is set 
for Friday.

Stephanie Lizon said ‘the celebration can't really happen until we have our son back with us.’

The
Lizons' home on their Jackson County farm burned to the ground in May 
and three people were charged with arson. Stephanie Lizon said the home 
remains off limits because of the arson investigation, although the 
family remains on the property.

‘This
certainly was an interesting year for us and very hard,’ Peter Lizon 
said. ‘We pretty much lost everything we had and then some. We're ready 
to rebuild and start our life over, I guess.’

Lizon's wife escaped the house of horrors on July 2 and hid in a Zumba dance facility while her husband was running an errand

Mrs
Lizon arrived at the shelter in Leroy, West Virgina, with mutilated 
feet and burns on her back that appeared to have a come from a frying 
pan.

But last July, 
she claimed that her feet were injured in a farming accident and the 
frying pan injuries were frrm accidental contact during an argument with
her husband.

She said: 'It was an accident. My husband and I were arguing. We collided with each other.'

When
she was shown a picture of her foot injury - allegedly caused when her 
husband intentionally ran over her - she said farming was dangerous and 
her husband did not know the tractor was close to her feet.

She said she did not seek medical treatment. 'I didn't think it warranted it,' she testified.

However prosecutor Katie Casto said the causes of the bruises were obvious.

Mrs Lizon fled her husband while they returned farm tools to a rental shop.

Staff at 
Bosley Rental & Supply said she came into their office while her 
husband was in another part of the building and told the staff: 'I'm 
trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few 
minutes.'

Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want
to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic 
violence shelter and called it, the store employee said.

She also called family to ask for 
money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a
Western Union office and the shelter.

The
woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the 
store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad.

The employee also told investigators that 
the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her 
her husband had broken her fingers.

Mr Lizon did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said.

At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint.

The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account:

She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan.

She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things.

The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room.

The
wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child 
while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm.

Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention.

She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh.

The complaint says investigators 
confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's
Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to 
document her injuries.

Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were 
arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for 
cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet.

Court records also show that Mrs 
Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore 
County. She pleaded guilty and got probation.
