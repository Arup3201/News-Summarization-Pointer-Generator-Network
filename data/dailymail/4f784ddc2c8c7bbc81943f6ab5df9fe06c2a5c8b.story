Everton's Steven Pienaar has given his heartfelt thanks to first coach and mentor Cavin Johnson in an emotional video posted on YouTube.

The clip, created by BarclaysFootballTV, shows a clearly grateful Pienaar welling up as he explained about his early life in South Africa, and admits that he owes a lot to the man who nurtured him through the early stages of his footballing career.

Midway through the video, Pienaar is asked what he would say to Johnson if he were in front of him at that moment, and the player's response is then played to his former coach.

The two men have clearly been through a lot together, and Johnson claimed: 'We've both helped each other grow. I'm very proud of you - you've become a superstar.'

Pienaar explains: 'I've always had a dream to play in the Barclays Premier League, but without coach Cavin Johnson I don't think I would have reached my potential.'

The Everton winger went on to describe his early years living in South Africa: 'I grew up on the south side of Johannesburg. Single mother, two brothers, one sister - a very poor town.

'There were a lot of drive-by shootings going on, a lot of innocent people got shot.'

Pienaar moved to Ajax in 2001, a move orchestrated by Johnson. The player, still young at the age of 19, was asked by the Dutch club if he had anyone who could help with the details of his contract.

Clearly emotional at this point, the South African explains that there was only one man he wanted to assist him - his father-figure Johnson.

Most footballers have someone they owe some of their success to - be it a father, or a father-figure - but Pienaar's coach Johnson seems to have had a bigger impact than most.
