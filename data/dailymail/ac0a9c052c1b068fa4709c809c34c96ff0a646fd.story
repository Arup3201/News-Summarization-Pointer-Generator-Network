Take off your helmet and put away your battleaxe - if you really want to live like a Viking you can now buy your own ship.

The Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, is now offering a number of Viking ships for sail, ranging from a ‘modest’ €33,000 (£27,000 and $72,000) to a slightly more expensive €400,000 (£325,000 and $545,000).

The longboats are each individually crafted and allow you to experience the sea like the Norse warriors of old.

Want to own a Viking ship? Now you can, thanks to a museum in Denmark, which is building authentic longboats (pictured) for anyone who wants to purchase one. They cost up to £325,000 ($545,000) and allow you to enjoy the same mode of transport used by the Vikings 1,000 years ago

The ships are meticulously built to mimic those used by the Vikings who inhabited Scandinavia from about 700 to 1100 AD.

Viking ships were fairly advanced for their time - they were swift and nimble, allowing for raids on coastal areas across western Europe.

The open decks sometimes supported crews of up to 60 men, ready to plunder various unsuspecting towns before moving on to another target.

The replica ships are built in the museum’s boatyard.

According to the museum, the price depends on the production method requested.

They say they can produce completely authentic longboats built in the same way Vikings would have done over a millennium ago.

This includes ‘felling and preparing the timber from the forest, with tools that existed during the Viking area’ they write on their website.

For example, the saw was not even invented during the Viking times, meaning they had to build their ships through other methods.

However, the museum admits they use a combination of modern and Viking tools to make the ships while still retaining the ‘quality and appearance’ of a ship from the Viking Age.

The boats are individually crafted using similar tools and methods employed by the vikings from 700 to 1100 AD. However, the museum admits that some modern tools are used in order to speed up the process slightly as, for example, the saw was not even invented in the time of the Vikings

Viking longboats were swift ships that allowed warriors to quickly mount attacks against coastal towns and villages, plundering what they could and then moving onto the next target before local forces had time to react, making Vikings adept pillagers of their era

‘Vikings are popular like never before,’ said marketing director at Culture Nordic Anders Røge, reports the Copenhagen Post.

‘That’s why we have no doubt that an authentic Viking ship online will fulfil a childhood dream for private persons and companies - whether it's for a weekend cruise or a spectacular marketing statement.’

Culture Nordic is affiliated with the museum and committed to creating authentic items like this.

'Our philosophy is quite simple. Why buy a plastic sword, when you can
 buy a hand crafted, authentic nordic sword for collectors or children –
 at the same price?' says the company on their site.

Now you can be a Viking too: Included with each boat are replica oars and sails similar to what the Vikings would have used, enabling shoppers to relive the adventures of these Norse seafarers
