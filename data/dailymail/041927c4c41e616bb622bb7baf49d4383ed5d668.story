Josh Beaumont may have to wait a while to become a team captain on A Question of Sport, but in many ways he is already emulating his father, Bill, as a rugby player.

The 22-year-old Sale No 8 has been a successful skipper at Twickenham, led a national side and made the unorthodox transition from tall fly-half to athletic and skillful forward. 

Following in his dad’s footsteps all the way to England and Lions recognition will require this season’s giant strides to continue for some time at club level, but the youngest of three Beaumont brothers is showing considerable promise.

Last month, his outstanding performances for the Sharks were rewarded with a new two-year contract — as further proof that his alternative route into the game has served him well. Instead of the modern staple of graduating from an academy, Beaumont Jnr played for Fylde in National League One before completing a Geography degree at Durham University, which significantly enhanced his rugby development and left some impressive entries on his c.v.

It led him to the national stadium and later to the role of England Students captain. ‘I was captain of my uni team in the final year and we went unbeaten that season,’ said Josh. ‘I had a very successful three years up there and played at Twickenham three times. We beat Cardiff Met twice — in my first and third year — but we lost to Hartpury College in the second year. That was our one defeat in my three years there.

‘It was a great experience playing at Twickenham and hopefully I’ll be back there some day. In the final year, because I was captain, I collected the trophy. My dad was there on the front row but it wasn’t him who presented it to me.’

Having a familiar rugby name has not always been a blessing. When he was younger, Josh felt being a Beaumont meant he was vulnerable to unfair suggestions of nepotism, but over time he has found his father’s background helpful. 

‘When I was younger it was probably a bit of a burden because people would say, “You’re only playing because of your dad”,’ he said. ‘But when you get to this level, you can’t bluff your way through and people understand that. I still get some comments but I just ignore them. It is beneficial because he knows a lot about the game and offers advice, but doesn’t get too involved.’

The game is very different now compared to when Bill was a Grand Slam-winning national icon in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Father and son have enjoyed light-hearted comparisons between their eras. ‘I’ve watched a couple of his games and it’s completely different,’ said Josh.

‘Some of the stories he comes out with, about old-school rugby… you wouldn’t get away with it now! It’s quite amusing to watch, but I haven’t seen many of his games because it was so long ago — 10 years before I was born.’

The game is much cleaner these days than it was in Bill’s pomp. ‘Back then, you would have had players sent off every five minutes if there had been all the cameras and replays there are now,’ said Josh. ‘Dad jokes that it was tougher in those days and I wouldn’t have lasted five minutes in the Seventies and Eighties!’

Having played rugby at Fylde — his dad’s old Lancashire club — since the age of seven, Josh relished the chance to work with Brian Ashton and Jason Robinson when he broke into the first team as a teenager.

By then, he had been advised that his physique was more conducive to playing in the pack, rather than the back-line. ‘When I got to about 16, the coaches suggested I moved into the forwards,’ he said. ‘Before, I was probably the tallest fly-half around — it got a bit ridiculous after a while!’

While his role as RFU chairman and the family textile business keeps him busy, Bill finds time to watch Josh most weekends — as well as older brother Sam, who still plays at Fylde. He is full of paternal pride but plays down his role in his son’s rugby education. 

‘He has done really well this season, after missing most of last season with injuries,’ he said. 

‘Josh is the youngest of three boys, so whatever games were being played on the lawn he had to get stuck in with older brothers and I think that has helped him. He’s always been a good sportsman, a good ball-player and once he moved into the forwards, he has made great progress.

‘I just try to give him some advice, that’s all. I was quite keen that he did his degree before going into rugby full-time. He really enjoyed university rugby and was lucky to be at Durham when they had a really good team. It meant he got to play at Twickenham three times, which he really enjoyed.’

Bill will be at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry tomorrow to watch Josh play for Sale against Wasps in the Aviva Premiership. One day, he may be able to watch him represent his country at Twickenham — but he won’t burden him with inflated expectation.

‘I don’t want to put any pressure on the lad,’ he said. ‘First, he has to establish himself as a Premiership player and if he does that, who knows what might happen?’
