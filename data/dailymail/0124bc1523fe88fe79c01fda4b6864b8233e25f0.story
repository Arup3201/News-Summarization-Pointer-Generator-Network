Thousands of Jordanians have marched through the capital of Amman calling for the immediate execution of six Islamic State prisoners following the horrendous death of captured Jordanian pilot, Muath al-Kasasbeh.

Gunfire and rioting has also reportedly been witnessed in the Jordanian town of Karak, the hometown of Mr Kasasbeh. Roads have been blocked with makeshift barricades and thick smoke has been seen after locals started to burn tyres. At least one government building has been torched. 

Disgusted protesters took to the streets just hours after the release of a sickening 22-minute-long ISIS video that shows Mr al-Kasabeh being burned alive while he was locked helpless in a cage.

The release of the expertly-edited video - which represents a new level of barbarity from a group notorious for its savagery - has prompted Jordan to announce it would execute all six prisoners convicted of association with ISIS at dawn today, roughly 6.40am (4.40am GMT).

Hundreds of angry Jordanians have marched through the capital of Amman calling for the immediate death of six Islamic State prisoners

Activists took to the streets  to protest and wave their flags in defiance of the shocking video showing the death of a Jordanian pilot

Demonstrators carried signs that read: 'We demand the execution of Islamic State detainees in Jordan' as they marched through Amman

The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', appears to show the captured airman being set alight as the militants, infamous for their barbaric murders, plunged to new depths of depravity.

The footage, filmed from several camera angles, shows the pilot wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is seen being set ablaze.

Flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish.

Within an hour of the 22-minute-long video's publication, Jordan reportedly moved six ISIS-linked prisoners to a jail in the south of the country which is usually used for state executions.

It is understood the execution of Sajida al-Rishawi - the female militant whom ISIS had originally demanded Jordan release in exchange for Kasasbeh - will take place tomorrow morning. Furious demonstrators were tonight chanting ‘we want to execute al-Rishawi’ as they marched.

She is one of six prisoners who have reportedly already been transferred to Sawaqa prison in southern Jordan, where they are expected to spend their final night.

Sajida al-Rishawi: The would-be suicide bomber was condemned to death for her participation in deadly attacks in Amman in 2005. ISIS had offered to spare the life of the Jordanian fighter pilot, Lieutenant Maaz al-Kassasbeh, if she were released. She will reportedly be the first prisoner executed. 

Ziad al-Karbouli: The Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative, also known as Abu Houthiyafah, was sentenced to death for being behind a spate of attacks on Jordanian trucks driving in Iraq in 2007. It is understood he could be killed.

Saad al-Noaimi: An Iraqi national, al-Noaimi was found guilty of being involved in a failed plot to detonate 8.8 pounds of explosives at a luxury hotel in Amman in 2006. 

Muammar al-Jaghbir: There are reports Al-Jaghbir, who was sentenced to death for murdering US diplomat Laurence Foley in 2002, could also be executed. He was previously charged for plotting to bomb the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.

Al-Rishawi is expected to be hanged tomorrow along with five other IS affiliated prisoners.

King Abdullah cut short a visit to the US, before making a statement on Jordanian TV, saying he had received news of the 'martyrdom with sadness and deep sorrow'.

Calling the murder a 'cowardly act of terror', he also pleaded for his countrymen to stand 'side-by-side', vowing that Kasasbeh's death 'would only make us stronger'.

US President Barack Obama says that if the video turns out to be authentic, it would be more evidence of the group's 'viciousness and barbarity.'

He added that the U.S. would 'redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of our global coalition to make sure they are degraded and ultimately defeated,' adding that the footage serves to indicate that 'whatever ideology they are operating out of is bankrupt.'

Prime Minister David Cameron also condemned the 'sickening murder', but said it would only 'strengthen our resolve'.

He said: 'I pay tribute to the dedication and bravery of Lieutenant Moaz al-Kassasbeh, who paid with his life while protecting his country and us all. My thoughts and prayers are with his family tonight at this tragic time.

'These terrorists' brutal behaviour will only strengthen our resolve... We will not stop until these evil extremists and their poisonous ideology are defeated.' 

Following the king’s speech, a photo montage of the Jordanian pilot was shown, accompanied by a melancholic soundtrack of classical music. 

Tomorrow, would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi will be executed along with five other jihadists, an official told Afp. 

'The sentence of death pending on... Iraqi Sajida al-Rishawi will be carried out at dawn," the security official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Rishawi, the would-be bomber, was condemned to death for her participation in deadly attacks in Amman in 2005, and IS had offered to spare the life of the Jordanian fighter pilot, Lieutenant Maaz al-Kassasbeh, if she were released.

'The death sentence will be carried out on a group of jihadists, starting with Rishawi, as well as Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative Ziad Karbuli and others who attacked Jordan's interests,' the security source said.

'Jordan's response will be earth-shattering," Information Minister Mohammed Momani said earlier on television, while the army and government vowed to avenge the pilot's murder.

'Whoever doubted the unity of the Jordanian people, we will prove them wrong,' said Momani, who is also government spokesman.

'The pilot did not belong to a specific tribe or come from a specific governorate, he was the son of all Jordanians, who stand united,' he said. 

Among the other prisoners who are thought to be facing execution tomorrow is Ziad al-Karbouli, who was sentenced to death for being behind a spate of attacks on Jordanian trucks driving in Iraq in 2007.

Also known as Abu Houthiyafah, al-Karbouli was a considered a leading figure under the command of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the deceased former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

Another prisoner is thought to be jailed Iraqi national Saad al-Noaimi. al-Noaimi was found guilty of being involved in a failed plot to detonate 8.8 pounds of explosives at a luxury hotel in Amman in 2006.

Likewise, another close associate of al-Zarqawi, Muammar al-Jaghbir, could also be executed. Al-Jaghbir was sentenced to death for murdering Laurence Foley, a US diplomat in 2002.

Al-Jaghbir, 44, was previously charged along with al-Zarqawi for plotting to bomb the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is also thought to be considering the idea of executing several Islamic State prisoners in retaliation for al-Kasasbeh’s death.

The sickening video has even been criticised by Al Qaeda with Al Qaeda in Arabian Pennisula (AQAP) declaring that the brutality of the execution proves why Al Qaeda and Islamic State do not share the same ideology.

In a short statement, an AQAP affiliated social media account wrote that the burning to death of Moath al-Kasabeh was ‘conclusive prove’ of the ‘deviation’ from Islam by Islamic State.
