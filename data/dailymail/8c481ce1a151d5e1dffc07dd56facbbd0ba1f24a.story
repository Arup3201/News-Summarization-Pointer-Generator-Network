British former police community support officer Andrea Waldeck told an Indonesian court today that smuggling drugs into the country was the 'most stupid decision of my life.'

The 43-year-old former PCSO with Gloucestershire Police had previously pleaded guilty to trafficking crystal meth, often referred to as 'ice', worth more than £3,000 into Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city, in April last year.

Miss Waldeck blamed her 'state of mind' at the time which led to her bringing the 3lbs of ice into the country, resulting in her arrest when police raided her three-star hotel Surabaya hotel.

At an earlier hearing Miss Waldeck, who had worked with the Gloucestershire constabulary, clutched a Bible and twisted rosary beads through her fingers as she heard prosecutors demand that she be sent to jail for 16 years and be fined £100,000.

But today her defence team argued that despite her admission of the crime - smuggling the drugs through customs in her underwear - the case had not been proved because of the duress she had suffered.

The team was referring to Miss Waldeck's claim that an African friend in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, where she had been living after leaving the UK, had threatened her, telling her: 'I'm Nigerian. You know about Nigerians. We kill people.'

Today the defence team said the threat, made by a man called  'Joe', meant that Miss Waldeck could not be deemed fully responsible by law.

Standing before the three judges in a red prisoner's bib, Miss Waldeck then spoke in her own defence.

She apologised to the court for the crime, explaining that her state of mind at the time had led to 'the most stupid decision of my life and one I regret the most.'

Much of the six hour hearing was taken up with complex legal argument and when the court eventually adjourned, Miss Waldeck was told she would continue to be remanded in custody until the next hearing on January 15.

It is then that the prosecution will have the opportunity of responding to the defence plea for leniency.

Despite the prosecution having earlier asked for Miss Waldeck to be sent to prison for 16 years, there is no guarantee that she will receive that sentence. 

Observers said there was still a chance that she could be sentenced to death, as happened with British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, from Gloucester, who is now on death row in a Bali jail, despite the prosecution asking for a 15-year jail sentence.

Miss Waldeck has shown open remorse since her arrest. She said in an earlier Facebook message to friends: 'Your support means the world to me. I'm so very sorry I've disappointed you all.'

Her court appearance today comes just four days after police from Guangzhou raided homes in the city of Lufeng and seized three tons of ice and made 182 arrests.

Police said a massive drug operation had been operating in Lufeng, a notorious drug-producing area.

While there is no suggestion that the drug operation was linked to Miss Waldeck's agreement to act as a drug mule on the flight from Guangzhou to Indonesia, police said that in the past three years, Lufeng - 370 miles from Guangzhou - had provided one third of the crystel meth nationwide.

It has not been revealed whether the drugs seized in the Lufeng raid were for export or domestic consumption.
