A giant Burmese python discovered in the Florida Everglades is believed to be the biggest ever found in the area, measuring more than 18 feet.

Experts believe the monster snake will beat the current record, for the longest python found in the area, which currently stands at around 17ft.

Record-breaker: A giant female Burmese python has been found in the Florida Everglades, prompting experts to speculate it is the biggest ever discovered in the area, measuring more than 18ft

The female reptile was discovered by Bobby Hill, the python control officer for the South Florida Management District on Tuesday, the Miami Herald reported.

The snake carcass is set to be transferred to the University of Florida, where experts working to stop the spread of the invasive species will verify its length and weight after studying the remains.

District spokesman Randy Smith, said: 'It looks to be about 18 feet.

'It could very well be a state record.'

In May last year, snake collector Jason Leon, captured the current record-holder, slicing off the beast's head to subdue the powerful creature.

The Florida Fish and Wild Conservation Commission revealed the female snake measured 18ft 8ins and weighed 128lbs.

Prior to that the largest found in the everglades was a 17ft female Burmese python, which was pregnant with 87 eggs and weighed more than 164lbs.

The everglades' waterways have been found to be home to some of the largest snakes captured in south Florida.

The cold-blooded creatures are often spotted warming their bodies in the sun on rocky embankments.

Giant: Burmese pythons are one of the largest breed of snake in the world

Burmese pythons are among the world's largest snakes, measuring up to 23ft and weighing up to 200lbs, with a girth similar to that of a telephone pole.

The creatures are distinguished by their striking patterned skin.

That combined with their generally docile nature and rapid growth rate make the breed popular among reptile owners.

The snakes are native to jungles and grassy marshes and are commonly found in southeast Asia.

Young snakes are often found in the trees, but as they mature are grow in size tree-climbing becomes more difficult. As a result adults spend most of their time on the jungle floor.

They are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for around half an hour.

Burmese pythons are carnivores and feast on small mammals and birds.

Suffering from poor eyesight, the reptiles rely on chemical receptors in their tongues and heat sensors along their body to detect and hunt their prey.

A member of the constrictor family, the pythons squeeze their prey to death, grabbing at their victims with their sharp teeth before suffocating the animal.

Stretchy ligaments in their jaws enable the breed to swallow their prey whole.

Females lay up to 100 eggs at a time, which they then incubate for two to three months.

The species is on the threatened list, because of persistent hunters targeting the snakes for their skins, as well as the depletion of their natural habitat.

In Florida experts regard the breed as a significant threat to native wildlife. Post mortems on dead snakes have found the breed eat almost anything that lives in the everglades, including aligators.

A study in 2012 suggests the rise in the number of pythons in the area has decimated the park's small mammal population.
