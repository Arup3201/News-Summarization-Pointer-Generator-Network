If you weren't already feeling guilty enough about that Christmas binge, the leading ladies of Hollywood are here to make you sink even further into remorse.

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Cheryl Cole and Katie Holmes have been showing no signs of  turkey tummy as they showcase super-toned bodies on their holidays this Christmas.

But how do they do it? With strict exercise regimes, gruelling alkaline diets and a few regimented treats along the way, that's how.

What's your secret, Jen? Former Friend star Jennifer Aniston showcased a toned body on her holiday in Los Cabos, Mexico

Jennifer Aniston, who displayed her trim physique in a tiny green bikini on holiday in Los Cabos, Mexico, was named the Sexiest Woman Alive in 2011 by Men’s Health magazine and FITNESS magazine’s 'most wanted body' of 2011.

So what's her secret?

Jennifer is reportedly a huge fan of the
 Honestly Healthy Alkaline Programme, which involves eating 
predominantly alkaline foods in an effort to keep the body’s pH between 
7.35 and 7.45. The regime is supposed to heal a variety of ailments in 
addition to aiding weight loss.

Jennifer, 44, is the latest star to try the diet, other fans include 
Gwyneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham and Kirsten 
Dunst.

The ultra-strict regime warns against
 ‘acid-forming’ foods such as starchy grains, vegetables such as 
pasta, wheat and beans, all dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish.

Also banned are tea, coffee, sugar, fizzy drinks including soda and tonic water, and of course, alcohol.

Honed and toned: Jen reportedly follows a strict alkaline diet, has a wellness and yoga instructor and is hooked on 'baby face' drips

Skin secrets: Grazia have reported that the actress is hooked on 'baby face drips', a drip that pumps her with anti-ageing ingredients once a week

The star is also said to be an ardent fan of a £5 'wonder' smoothie - and drinks nothing else on one day every week, usually a Saturday.

A
 source told Grazia: 'The drink is made up of fresh, organic vegetables.
 Beetroot, cucumbers, spinach, garlic, carrots, celery and kale.'

As for exercise, Jennifer is said to have been working with yoga teacher and 'wellness advisor' Mandy Ingber for three to four days a week since 2005.

The duo use a combination of yoga, spinning, and toners to get in shape.

'Part of why Jennifer looks so awesome is her balance. She's a balance of having strength, being toned, and being lean - beautiful but natural,' Ingber told InStyle.

'She works hard, but you also see her taking care of herself. She's a career woman and a relationship person. We should have balance in all aspects of our lives! Always address all aspects of who you are.'

And what about that glowing skin? Grazia have reported that the actress is hooked on 'baby face drips', a drip that pumps her with anti-ageing ingredients at West Hollywood clinic once a week.

Giving Jen a run for her money is best friend and former Friends co-star, Courteney Cox.

She works out: Courteney Cox, who is holidaying with Jennifer, also makes sure she eats healthily, most of the time, and trains with Tracy Anderson

The pair are currently holidaying together and 49-year-old Courteney also paraded an enviable body.

The actress uses the Tracy Anderson Method four times a week. The exercise guru is well known for training the likes of Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson and has gym locations in both the U.S. and the U.K.

The former Friends actress also makes sure she eats healthily - most of the time.

'I do cheat, on occasion, with pasta or bread and butter,' she told the magazine.

'And I do eat a lot of cheese and nuts, which is probably not the best idea.'

Strict regime: Courteney has also been rumour to follow the Blood Group Diet, which operates on the basis that your body responds to certain foods in certain ways, depending on your type

However, normally she eats a light breakfast of just coffee, chicken salad for lunch, and steak, chicken or fish with vegetables for dinner.

Over the years Courteney has also been rumoured to follow the Blood Group Diet, which operates on the theory that your body responds to certain foods in certain ways, depending on your type.

If you are blood group O, the diet advocates eating meat and avoiding dairy and wheat, while blood type A means you are meant to follow a vegetarian diet to keep slim and drop pounds.

Tinseltown's secret weapon? Jennifer, Courteney and Cheryl have all revealed that they follow Tracy Anderson's training method. She is well known for training the likes of Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson

Sharing her philosophy about her body in Gwyneth Paltrow's 2012 Goop newsletter the 49-year-old: said: 'My fitness philosophy is to be active in life and enjoy what I am doing. 'I have always loved exercise and feel that being active is important to maintain not only physical health, but mental health as well.'

Cheryl Cole, who is keeping her fans updated with a series of bikini snaps from her South African holiday, may be famed for her washboard 
stomach slender thighs, but says she doesn't follow a diet 
and swears her favourite food is 'anything sweet'.

Speaking to FeelUnique.com, the brunette songstress said: 'I don’t follow any strict diets, I just 
eat sensibly.

'I’m not eating McDonald’s or pizza every day but I do 
allow myself one cheat day a week, normally on a Sunday.

'I have a really
sweet tooth and love cupcakes, doughnuts. Basically anything that’s 
really bad for you.'

To burn off her sweet treats, the 30-year-old sticks to a gruelling exercise regime.

Cheryl says she also swears by the Tracy Anderson Method to keep her 
body in shape.

Cheryl explained that she uses the Tracy Anderson DVD at home to tone up and help maintain her much-envied abs.

Like Courteney, she has also previously opened up about following the Eat Right 4 Your Type diet, in which she eats 
and avoids specific foods based entirely on her blood type.

Speaking to HELLO! magazine, she said: 'My
mother told me about Eat Right 4 Your Type, in which you're told what
to eat and what to avoid depending on your blood type.

'It has made such
a difference - not so much to my shape, but to how I feel and my energy
levels. Before I was like "energy schmenergy" and didn't believe it. But
now I believe it 100 per cent.'

Stars including Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, Martine McCutcheon
and Sir Cliff Richard have previously admitted to following the plan.

Katie Holmes has admitted in the past to following a strict running regime to maintain her slender figure and she certainly showed off the results of her hard work on Monday.

The
 35-year-old displayed her toned physique as she stripped down to a hot 
pink bikini while lounging poolside with daughter Suri in Miami.

The mother-of-one looked in phenomenal shape, with athletic legs and a flat tummy.

Speaking to OK magazine, a source close to Katie revealed: 'When she wants to slim down for a role, she eats only unprocessed raw vegetables.

'Because
 of the sugar content, she tries not to eat fruit; if she does, she 
usually sticks to berries, because they have the lowest glycemic index.'

On
 a typical dieting day, 'she’ll have carrot soup and a yam for lunch and
 broccoli for dinner, and she’ll keep a handful of raw almonds for a 
snack,' says the source, who adds that the diet is extreme.

'She doesn’t sustain it for long.'

She is also well known for training hard, often spending hours in the gym practicing yoga or attending dance classes.

'I love Bikram yoga. I like the sweat. I feel like it’s good for me and good for my skin,' said Katie, who ran the New York marathon in 2007.

'She’s always been very sporty, but divorce takes all that energy away from you,' a source told Look magazine.

'She’s been focusing less on those aggressive gym workouts and adopting more calming exercise like yoga, Pilates and running.'
