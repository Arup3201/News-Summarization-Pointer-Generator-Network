History was made yesterday as the top three teams in the Premier League crashed out of the FA Cup, capping one of the most remarkable days in the 144-year history of the competition.

Third-tier Bradford City stormed back from two down to beat league leaders Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. 

Reigning Premier League champions Manchester City lost 2-0 at home to the Championship's Middlesbrough, and third-placed Southampton lost 3-2 at home to struggling Crystal Palace.

The greatest shock of the day came in west London where Bradford City - roared on by 6,000 travelling supporters - embarrassed the Premier League leaders.  

Prior to the match, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said it would be 'disgrace' if his side made up of international stars failed to defeat the League 1 outfit.

Chelsea's starting line-up cost around £98 million – Bradford's team of free signings and loan players, just £7,500. Their only player to cost a fee was James Hanson, a former supermarket shelf stacker. 

And with the home side leading 2-0 after 40 minutes, it looked like Mourinho's men would romp to victory. 

But a goal by Football League journeyman Jon Stead shortly before half-time brought Bradford to life and they netted three goals in the last 15 minutes to win 4-2 and send their fans in to delirium. 

They became the first third-tier team to score four against the Blues in 57 years.  

After the game, Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' and 'embarrassed' by his side's fourth-round exit, but went in to the away dressing room after the game to congratulate his opponents.  

'It's a disgrace for a big team to lose to a small team from a lower league. Me and the players must feel ashamed', he said. 

For Bradford, the giant killing is the latest in a series of remarkable recent cup upsets. 

While in the fourth tier of English football, the Bantams defeated Arsenal and Aston Villa en route to the League Cup final in 2013. 

Manager Phil Parkinson told BBC Radio 5 live: 'The lads are absolutely bouncing in that dressing room and what they've done today will be remembered for a very long time - not just in Bradford but all around the country.'

The day was no less embarrassing for Manchester City. 

After squeezing through the last round against lower league opposition, they were underdone by Championship high-flyers Middlesbrough at the Etihad Stadium. 

Patrick Bamford, a loan signing from Chelsea, scored the first and the Spaniard Kike sealed the victory in stoppage time in front of their ecstatic army of travelling fans.  

An incredible round of shocks began on Friday night when League Two Cambridge United held Manchester United to a goalless draw at the derelict Abbey Stadium. 

It continued on Saturday lunchtime as Swansea City exited at the hands of Championship Blackburn Rovers. 

Third-place Southampton were beaten 3-2 at St Mary's by Crystal Palace, managed by their former manager Alan Pardew, while eight-time winners Tottenham were knocked out as  they conceded twice in the closing seven minutes to lose at home to Leicester City. 

Liverpool also failed to beat Championship club Bolton, which saw former Reds Emile Heskey and Jay Spearing return to Anfield. 

The magic of the cup lives on.
