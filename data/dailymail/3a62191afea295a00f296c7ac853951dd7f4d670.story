Bacary Sagna says it 'is now a certainty' that he will be leaving Arsenal this summer.

The full-back was offered terms of £80,000-a-week to remain at the Emirates Stadium after his contract expiry, but has confirmed he has rejected those terms.

'It is no longer a secret, I am leaving Arsenal, it is a certainty,' he told l'Equipe.

'Arsenal made an effort (to keep me), but the discussions did not go in the direction that I wanted.'

At last: Sagna admits it has been tough not lifting trophies with the Gunners, but wouldn't change anything

Sportsmail understands Sagna has all-but-agreed an £150k-a-week deal to join Premier League champions Manchester City.

The French international, who spoke to the media during his country's training camp for the World Cup, would join a host of former team-mates who have swapped the Emirates Stadium.

Samir Nasri, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure have all left in unharmonious fashion, but Sagna thanked Arsenal for all they have done for him during his seven-year stay, and was happy to finish with an FA Cup trophy.

'It was an honor to grow in the shirt,' he added. 'Arsenal is a club that brought me a lot, both as a person and as a sportsman. Even though we had been criticised for quite some time due to the lack of trophies, I spent some magical moments (at Arsenal). If I had to do, I’d do it again.'

'There are a lot of calls, a lot of speculation. Frankly, it gives headaches. I’ll sort it all out that before the start of the World Cup.'

Arsene Wenger was insistent the former Auxerre man would stay at the club, hoping a new three-year deal would convince him.

Even fans chanted: 'Bacary Sagna, we want you to stay,' during his final weeks, and there was a sense that they were resigned to his departure.

Manuel Pellegrini looks set to bring in the 31-year-old, as competition to current right-back Pablo Zabaleta.

Arsenal will now look for an alternative, with the inexperienced Carl Jenkinson currently the only senior deputy at the club.

Serge Aurier, Callum Chambers and Atsuto Yuchida have all been linked, though Wenger has admitted most of the Gunner's transfer activity will be carried out after the World Cup.
