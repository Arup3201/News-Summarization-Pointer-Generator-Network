A New York woman has told how she got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye to set herself apart from the crowd even though the American Academy of Ophthalmology warns against the procedure.

Kristina Kovalevskya is the first New Yorker to visit Dr Emil Chynn at Park Avenue Laser Vision to get a 'cute' heart-shaped sequin, measuring 3.5mm, placed on the white of her of right eye ball.

'I’m a person who likes 
extremes...I want to keep it in my eye as long as possible. I like it, 
but I’m planning to swap it out. I really want to try a new design. 
Every girl wants to try something new,' she told Blackbook.

According to Harvard and NYU-trained Dr Chynn the eye jewelry procedure has been done hundreds of times in Europe and in Los Angeles, but never before in New York. Ms Kovalevskaya was one of his first clients.

To start the process he injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area. Then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry.

“The procedure involves making a very tiny incision in the clear covering of the eye, or skin of the eye,' Dr. Chynn explained.

'The platinum is then inserted. I don’t have to suture it up because it’s so small and it just closes up after three days.'

Using forceps he positioned the tiny flat stud into position on Ms Kovalevskaya's eye membrane. She wanted it set pointing diagonally.

Minutes later she was handed a mirror to admire her new accessory and given the go-ahead to go home.

Though it may sound scary, Dr Chynn insists the procedure, which was invented by a Dutch eye surgeon and introduced in 2004, is actually pretty safe.

'It's
 a very thin piece of platinum that's designed for insertion on the top 
of the eye, it's not in the eye so there's no risk of blindness or 
anything at all,' he says.

'She
 could have a little bit of local bleeding. That could go away in a 
couple days or couple weeks. She could have an infection but we'll 
prevent that with antibiotics.'

But the jewelry has not been FDA approved and the American Academy of Ophthalmology is warning consumers about the dangers.

In a statement to Fox 5, the medical body said there is not 'sufficient evidence to support the safety or therapeutic value of this procedure.'

It urges consumers to 'avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the FDA.'

Wayne Bizer, D.O., a comprehensive ophthalmologist from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida previously warned: 'My concern would be that it might cause foreign body granuloma or scar tissue. 

'The implant could also allow bacteria to
 get beneath the conjunctiva causing a serious vision-threatening 
infection or possibly erode the sclera, the white part of the eye.'

Kovalevskaya decide too get a heart in her eye because she says, 'I'm already a star.'

And if she gets bored of her heart-shaped implant it can be swapped it for something different.

'You can switch from a star for Christmas, for example,' Dr Chynn states on his website, adding that each swap incurs a $1,000 fee.

In addition to putting hearts in women's eyes Dr. Chynn has been contestant on The Millionaire
