It has been hidden for the past year, but now a secret house, built in the middle of a nature reserve has been discovered.

The illegal structure was spotted by deputies when they were patrolling the Tujunga Ponds Wildlife Sanctuary in Los Angeles.

They looked inside and found Robert Downs, 51, who said he had lived in the home for more than a year.

Discovery: The illegal structure was spotted by deputies when they patrolling the Tujunga Ponds Wildlife Sanctuary

He spent eight months building it using material from a 
home repair shop and camouflaged the entire structure by cutting trees 
and using tarp and paint.

Deputies also found two other men inside the crude shed which was equipped with bunk beds, tables, shelves and a rock patio with a barbeque and table.

According to a police news release eight marijuana plants were also discovered growing near the building.

Downs was arrested on suspicion of 
cultivation of marijuana and removing trees from a county park.

He was 
booked at the Inmate reception center in Los Angeles on $30,000 bail, reported NBC Los Angeles.

The two other men -- aged 30 and 45, both Sun Valley residents -- were cited for county code violations and released.

The Tujunga Ponds Wildlife Sanctuary is part of the area patrolled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Parks Bureau.

'It is illegal to be in a Los Angeles County Park after dark, let alone to build a structure and reside there,' according to sheriff's officials quoted in a news release.

'The structure had four bunk beds built into the walls, tables, shelves and even fire extinguishers on the walls. They also had a rock patio in front of the building with a barbeque and tables,' officials said. 

Crews from the county department of public works will remove the structure from the park during the next two weeks, officials said.
