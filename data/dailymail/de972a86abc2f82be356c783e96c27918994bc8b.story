When David Richards, a 34-year-old former stripper from London began to go bald, his confidence was left in tatters.

But while some would have put up with losing their locks, Mr Richards, who now manages the Dreamboys, plumped for an extreme solution - having, what looks like, new hair tattooed onto his head.

'It involves a little bit of pain, a few snuffly moments and watery eyes but the end result is that I look like I’ve got hair,' he explains.

Big improvement: Mr Richards chose to have his head tattooed after comb-overs and caps didn't work

Full head: Mr Richards had a full head of hair during his stripping days and was devastated when it began to thin and eventually fell out

'I had four or five treatments but most people have two. I’m very picky and that’s the beauty of this treatment - you can dictate exactly how you want it.'

Mr Richards, who has managed the Dreamboys stripper troupe for 14 years, had been left miserable and lacking confidence after noticing his hair beginning to thin.

'I had gone completely bald on top,' he remembers. 'I did
 try to comb it over and cover it up. But it got to the point where 
there was nothing else I could do and I just had to shave it off.

'For
 me there is nothing more soul destroying for a man than losing your 
hair - it’s worse than going grey.

'I first noticed it quite some years 
ago when someone at work said to me: “You’re losing your hair” and I said:
 “No I’m not” and he said “Yes you are!”'

'It
 was a very slow process,' he adds. 'You start to get thinner and thinner up top 
and you notice clumps of hair on your pillow in the morning.

'I started 
to wear more and more baseball caps. I was sat in the hairdressers one 
day and I was looking in the mirror and I just thought, “it’s time to 
shave it off".'

Miserable about losing his hair, Mr Richards resorted to baseball caps and comb-overs until bumping into a co-worker whose hair appeared to have mysteriously regrown.

'One of the guys at work had it done,' he explains. 'I 
said to him, “You’ve done something done to your hair” and he denied it 
and denied it but then he eventually told me he’d been to have his head tattooed.

Gone: Mr Richards says he found losing his hair deeply upsetting and had tried to cover it up by wearing caps

Ouch! Mr Richards immediately after having the procedure which he says does make your eyes water a little

I 
was like, “Wow I really like it” and went for a consultation at His Hair Clinic and then I thought let’s rock and roll!'

Like his colleague, Mr Richards had opted for new treatment: a procedure called Scalp Micro-Pigmentation or SMP which costs between £500 and £3000 and involves having tiny blobs of pigment dotted across the scalp to replicate the look of natural hair follicles.

While not as natural as traditional hair transplants, according to fans, SMP is unnoticeable from a distance and can barely be seen close up.

'The results are well worth the pain,' adds a delighted Mr Richards. 'You
 can add numbing cream and take paracetamol, but at the end of the day 
it’s 12 hours of treatment for the rest of your life.

He adds: 'One thing I 
would say is that it does make you sneeze a lot and your nose run [during the treatment] - it’s like having hayfever.'

Improvement: Mr Richards new hair line was created using SMP which involves tiny tattoos all over the scalp

Despite the pain and the sneezing, Mr Richards says having his head tattooed has changed his life for the better.

'I had gone completely bald on top but now it just looks like I’ve shaved my head,' says the Londoner. 'I’ve got that 5 o’clock shadow look.'

He adds: 'I feel so much more confident now and I don’t wear anywhere near as many baseball caps as I used to.

'The biggest thing I’ve noticed is people no longer say I’m bald and if they ever do, I can now just tell them that I shave my head.'
