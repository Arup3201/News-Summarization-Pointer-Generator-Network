For Arsenal to pick up four Premier League points despite not playing particularly well in their first two games of the season is a positive.

But surely Arsene Wenger has seen by now that if Arsenal are to achieve the standard of modern big clubs – Champions League and Premier League success – Per Mertesacker just isn’t up to it.

Just look at what happened in Brazil in the summer.

Struggle: Per Mertesacker battles with Romelu Lukaku at Goodison park on Saturday

Toil and trouble: Mertesacker feels the heat and is booked (right) on a chastening evening for the defender

Germany were looking far from convincing at the World Cup as the quarter final stage approached. Indeed, their game with Algeria was an epic largely because of the Germans’ atrocious defending.

Mertesacker was subsequently dropped and Germany kept a clean sheet against France, going on to win the tournament. Fair play to Joachim Low for showing Mertesacker the respect his 100+ caps warrants by putting him on for the final few minutes of the final at the Maracana – a touch of class.

The truth might hurt, but Mertesacker’s flaws are obvious. And Arsenal fans saw him struggle again at Goodison Park on Saturday.

If he were English, he would be getting absolutely hammered by everyone right now.

Mertesacker has had a great career, with lots of international caps, but it must hurt that after several near-misses – semi finals and a final – Germany only crossed the line and won a major tournament after he was eventually dropped.

I’m afraid it looks like a pattern Arsene Wenger will have to copy, if he’s got the guts to do it.

Mertesacker has won over the fans at the Emirates over by berating team-mates who he feels aren’t doing their best for Arsenal. 

Remember him scolding Mesut Ozil and jabbing his finger towards his fellow German’s face for not applauding the travelling Gunners fans after the 6-3 defeat last season. Fans love that sort of thing, but observers can see through the chest-beating, badge-kissing exhibitionism for what it is. 

Maybe Ozil should have been at the front of an orderly queue to berate Per on Saturday after Steven Naismith’s goal. 

What do Arsenal want to achieve? They don’t want to just win the FA Cup – they want to win the title after 10 years in the Premier League wilderness, and they want to win the Champions League. They can’t do that with Mertesacker at the back.

It’s a tough thing to say about a guy who seems like a decent guy, and probably plays to the best of his ability. But can the Gunners afford to carry him on their journey back to the top of the English game while they explore unchartered territory for Gooners in Europe?

Glory: Mertesacker was part of the Germany squad that won the World Cup in Brazil

Truth hurts, but truth is Mertesacker isn’t good enough for what Arsenal want to achieve.

Wenger can do the classy thing and follow Low’s lead – keep sticking the big flopping German on the bench week in week out, or stick him in the Gunnersaurus costume to give him time on the pitch at the Emirates.

But as a first choice centre half at a top Premier League club, he’s doing a great job of making Igor Stepanovs look like Tony Adams. Auf Wiedersehen Per.
