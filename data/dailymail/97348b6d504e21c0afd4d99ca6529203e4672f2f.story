It's a nuisance to some and a golden key to others but the Europa League features four British sides ahead of the draw for the last 32.

For the first time this season, winning the tournament offers a Champions League place so there is plenty of incentive for Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Celtic to go all the way and try and win the competition.

Here, Sportsmail gives you a guide to their European exploits so far and who they can face in Monday's draw for the last 32 when the competition resumes in February.

Liverpool

Group placing: Third (Champions League - unseeded)

Last five seasons:

2013-14: Did not qualify

2012-13: Last 32 (vs Zenit)

2011-12: Did not qualify

2010-11: Last 16 (vs Braga)

2009-10: Semi-finals (vs Atletico Madrid)

Who can they face?

Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Besiktas, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit.

Odds to win Europa League: 14/1 

When Liverpool fans dreamed at the start of the season of playing in the knockout stages of Europe, this probably wasn't what they quite had in mind.

But in a  disastrous Champions League campaign, the Reds finished behind Real Madrid and Basle in the group and it means they drop into the Europa League last 32 as opposed to moving into the last 16 with the rest of Europe's elite.

To make matters worse, their one win, which came on the opening matchday in fortunate circumstances against minnows Ludogorets, means that with just five points they will be one of the unseeded teams heading into the last 32 draw.

Basle may have pipped Liverpool by two points thanks to a final day draw at Anfield, but Liverpool's poor record in this year's Champions League compared to other third-placed teams means that despite being joint third-favourites, they will have to win the Europa League the hard way from an unseeded position.

Steven Gerrard and Rickie Lambert stand dejected following Basle's opening goal during their final day Champions League game at Anfield. In a must-win game to progress, the Reds could only draw 1-1

Liverpool's failure to beat Basle in their final Champions League  game resulted in them finishing third place in their group and a diverted European path into the Europa League last 32 as an unseeded team

Tottenham

Group placing: Runners-up (unseeded)

Last five seasons:

2013-14: Last 16 (vs Benfica)

2012-13: Quarter-finals (vs Basle)

2011-12: Group stage

2010-11: CL quarter-finals (vs Real Madrid) 

2009-10: Did not qualify

Who can they face?

Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit

Odds to win Europa League:  14/1 

While Tottenham rarely looked like being knocked out at the group stage of the Europa League, performances in Europe this season have often left fans frustrated rather than purring with delight.

Aside from a wonder Erik Lamela rabona goal against Asteras, Spurs haven't sparkled. Nervous wins away at the Greek outfit as well as at home to a poor Partizan Belgrade side have done nothing to convince supporters they can go all the way in this competition.

With Besiktas offering the only measure of a competent side in their group, Spurs were fortunate to get a point at White Hart Lane, before offering very little in their last day 1-0 defeat in Istanbul which decided top spot in the group.

Mauricio Pochettino's habit of mass changes and picking a reserve side has obviously had an effect, but it's hard to see Spurs progressing far in this competition if they don't drastically improve. Despite this, they are still joint third favourites to lift the trophy in Warsaw come May.

Tottenham sealed qualification for the last 32 with a match to spare, but blew the chance to top the group and finish as a seeded team following a last-day 1-0 loss at Besiktas

Everton

Group placing: Winners (Seeded)

Last five seasons:

2013-14: Did not qualify

2012-13: Did not qualify

2011-12: Did not qualify

2010-11: Did not qualify

2009-10: Last 32 (vs Sporting Lisbon)

Who can they face?

Villarreal, Torino, Celtic, PSV, Dnipro, Sevilla, Wolfsburg, Young Boys, AaB, Guingamp, Trabzonspor, Anderlecht, Ajax, Roma

Odds to win the Europa League: 16/1 

A good formula to success in Europe is win your home games and draw your away ones, and it's effectively been the foundation for the Toffees impressive continental showings this term.

From their first four games, two dominating and convincing Goodison Park victories by three goals over Lille and Wolfsburg firmly established the Merseyside outfit as top dogs in the group, with draws away from home in France and at Krasnodar sandwiched inbetween.

But the best was yet to come. A superb win at Wolfsburg on the penultimate matchday confirmed their last 32 spot as group winners, meaning the last day home defeat by Krasnodar meant nothing on a night when Roberto Martinez fielded a very youthful side.

At 16/1 it's clear that Everton will be a side to avoid among the seeded outfits  and Toffees fans will be optimistic that their side can progress a long way in this competition.

Everton's defeat on the final day of the Europa League group stage meant very little as the club had already secured top spot ahead of Wolfsburg on matchday five with a win in Germany

Celtic

Group placing: Runners-up (Unseeded)

Last five seasons:

2013-14: CL group stage

2012-13: CL last 16 (vs Juventus)

2011-12: Group stage

2010-11: Play-off round (vs Utrecht)

2009-10: Group stage

Who can they face?

Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Besiktas, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Everton, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit

Odds to win the Europa League: 80/1 

After failing to qualify for the Champions League (twice) this season, it was intriguing to see how Celtic would bounce back in the Europe League and just where their status rests among Europe.

After all, the Scottish Premiership tends to mask the overall ability of the Bhoys but they are indeed still a threat at European level, having come through their Europa League group relatively unscathed in a runners-up spot.

They never got anywhere near group winners Red Bull Salzburg, but were the only side to take a point off the Austrian side after drawing 2-2 away from home on the opening match day.

Despite picking up just eight points, progression to the last 32 was booked as early as matchday five.

The Scottish champions will now head into the knockout stages as one of the rank outsiders to go all the way in lifting the trophy in Warsaw - but not many sides will fancy a trip to Celtic Park on a European night.

Celtic finished comfortably ahead of third placed side Dinamo Zagreb in Group D, with Kris Commons scoring the winning goal when the teams met at Celtic Park on matchday two

Celtic were distant runners-up behind Red Bull Salzburg in Group D but despite picking up just eight points, they secured last 32 qualification with one match to play before losing at Dinamo Zagreb on the final matchday

How the last 32 Europa League draw works 

There are two pots ahead of the draw. One will contain the 12 Europa League group winners and four best third-placed Champions League teams (seeded), and they will be drawn against the Europa League runners-up and the remaining third-placed Champions League outfits.

No team can play a club from their group or a side from the same association. This rules out Tottenham, Liverpool or Everton drawing each other (or any side they have already played in the group stage) but it does leave Everton open to draw Celtic.

Games will be played on 19 and 26 February and the draw will take place from Nyon on Monday at midday GMT.
