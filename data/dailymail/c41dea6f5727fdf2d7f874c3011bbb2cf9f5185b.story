Disgraced former Minister Chris Huhne has been caught breaking the traffic laws yet again, by driving the wrong way up a one-way street.

Pictured in his Toyota Prius, he edged out of a narrow side road and, risking yet another three points on his licence, turned right instead of left.

Even allowing for Huhne’s famed hubris, the timing of his latest transgression, revealed for the first time today, is remarkable. 

Against the tide: Chris Huhne illegally turns right out of Eagle Court, on to one-way St John's Lane, his blue Toyota Prius travelling the wrong way

Mid-manoeuvre: The one-way sign clearly shows Mr Huhne has been breaking the law as he exits St John's Lane, turning right on to St John's Street

It happened just four weeks before his trial, at which he admitted asking his former wife Vicky Pryce to take speeding points for him in 2003. In other words, it was at a time when one might expect him to have exercised granny-like caution behind the wheel.

But as the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated, Huhne’s regard for the rules of the road – and the laws of the land in general – can be decidedly casual. Along with Miss Pryce, he now faces a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice.

The one-way infraction happened on January 11 on a street two minutes from Mr Huhne’s £1.25 million home in London’s fashionable Clerkenwell.

He left his flat and headed for Eagle Court, a narrow road which he used to cut through to St John’s Lane, where he executed the illegal right turn.

Four days later, his lawyers were in court battling without success to get the speeding points case thrown out. Then, just as the trial was due to start, Huhne changed his plea to guilty.

Mission accomplished: But is that a guilty look on Mr Huhne's face as he drives off into the London traffic?

Uneasy rider: Chris Huhne can be seen cycling on the pavement near Waterloo, London, left, and making a right turn while ignoring a traffic sign on the same day he was pictured driving the wrong way down a one-way road

Drivers in his London borough who break the one-way rule face a £130 fixed penalty fine on the spot, if caught on camera, reduced to £65 if they pay within 14 days. However, if caught by a police officer, they can face a charge of careless driving and the possibility of three penalty points.

If Huhne, 58, had been lost in an unfamiliar city, his behaviour might have drawn some sympathy. But having lived in Clerkenwell for more than a year with new partner, Carina Trimingham, he is thought to be familiar with the streets in his vicinity.

Especially as he often cycles in the area. Not that he is necessarily any safer on two wheels. On the same day he was pictured driving his car the wrong way along a one-way street, he had earlier ignored a no-right-turn sign while cycling in the Waterloo area, in breach of the Highway Code. And last year he was also photographed cycling the wrong way along a one-way road.

In his defence, when Mr Huhne committed his latest driving offence there were no signs in Eagle Court warning him not to turn right. Nor was there a sign opposite the Eagle Court entrance indicating he should turn left into  St John’s Lane. New signs have been put up since the incident, however.

And here he does it again, this time on a bike: Mr Huhne is pictured cycling the wrong way down a on-way road near his home last February

Disrespect for the law: The disgraced former MP Chris Huhne has admitted asking his former wife Vicky Pryce, pictured right, to take speeding points for him in 2003

The seeds of Huhne’s recent downfall 
were sown in 2003 when a speed camera caught his BMW doing 69mph on a 
50mph stretch of the M11. With nine points already on his licence, he 
asked Pryce to claim she had been driving.

She
 eventually agreed. But he still got a ban. Just 16 days later, he was 
caught using his mobile telephone while driving, and disqualified for 
six months. Two years later, after he was appointed Lib Dem environment 
spokesman, he traded in his cherished BMW for a ‘greener’ Toyota Prius. 
Pryce, 60, was last week found guilty of perverting the course of 
justice by taking speeding points on Huhne’s behalf. The judge warned 
the pair faced jail.

Last
 night Mr Huhne said there wasn’t a ‘no right turn sign’ in Eagle Court 
at the time of the incident. ‘I suggest there was no offence,’ he said, 
adding: ‘I haven’t obviously turned right there since the sign was put 
up.’

But on January 11, there were two one-way signs at either end of St John’s Lane. And Islington Council has confirmed St John’s Lane has been a one-way street for years.

Mr Huhne added: ‘Until that right turn sign was erected, it [making an illegal right turn] was a very common thing for residents to do because apart from anything else they couldn’t get through [nearby] Cowcross Street.’

His comment suggests that if he had turned left, his path would have been blocked, but it would only have meant him taking a longer route.

Hearing: Vicky Pryce (left) and her the 
ex-husband, Britain's former energy secretary Chris Huhne (right), will 
be sentenced together for perverting the course of justice on Monday afternoon - and probably face jail
