Real Madrid might be feeling the heat from Barcelona in the La Liga title race, but it doesn't seem to be placing too much pressure on  Neymar and Co.

Barca closed the gap at the top of the table to two points last weekend, and face Rayo Vallecano this weekend hoping that a Real slip-up could send them top.

But while the pressure has been heaped on the European champions, Barcelona players Neymar, Adriano, Dani Alves and Douglas looked relaxed on Friday.

Neymar - suspended for Sunday's visit of Rayo - posted a picture of the quartet on Instagram after finishing off a training session at Barca's Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper base.

That came after Neymar was called up to Brazil's squad for their upcoming friendlies against France and Chile - with manager Dunga being questioned over whether his side was too reliant on their star man. 

'Since he has been designated captain of the team, he has had an upgrade on his level of football,' Dunga said of Neymar.

'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better.

'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe. 

'Our priority is first to have a strong collective, and then as a second step, one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better.' 

Neymar is not the pure focus of Brazil's national team squad, according to his manager Dunga
