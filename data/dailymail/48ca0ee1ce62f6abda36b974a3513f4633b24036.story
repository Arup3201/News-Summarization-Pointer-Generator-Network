Divorce Battle: Alisa Thiry, 49, said that taking her husband Didier, a wealthy Belgian hotelier to court had been a difficult and painful experience

A former model at the centre of a £40million divorce battle with her husband has hit back at suggestions that she is a gold digger.

Alisa Thiry, 49, a former model and fashion editor at Elle magazine, who lives in London's affluent Notting Hill said that taking her husband Didier, a wealthy Belgian hotelier to court had been a 'difficult and painful experience.'

However, it's not the first time Mrs Thiry has faced the difficult decision.

Before she married Mr Thiry, 52, a property tycoon who was worth £8 million, she won an eight figure settlement from her first husband Stephen Marks, the wealthy owner of fashion brand French Connection.

Mr Marks is the father of her three children and her split from him was resolved relatively smoothly.

To
 pay off Mrs Thiry, Mr Marks sold £40million worth of shares 
in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in 
the region of that amount.

Breaking
 her silence yesterday, Mrs Thiry said that she 
had flourished through being a 'successful journalist and 
businesswoman.' 

But
 she is battling against headlines thanks to her acrimonious divorce battle, which 
saw her squabbling with husband number two over their £45million 
fortune.

Her second husband is a well-known figure in his
 native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire, including a
 boutique hotel in Brussels and a decades-old restaurant in a quaint 
village.

The key bone of contention is a £13.8million loan a company owned by Alisa made to a company owned by Mr Thiry.

Naturally, now the couple are no longer together, she wishes her loan to be repaid.

Chic: The 49-year-old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight-figure settlement after splitting from Mr Marks, the co-founder of French Connection, in 2004 after the couple had three children together

Last week, at a hearing of the Family 
Division of the High Court the judge ordered Mr Thiry to be jailed for 
four months for failing to disclose information about the loan.

The couple’s assets include a house in
 Notting Hill and a luxurious property on the Caribbean island of St 
Barts, where Alisa and Didier first met not long after her divorce from 
Mr Marks in 2004.

The High Court hearing heard that Mr 
Thiry had a fortune of £8million when their relationship began.

A large 
chunk of the couple’s combined fortune is made up of the money Alisa 
took from her first divorce.

But Mr Thiry is currently in Belgium, and is said to be in no mood to come rushing back to Britain to serve his sentence.

'I can’t come to London,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'You don’t know what it is for me not to go to London and be condemned to jail.'

Although he refuses to discuss the details of the court case, he claims to have launched rival proceedings in Belgium against Alisa.

The couple were married overseas around 
2006. Following their separation, it is understood a decree nisi was  
issued, but a decree absolute cannot be given until a financial 
settlement has been agreed.

Mrs Thiry is the daughter of Raymond Chapman and his wife, Valerie, both hairdressers. She
 was born Alisa Chapman in Cheltenham in 1964 but changed her name to 
Green after her mother’s marriage to Ronald Green in 1973.

Mrs Thiry has released a statement to complain about 'misleading statements' about the case.

In the statement released by her solicitors, she sent out a warning to all newspapers against 'repeating 
the offensive sugestion that despite being a successful journalist and 
businesswoman I have somehow made a career out of marrying for money.'

She
 added: 'I hope now that all sections of the press will respect our 
privacy, and that none of the newspapers will seek to capitalise further
 on this difficult situation.'

Her statement was, in part, a response to unkind mutterings that she is a woman who weighs up a potential husband’s suitability according to the size of his wallet.

‘It didn’t go unnoticed that she took Stephen to the cleaners,’ says one who knows her.

‘She told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did. He was devastated. There are no feelings of warmth between Alisa and Stephen now —  just loathing.

‘No one was surprised when Alisa married another multi-millionaire. She has an uncanny way of latching on to money. I think Didier was probably warned, but sadly paid no attention.’
