Horror: Intelligence chiefs are investigating the links between Dr Mirza Tariq Ali and the Taliban death squad that murdered 132 children

Links between a fugitive NHS surgeon and commanders of the Taliban suicide cell who massacred 132 school children are being investigated by Pakistani intelligence officers.

Mirza Tariq Ali, who fled the UK last year to join jihadi forces, is said to be a senior Taliban commander hiding in the tribal areas of Pakistan with those who controlled the six gunmen responsible for Pakistan’s worst terrorist atrocity.

An associate in the UK of controversial hate preacher Anjem Choudary, the 39 year-old recently appeared in a chilling Taliban recruitment video threatening the Pakistan Army.

Significantly, the Taliban has admitted responsibility for the school atrocity and said it was to avenge the deaths of their women and children in a six-month long army offensive.

Ali, from East London, practised for nine years in London and Cambridge, and slipped out of the UK last year in a bid to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State while awaiting trial at the Old Bailey. However, he was detained by the Croatian authorities, before being deported to Pakistan, his country of origin, where he joined-up with the Taliban.

Investigators in Peshawar said yesterday that they believed several factions of the Pakistan Taliban – co-ordinated from neighbouring Afghanistan – were behind the attack on the Army Public School in the frontier city that killed 150.

In one chilling intercepted telephone call between the death squad and their commanders at the height of the slaughter, a gunman is said to ask : ‘We have killed all the children, now what do we do?’ 

He is told to wait for the arrival of the commandos trying to rescue the surviving children and detonate their suicide vests killing as many soldiers as possible.

Police and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are said to have dozens of intercepted calls recorded before and during last Tuesday’s attack linked to Taliban commanders and co-ordinators on both sides of the Afghan border.

Officials confirmed they are looking for links with Ali, whose rise to prominence since arrival with the Taliban is said to have been rapid and now uses the name Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi.

He was described as ‘someone of interest’ to the mass murder inquiry and wider war against the Taliban.

Ali was arrested and charged with violent disorder last year following a demonstration in Central London calling for jihad in Syria organised by the East London-based Chodary.

But before the start of his trial in May this year he skipped bail and left the UK.

He was subsequently convicted in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months in jail in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole.

Ali was also struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester.

Speaking last month on a Taliban video in both Urdu and English, Ali said he did surgical training in London and ‘at the same time I called the non-Muslims to Islam’. He urged those fighting for the army in Pakistan to stop being ‘an ally of Kuffar (non-believers) and resisting against the implementation of Shariah.’

Up to 20 commanders believed to be linked to the Peshawar murders operating with different wings of the Taliban are said to have been involved in helping to orchestrate the outrage masterminded by Maulana Fazlullah, the group’s Pakistani commander.

Known as ‘Radio Mullah’ because of his previous propaganda broadcasts, Fazlullah is believed to be operating in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, where Afghanistan’s military have little influence.

He has ordered the murder of school children before. One of the targets of his hitmen was teenage education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, this year’s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, who survived being shot in the head and now lives in England.

With unprecedented anger at the Taliban’s latest attack spreading across the country, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has promised that terrorism will be defeated.

‘We have resolved to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated,’ he said.

Mr Sharif has ordered the military to step-up attacks on the group despite the Taliban blaming operations in the tribal areas that have killed women and children as the reasons for the Peshawar ‘revenge’ attack.

The Pakistani Air Force carried out 20 airstrikes in a small Taliban stronghold in the north west of the country yesterday, killing at least 57 militants.

Killers: Photographs of the six men responsible for murdering 132 children were released by the Taliban this morning, along with an emailed statement revealing the terrorists plan more attacks at schools in Pakistan

The remote handling of suicide attackers from the safety of neighbouring countries is not unusual in the region. The 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai is said to have been commanded from the Pakistani port city of Karachi.

Afghan officials say that a number of major bombings on the capital Kabul were co-ordinated by handlers in Pakistan.

‘The belongings we got from suicide bombers involved in the Peshawar School attack provided us with clues, and our intelligence agencies shared some other very valuable information related to the planning and execution of this terrorist attack,’ a security officer said, referring to a meeting on Wednesday between Pakistani and Afghan intelligence agents.

In an act of defiance yesterday, several pupils who had been inside the school at the time of the shootings turned up at the gates to show their contempt for the Taliban gunmen, promising they would not be intimidated.

The Taliban has threatened more strikes on schools linked to the military but dressed in his green blazer yesterday Student Aakif Azeem, 18, insisted: ‘We want our revenge. We were all innocent and had absolutely nothing to do with this... You can rip up our school, you can take away our teachers, but you cannot take away our identity.'

Recalling the moment the Taliban struck, he told the BBC said: ‘I was in the dining room when the gunmen started firing and one took a shot at me with a pistol, but the bullet ricocheted. There were children screaming and crying and there were bodies everywhere.’

‘The corridors were dripping with blood. Even the teachers were terrified... All I could think about was where my little brother was. Later I found out that out of a class of 25 who died, he was the only one who escaped unharmed,’

It was confirmed last night that a five-year-old girl named Khola Altaf was the youngest victim of the massacre - despite alleged instructions from Taliban commanders not to kill ‘small children’.

Khola is understood to have been on her first day the school’s kindergarten when gunmen burst into the room and reportedly shot her at point blank range.

Following the horrific terror attack on a school in Peshawar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered the lifting of the moratorium on the death penalty for terror related cases in Pakistan.

The death penalty had been unofficially suspended since 2008, under the orders of President Asif Ali Zardari.

Following Zardari’s decision to retire in September 2013, renewed calls emerged for the death penalty to be re-stated for terror related crimes.

Nawaz Sharif was re-elected for a third term as Prime Minister in June 2013, promising to bring back the death penalty.

However, international pressure from human rights groups and threats of further violence from the Pakistani Taliban, forced Sharif to shelve his plans to re-instate the death penalty in late 2013.

Despite the ban, judges in Pakistan are still allowed to sentence convicted criminals to death row. Last year, 226 people were sentenced to death by Pakistani courts. Activists claim that Pakistan’s overcrowded jails contain the largest number of death row prisoners in the world.

Over 8,000 criminals are currently being held on death row. 800 of the prisoners have been sentenced for terror related crimes.

There has only been one execution in the last five years. Muhammed Hussein, a former soldier in the Pakistani army, was sentenced to death by a military court for murdering his senior officer in 2008. Hussein was hanged in Punjab province in 2012.
