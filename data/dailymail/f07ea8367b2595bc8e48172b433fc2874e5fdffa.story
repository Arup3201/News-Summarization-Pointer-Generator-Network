A woman who had been struggling with body issues for much of her life has seen her confidence soar after taking part in a challenging nude photo shoot.

Claire, a 48-year-old working mother based in Denver, Colorado, felt the time had come for her to silence her inner-critic after her father - the first person to make a comment about her weight - passed away last year.

'You're kind of a little tank,' Claire's father had told her when she was eight years old, planting a seed that would embed itself stubbornly into her psyche long into adulthood.

Moving on: Claire had been struggling with body issues for much of her life, but has seen her confidence soar after taking part in a challenging nude photo shoot (pictured) 

Claire, was has teenage children, took part in journalist Shannon Bradley-Colleary's Love Your Body Now project, which involved working with body coach Marlene Zaleznick while posing nude for fine art photographer Beth Sanders.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Claire says of her experience: 'I still have the annoying voice in my head that tells me I am not good enough, thin enough, fit enough.

'That likely won't ever go away. However, I have a relationship with that voice now where it no longer has power over me.

'This alone is a huge transformation that feels absolutely liberating.'

Speaking to Shannon about her childhood, Claire explained that while her father's comments were 'seemingly innocent and supportive' - he would sometimes suggest they 'get fit together' - they did more harm than good.

At one point in her childhood, her father, an avid runner, even suggested Claire and her mother try and 'lean down' on a diet of 1,000 calories or less per day.

Claire was fit, incidentally. She loved to dance, and though she didn't go as far as some of her peers in regards to dieting, she did use diet pills and diuretics.

'I wasn’t a fan of making myself throw-up, which was kind of trendy at the time,' she says.

'There was something, my inner rudder, telling me to hold on a second.' She told herself: 'You don’t want to be about anorexia like many of the girls in dance class.'

Still, Claire, who stands at 5ft 4in and weighs 150lbs, held on to a fixation over weight as she grew older.

'I’ve been chasing the same 20-30lbs since college and the effort and exhaustion of the things I say to myself is crazy-making,' she admits.

Joy: Marlene, a 'body-centered' emotional coach,  suggested Claire lose herself in dance as part of the shoot - a childhood passion which remains a great source of comfort and freedom for her

During her 18-year first marriage, Claire disliked being seen naked, particularly after she started having children.

'My only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance,' she says. 'My sexuality went right out the window.'

Claire's second marriage was to someone she describes as an 'extremely lovely conscious man.' 

Their relationship remains strong and Claire's career is on the upswing.

Yet still she couldn't quieten the constant self-berating inner-dialogue she had regarding her body.

Although anxious about taking part in her nude photo shoot, Claire had high hopes based on similar projects Shannon had run before.

Marlene, a 'body-centered' emotional coach, astutely suggested Claire lose herself in dance as part of the shoot - a great source of comfort and freedom for her.

She shed her clothes and describes the dancing she performed as Beth snapped away as both 'celebratory' and a course of 'grieving'.

Claire had a particular breakthrough when Marlene - who Claire said expertly 'midwifed' the process' - placed bricks on her back to help her feel the weight of her body image issues pressing down on her.

'I had a transcendent experience when I shook off those bricks,' she recalls.

When Claire reviewed the black-and-white portraits, she says that 80per cent of her embraced what she saw.

'To see Beth’s genius was moving to me,' she says. 'There is a sense of peace and release in my face that was exactly what happened to me during the shoot.'

The remaining 20per cent of Claire noticed 'the softness' of her stomach.

'I don’t have a flat tummy and even when I worked out I didn’t,' she remarks. 'There was a feeling of disappointment in that part.'

It's been more than six months since Claire had the photos taken, and she describes the experience as enduringly 'healing.'

'I have a much more positive attitude about my body, and have grown more comfortable with the skin I am in,' she tells us.

'I find myself feeling grateful for this body that allows me to be in this world, so I may offer my work and talents, experience life and love, savor food that nourishes me, touch and be touched.'

She adds: 'The experience has allowed me to step more fully into who I am, back to who I was before the negative voice set up camp in my head.

'I am now gentler with myself. Loving. Accepting. And I am so grateful that I have the rest of my life now to feel this way.'
