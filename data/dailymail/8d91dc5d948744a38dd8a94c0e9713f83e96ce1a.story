As this car concertinas against a wall, sending shards of glass and metal into the air, it's hard to imaging how anyone inside would survive such a wreckage... But apparently they would.

The video was recorded during recent crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that where the electric Tesla Model S come out as the surprise winner.

The rechargeable car aced every category with a five-star 
performance in the front-end crash, the side crash and the rollover 
crash.

Safe car: As this car concertinas against a wall, it's hard to imaging how anyone inside would survive such a wreckage... But apparently they would

The electric hatchback has already won 'Car of the Year' from Motor Trend magazine while Consumer Reports said it was the best car it has ever tested.

The accolade will be seen as a boost to the fledgling car maker after it was revealed half of a dozen popular small cars tested for how they would stand up to a crash did not fare well, an influential road safety group found.

Six of the cars tested, most of which were 2013 models, were rated ‘poor’ or ‘marginal.’

General Motors Co's Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze each received marginal scores, while Kia Motors Corp's Soul and 2014 Forte were rated ‘poor’ in the results released Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Nissan Motor Co's Sentra also got a poor rating, while Volkswagen AG's Beetle was ranked ‘marginal.’

Two redesigned Honda Civic models, the 2-door and the 4-door, were the only small cars to get the top rating in stringent front-end crash tests performed by the insurance industry group.

In the worst cases with the small cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel, and side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection, IIHS chief research officer David Zuby said.

Of the 12 models tested, the Kia Forte fared the worst, the institute said in a press release. Its seat belt allowed too much slack, and the side curtain airbag deployed but didn’t provide enough protection. The crash dummy’s head hit the windshield pillar and instrument panel.

In the test of the VW Beetle, the steering column moved nearly 5 inches to the right as the test dummy’s upper body moved forward and to the left.

Intense: As part of the test, small vehicles were crashed at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side

Worst-case scenario: In cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel

‘The rotation meant that the dummy’s head barely contacted the front airbag,’ the institute reported. ‘At the same time, the safety belt spooled out too much, allowing the dummy to move forward 13 inches and hit its head on the dashboard. The side airbag didn’t deploy.’

By comparison, the Civics sustained only minimal intrusion into the occupant compartment, providing ‘survival space for the dummy,’ which remained well-protected from impact.

The IIHS increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. The insurance group said nearly a fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve only a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.

The IIHS continues to score vehicles on side, rear, rollover and front-end crashes that impact more than just a corner.
