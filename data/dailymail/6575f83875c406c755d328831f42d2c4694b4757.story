Spies around the world could soon be able to listen in on secret conversations without any fear of being found out thanks to the first ever one-way sound machine.

Sound waves traditionally travel forward before bouncing back, and with sound this means you can speak, hear yourself speak, and hear any responses. 

Called an acoustic circulator, the first-of-its-kind system uses fans to change the flow of air as the sound waves travel through it, and this prevents the waves from bouncing back.

The centre of the acoustic circulator, pictured, is fitted with three specially positioned fans that change the flow of air through the separate chambers. The arrows show how sound waves flow from one port, to the next, in sequence, and never bounce back. The circulator is the first-ever one-way sound machine

The circulator was created by a team of researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin led by Professor Andrea Alu. 

Alu said his experiments successfully prove that the 'fundamental symmetry with which acoustic waves travel through air between two points in space - for example, if you can hear, you can also be heard - can be broken by a compact and simple device'.

The inspiration for the device came from current three-port electronic circulators that are typically used in communication devices and radars.

For example, Microwaves and radio signals are able to move from one port to the next in sequence, meaning they're never sent back to the recipient.

In the middle of the team’s acoustic circulator is a 'resonant ring cavity' fitted with three small computer fans (pictured right). These fans circulate and keep the airflow travelling at a specific velocity. 

The ring is connected to three ports, each with a microphone fitted to the end that can record sound. 

During Professor Alu’s experiment, researchers sent sound from one port to another. 

When
 the fans were turned off, the sound signal from Port 1 split in half 
and travelled through the two other ports, Port 2 and Port 3, as 
expected - known as ‘transmission symmetry’.

However,
 when the researchers turned the fans on and delivered a moderate 
airflow into the ring, with specific velocity tailored to the ring 
design, transmission symmetry was broken and the signal from Port 1 
would flow into Port 2, leaving Port 3 isolated. 

Similarly, when a signal was sent from Port 2, it would flow into Port 3, leaving Port 1 isolated, and so on.  

The sound waves continued to move through the ports in sequence, and never travelled in the opposite direction or bounced back. 

In these electronic circulators, when one of the ports isn’t being used, the system acts as an isolator, letting signals to flow from one port to the other, but not back.

The UT Austin team realised the same principles could apply from sound waves traveling in air, which led to the team's building of a first-of-its-kind three-port acoustic circulator.

'Using the proposed concept, we were able to create one-way communication for sound traveling through air,' said Professor Alu.

'Imagine being able to listen without having to worry about being heard in return.

‘It
 is just the right spin of fluid (air) coupled with the strong resonance
 of our ring cavity, which makes our design powerful.'

To test the circulator, researchers sent sound from one port, pictured, to another. When the fans were turned off, the signal from Port 1 split and travelled through the two other ports - known as transmission symmetry. However, when the researchers turned the fans on transmission symmetry was broken

'These two combined mechanisms create strong nonreciprocity in a compact device. Sound waves are routed in one direction only - always contrary to the direction of the airflow.'

The findings, Sound Isolation and Giant Linear Nonreciprocity in a Compact Acoustic Circulator, are published the journal Science.

This research may eventually create an ‘acoustical version of one-way glass,’ said Preston Wilson, acoustics expert and associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 

‘It also opens up avenues for very efficient sound isolation and interesting new concepts for active control of sound isolators.'

The researchers are now working on using these concepts to create nonreciprocal circulators and isolators for radio waves and light, as well as a design for the sound circulator that does not use moving parts.
