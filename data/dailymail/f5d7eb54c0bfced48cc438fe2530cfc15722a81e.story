Bread has become the latest household to be slashed in cost in the supermarket price wars which have reduced milk to cheaper than bottled water. 

Branded loaves have now been reduced to as little as 75p and own-label bread can be bought for 55p in some stores, according to new research. 

Sainsbury's has led the battle by reducing the cost of a Hovis loaf to 75p - the lowest since prices of bread plummeted to similar levels in 2011. 

The price of loaves of bread has been slashed by supermarkets and has reached lows of 75p for branded loaves and 55p for supermarket own brands in the latest price wars, which last month cut the price of milk 

The supermarket dropped 800g Hovis white and wholemeal loaves and 750g Best of Both from £1 and cut nine of its 800g own-label loaves from 75p to 55p.

Trade magazine The Grocer said the price cuts come at a particularly bad time for bakers when the supply of wheat with the right levels of protein needed for baking have been tight and prices are expected to remain high until at least August. 

Sales of branded and own label breads have also fallen 4.5 per cent year on year - making business a struggle for bakers. 

A milling industry insider told The Grocer: 'With this pressure on margin, bakers won't be particularly happy about what is happening with retail pricing.' 

According to analysts BrandView.com, the bread price cuts mean that Sainsbury's currently has the lowest base price for a large branded and standard own-label loaf of the big four supermarket chains.

The drop matches the promotional price of Hovis in Waitrose which has been selling the loaves at two-for-£1.50 since mid-January. The Grocer said the last time the base price of branded loaves was this low was in 2011 when Kingsmill was 75p.

Sainsbury's has led the cuts, dropping the price of white and wholemeal Hovis loaves from £1 to 75p 

After Sainsbury's, Morrison's is the next cheapest with own-label 800g loaves priced at 59p each.

Last month supermarket price wars were having a devastating impact on dairy farmers, as the cost of a pint of milk was reduced to just 22p. 

Farmers criticised Asda for putting their livelihoods at risk after it reduced the cost of a four-pint bottle of milk to 89p. Waitrose and Sainsbury's followed close behind with a £1 price tag. The reductions mean milk is now cheaper than bottled water in some circumstances.
