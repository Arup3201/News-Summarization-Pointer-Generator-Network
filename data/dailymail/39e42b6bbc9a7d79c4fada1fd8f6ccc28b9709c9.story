Everyone hates a poser and it seems mother nature is no exception after this aspiring rapper was blown off a seawall while strutting for the camera.

Florida hip-hop artist Presto Flo was posing along the seafront in Clearwater, Florida, when a strong gust of wind suddenly lifted his hat off.

In an attempt to grab the lime-green cap he can be seen reaching backwards, before slipping and falling into the water.

Before the accident the rapper can be seen strutting his stuff along the sea wall in his hometown of Clearwater while another man takes pictures of him

To make matters worse, he landed on a sharp oyster bed and had to be taken to the emergency room with deep cuts to his shin and hand, according to his record label.

Thankfully, once the singer had been 'bandaged up' he was back in the studio.

The 30-year-old, who has a young daughter, is preparing to release his debut album Nitro at the start of next month.

He is described by the record label as a 'street cat' who is the 'real deal', producing music that speaks to 'his true-life grittiness'.

According to information posed on social media, he grew up in Clearwater and attended East Lake High School, in nearby Tarpon Springs, before going into music.

Since the clip of his misfortune was posted on social media three days ago, it has attracted more than half a million views.
