Police are hunting for the parents of two little boys after a video emerged of the infants viciously fighting as a group of adults cheer them on.

The children are captured kicking and punching each other - often through tears - on an unidentified street in Wilmington, Delaware.

At one point, one of the boys hurls the other to the curb and he is sent flying into the side of a parked car. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Sickening: A video posted on Facebook shows two infant boys punching and kicking each other as adults cheer

But the entire time, at least six adults can be heard laughing and cheering. 

The disturbing footage follows the two topless boys as they grip each other in a headlock while letting out high-pitched screams. 

Zooming in, the person holding the phone camera can be heard shouting 'oh man!' and laughing.

The video cuts when one child is flung to the ground, but starts again to show them embroiled in another headlock.

Fight: They grip each other in headlocks and scream through tears but they continue as a crowd looks on

Gripped: The boy in light-colored trousers eventually runs after he is pinned up against a wall by the other boy

The vicious fight doesn't come to a close until one of the boys runs away, into a nearby house and slams a door - as the group of adults are seen calmly looking on and chuckling.

Police have confirmed to ABC6 News that they are actively trying to find the parents of the two boys. 

Anyone with information should call Wilmington police on (302) 576-3990.

Watching: The camera turns to show more than six adults casually watching the boy flee in tears
