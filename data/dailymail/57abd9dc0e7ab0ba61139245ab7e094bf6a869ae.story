Affair rumours swirl but were Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin doomed from the start, given they are a classic case of 'opposites attract'?

He's notoriously shy, lost his virginity at 22 (just a few years before hooking up with Gwyneth) and avoids the public eye.

She has a fondness for first-night red carpets, a long list of lovers and Hollywood A-listers as best friends.

Gwyneth Paltrow announced her separation from Chris Martin today

'Seek a mate whose values and background echo your own' is standard relationship advice from people who know their stuff - like U.S. love guru John Gottman, who's been studying long-term couples for more than 25 years.

Chris and Gwenyth flew in the face of that advice and got married anyway.

Their 'conscious uncoupling' means they've proved the 'opposites attract but don't last' rule true, yet againâ€¦ or has it?

Not only are Chris and Gwyneth managing a remarkably amicable separation, they clocked up a decade of marriage, which, quite frankly, is a lot more than most of us achieve.

Could it be opposites have a lot more in common than we think? Research very firmly plants its feet on the side of similiarity.

Tracey believes that parenting can keep a couple like Chris and Gwyneth together, the pair are seen here with their daughter Apple shortly after her birth in 2004

Studies repeatedly tell us the key to long-term happiness is choosing someone who is a lot like you.If your partner agrees with you on most things, those destructive, 'they'd be perfect, if only' thoughts are reduced.

Someone who validates your existing views and habits is far easier to live with than someone bent on trying to change you to theirs.

It's logical: marry someone with a similar family background, income level, aspirations, personality traits, religion and age and your chances of romantic success are bound to be higher.

The more a couple share a similar perspective to life, the less conflict there's going to be.

Compatibility questionnaires used in pre-marriage counselling - asking questions like 'how important is being faithful?' and 'how should you raise children?' - are highly successful in predicting what chance a couple have of surviving and how happy they'll be with their relationships.

Tracey says 'opposites' might not have the smoothest relationships, but the highs are likely to be higher

But there's one edge that opposites have over Tweedledum-Tweedledee couples: They have much better sex.

Relationships without conflict are easy and comforting. But if you get on so well, you never have differing views about anything, your marriage has a brother-sister dynamic.

If you're not quite sure of your partner and can't predict how they'll think or react, the excitement level is higher. Uneasiness might feel uncomfortable, but it keeps you on your toes.

Love likes predictability. Lust doesn't.

Love likes to keep loved ones close-by, kept away from any threats like rival partners.

Lust thrives when our partners go out into the world without us because uncertainty and difference are what create a sexual spark.

'Opposites' might not have the smoothest relationships, but the highs are likely to be higher, which suits some personality types.

The trick to getting the balance just right, is ensuring your differences and similarities are in the right areas.

You wanting to spend Sundays curled up on the sofa with a book while he sets off on an eight-hour hike is a doable difference.

One of you being deeply religious and the other an atheistâ€¦ not so much.

A high compatibility score on personal and moral values is way more important than interests and hobbies for obvious reasons.

Want the best of both worlds?

A perfect match would be someone who agrees with you on important stuff like sexual morals, parenting and how to show affection but is passionate about things you haven't thought to explore.

Perhaps this is the formula that kept Gwyneth and Chris going for 10 years. And perhaps that's not such a bad achievement.
