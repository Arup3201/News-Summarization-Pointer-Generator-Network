For six months, Celtic have thought of little else but this. The fraught process of qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League begins under the low clouds of Iceland on Tuesday evening. Failure is unthinkable.

Few expect KR Reykjavik to be the toughest test Scotland’s champions will encounter en route to the rich man’s playground which is worth an annual £15million.

Were qualification down to dressing room IQ, however, KR would be favourites. One of their players is a banker, another an architect and most of the others are students. But the capacity of their KR-Vollur Stadium — a  glorified public park — is just 1,700.

Coach Runar Kristinsson held his own against Ronny Deila as a player in Norwegian football but gives himself little chance as a coach over the coming two legs.

Yet such is the importance of Europe’s blue-riband tournament in terms of prestige, interest and cold, hard cash, the Parkhead side can take nothing for granted.

Under Neil Lennon, this Celtic team displayed a knack for defusing awkward, unappealing ties.

But Lennon has now gone, European talisman Georgios Samaras has followed suit and the captain, Scott Brown, is out injured until October. As yet, their only new signing has been goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who hasn’t kicked a ball for two years.

For Celtic, these games are now like a high-stakes round of Russian roulette. And no one can predict if it will blow up in their face.

And no one knows yet what Deila can bring to this team, to this club. He will certainly bring his own players after the Reykjavik ties. And his first competitive test could certainly be stiffer. But its  importance and significance is hard to overstate.

As domestic football becomes more mundane, the Champions League is now what sustains Celtic.

With their home games to be staged at Murrayfield while Parkhead serves as a host venue for the  Commonwealth Games, the Norwegian could use a big statement in the Icelandic capital.

KR Reykavik’s English striker Gary Martin claims, with a slightly ridiculous level of mathematical precision, that the Scottish champions are ‘seven per cent’ weaker than last term.

From Kris Commons, last season’s Celtic player of the year, that prompts a snort of derision.

‘If the Reykjavik player has come out and said we’re weaker this year, then he’s obviously concentrating more on us than his own team,’ said the former Scotland international.

‘He’s probably hoping that we’ll be weaker. But over the course of two games, if we’re at it, we should have more than enough to get through.

‘But they’re like cup finals with everything on the line — so you just never know.

‘The European nights at home are some of the best in the world. That’s what drives you.

‘When you’ve reached the top and you’ve had those nights, it’s not the same just playing every week in the SPFL. You need those Champions League games in between.

‘That gives you the buzz, it’s what brings the fans and the money in.

‘To have that for the last two years, it would be devastating not to have it this time around.’

Focused: Commons is determined to help seal Celtic's qualification to the Champions League group stages

This, for Celtic, is the key. Sometimes, the finances make the headlines as if that’s all that matters.

In a domestic environment where broadcasting revenue is derisory, it’s certainly vital but the  Champions League means more to fans of Celtic than filthy lucre.

The European nights are what they live for. They know they will never win another European Cup, but being there, mixing with the elite, is what sets the pulse racing. If they inflict the odd bloody nose on a major scalp along the way, all the better.

‘We’re fully focused on the job that needs to be done,’ added Commons. ‘We know what to expect.

‘Everyone knows how vital these games are, not just for the club but for the whole of Scotland — it’s important that we get into the Champions League.

‘We know what we’re carrying on our shoulders. We have to get in there. Reykjavik are 11 games into their season, so they’ll have more match-fitness than us.

‘But once the whistle goes, you put your professional head on and get to where you need to be as soon as possible.

‘The players have thought about these qualifiers all summer. They either make or break our season.

‘We can either have a really good campaign up until December,  January time — or we’re going to be toddling through the season.

‘For a club like Celtic, we need to have European football. We need those special nights at Celtic Park to keep everyone interested.’

Last season, the group stage was a fairly joyless experience when the sale of key players came home to roost.

Fears remain that Fraser Forster or Virgil van Dijk — or both — could be sold after the Reykjavik ties. That concern was critical to Lennon’s decision to quit  and for Deila poses a significant threat to his hopes of a smooth passage into the job.

Yet Commons points to the streetwise players left behind who almost manage themselves these days. What Lennon called his ‘hard core’ of him, Charlie Mulgrew, Brown, Adam Matthews and Emilio Izaguirre.

‘We have a new boss — but, in these games, we almost have to manage it ourselves because we’ve been over the course before,’ he said.

‘I think we’ve proved we can deal with teams like Reykjavik. Recently, we’ve been right on the money apart from the Kazakhstan away game.

‘Over there, we played well and created chances but we didn’t deal with long throws and that cost us two goals.

‘Karagandy was a fright, we almost didn’t make the group stage. Now, you can almost touch it, you can feel it.’

Big job: Celtic fans expect new boss Ronny Deila to secure their passage to the group stages

It remains to be seen if this is a club which has learned anything from that Karagandy experience.

A last-minute James Forrest goal pulled them through after key players — Lennon’s ‘crown jewels’ of Gary Hooper, Kelvin Wilson and  Victor Wanyama –— were sold.

Deila knows the type of players he needs to play the kind of game he has in mind. Whether he receives the resources to get them will depend to a huge extent on steady progress in these qualifying games.

‘The new manager has been super, I’ve been really impressed,’ added Commons. ‘He’s got a great knowledge.

‘He wants us to be in the  Champions League and to win the title by a country mile, rather than just getting over the line.’

From this vantage point, crawling over the line would do Celtic fine. A confident stride from the blocks on Tuesday evening would help get things moving.
