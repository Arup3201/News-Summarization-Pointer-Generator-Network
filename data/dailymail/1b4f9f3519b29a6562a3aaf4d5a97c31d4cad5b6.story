Alleged racist rants on Twitter about the England players who missed penalties against Italy are being investigated by police it has emerged.

The messages were aimed at Chelsea defender Ashley Cole and Manchester United winger Ashley Young following their team’s defeat in the Euro 2012 quarter finals in Sunday night.

The Football Association has launched a strong attack on any online abuse branding it 'appalling and unacceptable'.

 penalties and police have confirmed they are investigating

Someone calling himself Steve, using 
@Lapwnage as his Twitter ID, praised Italian star Andrea Pirlo, adding: 
‘He could give those two black m******* Ashley Young and Ashley Cole a 
lesson or two.’

He said the two players were ‘worthless n******’ who ‘should be deported to Africa’.

When other Twitter users condemned his remarks, he accused one of being a ‘smelly Paki’.

‘Steve’ later backtracked, saying: 
‘Just a joke, you guys need to relax, police know I was kidding around 
and they won’t bother me hopefully.’

And in another message, he claimed 
defiantly: ‘The police won’t bother me mate. I can assure you of that.’

However, West Midlands Police got in touch with the user telling him: 'Wrong. Your comments may constitute a public order offence. We have advised complainants how to officially report this to police.'

Meanwhile, another Twitter user using
 the name @JordyEFCBoy posted: 'U black ****s!'. Two more users going by
 the name @jordanfoster97 and @johnbcfcmillman typed similar abuse.

Their accounts have now been deleted and the Metropolitan Police confirmed they were investigating the allegations.

Twitter trolls who post online racist abuse can face a jail sentence if they're found guilty. 

The comments prompted an outpouring of condemnation from other Twitter users.

A Met police spokesman said yesterday:
 'We are aware of alleged racist comments on Twitter following last night's England game and have launched an investigation.

'The
 allegation was made to MPS on 25 June by a member of the public 
relating to comments on a Twitter account supposedly based in London.

'There have been no arrests at this 
early stage. The MPS is examining possible offences under Section 18/19 
Public Order Act 1986.'

Meanwhile, the FA said in a statement: 'We are concerned at the reports regarding allegations of abuse aimed at
 England players Ashley Cole and Ashley Young on Twitter.

'They have just given everything for the national team at Euro 2012 and 
it is appalling and unacceptable that messages of an abusive type are 
being posted. We support any police investigation in identifying who is 
behind this.'

The alleged attacks are the latest in a series of incidents that have seen 
celebrities come under fire from anonymous people using 
social-networking sties - a practice known as internet trolling.

Among the most high profile was student Liam Stacey, 21, from 
Pontypridd, South Wales, who was jailed for 56 days in March after racially 
abusing two Twitter users and mocking Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba 
after he collapsed and almost died.

Stacey,
 who was in the final semester of his three-year biology degree when he 
drunkenly sent his offensive and now infamous tweets, was also banned 
from Swansea University for the rest of the year.

He admitted racially aggravated public disorder after posting: 'LOL (laugh out loud).

Twitter chiefs say their site is 
self-regulating and that they regard each user as being responsible for 
the content he or she provides.

A spokesman said: 'Because of these 
principles, we do not actively monitor users' content and will not 
censor user content, except in limited circumstances.'

But he added: 'We have clear rules that
 govern behaviour on Twitter and will look into any reports of those 
rules being violated.

'We will investigate reports of violent 
threats but we are not the police and we cannot actively work with the 
police to report incidents that are reported to us.'

The spokesman 
advised people who believe they have suffered credible violent threats 
on Twitter to call police immediately.

Millions up and down the country watched Sunday night's game, packing out pubs and bars.

However, unruly scenes followed England’s 
defeat in Ukraine. A mob of 150 fans turned on jubilant Italian rivals 
who were driving in cavalcade through Bedford.

Cars were damaged and flags torn from vehicles in the town, which is home to many Italians.

Lorenzo Galletta, a 22-year-old hairdresser, said: ‘We were going up the high street beeping our horns and waving flags.

‘There was a group of ten English lads
 and one of them threw a stone at us. We saw one punch a guy in the face
 and kick him off a moped. As he stopped to pick it up, they attacked 
him.’

Four people were arrested, one for assault and three for criminal damage. CCTV is still being reviewed to check if other offences were committed.

Superintendent Mark Turner said: ‘Sadly, a well-behaved build-up to the game was marred by approximately 15 minutes of sporadic disorder.

‘It is always a shame when the majority of well-behaved supporters are let down by the actions of a mindless minority. While order was quickly restored, this was undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant situation for people trying to leave the area sensibly and particularly for those stuck in cars.’

The game itself turned out to be spell-binding, despite ending in bitter disappointment for England fans.

More than 23 million people tuned in to watch the team go out of the tournament - the highest peak TV audience for eight years.

The
 quarter final, which was shown on BBC1, attracted 17.4 million viewers 
on average but another 5.8 million people dropped what they were doing 
to catch the dramatic conclusion.

The match - which had people hooked 
in homes, pubs and clubs around the country - drew more than 
three-quarters of all TV viewers in its final minutes just after 10pm on
 Sunday night.

Some 
23.9 million peak audience which tuned in to BBC1 to watch England crash
 out of Euro 2004 exit against Portugal - also on penalties.

The
 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton received a total 
audience of 26 million last year, although this was a combined figure 
from ten different channels that broadcast the ceremony.

The
 all-time top ten most watched programmes include England’s victory over
 Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, which had 32.3 million viewers, 
followed by the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 on 32.1 
million.
