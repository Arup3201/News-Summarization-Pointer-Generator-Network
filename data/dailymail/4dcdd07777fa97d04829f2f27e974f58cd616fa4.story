Two men have admitted a string of pet cruelty charges after being caught sending live fish in the post.

Mark Freed started an online pet delivery business from his home in Greenhithe in Dartford, Kent, along with friend Mustafas Bodour, a court heard this week.

Dartford magistrates heard on Tuesday how Freed, 28, posted animals in watertight bags placed inside boxes marked 'fragile' using a private delivery firm.

The pets sent out to online buyers included terrapins, lizards and Siamese fighting fish.

Freed and Bodour, 24, of Greenhithe - but now living in Holland - were arrested last year after a delivery worker from TNT discovered a fish in a package.

When the RSPCA sent an officer to Freed's address, they found another courier leaving with a parcel containing live fish.

Both men were charged with causing unnecessary suffering to animals and Freed was also charged with failing to provide reasonable care to Siamese fighting fish.

The court heard how the exotic pets were sent in 'clear plastic bags containing water', and after a search of Freed's home RSPCA officers found more animals in bags ready for transportation.

Andrew Wiles, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said although none of the animals had died they would have suffered from being posted to customers in boxes.

He told the court: 'Apart from having the label "fragile" on it, it had no information that it contained live animals.

'It was opened and there was some newspaper and some bubble wrap and the terrapins were in a clear plastic bag.'

The court heard how Bodour invested £1,500 in the business, but left the day-to-day running to Freed.

Wayne Crowhurst, defending Freed, said his client had been 'looking after animals since he was seven' and would never deliberately harm them.

Both men pleaded guilty to five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and Freed also pleaded guilty to failing to provide reasonable care to Siamese fighting fish.

Bodour was banned from owning aquatic animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £3,130 in court costs, as well as receiving a three-year conditional discharge.

Freed was released on bail and will be sentenced on April 24. He was warned a custodial sentence could not be ruled out.
