The number of soldiers caught taking illegal drugs has nearly doubled in just two years –  due to the popularity of sports supplements containing banned substances.

Some 590 soldiers failed drug tests between September 2012 and September this year – up from 305 in 2011.

Defence sources suggest that all but a handful of these will have been sacked under military law. 

Roll of shame: The Royal Artillery saw 90 soldiers fail a compulsory drugs test

The Army’s roll of shame is headed by the Royal Artillery, which saw 90 soldiers fail a compulsory drugs test.

They include 17 caught taking the restricted substance ephedrine, which has similar effects to the Class B drug amphetamine. The soldiers claimed they were using it to build muscle mass and reduce their body fat percentage.

The Royal Regiment of Scotland saw 70 soldiers fail a drugs test, the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment 50, and the Mercian Regiment 40.

The figures – obtained by a Freedom of 
Information request – also reveal that, in the same period, 40 Royal 
Navy and 25 RAF personnel were found to have taken a banned substance.

In total, the Army conducted 123,190 drug tests, the RAF 11,545 and the Royal Navy 13,450. Earlier this year, sports supplements containing performance-enhancing chemicals were linked to the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed on an SAS endurance march in the Brecon Beacons.

A defence source said: ‘We need to get this situation under control. A moment’s stupidity will cost soldiers their Army careers. They were too naive or lazy to check the ingredients. A lot of these products are sold online rather than over the counter – they’re dangerous and the side effects can prove fatal.’

The Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Armed Forces has a zero-tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour, including substance misuse.’
