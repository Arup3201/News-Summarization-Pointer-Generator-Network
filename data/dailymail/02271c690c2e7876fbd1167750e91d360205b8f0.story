A grandmother who spent most of her life avoiding the gym has become a world-beating weightlifter with three world records to her name.

Tania George, 43, smashed a world record this month when she deadlifted 200kg at the 2013 World Powerlifting Congress championships in Prague.

What makes her achievement all the more remarkable is not just that it is the fourth world record she has broken this year, but that she only began competing as a powerlifter two years ago.

Tania George, 43, of Manchester, has broken four world records in deadlifting since starting weightlifting in 2011

Tania, seen right in competition at the British Powerlifting Union Womenís Masters competition in Folkestone in September had spent her life avoiding gyms until two years ago

Mrs George, of Manchester, said: 'In my early 30s I fell into the habit of joining ladies-only gyms and giving up my membership after a month or so.

'I would try the same old cardio exercises and soon it would become monotonous and boring. I really wasn’t that interested. I’d rather just sit at home on the sofa and watch TV.

'I’ve achieved so much since then - I’m really proud of myself.'

Mrs George returned to the UK in 1998 after several years of living abroad.

After working in a variety of sales positions she set up a sports massage service in a gym in 2005 after meeting the gym’s owner, bodybuilder Paul George, 51. The pair married in 2009.

Mrs George said: 'I started weight training because I had idle time between massage appointments. At first I wanted simple exercises to improve my abdominal muscles. But I found I really liked it, and I was amazed at the difference it made to my physique.

'Even better, I found the weightlifting community to be lovely. Everyone was really welcoming and friendly.

'For the first time I was in an environment where people were praising and encouraging me to continue in the training I was doing, and giving me feedback about the results I was getting. It made all the difference.'

Supported by her husband and her 16-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, Mrs George was ready to try her first competition in 2011. The following year her daughter gave birth to a son - Mrs George’s first grandchild.

This year, after countless hours of training, Mrs George began breaking records. At the British Powerlifting Union Women’s Masters competition in Folkestone in September, she broke world records in her class for squat, bench press and deadlift.

She went beyond her personal best by deadlifting 200k at the World Powerlifting Congress world championships in Prague in November 2013, again breaking the world record.

Tania says that she wishes she had started bodybuilding earlier in her life, but that she is proud of what she has achieved

She said: 'Looking back, I’m extremely proud of my achievements. I’ve worked hard for them.

'Sometimes I wish I could have started powerlifting earlier in my life, but I believe that everything happens as it is supposed to and I have no regrets.'

Mrs George has now started weight training classes exclusively for women, organised through her Facebook group at www.facebook.com/Nodumbelles, and has become a vocal advocate for her adopted sport.

She said: 'Some women who powerlift have encountered negative reactions. There’s a misconception that powerlifting could only be appealing to butch or unfeminine women.

'Most of those bad reactions have unfortunately come from other women who are overweight or who are ignorant about sport. I think that kind of ignorance usually reflects failings in the people who are making the criticisms.

'When women come into the gym and ask me how they can lose weight I tell them, ‘I can help you do that if you like, but have you ever thought about becoming strong instead?’ It’s something they never think of, but most women like the idea.

'Powerlifting has given me wonderful benefits. I’m lucky to have met some amazing people and I feel great. If I can help other women achieve that, then I would like to try.'
