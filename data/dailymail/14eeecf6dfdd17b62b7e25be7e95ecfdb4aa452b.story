A Mormon doctor convicted of murdering his wife so he could continue an affair with his mistress has tried to commit suicide in his prison cell.

Deputies discovered Martin MacNeill, who was found guilty of murder last month, trying to kill himself as they carried out a routine check on his cell in Utah County Jail at 5pm on Thursday.

The officers intervened and he was rushed to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, Sgt. Spencer Cannon from the Utah County Sheriff's Office told KSL.

Suicide attempt: Martin MacNeill, pictured in court on November 18 following his murder conviction, has been found trying to commit suicide in his Utah prison cell. He is conscious and remains in hospital

Cannon said MacNeill, 57, was conscious 
but not cooperating with authorities. He did not indicate how MacNeill 
had tried to take his life or the condition he was found in by deputies.

The killer stayed at the hospital over night and remained there this morning under guard, but he is expected to be returned to the jail sometime Friday, Cannon said.

He added that deputies have been watching MacNaill closely since he was convicted on November 8 of killing Michelle MacNeill at their Pleasant Grove, Utah home in April 2007.

MacNeill's sentencing in the murder is set for January 7, when he could receive 15 years to life for murder and one to 15 years for obstruction of justice.

Murdered: MacNeill was found guilty of forcing his wife Michele (right) into having a facelift in 2007 before giving her a lethal cocktail of drugs during her recovery and leaving her to die in a bathtub

Affair: The court heard how he had been having an affair with Gypsy Willis, pictured testifying in the trial, for 15 months at the time of his wife's death. He moved her into their home soon after

Prosecutors called it 'perfect 
murder' as the court heard how MacNeill forced his wife to have a 
facelift so he could give her a lethal cocktail of drugs and then drown 
her in the bathtub.

The father-of-eight had moved his mistress, Gypsy Willis, into the family home shortly after his wife's death.

Another lover testified the doctor claimed he could induce a heart attack without anyone knowing, while cellmates said he admitted to the murder and called his wife a 'b****' after he was locked up.

His daughters had long fought for 
authorities to investigate their father for murder, certain that he had 
killed her to continue an affair with Willis, who had been introduced to
them as a nanny.

Locked up: MacNeill was found trying to kill himself at Utah County Jail, pictured, which is near Provo

It wasn't until MacNeill's release in 
July 2012 from a federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah 
prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice.

Willis also served timeÂ  for using the identity of one of MacNeill's adopted daughters to escape a debt-heavy history. That daughter had been sent back to Ukraine, supposedly only for a summer.

MacNeill's only family defender was his only son, Damian, a 24-year-old law student. But Damian, who was haunted by his mother's death, committed suicide in January 2010.
