The wife of actor Andrew Sachs condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to  Radio 2 for the first time since he left the BBC following Sachsgate scandal.

Melody Sachs said it was a ‘slap in the face’ to give the disgraced presenter a job on the same station on which he insulted her husband six years ago. 

Ross has been hired to provide holiday cover for Steve Wright’s afternoon music and chat show at the end of the month.

'It's highly inappropriate and disgusting': Melody Sachs, pictured with her husband Andrew Sachs, condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to Radio 2

He will be paid an estimated £4,000 to host four three-hour programmes between August 26 and 29.

Last night Mrs Sachs, 79, said: ‘It’s highly inappropriate and I think it’s disgusting.’

In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone.

The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the 84-year-old actor’s granddaughter and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls.

Brand later resigned and Ross was suspended for 12 weeks, later moving to ITV. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom.

Although Ross, 53, has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career.

Mrs Sachs added: ‘I’m so surprised that the BBC has welcomed him back. I’m amazed that they could do such a thing. It’s like a slap in the face for us, especially after Andrew spent so much of his working life with the BBC writing, acting and directing. It’s very sad and thoughtless and disrespectful.’ 

It is the first time since he left the BBC that Ross has been allowed back on Radio 2, although he has appeared on one-off TV.

On Monday he appeared as a guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute.

Criticism: Tory MP Philip Davies (left) has also criticised the decision to allow Ross (right) back on the airwaves

Last night Tory MP Philip Davies also criticised the decision to allow Ross back on the airwaves. He said: ‘My view is that what he did was completely and utterly unacceptable. He doesn’t appear to have accepted that, and until he does I don’t think the BBC should employ him.’ 

Ross was never fired from the BBC. Instead he chose to leave in 2010 after the corporation decided not to renew his £18million contract. He later claimed the scandal had made him a ‘better person’. 

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster … [who] is returning for this one-off stint of holiday cover for Steve Wright. There are no plans to bring him  back permanently.’
