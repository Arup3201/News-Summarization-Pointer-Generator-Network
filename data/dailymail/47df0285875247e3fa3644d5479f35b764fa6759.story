Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top U.S. officials faced off Monday in dueling speeches on the high-stakes Iran nuclear negotiations, a signature foreign policy objective of President Barack Obama.

'Imagine what Iran would do with nuclear weapons,' he warned on Tuesday, saying that the Islamic republic is already training, arming and dispatching terrorists on five continents.

Asked whether President Obama watched the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters: 'I don’t believe that he did.'

Netanyahu says a nuclear-capable Iran would have the means to achieve its stated goal of annihilating Israel. He listed a litany of instances when Israel has acted on its own, in defiance of the U.S., to protect itself.

The Obama administration is pursuing talks with Tehran that critics say could ultimately allow the kind of nuclear enrichment inside Iran that Netanyahu fears most.

U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power insisted on Monday in a speech preceding Netanyahu's that it will 'never' happen.

Netanyahu insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong'

The backdrop for the rift between the longtime allies was the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S.

On Tuesday Netanyahu will address the U.S. Congress. Despite some Democrats' boycotting, demand to see the speech is brisk.

'We’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday in an emailed statement. 

'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' 

Each House member gets a single ticket to give away.

'I could scalp that ticket, there are so many people who want it,' Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg told The Washington Times.

'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.'

Obama has repeatedly cautioned Israel not to launch pre-emptive attacks against Tehran, but Netanyahu suggested Monday that he could choose to act unilaterally as his country has done in the past, even at the risk of alienating the United States.

'In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare statehood,' Netanyahu recalled. 'That's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it. But, Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.'

'In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned ... that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone. But Israel did act – acted alone – to defend itself.'

'In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor at Osirak,' Netanyahu continued. 'The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms-transfers for three months. 

'And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister Sharon launched Operation Defensive Shield. The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately but Sharon continued until the operation was completed.'

'I mention them to make a point,' he said. 'Despite occasional disagreements, the friendship between America and Israel grew stronger and stronger, decade after decade. And our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future.'

US United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power told AIPAC that the United States will 'never' allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon

The alliance between Israel and the Unites States is 'stronger than ever,' Netanyahu finally insisted, quelling fears of a rift between his Likud Party and Obama's Democratic Party.

He insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong.' 

'My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both,' he said.

'I deeply appreciate all the President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more.'

'The last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,' he added, 'and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.'

Netanyahu addressed the gathering Monday morning at the Walter E. Williams Convention Center, bracketed by remarks from two senior U.S. officials: Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice.

The Obama administration hedged  last week about whether it would send someone to speak, and who it might be, after Daily Mail Online raised the subject during a White House briefing.

Power insisted that 'The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period.' 

'Talks, no talks, agreement, no agreement, the United States will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies,' she said to an audience of thousands.

'We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim. But if diplomacy fails, we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen. There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never.'

She also criticized Netanyahu for 'politicizing' the Iran debate, saying U.S.-Israeli relations 'should never be politicized and it cannot and will not be tarnished or broken.' 

Netanyahu's visit to Washington has sparked criticism in both the U.S. and Israel. The centerpiece of his trip is an address to Congress Tuesday, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans and was not coordinated with the White House.

Jeremy Bird, deputy director  of Organizing for America, is helping Netanyahu's opponents in the hope of defeating him, even as the White House insists Obama won't meet with the prime minister in order to avoid the appearance of prejudicing the election

Neither President Obama nor Vice President Biden will meet with the prime minister while he's in Washington, citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in Israel's upcoming elections.

A close Obama adviser, though, former presidential campaign aide Jeremy Bird, is in Israel working to help Netanyahu's opposition defeat him.

Rice has been particularly sharp in her criticism of Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, calling the move 'destructive' to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship.

The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon.

A Netanyahu adviser told reporters traveling to Washington with the prime minister on Sunday that he was not coming to the U.S. capital to offend Obama.

'The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers' of the agreement that may be taking shape, the adviser said, speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record.

The adviser said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. 

Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel 'does not oppose every deal' and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one.

As Netanyahu was preparing to speak, Secretary of State John Kerry was in Switzerland for another round of talks with Iran. 

The U.S. is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late-March deadline.

The U.S. is negotiating alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.
