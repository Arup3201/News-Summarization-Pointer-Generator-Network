The brother of MP Simon Danczuk’s wife Karen was re-arrested yesterday after two more women accused him of sexually abusing them.

Police confirmed that Michael Burke, 36, was being questioned last night on suspicion of historic sexual offences a month after complaints from Mrs Danczuk led to his first arrest.

The divorced father of three, a security guard, was held and taken to a Manchester police station yesterday morning after ‘new information came to light’.

Mrs Danczuk – who has become well-known for posting revealing pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12.

She did not name her attacker initially, but Mr Burke was later arrested. Last week he denied the claims, saying: ‘The allegations are false. I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’

Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes

In February Mrs Danczuk said: ‘I was raped and abused by a paedophile for years and years. And for years afterwards I felt worthless, guilty, as though I had somehow brought this on myself. But I was just a little girl.

‘I was on anti-depressants for years and wanted to kill myself. But my husband Simon encouraged me to have therapy and now – after intensive counselling – I have been able to get some confidence back.’

The 31-year-old says she was on anti-depressants for two decades, self-harming and attempting suicide in 2007.

Mrs Danczuk said she starting posting ‘selfies’ because she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’.

Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘A man has been rearrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences.

‘This relates to officers speaking to a woman on February 16, 2015, regarding historic sexual abuse and new information coming to light. He remains in police custody for questioning.’

It is not known when the fresh offences are alleged to have taken place.

But Greater Manchester Police were already investigating Mr Burke over claims that he sexually abused his sister between 1989 and 1995.
