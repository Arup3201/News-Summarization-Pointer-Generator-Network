Relatives of Omagh bomb victims tonight vowed to relentlessly pursue the £1.6 million in damages that the men found liable for the attack have been ordered to pay.

Their pledge came after two republicans were ruled responsible for the 1998 atrocity at the close of a landmark civil case in Belfast High Court.

The families insisted they had also not given up on securing a criminal conviction for the dissident republican outrage that claimed the lives of 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins.

Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly, both from the Republic of Ireland, had faced a retrial after they successfully appealed against a finding of liability made against them and two other republicans at the end of the original civil case four years ago.

But their second trial delivered the same outcome in the same court, with judge Mr Justice John Gillen today ruling the men were responsible for the Real IRA attack.

Between them, Murphy, Daly, Real IRA chief Michael McKevitt and republican Liam Campbell owe the 12 bereaved relatives who took the case £1.6 million.

However, the decade-long civil action, which could still be subject to another appeal, is estimated to have cost the taxpayer many millions more in legal aid and court bills.

Stanley McCombe, whose wife Anne was killed, said the families were determined to make the four men pay up.

'When you go before a court and you are fined for whatever you do, you pay your fine, you pay your debt to society, whatever you do, so why should these people get away, why should these people live in the lap of luxury?' he said outside court.

Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden died in the blast, said retrieving the damages would send a signal to terrorists contemplating similar acts of violence.

'We feel that the judgment that we were granted here in 2009 would be a very hollow judgment if the law wasn’t seen to be carried through and that the people that we were given a judgment against weren’t pursued, that will be pursued of course,' he said.

'That would be the deterrent for others not to pursue terrorism.'

Mr Gallagher said the families’ campaign for a full cross-border public inquiry into the bombing would go on and he urged the police on both sides of the border to examine the High Court judgment for evidential opportunities. No one has been successfully criminally convicted of the attack.

'We have not given up on criminal conviction,' he said.

'That’s really what we wanted in the first place and sadly it was left up to the families to get a result and to hold people to account for this crime.'

Not all the Omagh victims’ families supported the High Court action, with some claiming it was a waste of time that would not deliver a prison sentence.

At the conclusion of the original civil case, the families’ groundbreaking action had already cost them an estimated £2 million, with more than £750,000 provided in the form of 'special status' legal aid granted by the Government.

They were supported in their efforts to raise funds for the court case by former US president Bill Clinton, former Northern Ireland secretaries Peter Mandelson and Sir Patrick Mayhew, as well as musician Bob Geldof and boxing champion Barry McGuigan.

Mr Gallagher predicted the overall cost of the action, factoring in legal aid on both sides and the added costs of the appeal and retrial, was 'tens of millions'.

'Certainly I want to know the total cost of this trial and all the subsequent appeals and trials,' he said.

'We think it is scandalous that so much money, it has cost so much money to get justice for the families.

'Every time we meet politicians and ask for a public inquiry they always cite the fact it’s going to cost too much money and take too long, well this process has now taken 11 years and has cost tens of millions of pounds.'

Murphy, a builder and publican from Dundalk, Co Louth, and Daly, a bricklayer from Cullaville, Co Monaghan, were found liable along with McKevitt and Campbell in the initial civil judgment in 2009.

McKevitt, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence in the Irish Republic for directing terrorism, and Campbell, who recently successfully fought extradition proceedings to Lithuania on arms smuggling charges, failed in their bids to overturn the Omagh civil judgment.

They are now seeking to have their case heard in the European Court of Human Rights.

Murphy and Daly’s appeals were upheld but both men were ordered to face another trial. The retrial started in January and finished last month, with Mr Justice Gillen delivering his reserved judgment today.

Neither defendant was in court for the judgment. Both men also declined to give evidence during the trial.
