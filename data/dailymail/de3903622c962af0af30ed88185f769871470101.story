Apple made a number of improvements to the camera on its iPhone 5S to make pictures look more professional, and a new patent hints at what we could expect from the camera on future versions of the phone.

The patent details a system capable of capturing low-resolution images that can be refocused even after they’ve been taken and processed.

It would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image, similar to the technology seen in Lytro cameras, meaning the shots appear in 3D rather than 2D.

Apple's patent, pictured, details a camera attachment that takes images which can be refocused, even after they've been processed, similar to the technology used in Lytro cameras. This means images appear in 3D and the focus can be changed numerous times to create different shots

Apple’s digital camera, according to the patent, 
would be made up of a shell with an image sensor mounted inside it.

This sensor would be fitted with a number of sensor pixels for 
capturing digital images.

An adaptor, including a microlens array, 
could then be inserted between the imaging lens and the image sensor meaning users could switch to what Apple calls the 'low-resolution 
refocusable mode.'

As the name suggests, the array would be fitted 
with micro lenses that capture light from multiple sources and 
directions.

This is called light-field photography and gives the appearance of 3D. 

These images would then be able to be digitally refocused because the camera has enough light-field information to change how it looks.  

Earlier this week Apple confirmed it had bought Israeli motion-sensor company PrimeSense.

PrimeSense was involved during the early development stages of Microsoft's Kinect sensor.

The
 company hasn't discussed its plans for motion-sensor technology, but 
some experts believe it could be a part of the rumored Apple TV.

The set could also feature the camera detailed in the latest patent.

According to patent papers, which were originally filed in 2011, photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots.

These images would be taken through what’s called a microlens array.

According to Apple's patent, this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high-resolution photo.

A similar array is already used in Lytro’s Light Field Cameras.

Lytro was set up in 2006 but the first cameras didn’t go on sale until 2011. They use a technology called plenoptic imaging.

Each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions. This is known as 4D light field information.

Other companies, including California-based Pelican Imaging, produce similar cameras and in May, Nokia announced plans to invest in this firm.

Apple's patent makes explicit reference to manufacturer Lytro and its plenoptic camera, pictured. Lytro cameras went on sale in 2011 and use technology called plenoptic imaging. Each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions

Rumours suggest the investment will lead to the Finnish phone maker launching a smartphone with a plenoptic camera by 2014.

Apple makes explicit reference to Lytro and plenoptic camera patents, however, by making the microlens array in its own camera detachable, the firm believes this would make its design more consumer-friendly.

‘This invention has the advantage that the digital camera system can be configured to capture both low-resolution refocusable digital images and high-resolution non-refocusable digital images’ said the patent.
