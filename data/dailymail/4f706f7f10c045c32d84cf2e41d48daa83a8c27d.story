Almost 90 new suburbs have made it into Australian property's 'millionaires club' this year, with several unexpected suburbs making the cut along with long-established real estate royalty.

The 89 suburbs that made the list varied in location, but they all had one thing in common- an average property price of $1million or more.

Among Sydney and Melbourne, strong real estate prices meant that suburbs even a fair way from the CBD were included, surprising real estate agents with price jumps of up to 10% from last year.

13 Church Street in South Melbourne is just one of the surprise properties pushing its suburb into the millionaires club

With the recent property boom in Sydney, it is no surprise that NSW boasted more entrants than any other state, becoming the wealthiest property state with 20 new suburbs making the cut. 

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 25% of all Sydney suburbs are listed for prices of $1 million or more. 

Suburbs on the list in NSW included Epping, Glenhaven, Ryde, Windsor Downs, Lewisham and Chifley among others.

Ashburton, Ripponlea, Fairfield and Caulfield East were surprises in Victoria, all jumping between 17% and 33% in average house price in a year. 

47 Underwood Road is situated in Homebush, the suburb which recorded the largest jump in price to $1.184 mil

76 Seventh Avenue is located in the Adelaide suburb of St Peters, in the North East of the city's outskirts. Bordered by other expensive suburbs, its proximity to luxury may be a factor in the selling price of the house

67 Nanson Street in Wembley joined the ranks, with Western Australia recording eight additions to the club

In Sydney, Homebush was an unlikely inclusion to the 'millionaires club', with RP Data indicating that the average price for houses in the suburb is now $1.184 million.

The suburb, which was once known as a heavy industrial area, broke into the $1million average house price range with the biggest recorded jump of 38.6% in the past year, reported The Australian. 

'We know Sydney real estate is really strong, but in some of these areas where you are seeing million dollar price tags, like West Pennant Hills and Frenchs Forest, you are a long way from the CBD and a long way from the water,' said RP Data senior researcher Cameron Kusher.

Family-friendly suburb Chifley drew potential buyers to the suburb, with the absence of high-rise buildings being a potential attraction for those looking to invest in a first time home and looking long term, reported The Courier Mail.

14 McHenry Street in St Kilda East may not look like much, but for many millionaire club suburbs, it's all about location, location, location...which this property has in spades

38 Vineyard Street in Mona Vale is a tidy weatherboard house with only three bedrooms, another surprising property expected to fetch in excess of $1 million when it goes under the hammer this weekend

Suburbs which border other exclusive areas proved to be no surprise, with Adelaide suburbs Malvern, Walkerville, Saint Peters and Leabrook in the North and North East of the city making the cut.

'It is interesting that there are some (other, unlikely) suburbs in the nation's million-dollar median,' said Adelaide agent Rick Harcourt.

'In Adelaide you still get a lot of houses for a million dollars,' he said.

Agents were left shocked when an inner-city residence in Camperdown, Sydney, sold for excess of $1 million a few years ago, with the suburb now boasting an average price of $1.017 million.

'Now you are flat out getting a decent two-bedroom house in the inner west for under $1 million,' said agent Prue Holcombe of Belle Property Newtown.

In Queensland, Bulimba, Surfers Paradise and Tennyson made the cut, and in Western Australia the biggest jumpers included on the list were Coolbinia, North Freemantle, West Leederville and Bicton.
