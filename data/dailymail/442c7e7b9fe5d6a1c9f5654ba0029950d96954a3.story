A grandmother has told how she had to beg doctors to remove a surgical clip which had migrated across her body from her groin to her chest.

Cheryl Osborne, 51, had the metal device fitted to her fallopian tubes when she was sterilised 12 years ago.

However, three years ago she started suffering back, stomach and chest pain and an X-ray revealed a foreign body on the right side of her chest.

Cheryl Osborne had clips fitted to her fallopian tubes when she was sterilised in 2001. In 2010 she started to suffer pain in her back, stomach and chest which she thinks was caused by one of the clips moving around

But Mrs Osborne claims she was left in agony for a further four months until she finally convinced doctors to carry out keyhole surgery to remove the clip.

She believes it could have been travelling around her body since she first noticed the pain as she remembers a medic spotting it on a scan in 2010.

Mrs Osborne has now urged other sterilised women to demand answers if they are in pain.

She said: ‘I was in complete agony. I love walking and playing with my grandchildren but I was having to cancel visits as I felt so unwell.

‘I could not lie on my back or right side as I was in so much pain.

‘My friends and work colleagues said I looked grey, but despite clearly being in agony, the doctors kept refusing to get the clip out of my body.

An X-ray eventually showed that one of the clips had become lodged near Mrs Osborne's liver. The X-ray shows one of the clips still in place on her fallopian tube and the other stuck under her rib cage

‘I was so shocked and scared when I saw the clip on my rib.

‘I
believe it was on the move for three years - I can’t bear to think what
damage it could have done to my body. I am lucky to be alive.

‘I kept telling the doctors “there is a piece of metal in me, get it out”, but they reacted like it wasn’t a big problem.’

Mrs Osborne, from Hastings, East Sussex, was sterilised at Conquest Hospital in St Leonards-on-Sea in 2001.

When she started to suffer from pain three years ago she was diagnosed with angina and became reliant on taking the maximum daily dose of strong painkiller Co-codamol.

But when the pain got too much in December last year she went to her GP and was told her liver function was unusually high and needed monitoring.

A stomach X-ray taken at Conquest Hospital on January 18 this year showed the clip nestled under her liver.

Despite this she was sent home but returned to A&E a few days later on January 23 and was given an ultrasound which failed to spot the clip, so she was sent home again.

She went back to A&E on February 18 still in pain but was again told to go home - despite the doctor acknowledging that the clip was in the wrong place.

Eventually, on March 25, Mrs Osborne got an appointment at the hospital with a registrar who booked her in for an emergency CT scan - which she had two weeks later on April 9.

Mrs Osborne says that even after the stray clip had been located, she had to beg surgeons to remove it as they thought it was 'harmless'

An emergency MRI scan on April 21 confirmed where the clip was and it was finally removed on May 13.

Mrs Osborne says she has suffered no pain since.

She says that she also no longer has any signs of angina - in fact, she believes she never had it, and that the clip was causing the pain.

Since the operation, Mrs Osborne's liver function has also been improving steadily and so she believes the abnormality was caused by the clip pressing on it.

However, she acknowledges that the painkillers she was taking might have contributed to the problem.

She said: ‘I know the NHS is pushed for funding and they are short-staffed but the care I received was appalling.

‘Had I known the risks of the clip migrating across my body I would never have asked to be sterilised.

‘Women need to know the risks and think twice about this operation.’

A spokesman for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust defended Mrs Osborne’s treatment and said the clip was ‘harmless’.

‘On each attendance at Accident and Emergency Mrs Osborne was treated appropriately,’ he said.

‘As she was not acutely ill she was, on each occasion, referred back to her GP. She was referred to a surgeon and tests were undertaken (not as an emergency) to fully investigate her symptoms.

‘It is the opinion of the surgeon treating her that the clip was not causing the symptoms she was describing.

‘There was no clinical need for the procedure to remove the clip however it was decided to undertake the procedure because of Mrs Osborne’s severe anxiety.

‘The last time this lady was seen in clinic she informed the surgeon that she was very happy.

‘These clips commonly migrate and are harmless.

‘It is not unusual this long after the original sterilisation procedure as the fallopian tubes to wither and deteriorate once they are divided and the clip has no tissue left to “hold” onto.’
