These are the cartoon style artist's impressions which police hope will help them catch a sexual predator.

The unusual images were released by police as they advised women in the Shaftesbury area of Dorset to be extra vigilant following a sexual assault.

A woman in her 30s, bravely fought off the would-be attacker and managed to escape from the incident uninjured.

Dorset Police released the e-fits, which were hand-drawn rather than computer generated.

Detective Constable Andy Marsh, of Western CID, said: 'The images - derived from a full account by the victim - have been drawn by a specially trained artist.'

The attack happened at about 11.15 pm on Tuesday, February 11 when a man, who was wearing distinctive work boots, approached the victim as she walked home alone.

He is described as six foot tall, of slim build and wearing a hood over his head.

Detective Constable Marsh added: 'I strongly suspect the man to be local to the Shaftesbury area and I urge anybody who knows this person to come forward and speak with the police in confidence.

'This is a rare and isolated incident, however we would advise members of the public to be extra vigilant.'

Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101.

Facial composites are used by police in investigations into usually serious crimes in the hope to recreate a person's face as remembered by a victim.

They are sometimes drawn or painted by specially trained artists in consultation with victims or witnesses.

However, computer generated images are more common now using E-FIT software.

This e-fit was released by police in Bolivia but helped them to track down a suspect

Earlier this year, police in Texas came under fire after a poorly drawn composite sketch was released after two women were robbed at knifepoint, which looked more like a cartoon character.

In 2009, Bolivian police released a sketch of a suspected murderer which looked nothing like an actual person, however they did manage to catch a suspect.

Portuguese police did not do much better in their search for Madeleine McCann, showing local business owners a faceless, egg-shaped head.
