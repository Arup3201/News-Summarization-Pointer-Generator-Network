Workers inside the Houses of Parliament are being subjected to overflowing and blocked toilets, rodent infestations and leaking roofs according to a new documentary to be broadcast next month. 

The 160-year-old building requires an immediate refurbishment costing in excess of £1 billion before irreparable damage is  done to the historic structure.

A decision saving the structure will not be made until after the election so it does not become an issue at the forthcoming poll.

A four-part documentary on BBC2 has been granted exclusive access behind the scenes of the Palace of Westminster. 

Michael Cockerell, who made the documentary, told the Radio Times: 'The place is nearly falling down. It is probably the biggest building project in Britain. We saw leaking roofs; we saw paintwork and plaster work crumbling. We saw buckets to catch the drips. Even the stonework on Elizabeth Tower [the home of Big Ben] is crumbling.' 

The building has also seen infestations of mice, rats, moths and even pigeons.  

Labour MP Valerie Vaz said that two members of her staff were forced to go home sick after a pipe burst in April 2013. The leaking sewerage built up near her office, making two of her staff ill. 

It is understood repairs took two weeks to complete despite the threat to health and safety.  

She told The Times: 'I had rung facilities and it had been dealt with immediately two members of my staff would not have been sick and there would not have been faeces all over the floor. I had to ring the serjeant at arms and he dealt with it, not facilities.'  

Flaking and rusting iron roofs have caused major problems with leaks and require replacing

Some roof supports have rusted so badly they have been at risk of collapse before replacing

The historic building on the banks of the River Thames is so dilapidated that major repairs are needed or irreversible damage may be done and ‘part of our nation’s most valued heritage will be lost forever’, a cross-party report has warned.

Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’:

ASBESTOS

The walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk.

ELECTRICS

Much of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power

VENTILLATION

Many original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable.

HEATING

Many boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months

FLOODING

Faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained.

LEAKY ROOFS

A problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life.

DANGEROUS CEILINGS

Several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber

DRAINAGE

Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected.

FIRE SAFETY

Out of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily.

LIFTS

Oldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations.

Officials admit that there has been ‘significant under-investment’ since the 1940s, when the Commons was bombed by the Nazis.

For years contractors have adopted a 'make do and mend' approach to repairs, while the Commons and Lords have continued to meet.

However, experts warn the building is deteriorating at a faster pace than repairs can be carried out during parliamentary holidays.

Dr Richard Ware, programme director for the Restoration and Renewal Programme, said: ‘There is very little downtime and the problem is how on earth you undertake fundamental renovations on the scale required under those circumstances.

‘The more things become antiquated the chances of a bigger crisis grow. It’s already burned down once,’ he told Business Insider.

Mel Barlex, parliamentary director of estates and technical director for the programme, added: ‘Within six months of my joining I had a member stuck in a lift as a vote was underway.

'The legislation was ultimately passed by seven votes. That brought home just how serious these issues are.’

Many of the 3,000 windows will not close, iron roofs have rusted and leak, toilets regularly flood and the building is riddled with asbestos, in roof spaces, light switches, toilet systems and as a sound suppressant.

A Parliament spokesman said: ‘There has been significant under-investment in the fabric of the Palace since at least the 1940s, when parts of the Palace were renovated following bomb damage during the Second World War. Other parts of the Palace have not undergone appropriate renovation since it was built.

‘To date, all intrusive renovation work has been carried out around sittings of parliament. This approach has permitted only the minimum essential maintenance and piecemeal replacement of systems at highest risk of failure.

‘Currently, the rate and speed at which work can be carried out is slower than the rate at which the building is deteriorating so the backlog of essential repairs (and in turn the risk of system failure) is growing over time.’

Brick work is also crumbling, because the Anston limestone from Yorkshire is prone to erosion

Many parts of the Houses of Parliament have not been repaired since they were built, more than 160 years ago

Paintwork in the grand corridors inside the building is also peeling, and in many areas has been damaged by water

A report two years ago found the Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing.

It warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work.

They concluded that the World Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’.

And they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834.
