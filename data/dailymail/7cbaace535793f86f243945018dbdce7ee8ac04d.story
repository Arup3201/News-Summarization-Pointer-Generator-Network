Guilty: Stephanie Knight, pictured outside court at an earlier hearing, was jailed for seven years after being found guilty of conspiracy to rape

A teenage girl who lured two young white girls on a night out to be raped by three Asian men was jailed for seven years yesterday.

Stephanie Knight, then 17, told the 16-year-olds they were going for an 'exciting night' clubbing but instead plied them with vodka and drugs before forcing them to have sex with 'her boys'.

The girls had been taken in a large 4x4 vehicle to a derelict house where they were subjected to a sickening sex attack by the three men, one of whom was on licence after being let out early from an eight-year prison sentence for robbery.

Yesterday as the three attackers, Amjad Hussain, 34, Shahid Hussain, 37, and Tanveer Butt, 39, were jailed indefinitely at Preston Crown Court and ordered to serve at least seven-and-a-half years, a judge also sentenced Knight to seven years in a young offenders institute, saying she played a vital role.

Judge Beverley Lunt said the teenager, who had been in care most of her life, had distorted views on morality and knew exactly what she was doing when she led them into the trap.

She told Knight: 'You knew what has likely to happen when instructed by Amjad Hussain.

'You lured these two 16-year-girls from the safety of their homes and lured them into the clutches.

'You lied to them you said you were going on an exciting night out when there was no such intention.'

She added: 'It is clear you have had a difficult life so there is no doubt you have distorted views on morality and appropriate behaviour.

'There is no question that you were badly used by these men.

'But this means that you knew what they were like and what their interests were yet your lured the girls into their clutches.

'But for you neither girl would have been exposed to the danger of that night and subjected to humiliating rapes.

'You played a vital part in this conspiracy and knew what you were doing.'

Yesterday Knight, now 19, fought back tears as she stood in the dock alongside brothers Amjad and Shahid Hussain, and their cousin, father-of-four Butt.

Addressing all four defendants Judge Lunt continued: 'It is a total lack of humanity shown by any of you as this girl was repeatedly raped which disturbing and horrifying in this case.'

The case is the latest featuring Asian sex attackers preying on vulnerable young girls which has prompted former Home Secretary Jack Straw to warn that some Pakistani men in Britain see white teenagers as 'easy meat' for sexual abuse.

Knight met the three attackers after one pulled up in the street beside her six months earlier in his car and asked for her number.

Soon she was regularly performing sex acts on them. Friends said the men would lavish her with attention, pay for her meals and take her for rides in their cars.

One source said she was 'plasticine in their hands' and had been living on the streets and sofas for six months before the rapes.

Knight befriended the two girls a week before the attack in her home town of Blackburn, Lancashire.

After arranging to meet up with them in December 2009, she received a call thought to be from one of the gang during which she was heard to say 'got them'.

The girls were made to down vodka and coke and smoke drugs, leaving one victim 'feeling smashed'. They were then taken to a derelict house with no electricity.

Knight ordered one girl to perform a sex act on one of the man, before holding her back as the other girl screamed as she was raped.

As the screaming continued, Knight told the girl her friend would suffer even more if she did not comply, telling the victim that her friend was only 'chilling with my boys'.

The men took turns to rape the second girl throughout the night after she was barricaded inside a room. Both girls were then raped again as Amjad Hussain drove them home.

He also threatened them with a knife. The court heard that one of traumatised victims now felt invisible and often woke up crying.

The girl said she suffered from anxiety attacks, was still frightened by a knock at the door and 'at the time hated Stephanie with every bone in her body.'

But Elizabeth Nicholls, defending, said her client was as much of a victim.

'One does not have to look far for an explanation as to why this young lady has been drawn into the offences. At some stage she was much a victim as those that later become victim to her,' she said.

Miss Nicholls gave a 'chilling account' of Knight's life in 23 different placements between the age of 11 and 17.

She added: 'It is little wonder that she became a child deprived of love, affection and emotion support.

'She was a victim herself but did not regard herself as a victim but rather welcomed the attention of the men who preyed on her and these men.'

In April 2009, Knight made a complaint to the police that she had been raped but no charges were brought and she continued on her 'destructive and chaotic lifestyle', Miss Nicholls said, adding: 'She was and still is vulnerable.'

The court was told Amjad Hussain was on licence at the time of the attack after he was jailed for eight years for robbery in 2004.

The father of one, whose partner was pregnant at the time of the attacks, had become hooked on alcohol and cannabis after his fabric shop closed due to be debts.

Yesterday the three attackers were ordered to serve seven-and-a-half years for rape.

Knight, of Rawtenstall, was jailed for seven years for conspiracy to rape and aiding and abetting.

All defendants were told to sign the sex offenders' register.

Following the hearing, Detective Sergeant Paul Langley, from Lancashire Police, said: 'These two girls thought they were going for a night out and instead were given alcohol and drugs and taken to a strange house where they were subjected to an horrific sexual ordeal at the hands of three much older men.

'What's worse is that this abuse was facilitated by someone the victims believed was their friend.'

Several police forces are currently investigating gangs suspected of abusing young girls.

A damning report which revealed one in four men accused of street grooming young girls for sex is Asian was commissioned after the ringleaders of a gang which struck in Derby were jailed earlier this year.

Ashish Joshi, of Sikh Media Monitoring, said efforts to tackle the problem needed to focus on the Muslim community.

'It's a small element who treat white and Sikh girls as sexual playthings, and we aren't going to tackle it successfully unless the politically correct lobby stop putting up a smokescreen to hide the fact that this issue is about the Muslim community.'
