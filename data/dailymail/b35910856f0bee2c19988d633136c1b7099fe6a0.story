Whistleblower: A sacked PC who leaked details of Andrew Mitchell's pleb outburst said today he would do it again

A PC sacked for revealing that Andrew Mitchell called Downing Street officers 'f****** plebs' has said today he would do it again because the MP believed he was 'untouchable'.

Whistleblower James Glanville, 47, believes the incident two years ago would have been 'covered up' because Scotland Yard  is 'more afraid of upsetting politicians than looking after their own'.

Last week Tory MP Mr Mitchell lost his libel battle for calling police officers 'f****** plebs' who should 'know their place' because they would not let him through the Downing Street gates on his bike.

Mr Glanville, who leaked details of the row in September 2012, was sacked, racked up £13,000 of debt because of spiralling legal costs and the strain also cost him his marriage.

But the diplomatic protection officer, who served for 23 years and received a bravery award for tackling violent burglars, has no regrets about what happened. 

'I'd do it all again tomorrow. I thought the public deserved to know how someone that senior in the Government behaved,' he told The Sun.

'I was incensed by what Andrew Mitchell had said and I knew it would get covered up.

'Mitchell has been allowed to discredit anybody and say whatever he wants. He thought he was untouchable. Now he has been exposed as the bully he is'.

The former Met officer said he was furious because Mr Mitchell had been rude to police officers just days after to PCs were murdered in Manchester by Dale Cregan.

'We're stood there 24/7 in all weathers to protect these people. Why should we put our lives on the line if that's the sort of respect someone like Mitchell has for us?'

Mr Glanville said he had thought it likely no one would take action over the incident, which he heard about a few hours after it happened, so he 'picked up the phone' to the newspaper.

But three other officers have also lost their jobs in the aftermath of the incident, which was said to last no more than a minute.

Counter-action: PC Rowland, pictured last week, has sued Andrew Mitchell over his claims he falsely suggested that he had fabricated his allegations two years ago in a case that has cost at least £3million

Pc Keith Wallis was jailed and dismissed for emailing his MP pretending to have witnessed the confrontation.

Pc Susan Johnson lost her job after she exchanged text messages and a phone call with Mr Glanville around the time he contacted the tabloid, and for failing to report that Wallis had sent her a copy of his email.

Pc Gillian Weatherley, who was on duty on the day of the confrontation between Mr Mitchell and Mr Rowland, was sacked over leaks to the press. She sent a photograph of an email Mr Rowland had sent to his bosses about the row to Mr Glanville.

Mr Glanville, who now works as a car salesman in Essex, has told The Sun's Tom Newton Dunn he was sorry Ms Weatherley was dismissed, insisting she had no idea he had been in contact with the press.

He says that Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe and other management should have protected their workers.

He said: 'The hierarchy should have backed their officers from the outset. But they didn't.' 

Last week Mr Justice Mitting reached the 'firm conclusion' that the 58-year-old MP used the 'politically toxic' word in Downing Street when he was not allowed to cycle through the main vehicle gates.

Mr Mitchell, who resigned as a whip a month after the altercation, denied during his two-week libel action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) that he had said: 'Best you learn your f****** place - you don't run this f****** government - you're f****** plebs.'

He said he would never call a policeman a pleb, 'let alone a f****** pleb', although he agreed he muttered under his breath 'I thought you lot were supposed to f****** help us' - but not directed at the officer.

Mr Mitchell, who faces a hefty legal bill of up to £3million, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' with the ruling. His political career is also in tatters over the incident

In a statement, Scotland Yard said: 'Mr Glanville was dismissed from the MPS without notice, as it was found that he had breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to honesty and integrity; confidentiality; orders and instructions; duties and responsibilities; and discreditable conduct, this included providing inaccurate statements to the investigation team.

'There was no attempt to 'cover up' anything on the part of the MPS.

'Both Mr Mitchell and Pc Rowland had agreed the matter to be concluded shortly after it happened.'
