Tesco has bitten back against both cut-price and upmarket rivals snapping at its heels.

The supermarket’s Finest range has won 22 out of 74 gold medals in the supermarket own-label food ‘Oscars’.

The triumph is particularly sweet for the giant because it regained top spot from budget chain Aldi, which fell to fourth place. But the results suggest Tesco has no room for complacency because second place went to discounter Lidl, which achieved 19 golds.

The own-label food and drink awards are run by retail magazine The Grocer and rely on a combination of expert analysis and hundreds of consumer taste tests. It said: ‘An own-label that sets you apart from rivals is vital. Competition has forced suppliers to raise standards.’

Tesco’s British award winners included its Finest Rannoch Smoked Duck Pate, from Scottish producer Castle MacLellan Foods, which the judges said had a homemade feel married with ‘excellent flavour and texture’.

Gold also went to its Finest Wensleydale Terrine with Cranberry & Blueberry from the Long Clawson Dairy in Leicestershire, which was founded more than 100 years ago and its best known for its blue stilton.

There were also golds for many premium imports such as Finest Italian Pomodorini Tomato sauce. Consumer tests showed it appealed particularly to the over 55s and wealthier ABC1 customers.

Finest Fairtrade Guatemalan Roast and Ground Coffee won gold as did its Butterbean & Roasted Garlic Houmous and its Coquille St Jacques Scallops in Champagne and Bechamel.

Many of the products were praised as being ideal dinner party ingredients, however some fell in to the everyday category such as the frozen British Chunky Maris Piper Oven chips.

The own label food and drink awards are run by The Grocer magazine and are considered particularly prestigious because they rely on a combination of expert analysis and hundreds of consumer taste tests.

The Grocer said: ‘Price is the loudest weapon in the battle for market share, but an own-label offer that sets you apart from your rivals is also vital. Just as military conflict has brought leaps in innovation, competition has forced suppliers to raise standards.’

The awards judge Paul Beresford, managing director of Cambridge Market Research, said: ‘While consumers are turning to discounters for everyday basics, they still seek out treat-worthy but good value purchases.

‘Tesco has clearly found a winning formula for its premium range. The scale of Tesco’s success is a powerful endorsement of the retailer’s push for quality.’

His firm found that Finest products were seen as ‘new and different’ by 67 per cent of consumers, compared with 51per cent for all the other entrants.

Mr Beresford said: ‘The use of 
provenance and variety in names such as Rannoch Smoked Duck Paté and 
Coquille St Jacques Scallops encouraged consumers to try lines based on 
the packaging alone.

‘New 
twists on traditional products and flavours - such as a Salted Caramel 
Sauce and Pork, Honey & Fennel sausages - encouraged wary consumers 
to try without fear of spending on something completely unfamiliar.’

Retailers
 and suppliers entered a record 1,028 products in to the competition, 
including famous names like Harvey Nichols as well as upmarket grocers 
such as Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, where food sales have been 
strong during the recession.

Waitrose
 and M&S entered fewer products than their rivals and made some of 
the shortlists, however neither won any golds. Waitrose is considered 
the darling of the middle classes yet collected just one silver for its 
Manchego, Pepper & Chorizo Tortilla.

Asda managed 13 golds, while Sainsbury’s scored just two and there was one each for Morrisons and the Co-op. One small brand, Today’s, also managed a gold for its packs of Gingerbread Friends.

Tesco’s commercial director, John Scouler, said: ‘Over the last few years we’ve done a huge amount of work to improve our own label products. We are absolutely delighted to have won so many awards for the quality of our food.  

‘Our Finest range is now benchmarked against the very best food on the market and these awards show that we’re getting it right.’
