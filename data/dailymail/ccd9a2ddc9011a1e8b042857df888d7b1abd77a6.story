Treatment: Savannah Snodgrass, who is less than a year old, has a deadly tumour in the left temporal lobe of her brain

An insurance company pulled its funding for an eight-month old baby with cancer at the last minute, denying her treatment at a specialist hospital.

Savannah Snodgrass, the daughter of an Army major who served in Iraq, was born with a deadly brain tumour, which was discovered by doctors in May.

Since her condition was found, Savannah has been treated at the Texas Children's Hospital, and was scheduled for a complicated brain procedure.

But Superior HealthPlan, which provides cover to mother Tessa Snodgrass and her family, then decided not to cover the surgery because the hospital was outside of its 'network'.

They instead referred her to another facility in Austin, Texas.

While Texas Children's hospital has a 90 per cent survival rate for the operation Savannah will undergo, her mother claims that the new facility's rate is just 47 per cent.

Ms Snodgrass, a 38-year-old retired soldier, said she was 'shocked' at the change.

She told FoxNews.com: 'I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time.'

'It's rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young, it so clearly called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies - not just any surgeon.

'Would you accept less than a 50-50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 per cent?'

Savannah's struggle started in March, when she started suffering seizures, at one point being hit by 15 in the space of a single day.

The baby, then just four months old, was taken to specialists who identified the tumour in the left temporal lobe of her brain, which is responsible for speech, vision and other types of perception.

Specialists at Texas Children's hospital then produced a plan for beating the cancer, scheduling several procedures for which, Ms Snodgrass claims, her insurers happily paid.

The switch came last month when Ms Snodgrass was sent a letter which said Texas Children's was not part of her plan, and suggested a new provider.

Dispute: She has been treated in a specialist hospital for months, but insurers Superior HealthPlan suddenly withdrew their support and tired to send her somewhere with a worse track record

Now Superior HealthPlan has insisted that the new provider will be just as good - despite the concerns of Ms Snodgrass.

A statement from the company said: 'Paramount to Superior HealthPlan is helping our members achieve positive health outcomes.

'We are sensitive to the complex and timely concerns of this family and are actively working with them to ensure their daughter receives the highest quality of care... we are confident that our in-network providers have the expertise and resources to give each member the individual care they need.'
