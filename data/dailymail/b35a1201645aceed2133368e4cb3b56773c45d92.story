Donald Trump's dislike for Barack Obama has become so strong that he'd rather praise Saddam Hussein than his country's own president.

The real estate mogul and perpetual potential presidential candidate explained to the crowd at a New Hampshire breakfast frequented by White House wannabes that Iraq has become 'the Harvard of terrorism.'

'Whether you liked Saddam or not,' Trump said Tuesday at St. Anselm College's Politics & Eggs, 'he used to kill terrorists.'

Whoa, did I just say that? Donald Trump took the opportunity of addressing the Politics & Eggs forum at New Hampshire's St. Anselm College to criticize Barack Obama by complimenting Saddam Hussein

The outspoken billionaire seemed to clamor for controversy at the event, where he told attendees leading up to a Q&A to make sure their questions were 'really salacious.'

'It is my real hair,' he joked to the Bedford, New Hampshire crowd.

Trump claimed during Tuesday's that he may seek the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, saying he wants to undo President Barack Obama's legacy.

'You know why? I'm unhappy with the way things are going in America,' the avid Obama critic said in a telephone interview ahead of the speech.

The 67-year-old also took aim at 
potential 2016 contender Chris Christie, according to LA Times 
Washington bureau reporter Mike Memoli.

'It's a very scary situation for Chris,' Trump said. 'It's going to go on for a long time.'

He
 referred, of course, to the New Jersey governor's current Bridgegate 
scandal, which had escalated in recent days with new accusations of high
 level misdeeds in his administration.

'He’s one email away from a disaster,' Trump said. 

'Whether you liked Saddam or not, he used to kill terrorists,' said Trump. He said Iraq is now 'the Harvard of terrorism'

Tricky: The 67-year-old used the forum, which is often visited by potential presidential candidates, to discuss Chris Christie's current scandal and highlight his own foreign policy chops

Trump also showed off his foreign policy chops.

'Mexico is eating our lunch,' he said.

And later: 'Every time I hit a country, I get a call from the prime minister...or sometimes it’s a dictator.'

Trump, who made a fortune building skyscrapers and running casinos and hosts U.S. reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice, has long been a vocal critic of Obama and made waves after demanding proof the president was born in the United States.

The White House released the long-form copy of Obama's birth certificate in 2011 showing that Obama was born in Hawaii.

'He's one email away from a disaster,' Trump said of Christie, who's administration is embroiled in a high-level political controversy

Trump said that he believed the launch of the Affordable Care Act - Obama's signature domestic policy achievement popularly known as Obamacare - was an "abysmal" failure and that Obama had not done enough to shore up the economy during his term.

'No one has any idea what's happening at the top. America is not headed in the right direction, and that worries me,' he said. 'I want to talk about what needs to be done.'

Trump has also hinted he could run for governor of New York in 2014, claiming he has a $200 million war chest available for a campaign if he chooses to challenge Democratic incumbent Andrew Cuomo.

'Every time I hit a country, I get a call from the prime minister...or sometimes it's a dictator,' said Trump perplexingly, after claiming that 'Mexico is eating our lunch'
