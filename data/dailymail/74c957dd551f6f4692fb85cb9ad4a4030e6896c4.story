Chrissy Perkins was diagnosed with stress when she was actually suffering from blood cots

Chrissy
 Perkins was fit, young and had no history of health problems. So when 
the 23-year-old started suffering dizzy spells up to three times a day, 
doctors were baffled.

'The first happened when I was shopping - I suddenly felt faint,' says Chrissy, a charity fundraiser from Swindon, Wiltshire.

'My
 legs went weak and my friend had to hold me up then get me home in a 
taxi. I thought perhaps I just needed a sugar boost, such as a bar of 
chocolate.

'But the dizzy spells kept occurring - sometimes I'd get 
them up to three times a day, then I wouldn't get them for a few weeks 
and think I was getting better.

'I'd feel sick for 20 minutes 
afterwards and my vision would go slightly blurry. Sometimes I'd feel 
just a bit lightheaded, but once I had to crouch down in a corner 
holding on to the carpet because I felt I was falling.'

Chrissy 
visited her GP a few days after the first attack and over the course of 
the next month saw half a dozen specialists, including an eye expert. 
Each suggested a different diagnosis, ranging from iron deficiency to an
 inner ear infection.

She was referred to a psychiatrist when a neurologist insisted her symptoms were stress-related.

'I
 was working as a social worker for a mental health charity and loved my
 job and wasn't stressed at all, but the psychiatrist suggested I give 
it up and  work as a fisherman, perhaps because he thought it was a 
relaxing profession.

'My mum and I just laughed, though when someone tells you the problem is in your subconscious you believe them.'

She was prescribed antidepressants  and beta-blockers, which control anxiety by slowing down the heart rate.

But
 these didn't make her better and she decided to quit her job and move 
in with her mother - by then her legs would shake so uncontrollably she 
was terrified  of falling and was forced to use  a wheelchair.

Then 
in October 2010, six months after her first symptoms, she started to 
experience chest pains and her eyes became swollen. A few weeks later, 
she woke up one morning hallucinating. Her mother rang 999.

She was 
rushed to A&E, where she drifted in and out of consciousness while 
doctors carried out a scan. This revealed the cause of her problems: her
 lungs were filled with blood clots. The clots had blocked the artery 
carrying blood from the heart to the lungs, starving her body of oxygen -
 a condition known as a pulmonary embolism.

The fact Chrissy was 
young and had no underlying health problems meant that the 
life-threatening problem had gone undetected until nearly too late, 
despite her having classic symptoms, such as dizziness and chest pain.

While
 it is not clear where the clots in Chrissy's lungs had originated, 
typically they form in the leg vein (where they are known  as a deep 
vein thrombosis, or DVT), causing redness, swelling or pain. If the 
clot breaks off, it can travel up the vein to the heart and get stuck in
 an artery in the lungs, starving the body of oxygen.

Every year 
blood clots cause 30,000 deaths - official estimates suggest as many as 
25,000 people die from preventable blood clots that develop in hospital.
 This is partly because lying immobile in a hospital bed or on an 
operating table causes the blood to pool and thicken.

Surgery can 
also lead to clots - patients considered at risk are given 
blood-thinning drugs and compression stockings for their hospital stay.

The clots can take some time to form - more than half occur up to 90 days after a stay in hospital. While clots can happen to anyone, the risk increases if you're overweight, which slows down the blood flow.

And pregnant women are more at risk, partly because of the increase in blood-clotting cells.

Blood clots are often regarded as a disease of ageing - rates increase sharply after 45 until 80, though it's not clear why.

Another
 risk factor is the combined oral contraceptive Pill, taken by two 
million women in Britain aged 16 to 49. It contains oestrogen, which 
causes the blood to clot more easily.

Chrissy's doctors told her it was the Pill, which she'd been taking since the age of 18, which had triggered the blood clots.

The
 problem is that many doctors and nurses do not realise that blood clots
 can affect  adults of all ages, not just those over 45, says Professor 
Beverley Hunt, medical director of the charity Lifeblood.Another issue is that many health professionals are unaware a patient can have a blood clot even if their leg isn't swollen.

The
 warning signs include unexplained pain in the leg muscle, such as a 
sharp or achy cramp, but sometimes there are  no symptoms.

'I run a 
clinic for young people and teenagers who have had blood clots and what I
 often hear from them, including those in their 20s, is: “I had a pain 
in my leg and went to a health professional, but they said I was too 
young to have a blood clot,” ' says Professor Hunt.

'Many people are 
under the impression that thrombosis (blood clots) is an older person's 
illness. Yet we have evidence to show this isn't the case.

'We need 
to break the myth that thrombosis is an old people's condition or that 
you're only likely to suffer from blood clots after a long-haul flight. 
The Pill is also a risk factor, for instance. We've learned a lot about 
blood clots in the past five to ten years, but most GPs attended medical
 school before that.

The clots had blocked the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs, starving her body of oxygen

'In old-fashioned textbooks you see someone and
 they have a huge swollen leg, but 80 per cent of leg clots don't cause 
swelling.

'They just cause pain in part of the leg and a lot of doctors are unaware of that.

'More
 education needs to be done to make sure that frontline staff recognise 
the symptoms of thrombosis which, if not treated early, is an 
indiscriminate and devastating killer.' After Chrissy's condition was 
diagnosed, she spent four days in intensive care, where she was given 
the clot-busting drug heparin. She was then put on warfarin to prevent 
new clots.

After ten days in hospital she went home, but it took two
 years for her to recover fully. She has been switched to the mini Pill,
 which doesn't contain oestrogen.

Four years since the pulmonary 
embolism, she feels lucky to be alive. She is fundraising and 
campaigning for Lifeblood to raise awareness to ensure other young 
people get diagnosed quickly.'A clot can happen to anyone and it 
only takes one on the lung to kill you. If my mum hadn't been home that 
day I'd have died,' she says.

'It was only later I discovered the 
hospital had told my friends and family to say goodbye because they 
didn't think I'd survive.

'I'm one of the lucky ones, so I'm passionate about raising awareness to prevent misdiagnosis among younger people.'

What she finds frustrating is that doctors and nurses don't realise that clots can affect young people.'When
 I was on warfarin, I'd get doctors at the clinic in hospital and nurses
 at the GP surgery telling me I shouldn't be taking it because I wasn't 
at risk of clots at my age, even after being diagnosed. It was so 
frustrating.

'People still think it's just a problem that affects older people or long-haul passengers.'

But as she knows from terrifying experience, that's a potentially life-threatening mistake.
