Fears were rising last night that Russia could seek to grab more territory in eastern Europe as Moscow's noose tightened in Crimea with Ukraine troops forced into abject surrender.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden sought to reassure the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that America will defend any NATO member against aggression.

'We're in this with you, together,' he said in Vilnius, amid jitters in three countries overrun by Stalin during the Second World War which only won their freedom with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

He said: 'Russia cannot escape the fact that the world is changing and rejecting outright their behaviour.'

'We're in this with you': U.S. Vice President Joe Biden vowed America will defend any NATO member from aggression as ex-Soviet states expressed concerns over the developments in Crimea

Under threat: Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite told Biden that Putin's annexing of Crimea was a direct threat to regional security

Pressing forward: President Vladimir Putin, pictured on Wednesday, has signed a treaty to annex Crimea

But Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite warned him Vladimir Putin's annexing of Crimea showed 'the use of brute force to redraw the map of Europe', adding: 'This situation is a direct threat to our regional security.'

The sombre mood was reflected by Bulgarian president, Rosen Plevneliev, who said in London: 'What about Lithuania? What about Estonia? We do have Russian communities and minorities there.

'Is it possible in the 21st Century that they can call Moscow - and Moscow will send troops and occupy and annex some part of their territory?'

This came amid reports of FSB secret services agents flooding into Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region of ex-Soviet state Moldova which shares a border with Ukraine.Â 

In recent days the leadership of the region - where Russian troops are believed to be on the ground - has signaled their wish to be integrated into Russia, like Crimea.

The Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov, meanwhile, openly urged the Kremlin to go deeper into Ukraine to 'protect' ethnic Russians.

'The surge in patriotism we are witnessing in Crimea and Russia, which has united everyone irrespective of political views, convictions and political parties, shall spread farther, into southeastern Ukraine,' he said.

Russians in these areas 'have fixed their eyes on us, they are hopeful and they expect our support and assistance. People truly need this,' he insisted.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was 'deeply concerned'  over the spiraling crisis and urged all sides to 'take all possible steps to avoid further escalation', while Nikolai Petrov, professor at the Higher Economic School in Moscow, forecast 'a new Cold War'.

Concern was also rising last night over Russia's bid to steamroller 20,000 Ukrainian troops in Crimea to defect to Moscow, or surrender and be sent back to Kiev.

While many gave up without a fight to prevent bloodshed, the peninsula remained a tinderbox after Ukraine - which refuses to accept the Russian annexation of the Black Sea peninsula - gave permission for its forces to shoot in self-defence.

The Ukrainian naval base in Sevastopol fell without a shot, but 100 loyal servicemen were barricaded inside tonight refusing to bow to the Kremlin's orders.

Later the whereabouts of Ukraine's navy chief, Serhiy Hayduk, were unknown after he was captured by pro-Moscow forces.

Reports that he had been summoned by prosecutors in Sevastopol were denied by the Russians.

Meanwhile, five warships blockaded by the Russians inside Donuzlav Bay were refusing to surrender.

'We're throwing grenades from time to time so that they can't approach us. We have also put up armed guards,' said a commander.

Russian Black Sea fleet commander Aleksandr Vitko warned: 'Hotheads in the current Ukrainian leadership spoke of permission to resort to arms.

'I would like to warn everyone, and above all Ukrainian Navy personnel: God forbid anyone should shoot even a catapult. Don't play with fire. I ask to be taken literally.'

Some Ukrainian naval forces dejectedly filed out of the naval base saying they had nowhere to go after 20 years service. One was in tears as he left.

Putin's spokesman said 'they will have to take a decision' whether to join the Russian armed forces or be sent to Ukraine.

It coincided with Ukraine announcing plans to withdraw troops from Crimea to the mainland on Wednesday night.

'They are not welcome in Crimea,' said local pro-Moscow leader Sergey Aksyonov.

Russia was tonight poised to seize 20 Ukrainian warships.

Ukrainian military inspectors yesterday began an official reconnaissance of two Russian regions for evidence of a massive military build-up indicating a threat of imminent invasion.

The inspection - amid high tension between the two countries - is under an international agreement and gives four Ukrainian military specialists the right to examine Russian operations in Belgorod and Kursk regions.

The team will monitor around 13,000 square kilometres by helicopter to check for 'undeclared military activity'.

'During the inspection the Ukrainian experts will have an opportunity to monitor the specified area - including with the use of road transport and a helicopter flight - to make sure that no military activity, threatening Ukraine, is conducted there,' said Russian official Sergei Ryzhkov.

It follows claims that Russian forces pushed to the frontiers of Ukraine in these and other regions, notably Rostov, which is close to the Ukrainian city of Rostov, scene of a number of pro-Moscow protests.

The inspection over several days is under the Vienna Document of 2011, an agreement between members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Putin denies he will invade mainland Ukraine but despite this assurance, Kiev continues to call up reservists and establish a new National Guard.
