The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court has suspended Justice Seamus McCaffery on full pay while he is investigated over claims that he exchanged 'hundreds' of pornographic emails with the state's Attorney General's Office. 

McCaffrey is also facing claims that he authorised the payment of cash to his wife from personal injury law firms for referring them potential clients. 

Four of the members of Pennsylvania's Supreme Court voted to suspend McCaffrey, one dissented while two others - including McCaffrey - recused themselves. 

He has been suspended on full pay while the investigation continues.  

Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffrey, pictured, is accused of sending or receiving 234 pornographic or sexually explicit emails between late 2008 and 2012 as well as other misconduct 

Justice McCaffrey, top left, has described the investigation as 'a vindictive pattern of attacks' by Chief Justice Ronald Castille, bottom centre, who branded his colleague as 'sociopathic' and the 'focus of ethical lapses' 

Chief Justice Ronald Castille described McCaffrey's attempts to blame others for his behaviour as bordering  on the 'sociopathic'.

In his written opinion, Castille wrote: 'No other justice has failed to live up to the high ethical demands required of a justice of this court or has been the constant focus of ethical lapses to the degree of Justice McCaffery.'

McCaffrey was not available for comment immediately after his suspension, although he had previously apologised for sending the emails which have been described as  'sexually explicit'. 

Earlier McCaffrey described the investigation as a 'cooked-up controversy' and part of 'a vindictive pattern of attacks' by Chief Justice Castille. 

A review of McCaffrey's computer showed he had sent or received 234 emails containing either sexually explicit material or pornography. 

Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane launched the investigation after pornographic emails were discovered in emails belonging to staff in her office from the time of her predecessor Tom Corbett

He wrote: 'I want to reiterate my apology for my lapse in judgment with respect to the offensive emails, personal emails that were made public by the outgoing chief justice,' McCaffery concluded. 

'It was wrong, and I am sorry.'

The 64-year-old Judge was elected to the high court seven years ago and earlier served as a Philadelphia police officer and the US Marine Corps. 

He said: 'Coarse language and crude jokes' were part of his life as a police office and as a Marine.

'That's not an excuse, just a fact,' McCaffery wrote.

Four former employees of the attorney general's office have left government jobs in recent weeks following an investigation by new Attorney General Kathleen Kane. 

The emails were sent between late 2008 and early 2012 when Governor Tom Corbett was the state's attorney general. He denies any knowledge of the emails.    

Corbett's environmental protection secretary, Chris Abruzzo, and a lawyer in the department, Glenn Parno, both resigned after they were named as email participants.

Rick Sheetz, who led the criminal division of the attorney general's office under Corbett, has resigned as a deputy prosecutor in Lancaster County, and Randy Feathers, who supervised investigators in the Jerry Sandusky molestation case, has announced he will soon retire from his appointed position on the state Board of Probation and Parole.  

Former Attorney General Tom Corbett, pictured, who is now governor of Pennsylvania denies all knowledge of the pornographic messages allegedly sent between his staff and Justice McCaffrey between 2008 and 2012

The suspension, with pay, will last until the state Judicial Conduct Board decides whether to bring formal charges against McCaffery under an expedited review process expected to take 30 days. He was elected as a Democrat to the Supreme Court in 2007.

Possible further disciplinary action could include removal from the bench and loss of his license to practice law.

The main issue cited by the court in its decision was that McCaffery exchanged 'hundreds' of pornographic emails with lawyers in the Pennsylvania attorney general's office during the years that Tom Corbett, now the governor, was attorney general.

Corbett himself has not been linked to the porn emails and in recent weeks has forced several former lawyers from the attorney general's office who were implicated in the scandal to resign their current state jobs.

The porn emails, which the court called 'highly disturbing,' came to light during an investigation by the current attorney general, Kathleen Kane, into how Corbett handled the child sex abuse allegations against Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach of Pennsylvania State University.

Also mentioned in the court's opinion was an allegation, first reported last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer, that McCaffery authorized hundreds of thousands of dollars in referral payments by personal injury law firms to his wife and chief aide, Lise Rapaport, for sending them clients.

The court also cited an alleged action by McCaffery to have the Philadelphia Traffic Court fix a ticket his wife received, as well as allegedly improper attempts by the justice to influence assignment of judges in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.

McCaffery denies any wrongdoing in both these cases.
