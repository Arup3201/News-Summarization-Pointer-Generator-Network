A convicted sex offender was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fathering a child with an 11-year-old girl in western New York.

Jacky Berry of Niagara Falls pleaded guilty on charges of having a sexual relationship with the girl in 2010.

The girl, now 16, gave birth to a son in 2011. Authorities say DNA testing confirmed Berry, 53, was the father.

Berry also was convicted in 1990 for sexually abusing a 7-year-old girl and served eight years in prison.

The Buffalo News reported that Berry offered an apology in court Friday but refused to be interviewed by a probation officer.

'He didn't feel there was anything to add,' defense attorney James Faso Jr. said. 

'He had a child with this child, and feels terrible he made her grow up faster than she should grow up.'

Judge Sara Sheldon also imposed 20 years of post-release supervision for Berry, saying, 'This is in essence a life sentence.'
