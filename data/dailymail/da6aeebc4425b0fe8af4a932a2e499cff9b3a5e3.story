For ski-lovers, there is nothing better than coming straight out your door and being on the slopes, surrounded by rolling mountains and fresh snow.

For two lucky individuals, they will be offered the chance to go one step further, and stay at the top of the world-famous Holmenkollen ski-jump in Oslo, Norway.

The unusual competition aims to turn the room at the top of the jump into a penthouse apartment for guests so they can enjoy two nights of luxury with panoramic view of Oslo, under the Northern Lights, before checking out in the slickest way possible - via a zip-line.

The ski-jump penthouse apartment is usually where athletes meet to prepare before a jump and will be used by skiers at the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup, held at Holmenkollen later this month (March, 14-15).

Jeanette Hansen, in charge of operations at Holmenkollen, calls the penthouse competition, which is being hosted on Airbnb, a crazy idea that became a reality.

She said: 'This is a wonderfully quirky idea coming to life, and a perfect way to round off the ski jump season after the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup.

'It's a great way to showcase one of the top tourist destinations in Norway to a world of travellers, and we can't wait to welcome the guests to arguably the penthouse with the best view of our city.'

The ski jump was officially opened on March 3, 2010. The start house soars around 64 meters (210ft) above the ground and the construction comprises of 100 tons of steel.
