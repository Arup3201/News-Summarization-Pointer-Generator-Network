A pill to combat obesity is a step closer today after scientists discovered cells that transform 'bad' fat to 'good'.

The cells, known as ILC2s, are involved in converting white fat, which causes people to put on weight, into brown fat, which helps burn excess energy.

The U.S. researchers believe that by targeting the body's metabolic pathways, where these cells work, could help combat obesity.

They said the breakthrough could lead to a new way of treating obesity-related diseases.

Scientists at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York have discovered a specific type of cell, known as ILC2s, help convert white or 'bad' fat into 'good' brown fat. They believe the study could pave the way for a pill to treat obesity, and help combat obesity-related diseases

The human body has two types of fat tissue. 

When a person eats too many calories without burning them off, they are stored as white fat cells.

That is what causes a person to put on weight.

Brown fat cells burn excess energy and subsquently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells. 

The new study found ILC2s, which live in white fat tissue and limit the development of obesity by increasing energy levels, play a part in controlling weight gain.

They help transform white 'bad' fat into brown 'good', in turn helping combat diabetes, heart disease and other life-threatening conditions linked to obesity. 

Past studies have revealed problems with the function of these cells has been found to cause obesity in mice.

But more recent experiments on white fat tissue have revealed the abnormalities are also present in humans and have an impact on energy metabolism. 

This new piece of research found ILC2s stimulates the browning of white fat in response to a signalling protein called IL-33.

The new research was carried out by researchers at New York's Weill Cornell Medical College.

Professor David Artis and colleagues also showed that when mice are injected with IL-33 they accumulated more ILC2s in their white fat, which burned up calories and decreased their weight compared with animals not given the treatment. 

White fat cells, right, accumulate in the body when a person eats too many calories, but fails to burn them off. Brown fat cells, left, burn excess energy, and help reduce the size and number of white fat cells, thus helping a person to lose weight

One in four adults in England is obese and these figures are set to climb to 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women by 2050.

Obesity and diabetes already costs the UK over £5 billion every year which is likely to rise to £50 billion in the next 36 years.

As well as helping people to lose weight a drug which turned white cells into brown cells would reduce the chance of developing type 2 diabetes and protect against heart disease.

Professor Artis, of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said: 'Here we identify ILC2s in human white adipose tissue and demonstrate decreased ILC2 responses are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice.

'Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in white adipose tissue and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure.'
