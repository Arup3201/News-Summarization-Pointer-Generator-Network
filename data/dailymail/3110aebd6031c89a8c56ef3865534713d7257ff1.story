The families of 96 people killed in the Hillsborough tragedy will see thousands of official documents relating to the disaster for the first time today.

The Hillsborough Independent Panel has been overseeing the release of previously unpublished papers from around 80 organisations including the government, police, emergency services, Sheffield City Council and the South Yorkshire coroner.

The families of the 96 football fans who died in Britain's deadliest sporting disaster will be the first to see more than 400,000 pages.

Big day: An independent report is expected to condemn the responses of the authorities to the Hillsborough disaster where 96 football fans were crushed to death in 1989

Statement: David Cameron is today expected to issue an apology to the families

Prime Minister David Cameron will 
address MPs in the House of Commons and the documents will be uploaded 
to a website for viewing by the general public.

A report explaining the contents of 
the documents will be published by the panel, chaired by the Bishop of 
Liverpool, the Rt Rev James Jones.

The 96 Liverpool supporters died in a
 crush at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium on April 15 1989 
where their team were to meet Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semi-final.

A report into the disaster by Lord 
Justice Taylor, published in 1990, found that the main reason for the 
disaster was a failure of 'police control' but the Crown Prosecution 
Service decided there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution.

The victims' families say it is an 
injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully 
accountable for the disaster. They believe a major incident plan was 
never initiated by South Yorkshire Police and fans in the Leppings Lane 
end were denied emergency medical attention.

The families also dispute the 
findings of an inquest into the deaths, which ruled that the victims 
were all dead, or brain dead, by 3.15pm and which subsequently recorded a
 verdict of accidental death.

Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, who was in charge of the club on that tragic day, said: 'I just hope that after all this time the families get a great deal of solace from whatever comes out.

'The way they have conducted themselves over the last 23 years and the dignity that they have shown has never been anything short of remarkable and they’ve got the full admiration of myself and many, many others for that.

'Now though, they need to be given the answers to the questions that they have been asking. All we can do is hope that it is as positive an outcome as possible given the difficult ­circumstances and if they are able to take some solace from the information that they receive then it will be the very least that they deserve.'

Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the 
Hillsborough Families Support Group, said they hope the documents will 
answer some of the questions they have about the causes and aftermath of
 the tragedy.

'This is what the families and the 
fans have been fighting for 23 years. Without the truth you cannot 
grieve and where there is deceit, you get no justice,' Mrs Aspinall, 65,
 said.

The families will see the documents 
at Liverpool Cathedral and are being advised by two of Britain's best 
known lawyers, Michael Mansfield QC and Lord Falconer.

It is expected the families will meet in the coming days to decide what action to take, if any, following the disclosures.

Painful: Margaret Aspinall, chairman  of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that there had been 'a massively orchestrated cover-up'

The panel was created by then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith following the 20th anniversary of the disaster in April 2009.

Central to the panel's work is to 
prepare and publish a comprehensive report based on in-depth research 
into the documents to 'add to public understanding of the tragedy, its 
circumstances and its aftermath'.

Labour MP Andy Burnham, who has 
campaigned on behalf of the families, warned that the disclosures in the
 report would be ‘more shocking than many people realise.’ He said: ‘There will be many individuals with questions to answer.. But the truth will have its own power.

'I know enough about Hillsborough to 
know a national apology from the Prime Minister is justified. I hope Mr 
Cameron responds in the right way.

'I
 get the feeling the disclosure will be more shocking than many people 
realise. The closer we get, I’m confident the full truth will be told. 
That is an enormous thing.'

History: The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed

Anne Williams, who lost her 15 year old son in the tragedy, has evidence that her son was still alive at 4pm.

Mr
 Burnham described the cut-off point as ‘sheer cruelty’. ‘I, like the 
families, cannot accept a verdict of accidental death,’ he said.

The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families’ long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed.

Leaked documents earlier this year found that senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the disaster.

In
 a briefing paper seen by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, at 
least one Liverpool-based policeman said he was ‘ashamed’ of the 
spectators’ behaviour.

The briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry, which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground.

It said opening an exit gate just before kick-off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘pen’ on the terraces, causing the fatal crush.

The report is widely expected to hold South Yorkshire police to account for refusing to accept responsibility for the disaster and instead falsely putting the blame on drunk and ticketless Liverpool supporters.

The findings are likely to trigger an overwhelming demand for fresh inquests into deaths.
