Head bowed, handcuffed and surrounded by police, the wife of a millionaire Australian podiatrist killed in the Bahamas arrives at court where she was later charged with his murder.

The striking image was of Donna Vasyli, 54, who appeared in court accused of violently stabbing her husband Phillip to death last week.

She has been in custody since the body of the 59-year-old was found with numerous stab wounds in the couple's luxury home in Old Fort Bay, a high-end community just west of Nassau, the Bahamas' capital.

Police removed the 59-year-old's body from his house last Tuesday morning as his wife was questioned

Local police said the married father-of-two had been dead for seven hours before a worker found him.

Detectives took Mr Vasyli's wife, Donna, into custody following the discovery, saying she was a person of interest in the investigation.

She is now said to have hired the legal services of high profile local lawyers Elliot Lockhart QC and Murrio Ducille.

Bahamian newspaper The Tribune's website includes video footage showing a handcuffed Donna Vasyli apparently arriving at court flanked by security personnel. 

Mr Vasyli established three podiatry clinics in Sydney and later founded an orthotic footwear company that sells Vionic with Orthaheel Technology products in the US, the UK and elsewhere. 

He set up his first practice in western Sydney and had lived in the Bahamas with his wife and two children for at least 15 years. 

In his 30-year career, Mr Vasyli has treated more than 50,000 people and established three Sydney practices, according to his website. He has since sold the businesses.

Donna Vasyli is the mother of Mr Vasyli's two children, Aron and Lauren.
