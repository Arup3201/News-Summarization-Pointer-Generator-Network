This Yogi might be smarter than the average bear, but he sure doesn't eat healthier.

A couple in British Columbia, Canada, captured video of a black bear raiding their freezer for a pie - after tossing out several packages of vegetables first.

Sandy Lewis, the owner of Powers Creek Retreat in West Kelowna, told Castanet.net that she had noticed food was going missing from her outdoor fridge and freezer for weeks.Â

Yogi the bear was caught red-pawed rummaging through a freezer in British Columbia

Yogi tossed several packages of veggies as he raided the freezer. On this day, he apparently had a sweet tooth

However, she was confused, because there was usually no mess. She would just find the door open an items missing.

She set up a camera and caught the culprit, erm, red-pawed.

'You could tell he had been in there before and the first time he opened the lid probably whacked him on the head,' Ms Lewis told Castanet.net.

'This time, he pushes it open and looks to make sure it doesn't hit him.'

Mrs Lewis says the bear has been hanging around the camp for years.

He never bothers any of the people or animals - he just breaks into the trash sometimes.

After finding his pie, this beast proves he's smarter than the average bear by making a hasty retreat

His freezer raids are a relatively recent caper, though none of his antics are too bothersome, Mrs Lewis says.

'We've seen him out in the pasture with the horses, rolling around in the grass - the horses don't even care about him,' she said.

'He's very timid when it comes to humans, he always runs away.'

He carefully opened the door - even making sure it didn't swing back and hit him in the head
