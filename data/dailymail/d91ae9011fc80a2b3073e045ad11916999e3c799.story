A man abducted by his grandparents at the age of five lives next door to them with his new wife and is preparing to be a father himself.

The impression of a close and happy family life was emerging in the case of Richard Landers Jr, now  24, who was kidnapped by his grandparents as a young child.

Police found the grandparents and Landers almost 19 years after he went missing in an operation, praised by his parents, Lisa Harter and Richard Landers Sr, who had almost given up hope of seeing him again.

But both Landers and his new wife have praised rather than criticized his parents. In a Facebook post Bobbie Landers said his grandparents kept her husband 'safe' as a child.

'His
"grandparents" didn't follow the law, but they did what was right. 
Sometimes, our US laws don't help or protect the people they should. He 
was 5. He remembers his birth parents and what they were like,' it said.

'He had been living under his 
grandparents care since he was a 6 month old baby. He was where he 
wanted and needed to be to be safe and become the man he is today, my 
husband and best friend.'

Rather than the appearance of someone held against his will, Landers, who changed his name to Michael himself at age 18, has defended the grandparents who kidnapped and raised him.

He is now preparing to be a father himself with his wife Bobbie, who has two sons from a previous relationship.

They all live on one plot of land in Long Prairie, just outside Browerville, Minnesota and the young couple have been happily posting on Facebook about the upcoming birth of their child.

In one post Bobbie writes: 'Mike had a girls name picked out 
since he was younger so I feel like that's a sign too...he wants a lil tomgirl 
and having 2 boys, I can't really see myself having a girly girl...can't wait 
till we can find out!'

They are clearly close to Landers grandparents who live alongside them under the aliases Raymond Michael Iddings and Susan Kay Iddings rather Richard E. 
and Ruth A. Landers as they were called at the time of the abduction.

Overwhelmed: Michael Landers has been shocked by the reaction to his case. His wife, Bobby, pictured left, is pregnant and both have defended his grandparents who abducted him

Raymond Iddings has worked since 1999 
as a herdsman at Twin Eagle Dairy in nearby Clarissa, where owner 
Patrick Lunemann described him as a 'dedicated, faithful' employee. 
Lunemann said he was in shock when he read a story about the case.

He
said Iddings plays guitar at his church, and recalled a day last summer
when the couple brought their instruments to play for dairy workers. He
said he knew Michael slightly, saying he stopped in occasion - perhaps 
to drop off Iddings' lunch if he had forgotten it.

'(Landers)
works at an auto parts place. That fits him perfectly, because Ray is 
kind of a motorhead and Michael is the same way,' Lunemann said.

But behind the image of a close and happy family living in a small town, the couple had a secret which has now been revealed.

Landers' grandparents fled with five-year-old Richard during a custody dispute with his mother, Lisa Harter in July 1994 from Wolcottville, Indiana.

Harter, who has mild developmental disabilities, divorced Landers' father. His parents obtained custody after Harter moved into a group home that could not accommodate children according to an attorney for Landers' mother,  Richard Muntz.

After a while, she moved into an 
apartment and gained custody of her son on weekends, and she filed a 
petition to expand her custody rights when she remarried, he said

'The judge gave her custody on a trial
basis, and before she could get him, that's when they left,' Muntz added.

He said the grandparents withdrew $5,000 out of a home equity line, went out for breakfast and left town.

'The trail on this case went cold the day they disappeared. There was no trace of them after they left the restaurant,' he said.

The grandparents were charged with 
misdemeanor interference with custody, which was bumped up to a felony 
in 1999. But the charge was dismissed in 2008 after the case went cold.

Investigators
reopened the case in September after a conversation between Richard 
Harter, Lisa Harter's new partner, and an Indiana State Police detective who
attended the same church prompted another search of Landers' Social 
Security number.

That turned
up a man with the same number and birthday with an address in Long 
Prairie.

Indiana
State Police then contacted Minnesota law enforcement agencies, which 
began investigating along with the FBI and the Social Security 
Administration.

Sheriff Peter Mikkelson said the case will now be forwarded to federal 
authorities for possible charges.

Landers, pictured for the first time outside the family plot on Friday, defended his grandparents although it is not clear how much of his back-story he was told.

In a posting, believed to be a message from Landers' Facebook account to the Minneapolis 
television station KARE's Facebook page he said they did well be him.

'For you people who jump 
to conclusions you should find out the whole story I was where I needed 
to be. My `grandparents' were in the the right I don't care what anyone 
else thinks,' he says.

According to court records, Landers 
applied for the name change himself in November 2006. The application 
doesn't say why he requested the change.

Other witnesses from the time have also defended the grandparents.

John R. Russell, who spent 
several months investigating the disappearance with the LaGrange County 
Sheriff's Department in Indiana, said Landers' mother and stepfather were 
unemployed and lived in a car at the time.

Overjoyed: Richard Landers Sr has spoken of his relief that his son has been found. He says he hopes to re-establish contact with both his son and his parents

Vanished: In 1994 Richard Wayne Lander Jr disappeared at the age of five from Wolcottville, Indiana before he was found 19 years later at the age of 24 living in Minnesota

'These
people (the grandparents) were nice people. It was wrong for them to do
it, but I can understand why,' Russell said. 'But I also didn't think 
the child would be in any danger at all with them.'

Harter's attorney has refuted the claims and said she spent 
only three days living in a car and it was with Landers' biological 
father.

Both parents said they were delighted following the news that their son had been found. 

Richard Harter said his wife was 'the happiest woman on earth' on hearing the news he was found.

'We always just kept it in the back 
of our minds that we believed we were going to see him again,' said 
Richard Landers Sr, who was speaking to KARE after hearing the news.

'Until I get to actually walk up and say hello to him again, I don't know if it's going to be real,' he added. He has also said that he hopes to re-establish contact with his parents.

A spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota, Jeanne Cooney, said charges in such a case could be related to non-custodial kidnapping, whether the child was exploited, abused, trafficked or being used to obtain benefits.

The small town is buzzing with the news. Rich Wall, a retired jeweler, said some residents speculated that some people knew of Landers' history but kept quiet. He said it was the most notable news since a grisly triple homicide there in 2003.

'My grandson called last night and said, `Long Prairie made the news again,' Wall said.
