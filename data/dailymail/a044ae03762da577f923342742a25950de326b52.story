Ashley Cole's return to first-team action for Roma proved short-lived after the veteran left back was forced off during his side's Coppa Italia quarter-final win against Empoli.

The 34-year-old, whose last appearance for the Italian giants came in a league win against Atalanta on November 22, looked dazed and confused after receiving an accidental kick to his chin from Empoli midfielder Matias Vecino midway through the first half.

Cole was carried off on a medical buggy following the collision, and didn’t return to the field with Jose Cholevas replacing him on 24 minutes.

Despite enduring that setback, Rudi Garcia’s team – who are searching a record-breaking 10th trophy in this competition - went into the half-time interval with a one-goal lead courtesy of a Juan Iturbe goal.

But the hosts were unable to hold on that lead in normal time as  Simone Verdi struck late on for the visitors forcing the game into extra-time.

Garcia's side did run out eventual winners though, with Daniele De Rossi's converting from the spot with six minutes remaining.
