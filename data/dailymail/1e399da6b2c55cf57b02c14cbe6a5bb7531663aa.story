The City of Light is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side.

But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way.

Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys.

The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris

Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris.

He said: ‘When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film.

‘We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.’

Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before.

Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets

He said: ‘My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.’

The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together.

The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines.

Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images

Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography 

A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge.

More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football.

As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell.

Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris

A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets.

Eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons, a boat travelling under a bridge – which ties Paris’ beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together – and a casual shot of the Eiffel Tower.

Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation.

Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it

Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality

‘It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the "texture" of the image,’ he said.

‘I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect. This was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening.’

Sean’s work is available on his Facebook page and the original video can be viewed here.
