Saturday Night Live addressed the lack of diversity among this year's crop of Oscar nominees in their cold open this week.

In the sketch, a young boy, played by Pete Davidson, got some help writing a paper on Martin Luther King Jr. from the ghost Martin Luther King Jr., played by Keenan Thompson.

When he heard how things were going in the country these days however, Mr. King was none too happy with his legacy.

Mr. King is initially disappointed to learn that although there are many Boulevards named after him, they are not in 'nice areas with gardens,' and then even more upset when he learns that though there is a holiday in his memory, most people just use it as a day to get off of work.

He gets very excited however when he learns there has been a movie made about his life, called Selma.

'I guess that will be nominated for a lot of Oscars, right?' asks King.

When Davidson just sighs and looks at him, King responds by saying; 'Oh that mountain is getting really high.' 

Davidson does however tell King that protests are continuing in this country, just like the ones he led decades before.

Then, Davidson tells King how people protest these days.

'It's really easy now,' he explains.

'You just take your phone here, push this Twitter button, then type in #IAmFerguson, or #WereAllBlack, or #Blessed. And then you're done.'

A confused King responds by asking; 'That's how you protest?'

He then adds; 'Oh my God, that mountain is miles away.'
