Koala’s are often regarded as Australia’s cuddliest critter, but a recent video from Adelaide shows they have a hostile side, too.

Vision has surfaced showing two of the mammals holding on to the same limb of a gum tree when one rushes the other and grapples it from the branch, sending it plunging several metres onto the ground.

Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia the behaviour is commonplace during the end of the mating season, when the animals argue over breeding.

The two koalas are on the same branch when the male rushes towards the female and begins to wrestle her off the branch

The female can be heard squealing in horror as the male tussles her off the branch

‘The darker one is the male and the other is the female. The male tried to approach her for breeding, but she was not interested. ’

The female koala can heard squealing in protest as the male approaches and wrestles it off the branch, sending it plummeting onto the ground with a crash.

Momentarily dazed, the animal wanders away towards another tree, seemingly unharmed.

Jones said that while females can often defend themselves against their male counterparts, the male in the video was much larger and stronger.

‘The females would be interested in season, but since it is coming to the end of that time they generally decline the advance.’

The clip, which was captured by an onlooker in the Adelaide Hills, was uploaded to YouTube last week.
