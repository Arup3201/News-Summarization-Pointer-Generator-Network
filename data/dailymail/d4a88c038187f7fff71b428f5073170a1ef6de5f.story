Children broadcasted their own impromptu late night show complete with obscenities after breaking into a radio station in a remote town in Western Australia.

The youngsters, aged between eight and 14, broke into the buildings of the Wangki Yupurnanupurru community radio station in Fitzroy Crossing last week.

Station manager Angie Stahl told the ABC she had previously given the children lessons in community radio, and they figured out how to make the studio broadcast live.

Angie Stahl taught the children basic training which was enough for them to get on air and run their own show complete with obscenities

‘So the cops got a call from an outlaying station ringing up to say, ‘I think you've got some kids on the radio, they're busy swearing, you'd better go bust them”.

Police officers arrived a short time after the group went on air when a concerned listener called them to complain about the bad language being used.

Ms Stahl said the children appeared to have entered through a window in her house which adjoins the studios.

‘They were making themselves at home - no damage was done, they were just hanging around the house cooking some chicken nuggets, and they dyed their hair red from some hair dye I had lying around,’ she said.

‘But after just enjoying the quiet space of the house, they found the keys to the radio studio and decided to let themselves in.’

The equipment the children used to air their show and  Ms Stahl, left with a station colleague, said she was angry at first when she discovered the children had broken into the station but now sees the funny side of it

Fortunately for the mischievous children, it was agreed between the parents and elders that they children would receive ‘sorry tasks’ instead of charged.

‘I was quite angry at the time but I'm more relaxed about it now and can see the funny side,’ Ms Stahl said.

‘Criminal charges might have had serious consequences for a couple of the kids, so we decided we could work it out amongst ourselves, and that worked out a lot better.’

Ms Stahl said the children end up with careers in broadcasting.

‘They'd come in a couple of times before to do a couple of shows and programs, so I'd taught them the basics,’ she said. ‘So it's good to see the knowledge was used correctly.’

The Wangki Yupurnanupurru community radio station is located in Fitzroy Crossing, in the north of Western Australia
