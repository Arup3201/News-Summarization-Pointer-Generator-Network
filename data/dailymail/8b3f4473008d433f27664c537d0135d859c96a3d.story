The NHS is owed £62million by so-called 'health tourists' who have yet to settle their bills, despite receiving thousands of pounds worth of care in Britain's hospitals.

The  bill, built up over five years and across 40 different trusts, suggests previous estimates on the amount owed were far below the mark.

An investigation by the Sunday Times has found people who owe money for dialysis, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants.

One person alone is understood to owe more than £420,000 at Guy's and St Thomas' for treatment for hemophilia.

The investigation also uncovered a new mother who posed alongside Health Minister Daniel Poulter to mark the reopening of a maternity ward has yet to pay the bill she incurred.

Caroline Nyadzayo, 34, owes £3,000, more than two years after she gave birth at Norfolk and Norwich University Trust.
