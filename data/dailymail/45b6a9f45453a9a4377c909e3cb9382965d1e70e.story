A pensioner is lucky to be alive after blundering doctors failed to notice four times she had dentures stuck in her throat, leaving them lodged there for an amazing nine weeks.

Umit Maddock, 46, of Braintree, Essex, has claimed it is a 'miracle' that her mother, Nermin Keating, survived after she swallowed her false teeth.

Despite checking her over on four occasions doctors failed to spot the obstructing top set of 11 teeth.

Astonishing: Umit Maddock, with her mother, Nermin Keating, whose dentures got stuck in her throat for 9 weeks and doctors failed four times to spot them

When the dentures first disappeared in early November 2012, science teacher Mrs Maddock assumed they had fallen out somewhere in the house that she shares with her mother.

But when Nermin started feeling unwell, Mrs Maddock feared the worst and took her to St Michael's Hospital, Braintree the following day where doctors assured her there was no way that the teeth had been swallowed.

They instead diagnosed her with a lung infection and prescribed her with antibiotics.

During the following nine weeks, her mother continued to have problems, especially when she was eating.

The pair visited Mount Chambers Surgery in Coggeshall three times Between November 13 and December 3 yet still the dentures were not spotted.

It was only on their fourth visit to try to resolve why the pensioner was still unwell that a doctor Dr Noel Pereirafinally spotted them.

Rescue: After nine weeks lodged in her throat Nermin Keating was rushed to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, where doctors removed the top set of 11 teeth

Mrs Keating was immediately referred to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital where medics used a set of forceps to remove them.

'It's a miracle that mum even survived for so long with the dentures down her throat,' Mrs Maddock said.

'I can't quite believe what has happened - I was just so relieved when they came out.

'I almost feel guilty about what happened but my friends are telling me that I did what I could.'

Mrs Maddock quit her teaching job at Alec Hunter Humanities College, Braintree, so she could become a full-time carer to her mother who has dementia and struggles to speak.

Peter Hadfield, the practice manager at the Mount Chambers Surgery said he had never seen anything like it in his career.

He said: 'It was an extraordinary find - very unusual.

'The patient had difficulty swallowing for quite some time and she had been seen by the out-of-hours service but her condition kept changing and nobody ever suspected the obstruction was a set of dentures.

'I have worked for all my career and I have never heard anything like this.'
