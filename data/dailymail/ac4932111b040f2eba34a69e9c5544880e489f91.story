The Irish tourist who was knocked unconscious by his brother in a one-punch attack is conscious and no longer on life support. 

Barry Lyttle, 33, was arrested and charged after allegedly punching his younger brother Patrick, 31, at about 3am on Saturday in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district.

Patrick was rushed to hospital and was in a critical but stable condition while in an induced coma for most of the week. 

But on Friday afternoon, St Vincent's Hospital spokesman David Faktor told Daily Mail Australia there had been 'good news'.

Charged: Barry Lyttle, 33, was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm and was granted bail on Monday

'He's conscious. He's still in ICU (the Intensive Care Unit) but he's stable,' Mr Faktor said. 

'He's been taken off life support. He's sitting up.'

Brother Barry and father Oliver have been a constant presence by Patrick's bedside in Sydney's inner east. Mr Faktor was unable to comment on whether Patrick was talking. 

After a weekend spent in police custody, Barry was granted bail at Sydney Central Court on Monday charged with reckless grievous bodily harm. 

A tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters on Monday his sons had loved each other since they were children.

'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 

'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went (in court today) and their sympathy.'  

As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities. He is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol.

He is required to live with his Australian aunty at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day. He will face Downing Centre Local Court once more on January 20.  

Barry and Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June.

The siblings from Belfast in Ireland had been dining with their father earlier in the evening before the two young men went to a bar for a drink.

Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath.

Paramedics treated Patrick at the scene before taking him to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.

Police described the incident as a 'family tragedy' and Detective Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald said the 'pain in their father's eyes was indescribable'. 

The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and Barry reportedly screamed in shock and distress when he realised the extent of his brother's injuries. 

Alcohol was not a factor in the fight with Barry's blood alcohol concentration reading in the low range. The fight was said to have occurred after a minor argument. 

In a series of  Facebook posts before the incident, the brothers had previously expressed how excited they were about their Australian reunion.

Patrick has been travelling around Australia for the past six months and often received messages from Barry advising him to 'stay safe'.

In anticipation of the two meeting up in Sydney Barry posted to Patrick on Facebook: 'Not be long bro! See ya soon. Safe trip the pair of ya!' 

Barry wiped away tears as he sat unshaven in a blue jumper in the dock as agonised relatives, including his father Oliver, watched the court proceedings

A little over a month before the incident, Barry Lyttle messaged his little brother Patrick, who was travelling around Australia and told him to keep safe

The brothers were eagerly waiting their reunion in Australia in January. Patrick had been travelling around the country since early June 

In October Barry Lyttle again told his brother Patrick to say safe via a message on Social Media
