Mad Men's most beautiful women graced the red carpet at the Emmy Awards on Sunday night.

Not quite so glamorous! The actress wore a dressing gown in host Jimmy Kimmel's opening skit

The actress, who was accompanied by her husband Geoffrey Arend, wore red lipstick to match her fiery hair. 

She also made a surprise appearance in the ceremony's opening skit, albeit in rather less glamorous attire.

No gong: The star was up for best supporting actress but lost to Downton Abbey's Maggie Smith

The
clip featured host Jimmy Kimmel crying about a bad botox job in the 
women's bathroom as Christina, Mindy Kaling, Zooey Deschanel, Kathy 
Bates and Lena Dunham - in her birthday suit, eating birthday cake - 
punched him back into shape.

Meanwhile, fellow Mad Men star January Jones, 34, who missed last 
year's event because she'd just given birth to her son Xander, made a 
stunning return in an elaborate Zac Posen confection.

Blonde ambition: Elizabeth Moss, who recently bleached her hair, in Dolce & Gabbana. Right, with Jon Hamm

Jessica Pare, 29, who plays Don Draper's new wife Megan, opted for a striking white Jason Wu dress and Bulgari jewels.

Elisabeth Moss, 30, turned heads in a
printed, peplumed Dolce & Gabbana gown and had her newly bleached 
blonde hair swept to one side.

Budding fashionista Kiernan Shipka, who plays Sally Draper, looked stylish and age appropriate in a custom Zac Posen frock.

Jon Hamm meanwhile was joined by his 
longtime love Jennifer Westfeldt - he wore an Armani tuxedo while she 
stepped out in a J. Mendel dress.

While the stars shone brightly on the
red carpet, there was disappointment for the cast after failing to win 
any major categories.

The show was a hot favourite having taken the best drama series Emmy for four consecutive years.

It was scooped this year by the hugely popular Showtime programme Homeland.

Homeland's Damian Lewis and Claire Danes also beat out Hamm and Moss in the best actor and actress in a drama category.

Christina was up for best supporting actress but lost to Downton Abbey's Maggie Smith. 

The 64th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on 5USA at 10pm on Monday 24th September.
