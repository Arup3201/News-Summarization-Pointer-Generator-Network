MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace has been fined £1,300 for speeding at 82mph through a 50mph zone in his flashy Jaguar sports car.

The millionaire TV star from Whitstable, Kent, was snapped by a police safety camera van driving his £85,000 Jaguar XKR convertible in April this year.

Mr Wallace, 47, a former fruit and vegetable seller turned plush restaurant owner, admitted driving 32mph above the speed limit in his high-powered sports car.

The millionaire TV star admitted in court to driving over the speeding limit

The Jaguar can accelerate from 0-62mph in a cool 4.6 seconds and the top speed is limited to 155mph.

Mr Wallace was driving along a stretch of dual carriageway on the A240 passing the village of Detling near Maidstone, Kent on April 22.

Ten people have been killed or seriously injured on the stretch of road where he was caught.

The top chef, who did not attend his court appearance, was fined £1330, given six penalty points on his licence and ordered to pay £85 costs.

Katherine Barrett, Communications Officer for Kent & Medway Safety Camera Partnership, today said: 'Safety cameras operate at sites where people have been killed or seriously injured.

'On this stretch of road from Maidstone towards the County Showground there were 8 people killed or seriously injured within the signed camera area before the site was installed and 2 people in the last three years.'

She insisted: 'We do not want to catch people speeding.

'We would like them to drive within the speed limits to as to reduce the number of crashes and casualties.

'We offer Speed Awareness courses to drivers who are within a certain threshold.

'However, excessive speed cases such as this are referred to court.'

The news comes after Mr Wallace revealed in his new autobiography how he was abused by his babysitter's husband when he was eight years old.

He said the man, who was in his 60s, kissed  him on the mouth after telling him he would 'show you what happens when you get a girlfriend'.

He told how he clearly remembers his 'hot, stinking, tobacco breath' 
before adding: 'I turned to jelly, in a state of total confusion.' Mr Wallace said he fell victim to the man, called George, while he was living in Peckham, south London.

Mr Wallace, who has a 15-year-old daughter Libby and a son Tom, 18,also revealed how he was 'scared of marrying again' after splitting from third wife Heidi, 30, in March after just 14 months of wedlock.

Soon after the break-up, he had been openly telling diners at his Wallace and Co restaurant in Putney, South West London, how much he stills loved her.

Mr Wallace, who had been separated from his second wife Denise for eight years when he met Heidi, told the Daily Mail at the time: ‘I’ve had a terrible week.

'It’s all over Twitter. I’m in bits, I love my wife. I don’t know what’s gone wrong. She’s an amazing woman.

‘It’s all gone mad. It went wrong about three months ago. We knew there was something wrong. We want different things.

'We both have images of each other, I don’t know if they were right. I had an image of her and she had one of me but whether they were right...'

He insisted that the age gap – at 30, Heidi is 17 years his junior – was not a factor in the split.

He has now opened his heart on his blossoming romance with his new girlfriend, 27-year-old ex-glamour model Cara Franco.

A spokesman for Mr Wallace confirmed he was charged for speeding in April this year.
