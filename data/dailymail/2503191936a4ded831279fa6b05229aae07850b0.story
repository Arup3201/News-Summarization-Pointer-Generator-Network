John Gosden's four-time Group One winner Kingman, the colt destined to be crowned Europe’s champion miler for 2014, will be one of the star attractions of the Newmarket Open day on Sunday September 21.

The colt which has won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, St James’s Palace and Sussex Stakes and, most recently, the Prix Jacques Le Marois will be the headline act among the horses which work on Newmarket’s historic Warren Hill training grounds at 9am.

Gosden will be playing a big part in the Betfair-sponsored event which raises money for four racing charities. He will also be taking part in a demonstration at the famous Tattersalls sales ring on what he looks for when trying to buy a potential champion.

Thirty of the stables in the town will be open from 9.30 to 12.30 including, for the first time, the renowned Warren Place Stable now run by Lady Cecil and from where her late husband Sir Henry plotted the career of the great Frankel.

Other Open Day attractions include a chance to see top race mare Ouija Board, dam of this year’s Investec Derby winner Australia, parading at Stanley House Stud plus a programme of entertainment throughout the afternoon at the Rowley Mile racecourse.

Derby winning trainer Luca Cumani, whose Bedford House Stables are among those welcoming the public, said: ‘We are thrilled to be involved in an event that, not only allows the public and racing enthusiasts to get an insight into all that is involved in a racing yard, but also supports four fantastic and worthy charities.

‘We are looking forward to opening the Bedford House Stables gates and meeting everyone on the day.’

Tickets, at a reduced price if purchased by September 14, which give access to the stables and the Rowley Mile events, can be purchased at the Newmarket Open day website (www.newmarketopenday.co.uk)
