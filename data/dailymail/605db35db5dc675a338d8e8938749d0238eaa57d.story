The cost to taxpayers of renovating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s London residence is set to double to around £2million.

Bills for building work on Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace have spiralled and will eventually dwarf the £1.1million already spent, sources have revealed.

Royal aides are braced for criticism over the use of public money to turn the 20-room, four-storey building into a new home for William, Kate and baby George.

Questions have already been raised 
over the pair’s luxurious lifestyle after they returned last week from a
 seven-day break in a five-star resort in the Maldives.

 Prince
 Charles has denied that his organic garden at Highgrove is an 
‘expensive indulgence’ – insisting that it helps to heal ‘damaged 
souls’.

The money he 
has lavished on the Gloucestershire estate is a reaction to the ‘carnage
 of fashionable vandalism’ that has left once common shrubs, trees and 
farm animals on the endangered list.

Work
 such as planting unusual British apple varieties is attempting to 
repair ‘appallingly short-sighted’ damage to our soil, landscape and 
souls, he writes in the foreword to a new book.

And it comes shortly after the Queen cast protocol aside during an engagement to say that the world’s poor needed more help.

Although
 the Duke and Duchess are paying for fixtures and items such as curtains
 and soft furnishings out of their own pockets, the cost of building 
work including new heating, electrics and plastering is being met by 
money given to the Queen by the Government.

So
 far the internal refurbishments have cost £600,000 and the renewal of 
the apartment’s roof a further £400,000. Another £100,000 has been spent
 on ‘professional fees’.

But aides say work to renovate the apartment, which was once occupied by Princess Margaret, has far exceeded expectation.

The
 initial budget was, according to one source, ‘blown out of the water’ 
by the discovery of asbestos – and the final bill ‘is not likely to go 
down well’ when the full details are revealed in June’s annual royal 
finance report.

Primary residence: The extensive apartment in Kensington Palace, first estimated to cost £1.1million, will be the young family's main residence

Grounds: Apartment 1A is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden

A 
Kensington Palace spokesman said a close eye was being kept on costs but
 said roofwork was long overdue and blamed the asbestos for sending the 
bill skywards.

Earlier this
 month it emerged that Kate was having Apartment 1A redecorated at her 
own expense because she was unhappy with the colour scheme she had 
chosen while pregnant – apparently blaming her hormones.

The spacious four-storey property takes up half the Clock Tower wing designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William.

'Paid privately': Some of the refurbishment costs are to come from the personal fortunes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Living
 space once included five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing
 rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, nine staff bedrooms and 
‘ancillary’ rooms.

Princess
 Margaret herself spent £1.5million on refurbishment before moving in in
 1963. In recent years the property has been used and managed by 
Historic Royal Palaces.

As 
the charity has already spent its own money on remedial work, the Queen 
has compensated it for handing the building over to William and Kate.

Developments: Work is also being done on Anmer Hall in Norfolk, where vivid orange roof tiles were installed over the winter

Bolthole: The 10-room Georgian home was given to William and Kate by the Queen

The
 cost, met by taxpayers but described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is
 understood to be more than £100,000. A source said the apartment was 
being ‘kept in trust for the nation’.

‘Looking after these buildings is the very thing the Royal Household is charged with doing,’ said the aide.

But
 Graham Smith, of anti-monarchy group Republic, said: ‘There is never a 
good time to be throwing our money at people who can afford to pay it 
themselves.’

Sources say 
the Duchess is already busy on her next project – the decoration of 
ten-bedroom Anmer Hall in Norfolk, given to them as a ‘country 
residence’ by the Queen last year.
