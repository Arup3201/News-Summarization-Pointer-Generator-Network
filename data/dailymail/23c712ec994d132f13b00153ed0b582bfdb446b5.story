Using a real donkey in a children’s nativity play must have seemed like a good idea to organisers hoping to bring their open-air event to life.

But ‘elf and safety’ rules mean that rather than just a simple shawl, Mary will arrive sporting a crash helmet – in case she falls off the animal.

The Bridge Church in Neath, near Swansea in South Wales - which is organising the performance - brought in the measure after the donkey’s owner insisted it must follow council guidelines.

Church youth worker Mark Barrett, 44, said: 'We’ve been advised that any young child riding a horse or donkey needs a hard hat for health and safety purposes.

'The owner of the donkey has asked us to do this to make sure we’re in keeping with council guidelines and his insurance policy.

'We don’t really mind, we’ve just got to comply with it, we’ve got to do everything we can to make sure everyone is happy.

'Our stars will be the children taking part who are aged between six and 16 and the donkey.'

Traditional: The mother of baby Jesus is usually portrayed wearing a blue shawl and robes

Policy: The donkey's owner has insisted the schoolgirl wears the protective head wear in keeping with council guidelines as she rides through Neath town centre (pictured)

The school girl playing Mary has not been chosen yet but she will wear her shawl over the high hat hiding it from view.

Mr Barrett added: 'Lot’s of children have been on donkeys at the beach so I don’t think we’ll have any problem finding a girl who’s comfortable with it.

'The donkey in question has been used on the beach before so he’s very docile.

'But a donkey is very high of the ground for a small child so it is better to be safe than sorry.'We are really excited about it all but a bit nervous.

'It’s not everyday you see a donkey walking through the town centre - it’s a great focal point.'
