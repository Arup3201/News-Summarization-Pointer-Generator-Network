Prince Harry launched an inspirational Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women today in typical hands-on style.

After giving a speech to officially unveil the Invictus Games, the fourth in line to the throne got down on the floor for a game of volleyball with military personnel who had lost multiple limbs in Afghanistan and other international conflicts.

Harry has been working to bring the event to the UK after flying to the US last year to see members of Britain's Armed Forces taking part in a similar competition, the Warrior Games.

Prince Harry took a hands on approach as he joined in with a game of volleyball at the launch with some of the ex-servicemen and women

On the programme will be athletics, archery, wheelchair basketball, road cycling, indoor rowing, wheelchair rugby, swimming and sitting volleyball

He said the Invictus Games, would 'have a long-lasting impact' on those who fought for their country

At
 the official launch held in the Copper Box arena at the former Olympic 
Park in London the prince declared the competition would ‘have a 
long-lasting impact’ on those who fought for their country.

And
 joking about his inspiration, he said the Warrior Games competition was
 ‘such a good idea by the Americans that it had to be stolen’.

Harry
 said: ‘I have witnessed first-hand how the power of sport can 
positively impact the lives of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and 
women in their journey of recovery. 

‘The
 Invictus Games will focus on what they can achieve post-injury and 
celebrate their fighting spirit through an inclusive sporting 
competition that recognises the sacrifice they have made.

‘I
 am extremely proud to be bringing an event like this to the UK for the 
first time and believe it can have a long-lasting impact on the 
well-being of those who have served their nations so bravely.’

Organisers
 said more than 300 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, 
serving and veteran, from 13 nations would compete in eight adaptive 
sports in London from September 10 -14. On the programme will be 
athletics, archery, wheelchair basketball, road cycling, indoor rowing, 
wheelchair rugby, swimming and sitting volleyball.

Countries
 taking part range from Afghanistan and Iraq to Germany, Italy and New 
Zealand. Events will be staged in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park with 
track and field events at Lee Valley athletics centre.

Harry, a serving Army officer who wore fatigues at the launch, gave a short presentation at the Copper Box and told the invited audience about his experiences meeting wounded British service personnel who competed in the US Warrior Games in 2012

Harry said: 'The Invictus Games will focus on what they can achieve post-injury and celebrate their fighting spirit through an inclusive sporting competition that recognises the sacrifice they have made'

The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will contribute a significant grant to the staging of the games

The
 Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry 
will contribute a significant grant to the staging of the games.

In
 an interview after the launch, Harry urged members of the public to get
 behind the initiative, insisting that it wasn’t about supporting what 
had happened in Afghanistan but about the sacrifice of a remarkable 
group of men and women.

‘It's
 not about supporting the conflict in Afghanistan, it's not about 
supporting war, it's not about supporting the forces themselves.....just
 come along and show your support,’ he said.

‘Look
 at the journey these guys have been through....and also take the 
opportunity, if you haven't done so, and I am sure there are a lot out 
there, to come and sit in these seats in these iconic venues.’

The
 prince also expressed his deep-seated fear that people would forget 
about the on-going battle faced by injured service personnel once 
Britain pulls out of Afghanistan.

‘We
 are drawing down from Afghanistan and people will forget  this because 
something else will come into the news. Look at the news, see how busy 
the world is at the moment,’ he said.

Organisers said more than 300 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, serving and veteran, from 13 nations would compete in eight adaptive sports in London from September 10 - 14

He said: 'Hearing the stories that came back from the games really ignited something inside me and made me want to basically broaden this to a wider audience'

'As
 I have said the games itself is an excuse to bring attention to the 
legacy [of servicemen and women]. We want to get as many of these men 
and women back into society, giving them jobs and to make sure that all 
the core values they have been taught in the services to make them 
amazing, wonderful, strong inspirational people...that they bring it 
back into the community for the younger generation. Why wouldn't you do 
that?

‘This is not about the Games, this is about the legacy, using the games to catapult that to the forefront of people's minds. ‘

Speaking
 from the heart about the plight of the many hundreds of injured 
soldiers, Harry said he believed the Invictus Games would play an 
important part of their recovery.

'I
 think the [Warrior] Games  [in the US] had such a profound effect on 
every single individual that actually took part in it,’ he said.

'Finally
 they get the chance to set their mind to a task. Bear in mind these are
 military people who have been cut down in their prime. They want to 
have a goal in life. To be told in a day, ‘right that's it, no you’re 
not going to walk again, you’re not going to see again’. This is an 
opportunity for them and members of the public as well to walk in 
together with one goal as such.

'It's
 life changing, really it's life changing. Listening to them talk about 
it is inspiring.

There seemed to be a gap in the conversation between the Prince and London Mayor Boris Johnson, as he attended the launch of the games

'They see this as an opportunity for the next six months
 to set their mind on a goal, to bring themselves back into society when
 some of them feel, now that they are disabled, they are pushed aside.

'They are not. This is so much more than that. ‘

Although
 there is going to be a competitive edge to the Games, Harry stressed 
that it was one of the few sporting occasions that the taking part 
really mattered.

‘It's not 
about the winning or losing, the fact that the guys have got to this 
stage to be able to take part in these events, they have already won in 
my mind,’ he said.

'I just hope that September,  summertime this year, the sun will be out and it will be wonderful event. So please come. '

Dressed
 in his arm fatigues, Harry, a serving Army officer who recently quit 
flying the Apache attack helicopter to take a desk job in London in 
order to work on the Invictus project, added: ‘Hearing the stories that 
came back from the [Warrior] games really ignited something inside me 
and made me want to basically broaden this to a wider audience.

‘I
 saw first-hand the power of sport to inspire recovery, supporting 
rehabilitation and demonstrating life beyond disability - a group of 
inspirational people proving anything is possible.

‘Why
 bring it to the UK? Well it was such a great concept by the Americans 
that it had to be stolen, quite simple as that, really.

Prince Harry was inspired after a visit to the Warrior Games in America last year. He is pictured as he participates in a seated volleyball exhibition match, in May 2013

He added: 'This is an inclusive games and we're going to have hopefully 100 UK competitors, 100 from America and the rest of the 180 is going to be made up from other nations'

‘I wanted to bring this inspirational event to a broader and more international audience.’

Prime
 Minister David Cameron welcomed the launch of the event as a ‘wonderful
 opportunity to recognise the commitment of those who serve in the 
United Kingdom's and our allies' armed forces and to pay tribute to the 
sacrifice of those who are wounded or injured.’

Also
 present at the launch was London Mayor Boris Johnson who quipped, much 
to the prince’s amusement, that when Harry first suggested his idea he 
thought he was resurrecting the ill-fated It’s A Royal Knockout or an 
international version of the Eton Wall Game.

But he went on to describe the Invictus Games as ‘a winner’.

The
 name has been taken from William Ernest Henley’s famous poem which 
says: ‘I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.’

Invictus also means, appropriately, in Latin ‘unconquered’.
