The Co-operative Group  has been engulfed in a new scandal after it emerged  that one of its board has been suspended for allegedly lying about his qualifications.

Munir Malik, who is also a Labour councillor in South London, is being investigated over the claim, made when seeking election to the  Co-op board, that he was  a chartered accountant.

Malik was suspended by  the Labour Party on Friday after it became aware  of the investigation.

The probe into Malik by  Co-op board members was initiated after chief executive Euan Sutherland launched  a review of the group’s records. Sutherland himself quit last month after declaring the organisation  is ‘ungovernable’.

The Co-op refused to comment beyond confirming the suspension and that an investigation was under way.

Malik could not be reached directly, but it is understood he explained the inaccuracy by saying he had previously been a chartered accountant but had been struck off after being declared bankrupt.

But a spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said: ‘As far as our records show he is not and never has been a member.

‘Only members of the ICAEW are entitled to  call themselves a chartered accountant.’

Malik belongs to what one insider described as a closed group who have come to dominate the Co-op despite its democratic structure of elected boards.

His wife, Kathryn Smith, was also on the board of the Co-op Group from 1997-2008 and on the board of the Co-op Bank from 2001-2009, where she worked with disgraced chairman Paul Flowers.

Smith, who has been a Labour councillor in Bexley, like her husband, quit the Co-op to stand as the party’s parliamentary candidate in Gravesham.

Just days before the 2010 Election, in which she was defeated, she was arrested for drink driving, having hit a roundabout late at night. She was suspended for bringing the party into disrepute.

The fresh scandal is the latest to hit the bank since Paul Flowers was revealed to be buying drugs by a Mail on Sunday investigation

The Co-op has been  in the spotlight since  its banking division plunged into losses last year and Methodist Minister Flowers was filmed by  The Mail on Sunday buying class A drugs.

Former City Minister Lord Myners was appointed to assess the Co-op Group’s system of elections and appointments.

He resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review.

A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life – an advisory Government body – is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to collapse last year.

His report is expected after Easter.

Last week the bank announced a £1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £400 million to plug a hole in its finances.

The Co-op Group, which now owns just 30 per cent of the bank, will unveil its own results next week and a loss of more than £2 billion is expected.
