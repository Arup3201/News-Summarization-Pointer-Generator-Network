Tory donor: James Stunt is pictured with his wife Petra Ecclestone

James Stunt, the son-in law of Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone, has joined David Cameron’s elite Tory dining club, it emerged last night.

Art collector Mr Stunt, the husband of socialite Petra Ecclestone, is listed alongside oligarchs, bankers, hedge fund bosses and entrepreneurs in the Leader’s Group of major party donors.

For £50,000 a year, members are promised regular dinners, lunches and drinks receptions with the Prime Minister and other senior Tory figures.

Mr Stunt, 32, who is the most flamboyant member of the set, is known for his ostentatious displays of wealth. He was famously described by his billionaire father in law as a ‘flash b******d’.

His huge car collection reportedly includes two Rolls-Royce Celestials, three Lamborghinis, two Mercedes and two Range Rovers, and he married Miss Ecclestone in a spectacular £12million ceremony in a medieval castle near Rome in 2011.

The donors’ list, published on the Tory Party’s website yesterday, showed Mr Stunt was among 32 individuals who attended Leader’s Group events from July 1 to the end of September.

Between them they have donated more than £17million to the party since 2010.

Other donors listed include Russian businessman Alexander Temerko – who has donated more than £250,000 to the Tories since 2010 and is wanted on fraud charges in his home country – and venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who attracted controversy in 2012 after writing a report for Mr Cameron on cutting red tape, which included a proposal to allow employers to fire staff at will.

Mr Beecroft reportedly holds a significant stake in payday loans company Wonga.

Also listed are hedge fund boss Christopher Rokos, Betfair founder Edward Wray and oil entrepreneur Amjad Bseisu.

Sir Michael Hintze, who is thought to be the Tory Party’s biggest donor, is listed as a member of the group. The former Goldman Sachs banker has given more than £1.8million to the party since 2010.

Also listed in the club is the metals trader known as ‘Mr Copper’. Michael Farmer was elevated to the House of Lords in September and sits as a Tory peer. He has donated more than £3.5million to the party since the last election.

In the past, details of the list have prompted concerns about ‘cash for access’ and fears of behind-the-scenes lobbying of senior Cabinet ministers.

Ministers always denied that donors had used their access to influence policy.

Tories point out that, unlike Labour, their donations all come from private individuals and they are not substantially funded by trade unions.

Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘David Cameron leads a party with dwindling members but an ever-greater reliance on big money from an increasingly small number of mega-rich donors.

‘Ministers’ dinner dates with donors are boosting Tory coffers. The Tories are wining and dining the very same millionaires who have been given a tax cut by this Tory-led Government.’

The seven Cabinet ministers who attended events were Mr Cameron, George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith.

A spokesman for Mr Stunt was unavailable for comment.
