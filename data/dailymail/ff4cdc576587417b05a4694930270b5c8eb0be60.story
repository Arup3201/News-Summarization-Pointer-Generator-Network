If the idea of an expensive, clunky smartwatch doesn't appeal to you, an Italian firm has created a cheaper, slimline alternative in the form of a customisable bracelet. 

Called Hicon, the bangle features detachable buttons that can be slotted into holes around the band, and each button represents a different site or app, such as Facebook or Twitter.

When a notification is received on the phone, the corresponding button  lights up, and the band vibrates.

Called Hicon, the bangle (pictured) lights up when a notification is received on a connected smartphone. The band also vibrates when another wearer is nearby. Individual Hicon bands can be connected, and friend requests sent, using a high-five or by shaking someone’s hand

Hicon also vibrates when another user is nearby, and two bands can be connected, and ‘become friends’ through a high-five or a handshake.

Hicon syncs with an iPhone via Bluetooth.

Detachable buttons can be slotted into holes around the 0.5-inch (13 mm) bangle. 

Each button represents a different site or app.

Hicon is due to retail for $89 (£52) and go on sale in November. 

It works with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Whatsapp, Skype, email, messaging, YouTube, Snapchat, and more. 

The band was created by Milan-based Things-Lab and the firm has set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the gadget.

It syncs with an iPhone via Bluetooth, and works with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Whatsapp, Skype, email, YouTube, Snapchat, and more.

These buttons can be removed and replaced, depending on which apps are used the most.

‘We check our smartphones, tablets and PCs every six minutes for a total of 150 times per day,’ said Things-Lab.

‘What a waste of time!‘

'We thought to solve this problem by creating a physical device, a bracelet, we call it Hicon. It allows us to be always connected to our social networks.

‘The idea is to bring the social [notifications] from the digital environment to the physical world.

‘Whenever you receive a notification on your smartphone, the icons blink.’

The 0.5-inch thick (13mm) bracelet is made of silicone, making it waterproof and sand proof.

The band will be sold in Light (pictured left), Dark, Placid Blue (pictured right), Violet Tulip, Freesia, and Celosia Orange. A ‘social matching’ feature also means contacts and social network preferences can be shared with other Hicon users

It is expected to retail for $89 (£52) and go on sale in November, if the firm raises $60,000 (£35,352) through its Indiegogo campaign.

Things-Lab will ship internationally, but this will add $10 (£6) to the cost when shipped to the US, $15 (£8) to Europe and $25 (£14) other countries 

The band will be sold in Light, Dark, Placid Blue, Violet Tulip, Fressia, and Celosia Orange.

A ‘social matching’ feature also means contacts and social network preferences can be shared with other Hicon users.
