Jimmy Savile’s £4,000 grave is to be dismantled on orders of his family 'out of respect for public opinion', it was announced yesterday.

The astonishing U-turn by the Savile family was revealed only minutes after the Metropolitan Police press conference.

Sources said the relatives were 'emotionally drained' by the sheer force of the allegations as police announced a huge inquiry into allegations that Sir Jimmy Savile 'sexually assaulted underage girls over four decades'.

Scotland Yard said they are due to investigate 120 lines of inquiry from alleged victims, witnesses and third-parties.

The late Sir Jimmy Savile has been accused of abusing girls in his dressing room

The number of the late DJ's alleged victims is 
reported to be between 20 and 25  victims, some of whom were underage when 
the abuse happened, it is claimed.

Scotland Yard has formally recorded 
eight criminal allegations against the star, including two of rape and 
six of indecent assault.

Commander Peter Spindler, head of Specialist Crime Investigations, said the allegations span four decades and information so far suggests abuse was on a 'national scale'.

He said there are currently 120 lines of inquiry, although some could be duplicates.

Mr Spindler told reporters: 'Information is coming in as we speak probably.

'The reality is this really has captured
 the public’s mind. We are getting calls from victims, from witnesses 
and third parties who believe they know something about it.

'We have formally recorded eight criminal allegations against Savile. Two of those are rape, six of indecent assault.

A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them

'These are primarily against girls in their mid-teens, so between 13 and 16 and it spans four decades of abuse.'

He said the first dated back to about 1959 but most seemed to be in the 70s and 80s.

Scotland Yard has been in contact with ITV and the BBC to gather information, and they are contacting alleged victims they have been talking to to see if they will co-operate, he said.

'We believe there are probably another 20 potential victims there,' Mr Spindler added.

'It is too early for us to give you an accurate picture of what 120 lines of inquiry will distil down to but we believe we will come up with between 20 to 25 victims.'

Mr Spindler said they are working to identify anyone who could be subject to criminal investigation. The BBC is not being investigated, he said.

Asked if allegations related to any institutions other than those mentioned in previous claims - the BBC, the Jersey children's home, or the school in Staines - he said he had contacted Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and Leeds Royal Infirmary.

'The pattern of his offending behaviour does appear to be on a national scale,' he said.

Mr Spindler said police will produce a joint report with the NSPCC to look to see what lessons can be learned and what conclusions can be drawn, which can be shared with other agencies.

Calling it an 'assessment', rather than an investigation, he said it is being carried out by Scotland Yard and being led by its Serious Case Team, which looks at complex and history cases.

There are seven officers working on the case, but that will go up to 10 tomorrow, 'because we are keen to draw this to a swift conclusion', he said.

Mr Spindler said a provisional search of Scotland Yard's records could not find any record of any previous investigation into Savile, and they were only previously aware of the involvement of Surrey Police.

Although it is in its early stages, he said allegations suggested Savile's 'predilection for teenage girls'.

As police seek to investigate the scandal, they are expected to speak to celebrities and former Corporation staff in relation to the inquiry, the Evening Standard reported.

The headstone will be removed by undertakers after his family said they wanted to respect public opinion

'There is a pattern of behaviour that
 is being presented to us which ultimately we will hope to analyse and 
present in a final report in some weeks time,' he said.

Peter Liver, from the NSPCC, said 
over the last five days the charity has received 40 calls following the 
claims of abuse committed by Savile.

Of these, 24 have been referred to 
police or other agencies that can support victims of abuse, he said, and
 17 directly relate to Savile.

Mr Liver said there were also 21 unrelated calls to the helpline that stemmed from publicity over the allegations.

He said they consisted of 'people coming forward to report abuse as a result of the attention that has been drawn to this'.

As the scandal deepens, undertakers were hoping to remove the star's 
triple headstone – which they only put up on September 20 -  last night 
subject to consents from Savile’s relatives.

The family said in a statement: 
'Members of the family of Sir Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his 
headstone from the grave in Scarborough.

'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery.

'Out of respect to public opinion, to 
those who are buried there, and to those who tend their graves and visit
 there, we have decided to remove it.'

Queens Hotel, Leeds, West Yorkshire after he died and thousands of fans

There had been concern about security 
at the cemetery following a vandal attack on a commemorative plaque to 
Savile outside his former home on Scarborough seafront.

Other mourners with loved ones buried 
in Woodlands Cemetery were concerned despite regular security sweeps – 
now extended into the evening.

One of the closest plots is the last 
resting place of soldier David License whose sister Janet Taylor, from 
Leeds, said: 'Me and my brothers are all worried.

'We are all very concerned because of the way things have turned out. No one knows what’s going to happen.

'There are always some nutters out there and we don’t want any of it going our David’s way.

'Jimmy Savile just happens to be 
buried next to two very brave soldiers – my brother and the man in the next 
grave which is also military.'

David Cameron hinted that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood

Mother in law Carole Taylor, of Scarborough, added: 'They say there’s security but they can’t be here 24 hours a day.'

Savile’s gaudy six-foot wide and four-foot tall memorial spanning three plots was unveiled two weeks ago.

He was buried under the epitaph he dreamed up years ago – 'It was good while it lasted.'

Three 18ins thick slabs contain poetry, a potted biography of the star, and a list of charities he supported.

The past two weeks have seen most of the star’s connections with Scarborough severed.

On Sunday a footpath named after him –
 Savile’s View – was dismantled following an attack on his nearby 
memorial plaque which was daubed with the words paedophile and rapist 
the previous week. Plans for a statue were also scrapped.

There is no suggestion at this stage 
that Savile's remains will be removed. His body was entombled in 
concrete last November to deter grave robbers in search of bling - 
although the coffin contains no valuables.

The announcement came as the BBC's Director General George Entwistle apologised to alleged victims and promised a full inquiry into the scandal surrounding the former Top Of The Pops presenter.

David Cameron has added to the scandal by hinting that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood 
in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse against young girls.

The
 Prime Minister stopped short of revealing whether he felt the former DJ
 should lose the honour, but suggested that the case should be 
considered by a Whitehall committee which has the power to recommend 
forfeiture.

His comments came after the chairman of the BBC Trust gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation.

Lord Patten said the allegations against Savile could not be excused as behaviour from a time when 'attitudes were different'.

The
 radio and TV presenter and charity fundraiser, who died in 2011, has 
been accused by a growing number of women in the last few weeks of 
sexual abuse over a number of years.

Mr
 Cameron told ITV1’s Daybreak programme today: 'These stories are 
deeply, deeply troubling and I hope that every organisation that has 
responsibilities will have a proper investigation into what happened, 
and if these things did happen, and how they were allowed to happen, and
 then of course everyone has to take their responsibilities.'

Asked
 if Savile should lose his knighthood, Mr Cameron said: 'We have 
something called a Forfeiture Committee. It is not chaired or sat on by 
me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of 
honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.'
