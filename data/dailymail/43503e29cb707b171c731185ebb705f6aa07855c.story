Britney Spears wants to send her new lingerie collection to the Duchess of Cambridge.

The 32-year-old Toxic hitmaker - who unveiled her Intimate Britney Spears Lingerie collection at the Cafe Royal Hotel in London last night - is keen to see Kate Middleton wearing items from her new underwear line.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I would love to see Kate in my underwear designs. That would be splendid.

Princess-worthy: Britney Spears has revealed who she would like to model her lingerie line. 'I would love to see Kate in my underwear designs. That would be splendid,' she said. (Pictured at the line's launch in London)

'I'm going to send her one of every piece. So she'll have plenty to choose from.'

However, with the Duchess pregnant with her second child, she'll likely have to wait a few months to try on the racy lingerie. 

Britney is also keen to enlist some help from fellow pop star Gwen Stefani and hopes the Hollaback Girl hitmaker will help model the new range.

She said: 'I'd love to see Gwen Stefani modelling my collection. I think she's very cool and sexy.'

The blonde beauty launched the collection in the elaborately decorated hotel dressed with over 1,000 flowers, where attendees listened to classical music as they dined on macaroons and drank tea from vintage teacups. 

Kate's new look? At the launch, Britney told guests: 'The sexiest item is the cherry red because it stands out and it's very elaborate and it's pretty promiscuous'

Get the look: The collection, which retails between $17 and $79 and stock bra sizes A-J, boasts 'detailed shoulder straps and stunning embellishments, in addition to crochet edges, satin ribbons, and lace trim'

The setting mirrored the vintage style of the lingerie and Britney was happy to reveal her favorite piece.

She told guests: 'The sexiest item is the cherry red because it stands out and it's very elaborate and it's pretty promiscuous.'

The mother-of-two showed off her décolletage in a plunging navy jumpsuit, and a waisted bow meant her trim tummy was on full display. 

Unlikely: The racy designs would certainly be a departure from the Duchess's usual conservative style - and since she's pregnant with her second child, she'll have to wait a few months to try them on

She accessorized her look with a silver drop necklace, small stud earrings, stacked bracelets and pointed black heels.

The pop star mingled with the stunning models who were clad in her racy designs that featured high-waisted knickerbockers, sheer babydoll nightgowns, romantic red camisoles and chic bras.
