Most women try to avoid looking like a meringue when dressing for an elegant event.

But this waitress looked good enough to eat as she served chocolate mousse desserts from a gold tiered dress as part of a food festival in Miami. 

Around 60 of the nation's top chefs were invited to showcase gourmet food and drink at Wine Spectator's Best Of The Best at Fontainebleau Miami Beach.

The luxury hotel set the stage for a weekend of golden era glamour. 

Winemakers were also invited to speak about how some of the world's greatest varieties make it from the vineyard to the glass.

Ted Baseler, the President and CEO of Michelle Wine Estates was honoured as a 2015 Tribute Dinner honoree. 

The event was sponsored by Bank Of America and Merrill Lynch and held during the 2015 Food Network and Cooking Channel South Beach Wine and Food Festival. 

She wore a retro sparkly dress and rocked a Fifties-inspired hairdo to complete her glamorous look
