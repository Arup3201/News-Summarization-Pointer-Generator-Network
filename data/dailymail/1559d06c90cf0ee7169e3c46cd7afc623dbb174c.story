Hollywood superstars George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio have sparked record sales for a diet supplement with men making up two thirds of buyers for the first time.

Meratol has sold a staggering 25,000 bottles of its diet pill in the UK in the last two months since it was revealed that the A-listers were among celebrity fans.

But for the first time in its six year history, there are more male purchasers than women, who account for 74 per cent of total sales.

The pills, made from a cocktail of herbal ingredients including cactus leaves, prickly pear and seaweed, claim to speed up metabolism to burn fat while suppressing appetite.

Female celebrity fans include actress Eva Longoria and the supplement has been promoted by The Only Way Is Essex favourite Lauren Goodger.

But it is the Clooney Effect which is believed to have sparked the sudden sales surge to men recently as they look to shed those post-Christmas pounds.

A Meratol spokesman said: 'We usually see a ration of around 55:45 women to men purchasing our slimming aids.

'For the first time in six years we can report a significant change in buying patterns with male customers being our primary customer.

Wonder pill? Meratol is said to help slimmers shed their excess pounds in double quick time

'It has been reported recently that two thirds of British men are overweight so there is an increased awareness among them in actively taking action to lose weight.

'Women are already aware of such products but when you get fans like George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, it helps raise their profile to a whole new audience of men.'

Meratol claims to help shift between three and five pounds a week and was used by The Only Way is Essex star, Lauren Goodger to shed her excess weight.

She said: 'I've taken a lot of herbal diet tablets and some can make you feel a bit shaky but on Meratol I don't feel any different. It helps you burn fat and suppresses your appetite.'

Dubbed a 'turbo weight loss' supplement, each Â£35 tub contains 60 pills, enough for a month's use, and is available from the website, meratol.com.

Father of two, Darren Hughes, 47, had been piling on the pounds for years thanks to a combination of late night snacks and minimal exercise.

At just 5' 10" tall, the Oxford content writer tipped the scales at 13.5 st, which left him with a BMI of 27.1 - firmly in the overweight category.

But the super-slimmer has managed to lose two stone in just 12 weeks, dropping to a svelte 11.5 st, all thanks, he says, to using slimming pills which gave him 'the motivation needed' to do something about his unhealthy diet.

Darren said: 'Having always struggle with my weight I heard about Meratol through a friend.

'When I started using it, the pounds came off quite quickly, and the fact that it started to work spurred me on - I'm not the most motivated of people.'

Darren, who had gradually gained weight over the years, said the epiphany arrived in his late 30s, when the former runner realised that he was getting too big to keep up with his active children.

But feeling demotivated, he put the problem to one side and managed to convince himself that it would all drop off eventually.

It didn't and he became the butt of fat jibes from friends and family. Things changed when a friend's wife suggested slimming pills, and with nothing to lose, he decided to try.

A few weeks later, with the pounds starting to drop off, Darren finally felt motivated enough to change his diet and his exercise regime.

Having spent years feasting on fried food, microwave curries and crisps, he now chooses to eat a more healthy diet based on salads, healthy sandwiches and fresh vegetables.

'I'm a sucker for pancakes,' he admits. 'Once the kids were in bed, I would snack on junk food late at night and veg out in front of TV. It's an easy habit to get into.

'After I realised the pills were starting to work, I began to monitor what I eat and now I don't snack at all. I still have the occasional burger but now it's a treat.

'I've also started playing golf. I'm not that good at it but it does mean I'm standing on my feet. As long as you do that, you are burning some calories.

'To anyone thinking of trying to lose weight, I would say give it [Meratol] a go. I know different things work for different people but I'm still taking it now and I'm confident I can maintain my new weight.'
