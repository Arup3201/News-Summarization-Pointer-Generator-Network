This is the moment an 80-year-old widower was ambushed and dragged through his own home by masked men who stole his late wife's wedding ring.

Eamonn Durcan was going to close his front gate when the thugs jumped out of a car, pushed him to the ground and hauled him into the house.

The pensioner tried to fight back by kneeing one attacker in the groin - but the two men proved too strong.

Attack: Two masked men set upon Eamonn Durcan, 80, and pushed him to the ground as he closed his gate

Brutal: Here, one of the attackers can be seen grabbing Mr Durcan from behind to drag him inside the house

Threatened: During the 10-minute ordeal, Mr Durcan was threatened with a knife as they stole his wife's rings

Once inside, he was pinned down by one raider who held a knife to his cheek, threatening him for 10 minutes.

The robbers took cash, a Panasonic television set, a Dell laptop, two mobile phones, a tablet computer and two watches.

But
 they also stole wedding and engagement rings, which belonged to his dead wife Daphne, as well as an eternity
 ring and a traditional Irish Claddagh ring with a shamrock on it.

Mr Durcan, a grandfather of two, said: 'They were vicious thugs but I wasn’t about to be scared.

'Every chance I got, I lashed out. I hit one of them with an empty beer bottle.

'People
 have asked me why I tried to fight and told me I could have been hurt. 
But what did they expect me to do, hold them by the hand and let them 
help themselves?

'They didn’t hurt me physically, but they’ve hurt me mentally because they took things that were precious to me.'

Before: Mr Durcan, a retired HGV driver, had been walking out to close his front gate shortly before 10pm after a woman knocked on his front door in Leeds, West Yorkshire, asking to use his phone

Accosted: A man appeared and started trying to break in, while Mr Durcan can be seen protesting

Gang: A second man then emerged as grandfather-of-two Mr Durcan tried to hold the front gate closed

The attackers set upon Mr Durcan, a retired HGV driver, after a woman - apparently dressed for a night out - came to his door asking to use his phone.

He refused and the woman, who is thought to have been an accomplice to the robbers, left.

Moments later, Mr Durcan went outside to close his gate - and the men advanced.

He said: 'There was a car parked on the pavement. Suddenly the driver got out and he had a mask on and he jumped me.

'I was thinking, is someone having a laugh? But then the guy got out of the passenger seat and came for me. I realised this was the real thing.

'It was horrible. I kneed one of them in the groin, but I knew I was going to go down.'

Mr Durcan was pushed over and dragged into his house.

Forceful: Pulling open the gate, one attacker launches into Mr Durcan, running towards the house

Defenceless: Mr Durcan said despite trying to protect his home, he knew they would overpower him

'They kept saying: ‘Where’s the money? Where’s the safe?",' he said.

'I was telling them I didn’t have any but they wouldn’t believe me.'

Mr Durcan, who believes he was deliberately targeted, was taken to hospital as a precaution but was not seriously injured.

'I’m extremely angry about what happened and I want them caught,' he said.

Detective Constable Chris Lord, of Leeds District CID, said: 'It is appalling that people would deliberately target a vulnerable old man in this way and I would urge anyone who knows the identity of those involved to contact us immediately.'

Angry: The retired HGV driver said he is infuriated by the attack and will do everything to catch the thugs

The woman was white, about 30, and about 5ft 4in.

She had shoulder-length, wavy ginger or blonde hair and was wearing high heels and a light-coloured dress.

Both men had handkerchiefs covering their faces and were wearing baseball caps turned backwards.

One was white, about 5ft 6in and was wearing jeans.

The other was about 6ft and slim.

The incident happened about 9.50pm on Thursday, April 17.

Anyone with informationshould call CID via 101 or Crimestoppers, on 0800 555111.
