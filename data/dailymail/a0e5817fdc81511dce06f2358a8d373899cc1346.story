Taking your dog for a walk at night in the park, on a common, along the beach or in the woods can be a frightening prospect if you're taking your pet off the leash.

If they run off you probably have nothing but the piddly light on your mobile phone with which to hunt for them.

But now a San Francisco-based start-up have created a range of neon LED collars that will help you find your pet... while turning him of her into the ultimate rave accessory.

Turn your dog into the ultimate rave accessory (and keep him safe at night) with a HALO collar

HALO Belt Company originally designed illuminated belts for late-night joggers, backpacks and skateboards, to help keep people safe while outside in the dark.

Funded entirely by Kickstarter in August 2012, the brand's goal is to 'merge safety, fashion, and culture into an essential everyday product', their tagline is 'be seen, be safe'.

HALO MINI is an illuminated pet collar that comes in sizes suitable for big dogs, little dogs, cats and even rabbits.

Available in red, green and blue, the 
collars have reflective stitching and fully-recharchable batteries that 
last up to 75 hours.

The company said: 'LED pet collars have 
been on the market for years, however, most of them are made using cheap
nylon materials with LEDs that are just as bad.

'We have re-designed and created an ultra high quality illuminating collar using our custom patented illumination system.

'Just like our HALO BELT, each HALO MINI is designed to illuminate in bright neon colors.

'The purpose of the HALO MINI is to keep our loved ones safe when outside at night.'

The brand have already smashed their target $10,000 target - 667 backers have pledged a total of $30,970 - and they still have nine days to go.

A Kickstarter donation of $29 means you'll get the collar at a discounted rate.

Once pledging is over the collars will retail for $45.
