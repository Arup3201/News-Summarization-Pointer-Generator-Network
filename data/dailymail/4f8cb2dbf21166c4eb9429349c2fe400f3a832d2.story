Kiwi sensation Lorde is encouraging her fans to respond to hatred with love, as Westboro Baptist Church plan to picket her concert this week.

Westboro Baptist Church announced that they planned to picket outside the concert venue in Missouri, Kansas on Friday.

Spotting this, the 17-year-old Royals singer tweeted her response while on tour in Chicago yesterday.

Royal behaviour: Lorde took to Twitter to encourage her fans to respond to Westboro Baptist Church's hateful picket by spreading love and equality

Lorde asked her fans to wear rainbow clothing and kiss Westboro members of the same sex, in response to the church which is notoriously anti-gay.

‘Hahaha omg just found out westboro baptist church are going to picket my show in kansas city (sic),’ she tweeted.

‘Everyone wear rainbow clothing to that show ... [and] try to kiss church members who are same sex as you. They will so love it. Christmas comin early in kansas city. (sic)’

Westboro Baptist Church, believed to have a few dozen members, famously stage headline-grabbing protests at any event they deem ‘immoral’, holding ‘God Hates Fags’ placards at the funerals of soldiers, LGBT festivals and political events.

The teenage singer, real name Ella Yelich-O'Connor, later deleted her tweets although it has not been made clear why she did so.

Disgrace: Christian hate-sect Westboro Baptist Church are still planning on picketing Lorde's concert in Missouri on Friday

The Christian hate sect responded that Lorde ‘doesn’t have enough sense to put in a thimble’ as they posted an odious parody of her Grammy winning song Royals on their website.

According to Westboro’s website, they are still planning on picketing outside Midland Theater in Kansas on 21 March.

The news of their planned protest comes as their founder is said to be dying.

Fred Phelps Sr. started the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955, and the sect has since protested at hundreds of funerals of military members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians.

This weekend, his estranged son, who has left the church announced on Facebook that his 84-year-old father was 'on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka.'

He also revealed that Pastor Phelps, a former civil-rights attorney, was ex-communicated from the 'church' back in August of 2013.

Westboro Baptist Church spokesman Steve Drain has confirmed that Fred Phelps Sr. is in medical care but did not elaborate on the state of his health or the alleged ex-communication.
