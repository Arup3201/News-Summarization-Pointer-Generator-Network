A final dress rehearsal for the opening ceremony allowed some 10,000 performers to fine-tune their spectacular routines in front of a full house at the Olympic Stadium last night.

But it also gave the spectators some essential training in how to cope with another breath-taking aspect of the Games - the queues.

With less than two days to go until the London Olympics are officially opened by Danny Boyle's extravaganza, it seems fans are going to have plenty of time to chat about it afterwards.

There were huge queues at Stratford Station as thousands of spectators tried to leave the Olympic Park after a final rehearsal of the opening ceremony

There were big queues across the bridge linking the Olympic Park, Stratford Station and the Westfield shopping complex

Last night, there were lengthy queues 
from the entrance to Stratford Station back through the Westfield 
Shopping Centre as 60,000 spectators tried to board Underground and 
National Rail trains away from the Olympic Park.

There were packed platforms inside the
 station as volunteers frantically tried to direct the stream of people 
on to the right trains as late as 1am.

But at least they were running - after
 the first dress rehearsal on Monday night, a similar number of 
spectators leaving the stadium were informed that the Central Line 
wasn't operating and they would have to find alternative transport.

In another ominous sign, there were further transport problems this morning.

A fire alert at Canary Wharf station 
on the Jubilee Line during the rush hour caused the evacuation of one of
 London's busiest Underground stations.

Meanwhile, cable theft caused misery to rail commuters both north and south of the Capital.

The Central Line will be a crucial link between the West End of London and the Olympic Park in Stratford

Journey times on First Capital Connect
 services were extended by 90 minutes following a signalling fault at 
Bedford, while Southeastern trains through London to the South were also
 affected.

Then, a fire on a disused platform in West London caused delays to mainline services out of Paddington, including the Heathrow Express service.

Restrictions caused by Olympic 
traffic-only Games Lanes continued to cause tail-backs, notably on 
Waterloo Bridge and on the A40 in West London.

 - Pre-show begins at the Olympic Stadium at this exact minute, chosen 
because it matches the year in which the Games is taking place in.21.00
 - Danny Boyle's £27 million extravaganza begins with the stadium 
transformed into the British countryside. Most elements of the show are 
still being kept completely secret.00.00-00.30 - The show ends, up to 30 minutes earlier than planned

The Olympic opening ceremony remains 
one of Britain's most closely guarded secrets despite well over 100,000 
people having now seen it.

Fans invited to the sneak previews of 
the £27m spectacle were urged personally by Slumdog Millionaire 
director Boyle to 'save the surprise' for the estimated one billion 
around the world who will tune in to watch on Friday night.

Organisers invited London 2012 
volunteers, competition winners and others connected to the Games on the
 proviso that they kept quiet about what they saw.

It is already common knowledge that the stadium has been transformed into a British rural idyll.

The stadium will be packed with at 
least 62,000 spectators, 16,000 athletes, 10,000 performers, 70 sheep, 
12 horses, ten chickens, three cows, two goats and even dogs and geese.

Traditional countryside cottages will 
stand together with a mining wheel, harking back to the country's proud 
industrial heritage, all drenched in faked pouring rain to reflect 
Britain's typical weather.

And mimicking scenes across the 
country every weekend, a cricket pitch has even been laid with a game 
planned for during the ceremony.

Four lucky ticket holders to the second dress rehearsal of the Olympics opening ceremony in Stratford last night. The actual opening ceremony which will officially open the Games is on Friday evening

But in the main the contents of the three hour multi-million pound extravaganza is still a complete mystery.

This was despite some spoilsports trying to post footage of the ceremony rehearsals on YouTube last night.

Two videos - one entitled 'Olympic 2012 opening
ceremony snapshot from rehearsal' and the other 'Olympic Opening
Ceremony Rehearsal' - were taken down on copyright grounds by the International Olympic Committee.

One aspect of the ceremony that is 
most definitely still a secret is who will light the Olympic cauldron. 
The latest rumour is that David Beckham will light it with a flaming 
football.

The football star, 37, wasn't giving 
anything away yesterday however. He said: 'I'm playing a small part in 
the opening ceremony, which I am excited about.

'I'd love to tell you the details but I can't. It's exciting, it's going to be good.

'I am honoured to be involved because, obviously, I was involved in the start process with this seven years ago.'

Though one bookmaker today stopped taking bets on Sir Roger Bannister to be chosen for the honour after a flurry of interest.

William Hill said that 98 per cent of bets in this market today were on the running legend - who was the first to run a mile in under four minutes in 1954 - and his odds were cut from 6/1 to evens. 

A spokesman for the bookmakers said: 'Just a week ago we were 33/1 for Sir Roger; although he was an amazing sportsman we felt that his connection was not Olympic enough.

'If he does win, an awful lot of punters will be running, perhaps not four minute miles, down to their betting shops to pick up their winnings.'

LOCOG chief executive Paul Deighton wasn't giving the game away either, but he said the choice was 'easy'.

Mr
 Deighton, who sat on the panel which made the selection, told BBC Radio
 4’s Today programme: 'It was surprising how we reached unanimity pretty
 quickly.

'I think when everyone sees our choice last night they will understand why we made it.'

Tickets are still available for the opening ceremony - but only for those with deep pockets.

Category AA seats are on offer for £2,012 with a limited number of Category A tickets available for £1,600, on the official ticket website.

LOCOG also admitted that spectators who bought £995 tickets after July 17 are not guaranteed a clear view of all the ceremony.

A message on their website read: 'Tickets in price category B (£995) and C (£150) purchased from 17 July 2012 onwards will have a restricted view of parts of the ceremony.'

LOCOG revealed yesterday that 
spectators will be given a variety of musical themes, with Sir Elton 
John selected to accompany the archery at Lord's and Dizzee Rascal 
playing at the basketball at the North Greenwich Arena.

In-ear commentary will also be available at a cost of £10 to boost spectators' understanding of some of the more obscure sports.
