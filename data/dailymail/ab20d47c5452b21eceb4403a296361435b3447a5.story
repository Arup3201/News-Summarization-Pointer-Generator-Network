An astonishing 10,000 beer cans have been cleared from Trafalgar Square after Scottish football fans finished drowning their sorrows following their 3-2 defeat to England last night.

An ‘almighty clean-up’ was ordered overnight after thousands of fans descended on the London landmark ahead of the friendly at Wembley.

Almost two tonnes of rubbish was cleared from the site before the rush-hour, as council officials declared victory over litter.

Invasion: After thousands of fans descended on the London landmark, cleaners spent 10 hours removing the rubbish they left behind

Up to 4,000 good-natured travelling football fans transformed the London landmark into a blistering cauldron of Scottish jingoism.

But there was disappointment in the evening for the supporters when their team lost 3-2 in North-West London, with England debutant Rickie Lambert scoring the winner. 

Ahead of the big clash however, a 
sprawling crowd gathered at the base of Nelson’s Column, clad in a 
uniform of heavy boots, kilts and football shirts.

Brandishing
inflatable swords, Saltire flags and ginger wigs, many chanted ‘there’s
only one William Wallace’ to the sound of bagpipes.

Just hours before the celebrations 
began stern-faced local council officials insisted that the square’s 
alcohol ban would remain in place.

But any plans to enforce it were 
quickly abandoned as a throng of Scots appeared on the horizon before 
most pubs had even opened bearing crates of lager and cider.

Today Westminster Council said an 
estimated 10,000 cans had been removed as part of the huge operation to 
remove rubbish from the Square.

Ed Argar, council cabinet member for city management, said: ‘This was one almighty clean up.

‘Our crews worked hard around the 
clock to get London back to normal for our residents and businesses this
morning. I’m glad to say it is Westminster 1, litter 0.’

A team of 20 cleaners moved in from 6.30pm last night and worked through the night until 6.30am this morning.

It involved 18-tonne trucks, street sweepers and small cleaning buggies.

One council official added: ‘It was a 
triumph to vanquish the auld enemy of litter once again, and we even 
found one or two weary Scotsmen in the square this morning.’

The two teams met for the first time 
this century at Wembley Stadium last night, and thousands of Scotland 
supporters travelled to London for the match.

Scottish fans - sporting kilts, big 
grins and the odd ginger wig - covered walls with the blue and white 
Saltire flag in the shadow of Nelson's Column.

Washing-up liquid was added to the water in the fountains as the supporters spent the day partying.

The Metropolitan Police said there 
were two arrests at the match - one for drunk and disorderly behaviour 
and the other for public disorder.

A fan was also arrested for drunkenly dancing naked in a fountain in Trafalgar Square yesterday afternoon.

The fixture, a friendly to help 
celebrate the Football Association's 150th anniversary, was the first 
time the countries had met in 14 years.

Two people were taken to hospital with head injuries after paramedics were called to Trafalgar Square, London Ambulance Service (LAS) said.

An LAS spokeswoman said they were told there had been a ‘fall from heights’ in the area of Nelson's Column.

A man in his 40s, suffering from head injuries and back pain, was taken to St Thomas's Hospital ‘as a priority’, the spokeswoman said.

A second man, who was less seriously injured, was admitted to the same hospital.

Four other people were treated at the scene for injuries but did not need to be taken to hospital.

The LAS could not confirm if those involved were Scotland supporters.
