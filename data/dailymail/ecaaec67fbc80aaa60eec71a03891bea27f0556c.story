Tanya Strangeway  has been dismissed by West Yorkshire Police after receiving gifts from ex-partner Nicholas McFadden, who sold drugs confiscated from criminals

The former fiancee of a corrupt policeman who made more than a million pounds selling drugs confiscated from criminals has now been fired from the same police force.

Detective Constable Tanya Strangeway was showered with gifts by ex-partner Nicholas McFadden, including an Audi car and £10,000 gift-wrapped in bundles of £20 and £10 notes, a trial heard last year.

McFadden, also a detective for West Yorkshire Police, made £1.1million from his crimes after he helped himself to heroin, cocaine and cannabis and sold it on the streets.

In April last year, Leeds Crown Court heard how he used the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle including buying designer clothes, jewellery and an orangery.

He was jailed for 23 years, and ordered to pay back over £250,000.

West Yorkshire Police has now confirmed that Ms Strangeway has been dismissed at a misconduct hearing earlier this summer for 'discreditable conduct'.

The allegations against her are believed to be linked to the supply of drugs, though she has never been convicted of any criminal offence.

She had previously lived with and been engaged to McFadden until their relationship ended in 2006, but she told the court last year that they became close again in 2011.

Disgraced former policeman McFadden worked for the specialist Organised Crime Group for West Yorkshire Police.

During a five-week trial, Leeds Crown Court heard he and his brother Simon, 42, with whom he conspired to supply the drugs, made so much money they 'they did not know what to do with it'.

His colleagues had noticed that he purchased a private number plate for his car, that he began to wear designer clothing and an expensive wristwatch, and that he spoke of gifts that he had bought his wife.

But he explained away his excess money by telling his work his wife had received an insurance payout after being ill with cancer.

After developing a relationship with Ms Strangeway, McFadden used the cash to buy her a host of expensive gifts while funding their luxury lifestyle.

She told his trial last year: 'In June 2011, I received a text message off Nick saying we were going to be working together on a job. Then we became close again. He told me that he had something he wanted to give me and when we met up, that's when he surprised me.'

McFadden was jailed for 23 years and ordered to pay back over £250,000 last year. A  bag of drugs and money (right) was seized from his garage after police launched an investigation

Strangeway was given £10,000 after McFadden made so much money 'he didn't know what to do with it'

Ms Strangeway said DC McFadden had given her a parcel which contained bundles of ten and twenty pound notes. 'There was £10,000 in total,' she told the court.

'I made an assumption that the money came from the sale of his house. It was a life-changing amount of money from a house we shared together. I didn't feel like I had to ask questions about it. I had no reason to doubt him.'

The court heard how McFadden bought an Audi A4 for his ex-lover in July 2011, costing £10,000, gave her £2,000 in cash for a shopping trip and posted parcels of money through her letterbox, amounting to around £1,000.

The gifts came to light when Ms Strangeway was asked to declare them after the vetting procedure changed at her work. 'Nick was very concerned about his wife finding out that he'd given me the money and the car,' she said.

Commenting on her dismissal, Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's Professional Standards Department, said: 'West Yorkshire Police expects the highest standards of professionalism from all officers and staff and will take appropriate disciplinary action against anyone who fails to meet those standards.'
