A top London private school is at the centre of a murder investigation after one of its pupils was ‘executed’ during an official visit to the carnival city of Rio de Janeiro.

Sergey Petrovich Danshin, the  17-year-old son of a wealthy Russian businessman, was shot three times  in the back of the head after leaving a beachside villa he was sharing with the school’s headmaster Philip Hurd, 52, and the teacher’s gay lover.

Police said that four students and another teacher from the exclusive £22,000-a-year International Community School in Regent’s Park were staying in the house when Sergey left late at night, apparently in search of drugs.

Sergei Danshin was shot dead in an 'execution' style killing after apparently going looking for cannabis

The teenager’s body was recovered the next day not far from the villa  and less than 48 hours after the party arrived in Brazil.

But the murder has baffled detectives who revealed that Sergey’s backpack, containing an iPhone 5 and a credit card, had been left untouched.

Police, who have described the crime as an ‘execution’, believe he had gone out to buy cannabis.

Local police chief Julio Cesar Mulatinho Neto told The Mail on Sunday: ‘On Friday, September 27, at about 6pm, all seven walked to a bar for pizza.

'At 11.30pm, the three adults returned to the house. All the students remained in the bar.

‘At about 1am, all four students returned and went to bed. But soon afterwards, two decided to leave the house in an attempt to buy cannabis.

'They returned to the bar but were not successful and returned to the house. Later, Sergey left the villa alone.’ His body was found on a canal bank.

‘He had only been in Brazil for two days,’ Mr Neto said. ‘He can hardly have made many enemies in that time. We do not understand the motive for this crime.’

Headteacher Philip Hurd was supposed to be looking after the students while they were staying at this house in Brazil, but a bar owner says he watched on as his underage pupils downed shots and smoked

Earlier in the evening, Mr Hurd had looked on as his underage students downed vodka shots and smoked cigarettes, according to Renan Magalhaes Garcia Gutierrez, 21, the owner of the bar  the group visited.

Mr Gutierrez added: ‘When Sergey came back to the bar alone he was asking where he could find cannabis and also made a sniffing gesture that I understood to mean cocaine. I told him, “Be careful, it is dangerous here.”

‘He laughed and said, “Don’t be silly, Brazil has no law.” He then walked off and I did not see him again.’

Sergey’s father, Petr Danshin, an agribusiness magnate in the Black Sea city of Krasnodar, flew out to Rio last week to try to find out what happened.

Last night friends and pupils of  the school, which attracts many of the sons and daughters of London-based diplomats, expressed their shock and sorrow at  the death.

A school spokesman said: ‘We’re appalled by this tragedy, and have done everything we can to help the Brazilian authorities with their investigations.

'We have offered  our heartfelt condolences to the family and we are now keen to respect their privacy.’
