New robotic super-tills are set to replace the nation’s supermarket check-out workers.

The days of someone sitting at a check-out, switching and flipping items to make sure the barcode can be scanned before sorting out the payment are clearly numbered.

Tesco yesterday unveiled a bank of the super-tills at its new Extra store in Lincoln in a major policy shift that is already being adopted by some of its rivals.

The theory is that scanners built in to the supersize check-outs automatically scan every item put on the conveyor belt, regardless of which way up it is, so removing the human element.

A normal worker takes up to three seconds to scan a single item, however the rise of the machines means the new hi-tech version can do the same job three times faster – one per second.

At the same time, customers will pack their items and pay automatically with a card, so allowing the entire process to be managed without the need for a shop worker.

Most supermarkets have already installed self-scan tills for those picking up a few items for their evening meal on the basis of a claim that it is quicker and more convenient for customers.

However, the millions who have struggled with scanners and wrestled with ‘unidentified items in the bagging area’ will confirm the process does not always run smoothly.

It has been tipped as 'revolutionary', cutting the time it takes to scan an item from three seconds to one

Each of the robotic super-tills can send products on a conveyor belt to one of three packing areas, which enables up to three sets of customers to be using it at any one time.

Four of the state-of-the-art machines have been installed at Tesco’s 80,000 sq ft Lincoln Extra store, which accounts for nearly a third of all those available to customers.

Shopper, helped by Tesco employee, empties trolley on to the conveyor belt.

Items pass through an arch which scans them from all sides – 360 degrees – to identify barcode.

Once through scanner, items are carried by the belt to a circular platform.

Cone in the middle of platform spins the items into the first of 3 packing areas.

Once all the shopping is through, second customer can then load items on the belt.

A
 wall rises around the first shoppers items, which means the second 
customer’s shopping is diverted into a separate packing area.

The same pattern is repeated with a third shopper.

Each of the three packing areas has its own payment point, where customers can pay with cash or card.

There is also a dispenser for bags, which customers can take freely to pack shopping.

Tesco said it had already received a 
positive customer feedback from a trial of one of the checkouts in 
Fareham in Hampshire, but the new Lincoln store is taking the technology
 to a new level.

The
 super-till has been developed by NCR Retail and is similar to ones that
 have been developed for Asda and put on trial at a store in York and 
operate at speeds of up to 100 items per minute.

Tesco
 said the new technology will take the stress out of getting through its
 tills, because people will not feel under pressure to pack and pay.

A spokesman said: ‘Customers can feel pressurised when they have customers behind them at the checkouts. This is about making it a more relaxed experience.’

The firm stressed the check-out workers are not being made redundant, but rather they are being switched to other roles in the stores, such as helping people to negotiate the aisles or running taste tests and demonstrations.

NCR Retail’s Ronen Levkovich told The Grocer magazine: ‘Supermarkets such as Tesco must differentiate themselves to attract and retain shoppers.

'As consumers increasingly expect a better experience, incorporating innovative software and hardware becomes increasingly important.’

The changes at the Lincoln store are part of a major revamp of Tesco outlets to try and turn them into surrogate high streets with a range of stores and services beyond the normal groceries.

Many will have family restaurants under the Giraffe brand, together with Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakeries.

A number will also have community areas which can be used for exercise classes or mother and toddler groups.

The Lincoln store includes a new drive-through centre for people to collect items they have bought on the Tesco website.

There is also a Connected Technology department offering a dedicated area for tablets, smartphones and the latest games consoles.

It is the first store to include a kitchen in a community room that Tesco will use to provide cooking lessons for children in conjunction with the Children’s Food Trust.
