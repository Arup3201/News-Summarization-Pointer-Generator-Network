Almost half of women say they feel guilty about their carbohydrate consumption, a new study revealed

With Christmas over and New Year looming, many of us are turning our thoughts to diets and New Year’s resolutions.

And this year it seems carbohydrates will be on the hit list.

New research suggests nearly 50 per cent of women feel guilty about eating them.

The study of 3,000 people revealed many believe removing carbohydrates from their diet is an effective way to shed the pounds.

However, Jane Ogden, professor in health psychology at the University of Surrey, and designer of the new survey, claims this is dangerous as carbohydrates are an ‘essential’ part of people’s diets.

She said: ‘If they realise that carbohydrates have an essential part in their diets, not only for energy but also for building long-term sustainable healthy habits, then carbohydrates can resume their place as a central part of how they eat.’

Professor Ogden added that rather than cutting out all carbohydrates, people should try to steer clear of sugary ‘bad carbs’.

She says the problem with avoiding carbohydrates altogether is that it means people feel hungry and that this leads to snacking on fatty, sugary foods.

This, she explains, can lead to an unhealthy, vicious cycle.

The new survey, which was conducted from the weight-loss supplement XLS-Medical Carb Blocker,
 also revealed that women are twice as likely as men to feel guilty 
about their carbohydrate consumption - despite the fact they are less 
likely to be overweight.

One
 in ten women say they constantly feel bad about their carb consumption 
while a quarter say they try to avoid eating them during the week so 
they can eat more at the weekends.

It also found that most people are unsure how much carbohydrate they ought to eat each day.

The
 government currently recommends that about half of a person’s daily 
calorie intake should be in the form of carbohydrates but most people 
surveyed significantly underestimated the amount of food that would 
amount to.

In reality, this would add up to about one bowl of cereal, two slices of bread, a portion of pasta and three oatcakes.

While
 Professor Ogden is clear in her opinion that carbohydrates should 
remain a key part of people’s diets, nutritionist Zoe Harcombe 
disagrees.

Many women believe cutting carbohydrates from their diet is a quick and effective way to lose weight but some experts fear this is dangerous as they are 'essential'

She claims it is illogical to say people should avoid carbohydrates that are high in sugar, because all carbohydrates break down into sugar.

She
 told MailOnline: ‘This shows nutritional ignorance. Telling people to 
cut down on sugar but to eat more carbohydrate is like telling people to
 use the car less but to consume more petrol.

‘All carbs break down into sugars. 
Whether polysaccharides (many sugars), disaccharides (two sugars) or 
mono saccharides (single sugars) - all carbs break down into sugar.’

She
 added: ‘Carbs are not essential. Essential in nutrition means that the 
substance must be consumed - the body doesn't make it.

‘There are essential fats. There are essentials proteins (certain amino acids). There are no essential carbs.’

She added: ‘Women are right to be wary of carbs - they make us fat.’

She explained that women only need about
 500 calories a day for energy and that these needs can be met from fat 
or carbohydrates.

The other 1,500 calories a woman requires are for functions such as cell repair and fighting infection and carbohydrates cannot meet these needs.

As a result, she says people who eat more than 500 calories of carbs every day are likely to be overweight.

While there is debate about the importance of carbohydrates in people’s diets, there can be no argument about obesity statistics.

In Britain last year, 58 per cent of women and 65 per cent of men were overweight.

In 1993, 58 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women were overweight or obese.

Carrie Ruxton, an independent dietician, said that carbs are the body’s main source of energy – and the brain’s only source.

Echoing Professor Ogden’s concern, she said: ‘It is completely wrong to demonise carbohydrates.  Those who do have the wrong end of the stick.’
