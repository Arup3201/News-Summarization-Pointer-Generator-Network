U2 frontman and humanitarian Bono has blasted Tony Abbott for not joining the global fight against Ebola, labelling the government's decision to not send medical workers to West Africa 'outrageous' and 'not very Australian.'

The singer criticised the Prime Minister's failure to respond to the outbreak of the deadly disease 'at the source' during an interview on 60 minutes.

'(Politicians have) got to account for their actions, including your Prime Minister,' Bono said.

'I thought it was outrageous, the idea that you wouldn't send medical workers to West Africa.'

'This is just not the Australia that I know.'

'To think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart,' Bono said during the interview

The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia

Bono lambasted the Abbott government for only being concerned with protecting Australia's borders.

'To think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart,' Bono said.

'You have to protect it at the source of the problem. These diseases do not respect borders.'

Earlier this month, UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon reached out to U2's frontman, asking him to join the fight against Ebola by potentially holding a concert to raise money to battle the virus. 

He made the plea as it was revealed a trust fund he launched to provide fast and flexible funding for the fight against Ebola has only $100,000 in the bank. 

The fund, which is part of a $1 billion UN appeal for humanitarian needs in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is intended to provide fast and flexible funding to respond to the medical emergency.

'This is just not the Australia I know', Bono told 60 minutes of the Abbott government's decision to not send aid workers and medical professionals to West Africa to help the fight against Ebola

The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans

But as it became clear its funds would do little alone to stem the spread of the killer virus, Mr Ban revealed he was considering alternative measures.

'I would welcome any initiative taken by Mr. Bono or some other leaders around the world to join this campaign to mobilise funds and mobilise awareness to take urgent action all together and to show solidarity,' Ban said.

Bono is the founder of an anti-poverty foundation ONE, which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease.

'I think we all saw this (picture of) this young kid lying in her own excrement and a load of people just standing around watching her die because they didn’t, they just knew not to touch her and she’s lying there dying,' Bono told 60 minutes.

'These are very dangerous moments.'

Bono also took the Prime Minister to task for slashing the funds dedicated to proving foreign aid. 

'I know you've got difficulties, every country does, and I respect them but I think the aid budget got 20% of the cuts, so that's a lot of lives,' Bono said, speaking about the Australia's 2014 Federal Budget.

'It just doesn't strike me as being very Australian.'

Bono's comments come after the head of the country's medical association implored the government to formulate a plan - labelling Australia's response to Ebola 'a shambles.'

Associate Professor Brian Owler called for the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis. 

Apparently 16 health care workers have been trained to go to west Africa and do 'dangerous work' with Ebola patients, Australian Medical Association president Associate  said.

But neither the AMA nor the Chief Medical Officer know who the people are, what sort of training they've had and whether they're properly prepared.

It's not the AUSMAT (Australian Medical Assistance) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work,' Assoc Prof Owler told reporters in Sydney.

'Who are these people? If anything is going to be irresponsible it would be a last minute announcement about people who are ill-equipped or ill-trained to go and do this dangerous work'. 

'People should be reassured that the risk of transmission of that infection is very, very, low, but obviously it is a concern,' he said.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten has also accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of not doing 'enough to deal with this crisis'.

'Logic dictates that you're better off dealing with the outbreak of a deadly and serious contagion closer to the source than waiting until it comes to Australia or comes to Papua New Guinea,' he said.

'If you want to deal with a contagion and a disease which is deadly and spreads very rapidly, you're better off dealing with it early.'

The US and UK asked for assistance from Australia a month ago, Assoc Prof Owler said.

The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia.

'While we drag our feet on this issue, while the government continues to roll out the tired old excuses about why we can't respond, unfortunately people are going to continue to die,' he said.

The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans.

He's called on the government to announce what it is going to do to help tackle the 'humanitarian crisis' overseas and what the plans are if a potentially infected person arrives in Australian.

And Assoc Prof Owler has 'big questions' about mandatory quarantines at airports for people returning from affected areas, like those to be set up in the US.

He said the nurse in Cairns, who had quarantined herself after showing signs of fever, had followed the right procedures by avoiding contact with others and alerting authorities.
