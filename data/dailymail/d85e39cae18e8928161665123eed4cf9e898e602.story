Police in New York City are searching for two men in connection with a violent armed robbery at a jewelry store in Manhattan’s Diamond District, just a short distance from the Veterans Day parade.

The incident happened about 2.30pm on Tuesday when the two suspects entered the business on the eighth floor of a building on 47th Street between 5th and 6th avenues. 

According to police, the suspects, who may have been carrying automatic weapons, pistol-whipped the owner and then made off with an unspecified amount of cash and jewelry.

NYPD initially believed that the suspects were still inside the building and blocked an entire city block as they conducted a floor-by-floor sweep of the building.

At least two police helicopters, a SWAT team, dozens of police vehicles, and K9 team were involved.

Officers from the New York Police Department’s elite Emergency Services Unit forced everyone inside the mid-rise building to evacuate, but didn't find the suspects.

Little is known about the two suspects except that they are described as black and that one was wearing a long black trench coat.

Witnesses said the men put on masks as they entered the building and were carrying large weapons. 

'They had guns. Big guns,' witness Joseph Meyrov told the Wall Street Journal.
