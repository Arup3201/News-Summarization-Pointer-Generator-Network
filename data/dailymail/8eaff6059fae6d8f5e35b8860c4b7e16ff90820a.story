His family and supporters continue to insist Mark Duggan was a ‘peaceful’ family man who abhorred violence.

But this photograph suggests his links with the criminal underworld were far deeper than first thought.

Staring menacingly into the camera, the gangster poses with his arms around two dangerous criminals who are each serving long sentences for murder and attempted murder. As one police source said: ‘He lived by the gun.’

Gangster rap: Mark Duggan with Junior Cameron, left, and Darrell Albert, who are serving life for murder and attempted murder

And during the four-month inquest into his death, a torrent of evidence revealed the 29-year-old was one of the most violent gangsters in Europe – and linked to ten shootings and two murders.

He was a senior member of North London’s notorious Tottenham ManDem gang, which traded in violence, intimidation and drugs.

In the eight years before his death, Duggan was repeatedly arrested over a raft of serious crimes, including murder, attempted murder and a range of firearms offences.

Despite this, his mother Pamela, 55, maintains he was a ‘lovely young boy’ who tried to keep peace.

Last night she refused to accept the jury’s verdict, claiming he was a peacemaker, was not in a gang and was no danger to the public.

It is a picture put forward by Duggan’s family and supporters ever since England burned during days of widespread disorder in the summer of 2011.

Back then, few knew of his association with some of the most feared criminals in Europe.

To Duggan’s right in the picture is Junior Cameron, a career criminal serving a life sentence for shooting a man after a minor prang between their cars.

Cameron pulled a semi-automatic pistol on Gary Guthrie in Streatham, South London, and shot him in the back as he tried to escape. The 39-year-old died in hospital.

Cameron committed the murder in October 2007 – six months after being freed early from prison. The man to Duggan’s left is Darrell Albert, who was in the same car as Cameron that night.

During the confrontation he shot Mr Guthrie’s friend Rowan Williams with a Baikal 9mm pistol – now the weapon of choice for gangsters.

Mr Williams, 37, took a bullet in the neck but it was removed by surgeons and he survived.

As for Duggan, he was arrested on suspicion of murder in October 2003 after a body was found next to a ditch in Tottenham.

Gavin Smith, 28, had been abducted by a gang and then knifed in the back 17 times. He died from multiple stab wounds that pierced his lungs. Duggan was released without charge.

Three years later, he was arrested for the attempted murder of Surkhan Hussein, a Turkish mechanic who lost a kidney after being shot.

Two of Duggan’s associates were convicted but he walked free after a witness failed to pick him out on an identity parade.

The gangster was said to have shot a reveller in a crowded nightclub in Christmas 2010, and fired shots in a car park outside a club in February the following year. Again, he avoided court.

Jurors heard there were a number of ‘assaults, shootings and murders’ after TMD reignited a historical feud with the London Fields Gang.

TMD had a history of robbing rival drug dealers and turning up at nightclubs with guns.

But the wall of silence on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, where Duggan lived, meant many murders and shootings remain unsolved. Last night one senior Met detective told the Mail: ‘Duggan was a constant feature of briefings about the most dangerous gang members for months before his death.

‘There were regular intelligence reports of him having a gun, moving guns and the latest beefs he had with his rivals and supposed friends.

‘We were desperate to catch him red-handed and get him off the streets.

‘But the problem was very few people 
would talk to us because he did enjoy a perverse celebrity status in the
 circles he moved in.

‘Also, he lived such a chaotic life that it was difficult to keep track of where he was at any given time.’

Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 31, who gave Duggan a gun shortly before he was shot, said he was attacked by a gang including Duggan before his death.

When asked about Duggan’s killing during a police interview, he said: ‘They say karma is a bitch. They say you live by the gun and die by the bullet.’

Duggan, one of three brothers, was brought up on the Broadwater Farm Estate largely by his mother.

He is said to have had a difficult childhood and witnessed violence from a young age. One of his teachers at Broadwater Farm Primary School remembered how he was one of the ‘most disruptive children in the school’.

Boyan Yordanov, 47, said: ‘All kids, both the well behaved and the naughty ones, were frightened of him.

‘They never knew when they would be 
attacked by Mark. Sadly at this young age, he had become the epitome of 
aggression, as if there was nothing positive in this life for him.

‘His
 attacks were sudden, unpredicted and vicious. He had no concept of pain
 or the result of causing pain and he showed no mercy to his victims.

‘He would be reading a book and then seconds later he would be jumping on the chest of one of his class mates.

‘Once, over-excited during the 
preparations for a school party, Mark punched one of my female 
colleagues in the jaw. It appeared that at home he was watching 
wrestling all the time and was trying to imitate the wrestlers.

‘Everything
 related to violence fascinated him. Once he appeared at the school with
 a large assault knife. Luckily one of my colleagues saw him just before
 he entered  the school.’

His behaviour worsened when he reached secondary school and he was sent away to live in Manchester with an aunt.

During the inquest his mother claimed Duggan returned to Tottenham several years later as a ‘well balanced’ man.

What
 was carefully omitted was the fact the one of Duggan’s uncles was the 
late Desmond ‘Dessie’ Noonan, whose feared family are ‘major players’ in
 the Manchester underworld.

Duggan
 is said to have regularly spent time with Noonan before the crime boss 
was stabbed to death in 2005 at the age of 46 by a Jamaican enforcer 
working for a Yardie drug gang.

Dublin-born Noonan dominated the Manchester underworld in  the 1990s and made numerous appearances in court charged  with violence.

During an interview for a TV documentary called Gangster in 2005, Noonan suggested his family were untouchables.

He said: ‘We have a lot of strong 
loyal people around us. We will always have that. If they think they can
 take one of us out, they are silly people. Very silly people.’

He also boasted: ‘I’ve got a bigger army than the police. We have more guns than the police.’

And
 at one stage during the Channel 5 documentary with journalist Donal 
MacIntyre, he hinted that he was responsible for 27 murders.

Hundreds
 of so-called ‘Noonan Boys’ – youngsters said to be allied to the crime 
family – were allegedly among the rioters and looters in Manchester city
 centre in 2011.

On his return to London, Duggan hooked up with TMD and his life of gang crime began.

Known as ‘Starrish Mark’ in recent years, Duggan was also a senior member of The Star Gang, which is an off-shoot of TMD.

In the months before he died, Duggan is said to have become obsessed with the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton.

The 23-year-old was stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at a nightclub in East London in a row over drugs and a woman in March 2011.

Duggan is said to have become paranoid about his own safety and carried a gun for protection. One source said he was planning to avenge the death.

Friends say he was intending to marry 29-year-old Semone Wilson, his long-term partner, and move away from Tottenham with their two sons, aged 12 and nine, and three-year-old daughter.

But in the end, the lure of  guns and violence proved to be  too strong.
