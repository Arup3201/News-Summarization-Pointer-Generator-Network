An Arizona Department of Corrections K-9 dog died last month after his handler left him in a hot department vehicle for seven hours.

According to an initial investigative report, the dog named Ike was left in the back of his handler's SUV and locked in its kennel, without food or water for seven hours at the Arizona State Prison in Buckeye, Arizona.

The officer left work early to take care of a sick child when he forgot he left the animal in the back of the vehicle.

Arizona State Prison - Lewis in Buckeye, Arizona: The 7-year-old dog was inside the SUV from 6:45 a.m. to 1:50 p.m. when the temperature outside hit 98 degrees

The Maricopa County Attorney's Office 
has received the case against correctional officer Jesse Dorantes but 
prosecutors haven't decided whether to charge him, according to an 
agency spokesman.

An investigative report released Friday by the 
Department of Corrections said Dorantes left Ike, his canine partner of 
four years, inside of a cage located in a white Ford Escape because he 
forgot that he placed him in the vehicle.

Just before 2 p.m. the handler contacted his supervisor and let him know what happened.

An official then went to check on the animal, but the dog was already dead.

The
 sergeant found the K-9 dead in the locked cage inside the SUV. The 
vehicle's windows were rolled up and there was no food or water.

The 7-year-old dog was inside the SUV from 6:45 a.m. to 1:50 p.m. when the temperature outside was close to 100 degrees.

A necropsy determined the dog died by elevated body temperature.

Dorantes reportedly cried at the news and said he mistakenly forgot about Ike.

The
 veterinarian who performed the necropsy told investigators that Ike's 
internal temperature was 110 degrees, despite having been packed in ice 
and stored in a refrigerator.

The dog's organs would have begun to fail at 107 degrees, according to the report.

Investigators concluded that Dorantes was reckless in caring for Ike's needs and welfare, the report says

'Clearly
 the officer is very remorseful about this terrible situation,' said 
Department of Corrections spokesman Doug Nick. 'When something like this
 occurs, it's just a reminder to everybody, tragically so, that you need
 to be very mindful of what your job is.'

The Department Of Corrections is recommending the Maricopa County Attorney's Office charge the handler with cruelty to animals.
