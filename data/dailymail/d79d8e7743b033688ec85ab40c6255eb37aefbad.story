A disgusted shopper filmed this video showing three rats infesting a supermarket aisle containing food.

Will Clarke took the nausea-inducing footage of at least three different rodents at a branch of QFC in Wallingford, Seattle - and said he heard many more squeaking out of sight.

'They're cute,' Mr Clarke told Seattle broadcaster KIRO 7. 'They’re just in the wrong place.'

The footage shows the vermin scampering across the aisle, close to cereal bins. A QFC spokeswoman admitted the store has had problems with rats in the past.

Rats can carry deadliy illnesses which can be passed to humans, including Weil’s disease, which has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure.

Keith Seinfeld, a spokesman for the King County Health Department, said the store staff phoned them for advice on dealing with the rat problem.

Mr Clarke added: 'I’m outraged that it got to the point that it did, because there were clearly a lot of them,' Clarke said. 'It wasn’t something that happened yesterday.'

The QFC spokeswoman added: 'We apologise for this unfortunate situation and can assure our customers that we are doing everything possible to prevent future problems from occurring.

'We thoroughly sanitised this area and, out of an abundance of caution, we discarded our bulk products and we will not restock for [a period of time].'

She added that the company is stepping up pest control enforcement in and around the store and is working with the King County Health Department to prevent this from happening again.
