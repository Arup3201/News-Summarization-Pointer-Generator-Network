A Port Authority police recruit is claiming she was repeatedly sexually harassed and humiliated by her academy instructors who called her too pretty for the job and likened her to an 'American Girl doll'.

According to her federal lawsuit, Amanda Holley, 29, alleges that Sgt. Erick Torres told her she would die as an officer and made the lurid suggestion she would make a good looking body in her coffin.

'Holley, when you are killed in the line of duty, I'll make sure you look pretty for your family,' PA Sgt. Erick Torres allegedly told trainee Amanda Holley, 29, her suit claims.

'I do a lot of funerals for fallen cops, and I normally never look at their face, but for you, I'll make sure you look pretty.'

Holley, who lives in Jackson Township, alleges that she was picked out for unfair treatment the minute she arrived at the Jersey City academy in August 2013. 

According to the New York Post, she was sexually harassed from day one until the day she was fired, four months later.

The trainee, who graduated with a masters degree in May, 2012, says that she was made to do squat thrusts on her own in front of the entire platoon and was subject to name-calling by Torres.

Holley says that Torres would sing 'She is an American Girl doll' and 'One time, Sgt. Torres told (the) plaintiff that he took his two daughters to the American Girl Doll store and swore that he saw the plaintiff there.'

On the day she was fired, Torres called her out of class claims Holley for a meeting with supervisors.

'While waiting outside the chief's office, plaintiff reached into her duffle bag to grab a memo book,' the lawsuit says. 'Sgt. Torres then put his hand on his gun and asked what plaintiff was reaching for, implying that she was reaching for her weapon.

According to the New York Post, Torres also called Holley, Angelina Jolie after her lips swelled because of a pepper-spray test and added she was sprayed more times than other recruits.

History: Amanda's family have a proud history in the police force which caused her to try and join in the first place (Amanda is pictured center in the early 1990s)

'The whole thing was obviously heartbreaking for me,' said Holley to The Post.

'To be ridiculed and feel ashamed of the way I looked was the hardest part. I was just embarrassed and humiliated.'

Holley blames the harassment for her failure to graduate in December 2013, and says she never received the same tuition and time as the other female trainees. 

Indeed, prior to attempting to join the police, Holley worked as a social worker at the New Jersey Department of Corrections - a fact she claims was used against her.

'Sgt. Torres made it appear that plaintiff did not have the gumption to do law-enforcement work and should have stuck with social work solely because she was a young female,' her lawsuit claims.

Holley also added she was disappointed she was fired because of her long family history within the NEw Jersery police.

The PA could not be reached for comment on the matter.
