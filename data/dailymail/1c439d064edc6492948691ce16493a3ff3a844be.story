A new year, a new MasterChef Champion, and this time it's Natalie Coleman.

The part-time DJ was crowned on Thursday night and she said, 'It's a dream come true.'

Thanks to her winning menu, Natalie, 29, became the third woman ever to take the title in the show's nine year history.

Dessert

As she was given the MasterChef trophy, judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace told Natalie she was 'destined for great things'.

50 contestants began in the BBC1 show, but the Hackney-born chef reigned victorious at the end of the eight week competition.

She defeated finalists Dale Williams and Larkin Cen, after tough challenges that took them to Italy.

They cooked with rustic chef Mamma Agata on the Amalfi Coast, and headed to Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence during their travels.

MailOnline can reveal she has already 
been offered a job at the prestigious Trinity restaurant in Clapham, 
London, after impressing owner and head chef Adam Byatt after she worked there during the hit show.

'I thought Natalie was a natural, she had a good pallet, was a tough character and listened really well, Mr Byatt said.

'I have been in contact with Natalie since her time with us and I was extremely proud to see her win Masterchef.

'I am in talks with her around working with us in the future. Every kitchen needs a Natalie.'

One of their daunting tasks saw the 
wannabe chef's attempt to impress four of the world's greatest chefs by 
preparing a three-course menu designed by two Michelin-starred chef 
Simon Rogan.

But the final task was to prepare a menu for John and Greg.

Speaking of their champion, Torode, 47, said: 'I think Natalie is destined for great things.

Defeated: Larken Cen and Dale Williams were beaten by Natalie

Emotional: The champion couldn't hold back the tears after being named winner

Proud moment: The part-time DJ beat 50 contestants to get the trophy and cried saying it was the best moment of her life

Impressed: Both John Torode and Gregg Wallace believe the Hackney-born chef will do 'great things'

Concentration: The finalists had to create a three-course meal for the judges

Own kitchen: Natalie said she'd love to open a restaurant one day

'She not only understands finery of great food but she cooks for the people, food that people want to eat.

'She makes people smile and she's not fazed by a thing.'

'She also has a great palate and understands flavour combinations,' the judge evaluated.

Deliberating: John and Gregg had nothing but good things to say about her menu

Starter and main: Natalie served lobster tail, accompanied by compressed fennel, and, roast pork belly, pork tenderloin and a scotch egg served with a pomme puree, caramelised shallots and two sauces

Dessert: Vanilla chocolate panna cotta topped with a tempered bitter chocolate tuile with caramelised pears and a trio of hazelnut crumble biscuits

Gregg, 48, agreed: 'Natalie is an incredible talent who grew in stature day after day.'

'I don't think she is fully aware of how good she really is.'

Coleman couldn't have been happier with her success: 'This is probably the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life.

'It's like a fairytale really, the girl from Hackney done good,' the champion laughed.

Natalie
will be appearing on stage at the BBC Good Food Show Summer, at the 
Birmingham NEC along with her fellow finalists from June 12 to 16.

Unlucky: Dale and Larkin were disappointed not to be crowned
