Broadway producers who want big stars at their premier usually want ones with a pulse.

But the folks who put Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway wanted the late author cremated remains at the play premier’s after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it.

They even went so far as to offer the ashes—and their owner—a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show.

A source of the New York Post confirmed the bizarre offer.

‘We did try to get him here,’ the source said. ‘We thought it would have been poignant for the entire company.’

Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984.

The two were close friends up until his death and Carson has seen the ashes argued over, stolen, returned, and nearly stolen again over the years.

The ashes were famously boosted during Carson’s 1988 Halloween party, along with $200,000 worth of jewelry.

However, they were mysteriously returned shortly thereafter.

That’s when Capote’s longtime partner questioned whether the ashes were those of his dead lover at all.

Someone again attempted to steal the remains at a showing put on by Carson of the play Tru, which is adapted from Capote’s works.

It was the history of theft that doomed Capote's post-mortem trip to the theater, or so says the Post's source.

'Ultimately, the risk of theft was just too high.'

In spite of the drama surrounding them, Carson has referred to her cremated friend’s remain as ‘her sanity’ over the years.

And Carson claims Capote always wanted to see ‘Holly Golightly open on Broadway.’

Though he was not in attendance, Capote’s wish came true March 20 when Breakfast at Tiffany’s, starring Emilia Clarke, made its debut at the Cort Theater.
