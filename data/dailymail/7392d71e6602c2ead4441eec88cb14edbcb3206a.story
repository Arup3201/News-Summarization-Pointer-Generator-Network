Warning: Gordon Brown will tell Glasgow University that Scotland faces a 'time bomb' with its pensions

Scotland faces a £700 million pensions ‘black hole’ if the SNP wins the independence referendum, Gordon Brown will claim tonight.

The former Prime Minister will join the Better Together campaign for the first time as he launches a passionate plea to ‘keep our pensions British’.

In a major speech at Glasgow University tonight, Mr Brown will produce an internal document from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) showing the cash benefits to Scotland of staying in the UK.

He will highlight the ‘time bomb’ facing the country as the number of elderly Scots is set to soar from 1 million to 1.3 million over the next 20 years, putting pressure on the welfare state.

By 2030, there will be 42 pensioners for every 100 people of working age in Scotland – compared to only 40 in the rest of the UK.

As part of the UK, Mr Brown will say, money from taxes generated in areas which have larger working-age populations, such as London, can be sent north to pay for the extra cost of State pensions.

He will say the ‘extra benefit’ for Scots will rise from £425 million a year to £700 million as part of the country’s £9.6 billion pensions bill, which is three times  the estimated income from oil revenues in 2016-17.

Mr Brown remains a popular figure north of the Border – but due to his hatred for the Tories and a personality clash with former Labour Chancellor and Better Together chairman Alistair Darling, he has avoided official pro-Union events until now.

'Time bomb': The number of elderly Scots is set to soar from 1 million to 1.3 million over the next 20 years

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘The last person anyone in Scotland will take lessons from when it comes to pensions is Gordon Brown – the man who destroyed final salary pension schemes with his £100billion raid and insulted our older folk with a miserly 75p increase in the State pension.

‘His track record means he lacks all credibility.’
