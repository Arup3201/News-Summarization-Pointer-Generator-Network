You may not be familiar with the name Charlotte Simone, but you will certainly know her fans.

The British accessories designer's fur and faux fur stoles are regularly seen adorning the necks of the fashionable and the famous.

Among the label's following are stylemakers including Alexa Chung, Rita Ora, Sienna Miller and Olivia Palermo, to name but a few. Indeed, Rita loves the fuzzy neon wraps so much, she even posed for the Charlotte Simone campaign.

Charlotte Beecham, the woman behind the much-loved designs, came up with the concept while studying at NYU 18 months ago. Now she has 120 stockists across the globe - largely thanks to her celebrity following.

But while the flashes of neon fur, which cost upwards of £155, have become her signature, Charlotte says she doesn't consider herself a 'fur label'.

'We've become known for fur pieces - like
 the fur-trimmed hood and the colourful popsicle scarf - but everything 
also comes in faux fur,' she told Vogue.co.uk.

Brains behind the brand: Charlotte Beecham came up with the concept while at NYU 18 months ago

'I never wanted to do fake fur just to be
 able to say we offered it, I really wanted to do a product that I 
believed in. Nice quality faux fur, that wears well and looks luxurious,
 is very expensive, and while I understand that some people choose fake 
fur rather than real as a lifestyle choice, I really didn't want to 
offer it just as a cheap alternative. It needed to be as beautiful as 
real fur - and in some styles it actually looks better.'

And her success with fur and faux has spurred her on to experiment with other luxury materials.

'Super-soft cashmere, really chunky knits, woven leather, shearling, silk, lambswool - the pieces have to feel great and the shapes are designed to be easy to wear,' Charlotte explained.

Nor is the collection solely geared at the twentysomething trendsetters.

'Everything from the hood, to the cuff, to the popsicle can be worn in 
several ways - and I love to see them being styled in different ways by 
different girls,' she added.

'My mum might wear something that Rita Ora has worn, but in a totally different way - I think that's so cool.'
