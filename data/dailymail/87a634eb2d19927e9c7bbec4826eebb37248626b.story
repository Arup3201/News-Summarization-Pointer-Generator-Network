Loic Remy has labelled Liverpool 'dishonest' after the striker's move to Anfield fell through due to a failed medical.

The new Chelsea forward was poised to join Liverpool for £8million from Queens Park Rangers, but the Premier League club pulled out of the agreement after Remy's medical tests.

The France international remains unsure as to why his move did not come off, insisting: 'I did not understand Liverpool's decision. It was not very honest from their side.'

The 27-year-old continued, telling Telefoot: 'I was not scared. I know exactly what I have, I met all the specialists in the world. A lot of players share the same situation as mine and Liverpool know it.'

Remy was diagnosed with a heart defect in 2010, but the problem seemed to put Liverpool off. 

Instead, Chelsea pounced and signed the striker on a four-year contract.

Remy became Chelsea's sixth major signing of the summer following the captures of Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Mario Pasalic (now loaned to Elche), Filipe Luis and Didier Drogba.
