Missing British guns that were being stored in the US consulate in Libya could have been seized by extremists after the site was destroyed.

An attack last month on the consulate in Benghazi - which killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans - followed Foreign Office diplomats’ withdrawal from the city in June.

The officials departed after an assassination attempt on the British ambassador, but left weapons and vehicles at the lightly-guarded US compound after an agreement was struck with the Americans.

One month after the attack, the equipment is still unaccounted for - and Libyans have been walking through the site’s remains, so guns could have already been seized, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The revelations came during a U.S. congressional hearing on Wednesday, which heard evidence from Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, who headed a 16-member U.S. military force in Libya.

He said the British could ‘leave their weapons and vehicles on our compound in Benghazi’ and would ‘come back and at times withdraw their weapons and vehicles and then return them and leave’.

Politicians at the hearing asked why the US stayed in the city even after the British pulled out as they thought it was no longer safe. Lt Col Wood said the withdrawal should have been a warning sign.

‘I almost expected the attack to come,’ he said. ‘We were the last flag flying. It was a matter of time.’

Foreign Office spokesman

Sir Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Libya, was in a convoy hit by a rocket-propelled grenade as it drove through Benghazi in June.

He escaped injury but two close protection officers were hurt.

A Foreign Office spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Following the suspension of our office in Benghazi the U.S. consulate agreed to store some equipment on our behalf.

'We are working with the U.S. to establish what, if anything, has happened to this equipment.’
