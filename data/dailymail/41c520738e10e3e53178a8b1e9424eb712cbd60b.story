Hundreds of air passengers narrowly avoided a massive mid-air collision when three U.S. commuter jets came within seconds of each other after a mix up by air traffic controllers.

The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating how the three U.S. Airways jets flew within feet of each other at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia on Tuesday afternoon.

A federal official told the Washington Post that confused air traffic controllers had 
launched two outbound flights directly at another plane coming in to 
land.

The inbound plane and one of the outbound planes began closing the 1.4 mile gap between them at a speed of 436 mph.

When the controller realised her mistake, all three planes, which were carrying a a total of 192 passengers and crew members, were just 12 seconds apart.

She immediately ordered one of the planes to change course. No one was hurt and all three planes reached their destinations without further issue.

The FAA said preliminary investigations 
show that the two outbound planes came within 500 and 600 feet 
respectively of the incoming jet.

Backed up: It is just the latest error made by air traffic controllers at increasingly busy airports

The mishap occurred as air traffic 
controllers decided to change flight courses in a response to a storm 
brewing just south of the airport.

Controllers at Warrenton, Virginia changed the runway and direction
from which planes were landing and taking off at the airport, and told 
the controller tower at the airport of the plan.

The near miss at Reagan National Airport in Virginia is just one mistake of many recorded in recent years.

The Federal Aviation Administration recorded a staggering 1,234 operational errors in 2009 and this jumped to 1,887 in 2010. Last year, there were 1,895 recorded mistakes.

Among the 2011 figures, there were 50 of the 'most serious incidents' - those that put aircraft closest to each other or that have the greatest chance of causing collisions.

Last year, the FAA took action against more than half a dozen controllers for mistakes after napping on the job during night shifts, including controllers at Reagan National.

In another near-miss in 2010, a heavily-loaded United Airlines plane leaving San Francisco passed within a few hundred feet of a single-engine propeller plane. Last year, a controller put two jets on a collision course at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport before a supervisor spotted the mistake; the jets were just 225 feet apart in the air.

'The tower agreed, but they didn’t pass it on to all the people they needed to pass it on to,' a federal official told the Post.

When the controller at National realised the mistake, radio recordings show she ordered the pilot to make a quick turn to the south.

'We were cleared [for landing] at the river there,' the pilot said after the turn, the Post reported. 'What happened?'

The controller simply responded: 'Stand by, we’re trying to figure this out.'

When she told him to fly one more time around the airport to begin landing, he warned: 'We really don’t have enough fuel 
here for this. We have to get on the ground pretty quick.'

The FAA said it is investigating the incident.

'During the switchover of operations,
miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of 
the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1
and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19,' FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown 
told AFP.

'The FAA... will take appropriate action to address the miscommunication.'

In
a statement, U.S. Airways said: 'We are currently investigating and 
working with the FAA to determine what occurred. The safety of our 
customers and employees is always our top priority.'

The
mishap - which was only 12 seconds from devastation - is just one of 
the several thousand errors by air traffic controllers recorded across 
the country in recent years.

Investigation: Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood held a news conference in Washington on Thursday to argue against calling the incident as a 'near miss'

The FAA recorded 1,234 operational errors in 2009 and this jumped to 1,887 in 2010. In 2011, there was a minor increase to 1,895.

Just last year, an air traffic controller at the same Virginia airport was found sleeping during the  overnight shift, and several controllers were suspended or fired by the FAA after the revelation.

A passenger as Reagan National Airport told ABC 7 he was not surprised by the near miss.

'You have to remember that people make mistakes and this is part of the problem,' Steve Wilson said.

'It's happened to me. We were landing and had to take right off again because they were crowding the runway. These things happen and it's frightening.'
