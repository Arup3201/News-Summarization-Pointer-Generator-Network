Bizarre: Dancing fanatic Dave Cooper, 48, claims he has been banned from Cosy Joes in Newcastle upon Tyne, because of his dancing

After a few drinks and with the right choice of music, most people lose their inhibitions and enjoy a good dance.

But it seems one man's dancing style is so unique it has got him banned from his favourite city centre bar.

Dave Cooper was a regular at Cosy Joes in Newcastle's city centre, and could be seen busting his moves on the dancefloor every weekend.

But the 48-year-old, who has become an internet star thanks to his American Ninja-inspired dancing, claims he's been barred from the popular nightspot.

Mr Cooper - affectionately known as Dishwater Dave - has gained a legion of fans through his dancing routines.

He said: 'Me and my friends go out on a weekend for a few drinks and a dance.

'I love to dance because I get frustrated with life. I don't like fighting, I'm not a fighter so I dance.'

Cosy Joes - which advertises on its website 'drink, dance, laugh, sing, party' has always been one of Mr Cooper's favourite spots.

But a night out to celebrate his birthday ended with Mr Cooper, who works as a dishwasher, allegedly being refused entry.

'Last weekend me and my mates went to go in Cosy Joes, where I've been going for ages, but the bouncers wouldn't let us in,' Mr Cooper said.

'They said they'd had lots of complaints about my dancing because of knocking over people's drinks and stuff.

'I have done that in the past and trodden on people's toes but I always apologise and buy people their drinks back.'

He added: 'When I spoke to the manager about it all he told me I was barred because some people who complained said they wouldn't come back if I was allowed to dance in there.

'I said that I didn't just come to dance, I do karaoke as well and the manager said "yeah, I know mate, you can't sing" but that's not the point of karaoke.

Complaints: Mr Cooper, pictured on the dancing floor, said he wasn't allowed in to Cosy Joes because they'd had lots of complaints about his dancing and knocking over people's drinks

Dispute: Mr Cooper said he always apologises if he stands on people's toes and said he was told by the manager that he can't sing when he does karaoke - but he's vowed not to let the dispute hinder his dancing

'I was disgusted by his attitude and more so when he said that my mates were blacklisted too even though they hadn't done anything.'

Mr Cooper has vowed to not let the dispute hinder his dancing.

He said: 'Even when I was young I used to come home from school and would go straight to my room and just dance away.

'It's developed from there and because I used to do martial arts, so I use that sometimes as well.

Party animal: Cosy Joes - which advertises on its website 'drink, dance, laugh, sing, party' has always been one of Mr Cooper's favourite spots

'I'm just a crazy dancer. I get called Lethal Weapon by people because I'm wild.'

Not only is dancing therapeutic for Mr Cooper  but it entertains pub-goers around Newcastle who love to watch him at a weekend.

Mr Cooper , from Newcastle, said: 'People love me whether I'm dancing or doing karaoke - even though I can't sing to save my life - but I've never had any trouble.

'I'm very, very well-known in town, I'm liked by a lot of people who recognise me because I go around a lot of the bars dancing and loads of DJs know me.'

He added: 'People have even put videos on YouTube of me dancing because they like me that much.'

Cosy Joes declined to comment.
