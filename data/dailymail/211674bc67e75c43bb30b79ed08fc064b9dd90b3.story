Bill de Blasio kept more than 100 people waiting for a commercial flight from JFK Airport to Puerto Rico because he was running late.

The revelation will do nothing to alleviate New York's mayor of his reputation for tardiness.

Passengers including city officials and holidaygoers had no idea why the boarding gate remained closed for 20 minutes after it was due to open on November 6.

Finally, de Blasio arrived with an entourage of security, and the JetBlue flight was deemed ready for boarding.

Tardy: Bill de Blasio cemented his reputation for lateness when he had a JetBlue flight held at JFK last month

The mayor and his security were seated first before others were allowed to board.

It has since emerged, in documents obtained by DNAinfo New York, that airport officials were ordered to hold the plane by de Blasio's NYPD security squad who radioed over.

Officials would not confirm why de Blasio was delayed en route to the Somos El Futuro Conference 2014 in San Juan.

He had finished a press conference in Coney Island at noon, with the flight due to leave at 2.29pm.

The flight left at 2.38pm. 

'We started to make our way over to the gate, about a half-hour before the flight was due to board,' a passenger told DNAinfo New York.

'There was a long line, but there was no boarding call and no one knew why. We were saying, 'Why are we just standing here? The plane is here. We are here. So what's the holdup?''

We finally understood why. It was the mayor that was holding us up, of course, and a few people could be heard joking, 'Late again,'' the passenger said.

'He was walking quite fast, with four or five people, probably security people, and he went straight past everyone onto the plane.'

Delay: More than 100 passengers including lawmakers and holidaygoers were left in the dark for 20 minutes

The incident came just a week before de Blasio enraged relatives of Flight 587 plane crash victims by turning up 20 minutes late for an annual moment of silence.

He missed the silence and the ringing of the bell that has happened at 9.17am on November 12 every year since 2001 - and intially blamed the fog before later admitting he slept in.

De Blasio cemented his reputation for lateness early on in his tenure when he was an hour late for a get-out-the-vote rally.

He admitted to reporters at the event last year that he had overslept as he arrived at 12.30pm for the 11.30am stunt.

Staffers told Politiker in 2013 that de Blasio has trouble getting up in the mornings and they had been forced to stall the start of numerous events.

The Mayor's Office has yet to reply to MailOnline for a comment.
