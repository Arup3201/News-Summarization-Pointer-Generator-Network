The doctor found to be responsible for the death of pop icon Michael Jackson will be freed from jail in just three months - after serving less than two years following his 2011 involuntary manslaughter conviction for giving the 'King of Pop' a lethal dose of the powerful sedative propofol.

Conrad Murray is scheduled to be freed from the Los Angeles County Jail on October 28, after serving less than two years of a four-year sentence - and members of Jackson's family reportedly are livid.

Murray served his time in county jail - rather than state prison - due to overcrowding in the the California prison system.

'It is not right I will never be able to see my son again, while his mother can see him,' sources close to the Jackson family told the Daily Mirror.

The source went on to say the family - including his devastated children, Paris, 15, Prince, 16, Blanket, 11, and his 83-year-old mother, Katherine - feels Murray 'should serve his time for his crime.'

'Murray is the killer of Michael in their eyes. He cost them their son and father,' the source said, adding that 'for [Murray] to get out in two years is an insult. They still feel he should have been tried for murder.'

Murray was sentenced to four years for Jackson's death, but is expected to get time off from his sentence for good behavior.

'He has been a model inmate and the authorities have granted him an early
 release due to that good behaviour and the overcrowded California jail 
system,' a friend of the doctor's told the paper.

Murray reportedly has been serving his time in solitary confinement because of the high-profile nature of his case - and because the victim was a beloved figure in pop culture. Despite being in solitary confinement, Murray has both a television and a cell phone in his cell.

In addition to the reduced sentence, the Jackson family is enraged that Murray has refused to provide testimony in their wrongful death lawsuit against concert promoter AEG Live, which was promoting Jackson's 2009 'This Is It' tour.

The tour was pegged as Jackson's final tour. The family claims that the grueling rehearsal schedule - and AEG Live's negligence in hiring Murray - contributed to Jackson's death in June of 2009.

This week, Murray made headlines when he said that if he was forced to testify in the wrongful death case, he would reveal information about Jackson's relationship with his family that would be like a 'nuclear' bombshell. It's unclear to what he might be referring.

Murray says he wants nothing to do with the lawsuit because he fears he could be incriminated.

Murray is appealing his criminal conviction.
