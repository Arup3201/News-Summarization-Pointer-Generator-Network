A New York state man has been charged with assault after state police said he sliced another motorist's face with a bayonet during a road rage encounter along a suburban Buffalo highway.

Troopers said 26-year-old Bryan Cirbus, of West Valley, sideswiped another man's car Friday where Interstate 90 and Route 219 merge in West Seneca.

Both drivers pulled to the side of the highway, where Cirbus pulled out the bayonet, troopers said in a release. 

Charged: Bryan D. Cirbus is accused of cutting the other man's face and hands with a bayonet and trying to stab his shoulder 

Cirbus allegedly cut the other man's face and hands and sliced his jacket while trying to stab the man's shoulder.

The name of the 35-year-old male victim was not included by troopers.

A female passenger in Cirbus' car held him back, and he fled before officers showed up, according to police.

Cirbus later went to the Boston, New York, state police barracks and turned himself in, the release said.

Troopers said that Cirbus faces a second-degree felony assault charge, a third-degree felony criminal possession of a weapon charge, a second-degree misdemeanor menacing charge, as well as two counts of misdemeanor endangering the welfare of a child charges.

He posted $1,000 bail and is out of the Erie County Jail, Syracuse.com reported.

Troopers say Cirbus is due in court Tuesday night at 7pm. Court officials didn't know if he has a lawyer.
