Twitter has been sent a letter from Sony's lawyer demanding that any account sharing the leaked information should be suspended.

The US have blamed North Korea for the cyber attack on Sony, but this has been denied any involvement. North Korean leader KIm Jong-un was pictured today visiting a catfish farm

In the letter published on US website Motherboard, the firm's lawyer David Boies wrote: 'If Twitter does not comply with this request, and the Stolen Information continues to be disseminated by Twitter in any manner, SPE will have no choice but to hold Twitter responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by Twitter.'

Twitter were also asked to pass a copy of the letter to London based musician Val Broeksmit, who has been sharing screenshots of the leaked information. 

Today Mr Broeksmit's Twitter account appeared to still be operational on the social networking site.

A spokesman for Twitter confirmed to the MailOnline that they had received a letter from Sony and that they forwarded it to one user. 

Sony yesterday performed a u-turn and said that it would now release the Seth Rogan-James Franco comedy 'The Interview, ' a film about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

It came just days after it cancelled the movies release after hackers threatened real-world attacks on screening it.   

The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie pulled it after the threats. 

The US have accused North Korea of being behind the cyber attack, but the country has denied any involvement. 

The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes. 

A further series of  internal documents were also made public, ranging from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures.

Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges.

She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond.

Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra.
