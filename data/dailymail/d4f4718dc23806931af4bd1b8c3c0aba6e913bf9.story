A sci-fi fan has recreated masterpieces - from Star Wars figures.

David Eger wanted to combine his love of the films with passion for photography and art in a year-long project.

The result is a hilarious series entitled 12 Months of Hope, Empire & Jedi which replaces classical figures in paintings with characters from the films.

A highlight of the series sees Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader recreating Michelangelo's famous Creation of Adam fresco from the Sistine Chapel.

Mr Eger, a 31-year-old married art and photography teacher from Milton, Ontario, had previously carried out two previous year-long photo projects - 52 Weeks of Star Wars and 365 Days of Clones - but wanted to do one with a more historical flavour.

This one, entitled the 'Creation of Luke', is based upon Michelangelo's most famous section of his fresco in the Sistine Chapel, The Creation of Adam

Original: The restored 'Creation of Adam' by Michelangelo Buonarroti on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City

Caravaggio's The Calling of Saint Matthew depicting Jesus and Saint Peter is shown is this image, titled 'The Calling of Obi-Wan Kenobi'
