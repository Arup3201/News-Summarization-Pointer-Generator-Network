Rosie Tapner, the British model tipped to be the next Cara Delevingne, proves that she is more than just a pretty face in her new fashion film.

The 17-year-old schoolgirl, who you may recognise from the windows of Topshop's Oxford Street store, stars in i-D's new fashion film.

The fashion site headed to the beautiful Berkshire countryside for a wholesome day out with the model schoolgirl for the latest in the More Than A Model series.

Model schoolgirl: Rosie Tapner may only be 17 but she already has a Vogue cover and Topshop campaign under her belt - and now she's the star of i-D's fashion film

Showcasing the secret talents of fashion’s most prominent faces, More Than A Model aims to unlock a side of the girls rarely seen on camera.

i-D join Rosie at the Wasing Estate as she runs, cycles and gallops her way through the short film, capturing the essence of the British countryside and featuring a cameo by Rosie’s very own horse, Floyd.

Despite her tender years, Rosie is already a star of her school’s lacrosse team, competes in British Eventing competitions and has managed to fit a British Vogue cover around all her extra-curricular activities.

Talents: The boarding school girl showcases her lacrosse, horse riding, running and, of course, modelling skills

Since Rosie Tapner signed with Kate Moss and Cara Delevinge's agency, Storm, her day jobs have included working with Burberry, Chloe, Vogue and exclusive work for Balenciaga.

She also happens to buddies with Cara and Jourdan Dunn and shot to fame when she performed the Harlem Shake dance with the pair backstage at Topshop last year.

Speaking to MailOnline at the time, Rosie said: 'I'm just walking for Topshop this season, partly because of school. I've got a lot on at school at the moment.

Grounded: The school girl loves playing sports and says her friends at home keep her grounded

Friends in the right places: Rosie joined her friend Jourdan Dunn to pose for Selfridges

Rise to fame: Since Rosie signed with Storm, her day jobs have included working with Burberry, Chloe, Vogue and exclusive work for Balenciaga

'It's easy for me at school because I've got that grounded life where I don't need to think about all of this.

'I absolutely love this hype, it's amazing but I just try to keep my head out of it and not read too much

into it.

‘My favorite thing is going back to school and having normality. I was in Miami last week, shooting the Topshop campaign in the 80 degree heat, and then came back to England’s rain and just hung out with my friends. It’s hilarious really.'

Backstage buddies: She showcased her dancing skills backstage at Topshop last year with Cara and Jourdan - and it quickly went viral
