As political slanging matches go, it was more sticks-and-stones than a clash of rapier-like wits.

A spat between Nick Clegg and Boris Johnson descended into a war of words... over who was the lazier.

It began when the Deputy Prime Minister branded the London Mayor a ‘slacker’.

Air war: Nick Clegg, pictured during his weekly show today, accused Boris Johnson of being a 'slacker' for only hosting a radio show once a month

Mr Johnson retorted that Mr Clegg was
an ‘idle bum’ with only a ‘ceremonial post’ in government. The row 
erupted yesterday after it was revealed that Mr Johnson is to host a 
monthly phone-in show on London radio station LBC.

Who do you think is the biggest slacker?

He will take questions for 45 minutes
on the breakfast show, mediated by Nick Ferrari. But Mr Clegg, who 
answers questions on LBC for half an hour each week, dismissed the Tory 
Mayor’s effort as inadequate.

The Liberal Democrat leader told 
listeners to his Call Clegg show: ‘I’m going to call him Slacker Johnson
from now on. He’s only on once a month. If imitation is the sincerest 
form of flattery, I’m delighted he is trying to follow in my footsteps, 
but he should put the hours in.

‘Every week – I want to see Slacker Johnson every week.’

Hitting back at the jibe, the London 
Mayor made his contempt for Mr Clegg clear, accusing the Deputy Prime 
Minister of not having a proper job.

‘Good to see Nick’s got spare time in [his] ceremonial role as Lib leader,’ Mr Johnson said, before branding him an ‘idle bum’.

A Lib Dem source then accused the 
Mayor of spending his time conspiring against David Cameron, saying: 
‘I’m not sure whiling away days in City Hall plotting your route to No 
10 constitutes a full-time job.’

The Mayor’s term lasts until 2016, 
but many Tory MPs expect him to return to Parliament as an MP at the 
2015 General Election – so that he is well placed to become Conservative
leader if Mr Cameron fails to win a majority.

Bookmakers yesterday listed Mr 
Johnson as 4-1 second favourite to become the next Tory leader, behind 
Home Secretary Theresa May.

When asked later yesterday whether he
would rather have a drink with Mr Johnson or Mrs May, Mr Clegg replied:
‘After some of the things that Boris Johnson’s said about me recently 
I . . . anyway, I’d probably pour the drink over his blond mop.’
