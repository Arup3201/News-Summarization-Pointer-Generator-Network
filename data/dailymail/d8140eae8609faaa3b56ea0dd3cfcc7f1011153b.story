Historian: Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt faced charges of hypocrisy after taking lessons himself while campaigning against unqualified teachers

A Labour education spokesman who has condemned government plans to allow more unqualified teachers into the classroom has boasted of taking lessons himself.

Former TV historian Tristram Hunt revealed he ‘teaches in schools’ including delivering a lesson on the Spanish Armada to primary-age pupils.

But he faced charges of hypocrisy because the Labour party policy is for only qualified teachers to be allowed into the classroom.

Mr Hunt, a respected academic who has presented history programmes for the BBC, used a newspaper interview to reveal he regularly takes charge of classes.

‘I teach in schools in Stoke when they allow me, to make sure I know what's going on,’ he told The Guardian.

‘I do a class at the FE college about Cape Town as a city of empire. And I do an industrial revolution class at the sixth form.

‘And I taught a class on the Spanish Armada to a primary school.’

But the comments from the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central appear to be at odds with the official Labour party line.

Just yesterday his boss, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg, condemned Michael Gove’s plans to allow more unqualified teachers into schools as the ‘wrong approach’.

Under Michael Gove’s policy, increasing numbers of schools are able to employ unqualified teachers. When we know the key to standards is the quality of teaching, this is the wrong approach.

Mr Twigg added: ‘It will be one where we insist on high standards for our children, with qualified teachers in every classroom.’

A source close to Mr Gove said: ‘Hunt's hypocritical attitude is – “don't do as I do but do as I say”.

‘Yesterday, Hunt was saying that great teachers should be fired from state schools if they don't have a particular teaching license that Unions like.

‘Today, it turns out that Hunt himself teaches in state schools without that license.

‘Instead of media posing, Hunt should encourage more great teachers from private schools into state schools without the bureaucracy that he wants to swerve himself. It's typical hypocrisy on schools from rich Labour MPs.'

Reforms: Education Secretary Michael Gove has said he wants more unqualified teachers in academies, giving them the same freedoms as free schools and the independent sector (file picture)

Last year Mr Gove announced academies would be able to employ no formal teaching qualifications, in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector.

The Department for Education said the flexibility would more schools to hire ‘great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before’.

Today Mr Hunt, who has a doctorate from Cambridge, insisted he was not acting as a teacher, but simply taking lessons.

He told MailOnline: ‘When I’m invited I go and give talks in schools and I am delighted to do so.

‘I don’t teach a course or anything like that. I don’t mark, I just give them some history.

‘It is actually part of the broader issue that schools and schoolchildren should be exposed to as many outside speakers and ideas as possible.

‘Our party’s policy is that fully operational teachers should be qualified, so if you are running a class or course or marking…

‘I definitely think you need qualifications and training about different ways to teach about different school kids.’

Questions were also raised about David Miliband - brother of Labour leader Ed - who taught politics to local students before quitting as an MP for a job in America.

Tory MP Craig Whittaker, a member of the education select committee, said: 'We believe heads and governors are best placed to decide who are the best teachers, not bureaucrats.

'It's a mistake to confuse being properly qualified and state controlled licenses, and it would be wrong to stop brilliant teachers who want to be able to switch from private to state schools from doing so.

'I'm sure Tristram Hunt and David Miliband are great teachers - but so are many others who, just like them, teach without a state controlled licence.'
