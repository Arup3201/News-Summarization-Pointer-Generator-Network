A double decker bus has had its roof torn off after hitting a notorious blackspot bridge where up to six serious crashes happen every year.

The spectacular accident in Manningtree, Essex, has ignited calls for urgent action before someone is killed.

Fortunately no passengers were on board the bus when the incident took place yesterday morning.

A local councillor has described the lack of casualties as a huge stroke of luck and called for a review to take place to put a stop to the crashes which have plagued the bridge for the last three decades.

Councillor Carlo Guglielmi, said: 'Thank God we have not had a fatality there.

'But if we keep having accidents something sinister is likely to happen in the near future.

'A solution could not come soon enough.

'I call on the three agencies - Highways, Essex County Council and Network Rail - to discuss this problem once and for all.'

The entire top half of the double decker bus was ripped off after smashing into the bridge in Essex

Mr Guglielmi said there had been about six serious accidents a year at the notorious bridge over the last three decades and that better signposting would make the area safer.

As well as the road being closed for five hours whilst the crash scene was cleared, train services were also affected in the area as structural engineers assessed the damage to the railway bridge.

The town's Mayor said she backed demands to improve safety at the bridge.

Local councillor Carlo Guglielmi said it was a huge stroke of luck that no one has died at the accident blackspot

Mrs Lay-Flurrie said: 'We have known for years there's something wrong with the crossing.

'It's always been such a nightmare there.

'I find it amazing that a double-decker bus would even try to get under there.'

'I'm pleased no-one was hurt and I feel sorry for the driver - he must be feeling awful.'

Bus owner Carters refused to comment on the smash last night.
