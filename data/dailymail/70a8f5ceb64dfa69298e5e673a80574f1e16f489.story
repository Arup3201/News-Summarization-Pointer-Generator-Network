They are as industrious as Bob the Builder and possess the same social intelligence as a colony of termites.

A crew of self-organising robots created by U.S. scientists can construct towers, castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions.

It is hoped the study of the co-operative bots is a small step towards a time when autonomous robots could build real structures on Earth and even on other planets.

Sociable: Scientists have created a crew of self-organising robots (pictrued) that can construct towers, castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions

Termes bots are given an overall idea of what the finished job should look like, before being left to get on with it.

All that guides them are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and simple 'traffic' rules that determine whether to go or stop.

Termes bots require no centralised controller or complex system to talk to each other.

The bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on bricks, and sonar for navigation.

They follow two sets of rules. One determines how a robot makes its next move and applies to any structure being built.

The other consists of 'traffic laws' that correspond to a specific structure.

The traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots and material through the structure.

Safety checks performed by the bots mean they do not get stranded and work with each other.

All
 that guides them are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and 
simple 'traffic' rules that determine whether to go or stop.

They also know when to lift a building brick and where to attach it, as 
well as how to avoid collisions and even how to reach higher levels by 
constructing staircases.

While the robots are just over 6-inches long and the building bricks are made of lightweight foam, the 
scientists are impressed by what their creations are capable of.

In 
future, similar autonomous machines could be used to build full-scale 
structures for human use, possibly in dangerous settings where it might 
be difficult for humans to work from earthquake shelters and underwater 
habitats on Earth to bases on the moon or Mars.

Termites have long amazed experts with their ability build. Millions of the insects co-operate to manufacture their mounds, which can stand 8ft tall (pictured)

'The key inspiration 
we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really 
complicated as a group, without a supervisor and secondly that you can 
do it without everybody discussing explicitly what's going on, but just 
by modifying the environment,' said U.S. computer scientist Professor 
Radhika Nagpal, from Harvard University.

Termites have long amazed 
experts with their ability build.

Millions of the insects co-operate to 
manufacture their mounds, which can stand 8ft tall and act as 
sophisticated air conditioning systems for nests.

Inside each mound 
is a complex system of tunnels and shafts and unlike human builders, 
termites need no detailed blueprints from which to work, instead relying
 on a process called ‘stigmergy’ - a kind of implicit communication.

They observe each other interacting with the environment and act accordingly in a way that, scaled up, looks intelligent.

The Termes bots employ the same principle.

In
 contrast to other working robots, such as those in car factories, they 
require no centralised controller or complex system of talking to each 
other.

Each robot has a set of wheels and a single lifting arm with a spring-loaded gripper.

The bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on the bricks, and sonar for navigation.

Despite their small size, scientists are highly impressed by what their creations are capable of. In the future, similar autonomous machines could be used to build full scale structures for human use, possibly in dangerous settings where it might be difficult for humans to work

Just two kinds of rules ensure the building project does not descend into chaos.

One determines how a robot makes its next move and applies to any structure being built.

The
 other consists of 'traffic laws' that correspond to a specific 
structure, according to the study, which is published in the journal 
Science.

The traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites 
they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots 
and material through the structure.

'If they built carelessly, it 
would be easy for them to build in a way where they got stuck,' said 
team member Dr Justin Werfel, from the Wyss Institute for Biologically 
Inspired Engineering in Cambridge, U.S.

'The safety checks involve a 
robot looking at the sites immediately around itself, paying attention 
to where the bricks already are and where others are supposed to be and 
making sure certain conditions in that local area are satisfied.'

'The key inspiration we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really complicated as a group, without a supervisor, and secondly that you can do it without everybody discussing explicitly what's going on, but just by modifying the environment,' said Professor Radhika Nagpal, from Harvard University

One
 of the key advantages of the system is that it is not dependent on a 
set number of interactive units working together, Dr Werfel explained.

'Individual
 robots can break down but the rest can carry on. There's no one 
critical element that brings everything down if one fails,’ he said.

During the study, the scientists filmed the robots recovering from unexpected changes made to the structures they were building.

'When
 many agents get together, whether they're termites, bees or robots, 
often some interesting, higher-level behaviour emerges that you wouldn't
 predict from looking at the components themselves,' Dr Werfel said.

'Broadly
 speaking, we're interested in connecting what happens at the low level,
 with individual agent rules, to these emergent outcomes.'
