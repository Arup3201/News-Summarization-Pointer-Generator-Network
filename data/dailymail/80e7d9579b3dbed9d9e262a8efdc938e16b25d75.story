Pep Guardiola insists he'll never coach Barcelona again despite leading the club to their most successful ever spell.

Under Guardiola, the Spanish giants won 14 trophies in four years - including two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles - as the Catalan club became widely renowned as one of the best teams to ever grace the beautiful game.

Following his departure at the end of the 2011-12 season,  Gerardo Martino and the late Tito Vilanova  both  failed to replicate the 43-year-old's success while Luis Enrique's start at the Nou Camp has included an El Clasico defeat to eternal rivals Real Madrid so far.

Guardiola, who took a sabbatical before taking charge of Bayern Munich last season, revealed his ambition to one day return to live in Catalonia  but nothing more - citing that his chapter as Barcelona manager is well and truly closed.

'In principle I won't coach Barca again. I think that there are cycles in life and that mine [at Barca] finished,' he told Mundo Deportivo.

'My wife has her work here [in Barcelona] and the idea is to come back and live here. But I don't know when that will be.'
