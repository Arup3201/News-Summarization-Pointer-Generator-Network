Police are investigating Ched Evans' family today because CCTV footage of his victim was published on his official website.

The woman, now 22, is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans, who was released from prison last week.

North Wales Police told MailOnline they are 'looking into' the post named: 'Too drunk to consent, too drunk to remember?', which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago.

Investigation: Police are probing the decision to publish CCTV showing the victim of Ched Evans, pictured yesterday with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, on the night of her rape

Website: Evans, who despite his conviction maintains his innocence, has a website demanding justice and on it the woman he raped is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked

The police, Crown Prosecution Service and Premier Inn have said they did not give permission for the film to be used. 

Evans' website, which is run by his family, has asked viewers to 'judge for yourself' if she was drunk when he attacked her. Her face is obscured in the film. 

The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years after the jury unanimously agreed  she had been too drunk to consent to sex with him.  

Two years ago she had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012, but now may have to do the same again.

The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. 

Police put her ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet.

Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. 

Evans, right, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission

Anger: Twitter uses have reacted to the news that Evans' victim may have been named again by trolls

But Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. 

Detective Superintendent Jo Williams said: 'The victim in this case has been in regular contact with officers responsible for her care and she is receiving appropriate support at this difficult time. She has been fully appraised of all her options.'

Victim: Ched Evans' victim's  new identity has apparently been published by trolls. She moved away from her friends and family, because of the abuse she suffered after being raped but may have to take on a third identity

Yesterday Ched Evans was seen smiling in public as he went shopping with his loyal girlfriend Natasha Massey in Cheshire.

The footballer, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence and is looking for a new club, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

It normally takes 18 months to examine a miscarriage of justice claim but Evans’ application will be considered ‘within weeks’ after fresh evidence was put forward by his legal team.

The Commission said its decision ‘does not in any way represent a judgment as to the merits of the case or its chances of being referred to the Court of Appeal’. 

The move has caused concern among rape campaigners. Rape Crisis England and Wales said: ‘We’re concerned that survivors’ voices and feelings [should] not be lost or overlooked in the furore surrounding one high-profile rapist’s release.’

Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB) said: ‘Rehabilitation requires remorse. Evans has continuously denied that he committed rape.’

An appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the court of appeal in 2012. 

In an interview in the Sunday Mirror, the former Sheffield United and Wales footballer – who hopes to resume his career – failed to apologise to his victim but praised his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25, for standing by him.

‘I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock,’ he said.

‘I am very lucky my girlfriend Tasha has stood by me. She knows I am not capable of rape.

‘I want to play football again, but I am determined to prove my innocence.

‘I really thought it would have been thrown out of court. I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong.’

Some fans at Sheffield United are asking the club to re-sign Evans saying he has served his sentence and should be rehabilitated.

But more than 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back.

TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy last week by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’ during a panel discussion on ITV’s Loose Women.

Her comments caused a wave of outrage and abuse on social media and also sparked threats against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe, wishing rape on her.
