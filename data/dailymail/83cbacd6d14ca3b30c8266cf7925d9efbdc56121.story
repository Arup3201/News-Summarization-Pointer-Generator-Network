She works out for two hours each day and runs a successful fitness empire so it comes as no surprise that Lucy Mecklenburgh has been snapped up to front a new sportswear campaign.

Italian sportswear brand Ellesse has teamed up with the former TOWIE star and fitness entrepreneur to promote its forthcoming Body/Works campaign.

Showcasing her toned and tanned physique, the 22-year-old shows off her six-pack while modelling the brand's SS14 range.

New campaign: Since leaving The Only Way Is Essex, Lucy Mecklenburgh has landed herself a series of high-profile campaigns. Her latest? She's been signed up as the face of sports brand Ellesse's SS14 range

'Body/Works is all about embracing new physical and mental challenges, so the campaign willfocus on alternative and imaginative forms of exercise that stimulate and excite senses more thanconventional workouts,' say the brand.

The former reality TV star turned model recently holidayed in Dubai, where she was seen showing off her golden tan on the beach.

Perfect face (and body) of the brand: As a health advocate who runs her own fitness brand, Ellesse couldn't have chosen a more suitable model

She works out: Lucy, 22, can be seen partaking in a series of fitness drills, such as weight lifting and jogging, as she models the Italian brand's SS14 range

Lucy
 threw herself into a vigorous diet and exercise regime in the wake of 
her painful split from co-star fiance, tattooed lothario Mario Falcone, 
last April.

But the 9st, 5ft 6in star has since admitted she got 'too skinny' at one point. 

She said: 
'When I started training for the first time last January, exercise 
started out as the thing that made me happy at a time when I felt sad. 
It got me out the other end.

'I still love exercise but, back then, it was more of an addiction and, at one point, I was too thin.'

Showing off the results: She tones her athletic body for two hours each day and runs a successful fitness empire - here, Lucy showcases the fruits of her labour

She
 recently told MailOnline of her healthy approach to life: 'I think it's
 normal for people to lose weight through anxiety after a break-up. I 
would just advise women to not overdo it.

‘I feel more confident, I am aware of what I eat and I have so much more energy.'

Her 
typical daily diet now consists of eggs with smoked salmon for 
breakfast, sushi or salad for lunch and fish or meat with quinoa and 
vegetables for dinner, all washed down with lots of peppermint tea.

Feeling blue: Ellesse, a sports apparel company founded in Italy in 1959 and popular in the 90s, is having a resurgence thanks to all the 90s trends around this season

Reminding
 us that she's still mortal, Lucy has a treat day and loves a huge bowl 
of spaghetti bolognaise with lots of cheese, as well as a piece of apple
 crumble or chocolate brownie with her Sunday roast dinner.

She
 added: 'I love going for drinks with the girls, it's how I relax after a
 long day. I just opt for vodka and steer clear of sugary cocktails.

'We need to realise that we are just addicted to sugar, we don't need it. I banned it for two weeks and never craved it again.'

It's a miracle:  Wearing a conservative pin-striped swimming costume, Lucy Mecklenburgh 'walks on water' during her recent trip to Dubai
