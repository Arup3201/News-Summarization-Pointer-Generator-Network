European clubs will demand cash compensation if the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is moved to the winter.

FIFA is considering moving the tournament to avoid the fierce summer heat but European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said the cost of moving to the winter could not be borne by the clubs.

Rummenigge, who is also chairman of German champions Bayern Munich, told the Leaders in Sport conference in London: 'We are ready to discuss changing the date under one condition - that there is no damage for club football because if we change from summer to November or January it will affect our business.

For the World Cup to take place in Qatar in 2022, it may have to be moved to the winter due to the climate

'That cost cannot be paid by the clubs. We are not ready to pay it and it has to be made clear to FIFA that they need the goodwill of the clubs or we are not ready to talk or discuss it.

'The fact is 76 per cent of all players in the last two World Cups were contracted by European clubs.'

AC Milan executive director Umberto Gandini, vice-chairman of the ECA, said the Winter Olympics in 2022 should be moved to accommodate a winter World Cup.

Moving the tournament would cost clubs money, something Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says cannot happen

He said: 'The World Cup is one of the major events in the sports landscape [along] with the summer Olympics. But the Winter Olympics are not up there.

'When you have such a huge event like the World Cup don't tell me it's not possible to move the Winter Olympics a bit, especially with it still in the bid process and there are only two candidates [Beijing and Almaty].'

The International Olympic Committee said it had been reassured by FIFA president Sepp Blatter there will be no clash with the Winter Olympics.

76 per cent of players at Brazil 2014 played for European clubs, so Sepp Blatter and FIFA need their support
