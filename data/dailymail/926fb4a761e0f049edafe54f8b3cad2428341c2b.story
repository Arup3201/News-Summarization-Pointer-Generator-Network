This is the nerve-racking moment a shirtless drugged-up man leaps more than 20 feet from a bridge and miraculously gets up unscathed.

Jorge Jr. Fosado Lopez filmed the terrifying scene take place on a highway in Tijuana, Mexico, last month but the footage was only recently uploaded  by police to highlight the dangers of intoxication.

The clip shows 35-year-old Hilario Guajardo leaping from an overhead pass at night and falling flat on his back before springing back to two feet. 

He was apparently on the run from authorities and decided to plunge off the bridge in a bid to escape.

Once he's landed, Guajardo claps his hands and does a twirl in celebration that he survived the fall.

Lopez appears to be shocked as he exchanges worried words with a female passenger in Spanish.

Guajardo is seen confidently walking towards the couple down the middle of the road with his arms swinging by his side.

He seems to be in a slight daze as he twists his head to look at the surroundings.

Luckily there were no vehicles in his pathway when he performed the potentially deadly-feat.

The stunt took place on November 20. 

Police say Guajardo had taken a 'cocktail of drugs' before they arrived at the scene.

Intoxicated: Police say Guajardo had taken a 'cocktail of drugs' before they arrived at the scene

Wrong move: He was apparently on the run from officers and decided to leap off the bridge in a bid to escape

Recalling the chain of events, Lopez said: 'I saw him crash to the ground and was expecting him to stay lying on the ground but he just got up and walked off with no visible sign of injury.

'Everyone was pretty stunned but it took a while for the police to realize that unless they acted they were going to lose him.'

Officers managed to catch Guajardo and later posted the video to the Tijuana's Secretary of Public Safety Facebook page to warn about the dangers officers face daily.

'This incident highlights the sort of danger officers face on a daily basis when dealing with people who have taken a cocktail of drugs,' they wrote.

'It makes them do things that they would never normally dream of, they put their own lives and the lives of others in danger, and also in some cases seem to have almost superhuman abilities to ignore pain.'
