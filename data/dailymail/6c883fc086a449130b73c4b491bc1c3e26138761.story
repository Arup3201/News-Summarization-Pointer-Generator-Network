Strong winds and heavy rains pounded India's eastern coastline today, as hundreds of thousands of people took shelter from a powerful cyclone that was expected to reach land in a matter of hours.

Categorised as 'very severe' by weather forecasters, Cyclone Phailin is expected to hit Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states in the next few hours.

The Meteorological Department predicted winds up to 136mph.

Black skies above Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Orissa state - which is expected to bear the brunt of the cyclone - continued 60 miles out to sea this morning.

Roaring winds made palm trees sway wildly, while to the south of the state seawater was already pushing inland. 

By Friday evening, some 600,000 people had been moved to higher ground or shelters in Orissa, said Surya Narayan Patro - the state's top disaster management official.

About 12 hours before Cyclone Phailin's expected landfall, meteorologists held out hope that it might hit while in a temporary weakened state.

However, recent satellite images showed the cyclone filling nearly the entire Bay of Bengal, an area larger than France.

'A
storm this large can't peter out that fast,' said Ryan Maue, a 
meteorologist at Weather Bell, a private U.S. weather firm. 'There's 
nothing to stop it at this point' he added.

Maue said that even in the best-case 
scenario there would be a storm surge - a giant wall of water that a 
cyclone blasts ashore - of 20 to 30 feet. 

A storm surge causes a great deal of devastation in cyclones - usually even more than the strong winds.

The
storm has been powerful for nearly 36 hours and 
those winds have built up tremendous amount of surge, Maue said.

Officials canceled holy day celebrations and stockpiled emergency supplies in coastal Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states. 

The
Indian Meteorological Department warned that cyclone Phailin was 
expected to hit with maximum sustained winds of 130 to 135 miles per hour.

However, the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii forecast maximum sustained winds of 167 mph, with gusts up to 196 mph.

Indian officials also made less dire predictions about the storm surge, saying only that it would be 10 feet high.

In
Bhubaneshwar, government workers and volunteers were putting together 
hundreds of thousands of food packages to be distributed at relief 
camps.

The state's top official, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, appealed for people to cooperate with officials as they order people to leave their homes.

'I request everyone to not panic. Please assist the government. Everyone from the village to the state headquarters have been put on alert,' he told reporters.

In Paradip, the Orissa port city 
hammered in a 1999 cyclone, at least seven ships were put to sea to ride
out the storm, with other boats shifted to safer parts of the harbor, 
officials said.

U.S. forecasters repeatedly warned that the storm would be immense.

'If it's not a record it's really, really close,' University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.

'You really don't get storms stronger than this anywhere in the world ever. This is the top of the barrel'

To
compare it to killer U.S. storms, McNoldy said cyclone Phailin is 
nearly the size of Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,200 people in 2005 
and caused devastating flooding in New Orleans.

He said it also has the wind power of 1992's Hurricane Andrew, which packed 165 mph winds at landfall in Miami.

If the storm continues on its current 
path without weakening, it is expected to cause large-scale power and 
communications outages and shut down road and rail links, officials 
said. There would also be extensive damage to crops.

One
official said tens of thousands of more people will be moved to safer 
areas before the cyclone hits. 'No one will be allowed to stay in mud 
and thatched houses in the coastal areas,' he said.

The government also began evacuating 64,000 people from the low-lying areas of three vulnerable districts in neighboring Andhra Pradesh state, said state Revenue Minister N. Raghuveera Reddy.

The sea had already pushed inland as much as 130 ft in parts of Andhra Pradesh.

Officials have been stockpiling emergency food supplies, and setting up shelters for people expected to flee the heavy winds and rains. The Indian air force said four transport planes and 18 helicopters were being kept ready for relief operations in the region.

The Bay of Bengal has been the scene of some of the deadliest storms in recent history. The 1999 Orissa cyclone, which was similar in strength to Phailin, killed 10,000 people.
