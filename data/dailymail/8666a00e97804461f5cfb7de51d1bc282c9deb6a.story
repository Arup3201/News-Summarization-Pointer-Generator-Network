As any tour guide will tell you, there are few things scarier than a stampede of picture-hungry tourists with their sights set on a photo opportunity.

And as these images show, when they really want to take a photograph there's next to nothing you can do to stop them - no matter how dangerous the route may be.

Dozens of Chinese tourists were plunged into a lake when this newly-built footbridge buckled under their weight as they swarmed across to get a better view of Lushan Mountain in Jiujiang city, eastern China.

Dunked: This was the scene when dozens of photo-hungry tourists ignored guides' warnings and piled onto this bridge to get a better view of Lushan Mountain in Jiujiang city, China

Unexpected: Tourists saw more than they were expecting when they visited a newly opened marina offering boat trips on a lake when the bridge to the boats collapsed

Cold surprise: Fellow tourists watched as they fell into the icy water one by one, leaving as many as 18 people with minor injuries in east China's Jiangxi province

The bridge collapsed when the herd of sightseers piled onto the bridge despite signs stating its maximum weight threshold.

A spokesman for the builders denied the bridge was clear, saying: 'It was designed for 40 people, not 200.

'They should have not allowed so many on at the same time.'

Creaking: Moments earlier the tourists came onto the bridge which heaved and creaked under their weight

Not so swimmingly: This was the scene seconds later

Help! People were seen struggling to stay afloat and scrambling over each other as the water flooded onto the bridge

Help! Most of the tourists floundered in the water for about five minutes before they were rescued

Life rings: Eye witnesses threw dozens of life rings into the water to keep them afloat

They fell into the icy water one by one, leaving as many as 18 people with minor injuries in east China's Jiangxi province.

People were seen struggling to stay 
afloat and scrambling over each other as the water flooded onto the 
bridge, and eye witnesses then threw dozens of life rings to keep them 
afloat.

The incident 
occurred when too many tourists crowded onto the bridge, ignoring 
instructions from management staff, a publicity department official with
 the West Sea Tourism Zone Management Committee said.

Under inspection: The bridge had been in trial use since September 26 as it had not yet passed final inspections, according to a report

The wharf opened in September for the 
pleasure boats with parking for buses was built because Xihai is famous 
for its mountains and clear waters.

The bridge had been in trial use since September 26 as it had not yet passed final inspections, according to a report.

Most of the tourists were rescued after around five minutes of floundering in the water.

They suffered slight bruises and had been sent to a hospital, the publicity department official said.
