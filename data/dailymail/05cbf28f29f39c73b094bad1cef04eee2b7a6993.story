Tragedy: Victoria Harrison, 17, bled to death after an artery was torn during a routine operation, an inquest heard

A teenage hairdresser bled to death over 15 hours after a surgeon tore an artery during a routine operation, an inquest heard today.

Victoria Harrison died in her bed at Kettering General Hospital, whose staff failed her in 43 different ways.

The 17-year-old was so scared for her life she even texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend in the hours before she died.

She was admitted to hospital for routine key-hole surgery on August 15 last year after suffering abdominal pains.

But during the 30-minute operation to remove her appendix, she suffered internal bleeding when surgeons tore a hole in an artery while inserting a micro-camera into her stomach.

Staff managed to repair the hole but she lost almost half a pint of blood and she was sent to recover on a ward, but died the next day.

An inquest at the Best Western Hotel in Corby, Northamptonshire, heard nurses failed to read her medical notes which indicated she had suffered a large bleed during surgery.

She was not properly checked and nurses failed to take her blood pressure which would have indicated her blood loss.

Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16.

Her death also sparked a huge investigation by hospital into her care.

A report by Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found staff made 43 errors while caring for Miss Harrison.

The inquest heard her surgeon Shady Hosny said one of the abdominal wall arteries started bleeding during the operation.

Within 30 minutes the bleeding had stopped but it was unclear from medical notes how much blood she had lost exactly but Mr Hosny confirmed it was more than normal during such an operation.

Life lost: Victoria was admitted to hospital for the simple operation on August 15 this year, but within 15 hours she had died

In a statement read to the inquest he said: 'During the procedure, I noted that there was minimal blood yet as it was a small amount, I was not concerned at this stage and continued to perform the appendicectomy.'

Mr Hosny was later exonerated of blame following a hospital investigation.

When the two hour operation was completed at 4pm Victoria was then transferred to a recovery ward.

Gillian Joy, the recovery nurse looking after Victoria told the inquest she had not been told the patient had bled during the surgery and did not read the operation notes.

She said: 'I would expect the scrub nurse to tell me about any excessive bleed. I would have then informed the ward nurse.

'Initially Victoria told me she had a slight pain but she was more concerned about feeling nauseous.

'Later she stated she was pain free and was just anxious to see her boyfriend.'

Victoria was then discharged to a main ward at 5.20pm.

Julie Walsh, a staff nurse at the hospital, was then in charge of Victoria's care.

She gave her painkillers at 6.15pm at which point she was being comforted by fiancé Ashley Warner.

Hours after he left he was alarmed when Victoria, who he called 'Tor', texted him a picture of her bleeding.

Let down: 'Tor', as she was known to her family, texted her fiancé with a picture of a blood-soaked T-shirt because she was scared

In a statement he said: 'We spoke for about an hour, Tor said she felt fine.

'She was looking forward to coming home the next day and telling me how everyone had to look after her and she wanted a bit of pampering.

Family: Victoria's step-father Stan Foskett and her mother Tracy Foskett and her father Andrew Harrison demanded a probe into her death

'I left at the end of visiting, she still seemed fine, very relaxed and she was texting friends on her mobile phone.

'That was the last time I saw her.

'We were texting each other most of the evening, I've no idea what time it was that I got the first message from Tor saying that she was in pain, but the doctor had been and given her some pain relief.

'A bit later I then got a message saying that she was bleeding from one of the holes from the operation and she sent me a picture.

'She was wearing grey jogging bottoms, I can't remember what coloured top she was wearing, but I could clearly see a large amount of blood on her abdomen.

'There was blood on her T-shirt and I could see the blood coming from one of the holes and I could see where the blood had trickled down her front.

'The next text I got from Tor said "nurse is here she's sorting it now".'

When Mrs Walsh finished her shift care assistant Debbie Sumpter took over at 5.30am on August 16.

She said in a statement read at the inquest: 'I started the rounds at 5.30am and as I was helping another patient I looked over to Victoria and could tell something wasn't right.

'She looked pale and stiff. I went over and shook her and shouted her name but there was no response.'

An arrest team then tried to resuscitate Victoria for nearly 40 minutes and she was given two units of emergency blood but she was pronounced dead at 7am.

Staff nurse Marites Salvador broke down in tears giving her evidence when she admitted not carrying out 'a proper observation' when Victoria was asleep.

She told the inquest: 'I just can't get it out of my mind.

'I saw Victoria lying there and I pulled the emergency cord.

'I didn't do a proper observation as she was asleep and I didn't want to disturb her.

'I'm just so sorry. When I saw her she was reading her book.'

The inquest heard Kettering General Hospital carried out an investigation after Victoria's death.

Head of nursing practising development Jacqueline Davis said an investigation found 43 different care delivery issues in Victoria's case.

The inquest is expected to finish tomorrow.
