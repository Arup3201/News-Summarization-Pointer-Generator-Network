Australian paramedics are being flown to the UK to fill staff shortages despite the fact the industry is crying out for more ambulance workers locally.

The London Ambulance Service has 175 Australians starting work this month in an attempt to fill staffing gaps.

But unions in Australia say the industry needs more funding to create more jobs so Australian paramedics are not seeing overseas as a more attractive option.

The issue of staffing shortages for Australian ambulances was highly publicised last year when there was a significant delay in paramedics reaching cricketer Phil Hughes, who later died from severe head injuries.

Australian Paramedics Association secretary Gary Wilson said in NSW ambulances don't have enough resources to cover the work they need to undertake.

'Unfortunately delays in ambulance response are becoming more common and it comes down to a system-wide lack of resources,' he said.

'The ministry won't approve staff increases. Losing 175 paramedics to fill a shortfall overseas doesn't make our situation worse it just doesn't help us.

'What happens here is we need hundreds more paramedics but we don't have approval or funding for those positions.'

The Australian paramedics - many of them recent graduates - will work 37.5 hours a week and be paid a salary of between £30,295 ($A57,753) and £39,061 ($A74,396) - 25 and 60 per cent more than they earn in Australia.

They also received relocation costs and a three-week training course on working in London, including dealing with incidents on the Underground.

Danny Hill, assistant secretary of the Victorian chapter of Ambulance Employees Australia, said local graduates were paid a base rate of about $46,000 and work minimum 48-hour weeks.

'Paramedics in Australia are very highly trained and are probably looking at other countries where they can practice their skills internationally, and of course they'll look at the wage rates,' Mr Hill said.

'But whether they're going to England or the U.S. or leaving the industry altogether the key issue is what's making paramedics leave Australia, and that's got to be dealt with in every state.

'A lot of them are only lasting in the job five years and that's because of burn out - a lot of the time they become so fatigued and are under enormous stress.'

London Ambulance Service bosses travelled to Australia and New Zealand last year, employing three quarters of the 200 graduates they interviewed. They will return there in March for another 280 interviews.

Six of England's ten ambulance trusts have recruited or plan to recruit from countries including Australia, Poland and Ireland, according to figures gathered by the Health Service Journal.

In total, 183 paramedics have been brought in from overseas since April, compared with just one in the previous financial year.

Mitchell Hand, from Sydney, said the fact London was the busiest ambulance service in the world, receiving up to 5,000 calls a day, was what attracted him.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'That's what you look for as a graduate. You want to use your skills you've spent three years at university learning. It's the unknown that attracts you here.'

Another new recruit from Sydney, Simone, told the programme: 'I don't have plans to go back home because the career advancement is too good.'

An LAS spokesman said it targeted Australians because 'their skills and training closely match those in the UK'.

Staff shortages have been blamed on a lack of training places and paramedics being 'actively recruited' to the NHS 111 service or as disability benefits assessors.

Sarah O'Donoghue, of the union Unison, said pressure on existing staff was driving more to leave their jobs. Yesterday the Department of Health was in talks to avert a 12-hour strike by ambulance staff on Thursday.
