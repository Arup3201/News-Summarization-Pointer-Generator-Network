A renowned TV pitchman who allegedly defrauded at least 220,000 people of nearly $52million is believed to have committed suicide in jail.

Don Lapre, 47, of Phoenix, Arizona, was charged with running a nationwide scheme to sell essentially worthless Internet-based businesses.

The father-of-two was found dead in his prison cell in Florence, Arizona, on Sunday - just two days before his trial was due to begin on Tuesday.

Dead: Don Lapre, 47, of Phoenix, Arizona, was charged with running a nationwide scheme to sell essentially worthless Internet-based businesses

The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed he
 died in an apparent suicide while in federal custody but the death 
remains under investigation.

However there was a 'large amount of blood' in the cell where he was found and so it appears he cut himself, law enforcement sources told TMZ.

A grand jury had indicted him in June on 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and promotional money laundering.

When Lapre failed to arrive for his 
arraignment that month a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was discovered less than 24 hours later.

Authorities found him in a gym with a cut in his groin and they believed at the time he had attempted suicide by trying to slice his femoral artery.

He was accused of overseeing and promoting a misleading opportunity through his company called ‘The Greatest Vitamin in the World’.

Lapre allegedly made millions of dollars from his television ads selling the schemes

The charges carried potential fines of
 between $250,000 and $500,000 per count and federal prison terms of 
between five and 25 years.

The company said it would support the hundreds of thousands of people it recruited to start up online businesses selling vitamins.

But investors were allegedly misled as the company tried to get them to purchase additional advertising and other services.

Lapre was known for his emphatic 
salesman style but the company was shut down in 2007 after customers 
filed hundreds of complaints.

Meanwhile he was personally paid more than $2.2million from the business between 2004 and 2007, the indictment said.

Jokes: David Spade's impression of Don Lapre on Saturday Night Live

Lapre was known for his television appearances on shows such as 'Making Money From A Tiny One Bedroom Apartment'.

'It did not work out for me with my vitamins but I believe that being willing to fail is part of having a chance at success'

Don Lapre

The pitchman, who referred to himself 
on his website as 'The King of Infomercials', would recount his 
hard-luck life story to viewers.

He encouraged them to turn their lives
 around like he had and is notorious for claiming he made $50,000 a week
 from his one bedroom apartment.

It was widely parodied - notably by David Spade on Saturday Night Live.

'It did not work out for me with my vitamins but I believe that being willing to fail is part of having a chance at success,' Don Lapre wrote on his website.
