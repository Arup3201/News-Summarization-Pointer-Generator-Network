Steffon Armitage’s chances of making the England World Cup squad look slimmer than ever after the flanker was given a court date following an alleged assault at a beachfront restaurant in Toulon.

The European Player of the Year spent Wednesday night in custody and was released on bail on Thursday morning on condition that he returns for a hearing on February 10.

According to reports in France, Armitage was ordered to pay £3,750 in bail fees and eye-witnesses claimed that his actions left a local man with a facial injury that has kept him out of work since December 13, when the incident took place after Toulon’s Champions Cup victory over Leicester Tigers.

Toulon have threatened to impose internal sanctions on the 29-year-old, having confirmed that he was taken into custody along with team-mate Xavier Chiocci, who was freed without charge.

The club said in a statement: ‘Xavier Chiocci’s custody ended on Wednesday night and no charges were brought against him. Steffon Armitage’s custody lasted through the night. If need be, RC Toulon will impose the necessary sanctions to preserve their core values.’

Even if Armitage is found not guilty, the negative publicity surrounding the hearing is likely to severely damage any hopes of an international call-up. Although the RFU have a policy of not picking overseas players, there have been popular calls to select the forward under the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause.

The former London Irish star is a versatile option in the back row and was seen as the ideal candidate to help ease England’s injury problems, which were  worsened on Thursday by the news that tight-head prop David Wilson is suffering from a nerve problem in his neck.

Wilson, who has started England’s last 10 Tests, will sit out training on Friday and Newcastle Falcons youngster Kieran Brookes has been called in to provide cover.

England’s injury list is already alarmingly long - it includes Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes, Ed Slater and Joe Launchbury - and head coach Stuart Lancaster hopes Wilson will recover in time for the opening RBS 6 Nations Test against Wales next Friday.

‘We have brought Kieran in as cover at tighthead as a precaution because Davy has a small nerve impingement which should settle down,’ said Lancaster.

Leicester second row Geoff Parling has also been ruled out of next week’s fixture at the Millennium Stadium. The 31-year-old has been sidelined with a knee injury but Exeter Chiefs coach Rob Baxter, who on Thursday announced that he has signed the lock for next season, said he has no concerns over the veteran’s fitness.

‘As with most players, we’ve done a full medical and we don’t have any concerns about his physical state,’ said Baxter. ‘He’s just like a lot of guys who get to just over 30 and have played a fair bit of rugby - there’s a few miles on the clock but physically he’s in very good condition really.

‘Geoff is a proven international performer. He adds great experience in running things like the line-out, he has good leadership experience as well and all those things add up to it being a very good signing for us.’
