Passengers aboard the United Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing on one of the most remote islands in the world after an 'electrical odor' was detected in the cabin say there were problems with the aircraft before takeoff.

The pilot also made an announcement that 'there was smoke in the cockpit and the radar failed', it has been claimed.

Flight UA201 - a Boeing 777 carrying 335 passengers and 12 crews from Honolulu to Guam - was forced to set down on Midway Island, a tiny 2.4-square-mile atoll in the Pacific, on Friday.

A 'mechanical error' has been blamed for the diversion, which occurred about three hours into the flight, United spokeswoman Mary Clark told The MailOnline, however the aircraft was delayed on the tarmac before leaving Hawaii on Thursday, as airport maintenance crews reportedly worked to fix an undisclosed issue.

Passengers were told of an unidentified odor in the cockpit before the flight and some even got off, according to at least two on board.

United Airlines says the reason for the diversion was a 'mechanical error' and that an 'electrical odor' was detected in the cabin three hours into the flight

Passengers say they were told of the odor before the plane took off and that investigations delayed them on the tarmac extensively

According to Karen Von-Merveldt Guevara of Sedona, Arizona, the pilot spoke of smoke and failure to the radar and other systems during the complications.

At one point the plane is also believed to have dipped dramatically.

'The captain said there was smoke in the cockpit and the radar failed and other electronic systems were failing, so they had to land,' she told CNN.

'At one point there was one drop of about 40 feet. 

'After that turbulence, it got really silent. I thought everybody was praying, and we were coming in on the wings of faith. We were all praying.'

Von-Merveldt said she, like many people, were asleep when the problems started to obviously become serious, and she awoke to hear a flight attendant having a nervous conversation with another passenger.

'When more people woke up, they made an announcement,' Von-Merveldt.

'I could understand they didn't want mutiny. First we thought it was of a storm hitting Guam. 

'Then the smell got worse in the cabin, and I started to gag because of the smell of chemicals. The attendants were busy. 

'In between they would communicate saying they were busy in the cockpit trying to figure things out.'

Von-Merveldt said she now believes the plane should never have left Honolulu, because they was clearly uncertainty.

'They told us they had a problem with a smell on the cockpit.

Passenger Teresita Smith, who was also 
traveling with several family members on the flight, told reporters a 
burning smell filled the aircraft.

The passengers were so terrified many were loudly praying.

'It 
was terribly frightening.  There was no doubt, 100 per cent emotion, of 
the feeling that the plane was going to go down,' she told KITV.

Diversion: The flight was heading from Honolulu to Guam when it was diverted to the remote island of Midway

Midway Island - an atoll 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu - was used by the Navy as a base during the Cold War but abandoned in 1996.

It's now a national wildlife refuge, home to more than one million seabirds, green sea turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals.

The island's residents manage the airstrip and wildlife refuge.

They opened an old gymnasium for the passengers of UA201.

Inside, passengers sat on folding chairs and rested on the floor.

As it was the middle of the night - or early Friday morning local time - shops were opened and the passengers were given food.

After a few hours of waiting, a new 
flight, UA2105, flew the passengers to Guam, where they landed Saturday 
about 6pm local time, Clark said.

'We’re
 currently reviewing the mechanical issue and circumstances surrounding 
the diversion of flight 201 and will not be able to provide additional 
details until our review is complete,' Clark said.
