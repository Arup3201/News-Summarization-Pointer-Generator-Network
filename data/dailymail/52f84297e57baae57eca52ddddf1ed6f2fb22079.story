The Football Association has asked Chesterfield to launch a full investigation into the alleged racist abuse aimed towards their players at Port Vale on Saturday.

The Sky Bet League One fixture was marred by a confrontation between Spireites defender Daniel Jones, a former Vale player, and home supporters as the players left the pitch at the end of Chesterfield's 2-1 victory.

It is then that it has been alleged that Chesterfield's black players were the subject of racist taunts from a small section of Vale fans.

Spireites chief executive Chris Turner said in a statement on his club's website: 'Any form of racism cannot be tolerated. 

'We have been asked by The FA to launch a full investigation, which will involve speaking to our players.

'I spoke to Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite after the match and he said they would hold their own investigation.

'We will make no further comment on the matter while the investigation is taking place.'

Vale were forced to conduct an investigation at the beginning of last season when it was alleged racist chanting took place during the home game against Bradford.

Following that incident, anti-racism campaigner Garth Crooks, the former Stoke striker, called for the Railway Paddock part of Vale Park to be closed down if problems continued.
