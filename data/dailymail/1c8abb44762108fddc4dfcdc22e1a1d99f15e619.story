Most of us have a favourite piece stashed away in our wardrobes and Cressida Bonas is clearly no exception after she stepped out in her white Frame Denim dungarees for the second time in a week.

This time around, the all-in-ones got an outing at the park, where Prince Harry's former flame giggled madly as she was swung around by a friend.

Later, Miss Bonas was seen relaxing in a cafe with another friend as she took a break during rehearsals for her play, There's A Monster In The Lake.

Favourite: Cressida first wore the dungarees on Monday (left) and reappeared in them today (right)

The play, her first since splitting from the fourth in line to the throne, made its debut during the Hay festival and is now showing at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in north London.

Despite her hectic schedule, which has seen her take to the stage three times in the last 24 hours, Miss Bonas looked sprightly and fresh-faced as she enjoyed the sunshine.

The 25-year-old also managed to pull off a fresh-faced look last night as she left the theatre in the following a late performance wearing a cool and casual all-black sporty outfit.

Accentuating
 her toned stomach, the actress wore a high-necked black crop top, which she 
teamed with black joggers and her trademark scruffy white pumps.

And so to bed... Cressida Bonas leaves the Rosemary Branch theatre in London after appearing in There's A Monster In The Lake, the first professional acting role for the socialite

Still looking fresh: Unlike Tuesday night, when Cressida stayed late in the pub after her performance, last night saw her head straight home for a sensible and probably much needed early night

Dancer's body: Cressida is well known for her dance talent and showed off her athletic body in a black sleeveless crop top

Unlike
 Tuesday night, when Cressida stayed late in the pub after her 
performance, last night saw her head straight home for a much-needed 
rest. 

Prince 
Harry's ex-girlfriend has been performing in the devilish tale at the 
award-winning theatre, which is situated above a pub in Islington.

Her

 mother, Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, turned out for a second night to support
 her daughter in her newfound acting career on Tuesday evening, but it seems that she took a night off on Wednesday.

On Monday 
night sisters Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe-Branson and Pandora 
Cooper-Key were in the audience, along with close friends Guy Pelly and 
Richard Dinan.

Back to the theatre: Cressida Bonas looked casual and cool as she made her way to a matinee performance of There's A Monster In The Lake at The Rosemary Theatre, North London, yesterday

In they go: Cressida, 25, made her way to the North London theatre with a male pal, possibly a fellow thespian

Born performer: Cressida studied dance at Leeds University and acted in a production of Othello there that was so highly acclaimed it was taken on to Edinburgh Festival

Bodycon: Cressida, who is a trained dancer, showed off her athletic physique in the figure-hugging grey dress

Stylish: Cressida made her debut performance on Monday night and showed no signs of fatigue as she left the theatre after her second performance on Tuesday

The
 play, which was directed by Lily Ashley, and written by Tallulah Brown,
 follows the tale of an elderly man who, tired of his life in a nursing 
home, enters a fantasy world where he ends up marrying the Queen of the 
Woods.

Cressida 
plays the wolf that guards the way between the two worlds and by all 
accounts showcases her comedy skills in the role. 

And this foray onto the stage is just the first step of what looks to be a promising acting career for the blonde.

Cressida
 has recently signed up to do a movie with Dame Judi Dench and Cara 
Delevingne called Tulip Fever. According to Cara's Instagram account the model 
has been working 15-hour days on the film.

Cressida
 studied dance at Leeds University and acted in a production of Othello 
there which was so highly acclaimed it was taken on to Edinburgh 
Festival.

She also regularly goes to the theatre in London. Two
 weeks ago she attended a performance of The Colby Sisters Of 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at The Tricycle Theatre in London, in which her
 sister Isabella was performing.

Family support: Cressida made her way home from 
the pub after a night's work on Tuesday, which saw her mother, Lady Mary-Gaye 
Curzon, right, turn out for a second night to support her daughter in 
her acting career
