Detectives decided to sell watches, gold chains and necklaces seized during their investigations into one legged former cagefighter Vincent Graham

Police have set up an eBay account to sell the beloved jewellery of a convicted drug baron for up to £3,200 an item.

Detectives decided to sell watches, gold chains and necklaces seized during their investigations into one legged former cagefighter Vincent Graham.

A luxury £100,000 sports car seized in Salford is also set to be up for grabs soon.

The extravagant items, which were bought by Graham from his proceeds of crime, are now being snapped up with the money raised to be spent catching other gangsters.

The initiative - from Titan, 
the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit - is the first time a police 
unit has raised funds in this way.

Father of ten Graham, 35, who was nicknamed 'Big Vin', lived a lavish lifestyle after becoming the head of an organisation which dealt cocaine smuggled into the UK from South Africa.

He posed semi-naked on online dating sites and dated a string of women , seduced by his lavish five-bedroom home and string of supercars.

But his empire collapsed after Graham was arrested and questioned over a kidnap plot in the Netherlands.

Dutch police freed him without charge but then contacted police in the UK urging them to carry out a series of raids on properties connected to Graham amid suspicions they were being used to deal Class A drugs.

Officers discovered 25 kilos of benzocaine - a chemical used to dilute cocaine - in a house in Liverpool which if used would have produced enough cocaine to sell for more than £1m.

It emerged Graham paid £1,500 in cash a month to rent a five bedroomed luxury house worth £500,000 in Lancashire in an exclusive development opposite Blackburn Rovers’ training ground.

He had a fleet of nine cars including a Lamborghini Gallardo, worth more than £40,000, a Nissan Skyline, worth £35,000, and an Audi Q7 worth more than £20,000.

Searches at various premises owned or rented by Graham recovered £5,000 in cash. Motorbikes, jet skis, quad bikes, off-road motorbikes, electrical goods, jewellery and artwork together worth over £150,000 were found in his garage.

Examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling over £35,000 and no evidence of the payment of household bills from his bank accounts. Also seized was a £50,000 Jacobs watch and a £32,000 diamond necklace.

During a police surveillance operation officers watched as Graham would check his Nissan GT-R’s wheel arches with surgical gloves.

In July 2011, Graham, described by police as a 'significant player' in the supply of drugs in the North West of England, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was jailed for seven years.

He was later ordered to pay back 700,000 under a Proceeds of Crime hearing and was warned he faced a further four and a half years jail if he didn’t pay up.

Police said Graham’s haul of jewellery was the first to be put up for sale on Ebay with luxury items seized from others including a £100,000 supercar to be posted on the site later.

Each of Graham’s gems has a full description and was independently validated as genuine by an experienced jeweller.

A 14 carat white gold diamond set bracelet up on offer for £3,200 is described as: 'Condition Fair, two diamonds missing, mark and scuffs to gold.'

A nine carat white gold stone set line necklace on offer for 1,000 is described as being: 'Condition Poor, broken with bad and ineffective repair.

A white gold diamond set ring on offer for £350 is described: 'Condition Fair, slightly misshapen scratched and scuffed and rhodium plating worn.'

Det Supt Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan which cracks down on organised crime said more 'bling and buy' auctions would follow soon.

He said: 'This is just the start of us selling the ill-gotten gains of convicted major criminals and re-investing the proceeds back into tackling others like them.

'Expensive jewellery, luxury furniture, fast cars - these trappings of wealth are things that most ordinary people can only dream of yet serious organised criminals have been enjoying them while blighting communities with their drugs and violence.

The initiative - from Titan, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit - is the first time a police unit has raised funds in this way

'Law enforcement agencies are using the Proceeds of Crime Act and court confiscation orders to their full potential and hit criminals in the pockets as well as with prison. By using ebay we hope to sell criminals’ assets at the highest price we can.

'Titan tackles some of the most serious organised crime groups operating in the region and we are expecting to be able to auction off lots of other high-value things in the coming months, which can only be good news for our communities.'

Half of the money from the auction will be split between Titan and the region’s police forces, the Crown Prosecution Service and Her Majesty’s Courts Service. The other half will be returned to central government.

The court heard former garage boss Graham, who gave up his cagefighting career after he lost his right leg in a motorbike accident in his 20s, never touched the drugs during transactions

Undercover officers tracked Graham for about six months after the tip off from their Dutch colleagues. It emerged he was a cage fighter with the Myspace name of 'Big Vin 1977'” and had been linked to a number of organised crime groups in the UK.

The court heard former garage boss Graham, who gave up his cagefighting career after he lost his right leg in a motorbike accident in his 20s, never touched the drugs during transactions.

But he was arrested after police filmed two accomplices engaging in a drug deal in Southport with a third man from Nigerian.

The Titan unit was set up in 2009 as a collaboration between the six police forces to tackle serious and organised crime.

More than 200 high-profile criminals have been arrested and jailed for more than 700 years. Drugs, property, cash and firearms worth millions have also been seized.
