Prime Minister David Cameron meets former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood

Controversial Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood is moving its headquarters from London to Austria in an apparent attempt to avoid an inquiry into its activities set up by the Prime Minister.

The alleged terrorist outfit was expelled from Egypt following last year’s coup there.

It recently opened a new international office above a disused kebab shop in Cricklewood, northwest London.

But this weekend, sources said it had decided to transfer its base to Graz, Austria’s second city, after David Cameron announced a joint MI5 and MI6 investigation into its membership.

The group is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Last month, Mr Cameron said that it was important to establish what the group’s beliefs were in terms of ‘extremism and violent extremism’.
