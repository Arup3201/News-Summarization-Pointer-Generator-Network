A group of lawmakers has taken time out from Capitol Hill's budget showdown to propose an amendment to the Obamacare law that would exempt volunteer firefighters and paramedics from a loophole that threatens to close stations.

The Affordable Care Act was enacted without an exemption for volunteer first-responders, potentially forcing fire departments to buy coverage for hundreds of thousands of volunteers even though they're not on any payroll.

The result could have put most of America's 1 million fire departments in a position of diverting equipment and training funds to pay for insurance policies or federal government fines. Thousands of them could face closure because of the added costs.

New
York Republican Rep. Chris Collins wrote to IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel last week, calling the result 'a public safety disaster.'

MailOnline highlighted the issue on Monday, bringing swift action from a Pennsylvania congressman and a bipartisan group of six U.S. senators.

Help is on the way! Lawmakers have rushed to respond to national outcry by writing an Obamacare amendment just for volunteer first-responders

Not just firefighters: Many paramedics and other emergency medical personnel volunteer their services to their communities in addition to holding down full-time jobs

Rep. Lou Barletta (C), a Pennsylvania Republican, has forced Obamacare'€™s impact on volunteer firefighters onto Congress'€™ front-burner. His state leads the nation in the percentage of fire departments that are staffed by volunteers

Their 'Protect Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act' would amend the Affordable Care Act to provide volunteer emergency service workers a carve-out ensuring that they're not counted toward employee totals that would trigger the law's employer mandate.

Eighty-seven per cent of U.S. fire departments are entirely or 'mostly' staffed by volunteers, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

''’m sure that this is an unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act, but it is a very real threat to public safety.,' Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta told MailOnline.

Barletta has spearheaded the effort, which attracted the attention of senators from both sides of the political aisle.

'If fire companies have to provide health insurance to their volunteers, it would be an unbearable cost and many would have to reduce the number of volunteers, or close their doors entirely,' he said.

'Either way, this is a serious public safety problem. Of course, the IRS could solve it tomorrow by saying that volunteer fire fighters are not employees.'

The Obama administration has offered a
host of Obamacare exemptions to politically favored companies and labor
unions. But Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, insisted that 
leaving volunteer firefighters on the sidelines was an 'unintentional 
consequence' and 'a technical error.'

Firefighters battled a blaze in the aftermath of a Nov. 18 tornado in Washington, Illinois. The vast majority of U.S. firefighters are community volunteers

As written, Manchin conceded, the Affordable Care Act 'jeopardizes
funding for training and emergency response hours by imposing 
unreasonable burdens on many of our volunteer emergency response 
agencies.'

Angus King, 
an independent senator from Maine, said in a statement that the bill 
'will draw an important distinction between those volunteers and 
full-time, paid staff that will ensure emergency response units can 
continue to deliver robust services without the fear of having to deal 
with cumbersome federal regulations.'

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republcian, called it 'unacceptable that an undue burden could be placed on volunteer fire departments across the country.

Only Congress can prevent forest fires? Volunteers are often the first line of defense against wildfires in America's forests, and Obamacare threatened to put many of their fire departments in jeopardy of closing

'It is imperative that this ambiguity in the law be clarified and fixed,' she said Wednesday.

Alaska Democratic Sen. Mark Begich 
added that 'first responders and firefighters who put their safety on 
the line to keep our families and communities safe ... need the 
certainty that they have the necessary resources to keep offering their 
services.'

It's unclear how
many fire departments would have been negatively affected by the 
Affordable Care Act in its current form, since the employer coverage 
mandate applies only to agencies that employe at least 50 people.

Annual fines for fire departments that choose to flout the law would amount to $2,000 per employee, beginning after the first 30.

This International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council and the Congressional Fire Services Institute all offered endorsements of the legislation on Wednesday.

'This is a bipartisan issue which could have serious impacts on staffing at fire departments across the United States,' said International Association of Fire Chiefs president William Metcalf.

'The IAFC looks forward to working with Congress and the Administration to help ensure fire departments of all types are able to continue saving lives and serving their communities.'

Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey are also co-sponsors of the Senate legislation.

'I would rather tear down the whole thing and start over again with a fresh health care approach, but the president has made it clear that he won't allow that to happen. So, we're left to try to pave over the potholes, and this is a big one – possibly affecting fire stations nationwide.'

Pennsylvania has the highest percentage of fire departments that are entirely or mostly volunteer-based, with 97 per cent.
