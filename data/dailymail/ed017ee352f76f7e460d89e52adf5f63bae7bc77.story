Rich Chinese wives are infuriating communist party officials by taking part in a growing craze - hen parties heading to Taiwan to buy sex with younger men.

Media in Taiwan have highlighted the sex
 parties of the middle-aged women, which include spouses of businessmen, 
politicians and local party officials.

'They are afraid that if they hire 
male prostitutes in China proper they will be discovered, so they cross 
the strait to go to Taiwan to buy sex,' said a vice squad officer.

'The
 rich women are usually middle-aged or older. They go to Taiwan in 
groups for one purpose - to have sex with younger men who they pay for 
the service.'
