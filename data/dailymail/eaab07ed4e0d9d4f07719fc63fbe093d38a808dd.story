This dramatic photo shows the horrific burns left on the face of a teenager injured when he threw aerosol cans on a bonfire with his friends.

Jordan Lewis, 15, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was the most seriously injured of five teenagers who had to flee for help after a fire in a wheelie bin exploded in their faces.

He may require a skin graft after suffering third degree burns to his whole face. All five were taken to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital burns unit where four of them remained overnight.

Now their parents have united in a plea for other youngsters not to repeat their mistake.

Jordan’s mother Mandy, 40, said: ‘It was awful when he came home, he was just screaming and screaming and his whole face looked like it was covered in blood. He should have known better.

'But unfortunately it’s something a lot of lads his age do. I’d say to anyone who is tempted to do it in the future to have a look at Jordan’s injuries and see how dangerous it can be.’

His friend Francis Kavanagh, 14, was discharged from hospital after his damaged chin was patched up by medics.

He said: ‘We’d started a fire in the 
back field and a few people were throwing things on it and the next 
thing I knew, just as I turned around, it went “bang”.

‘I
think I was in shock so I didn’t really feel anything at first but I 
put my hand to my face and could see there was loads of blood.

‘I saw Jordan was crying and then saw how bad his face looked and everyone just started running to call an ambulance. I’ll never do anything like that again.’

Francis’s mother Joan, 56, said: ‘He knows he shouldn’t have been doing it but lads won’t be told sometimes.

‘It’s not a game and kids can end up getting seriously hurt. I hope this sends a message to people.’

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service assistant chief fire officer Peter O’Reilly said: ‘I’m a parent of two daughters and understand it’s a challenge knowing what your children are up to.

‘We know that children are children and that’s why we have our education programmes.

‘These are not bad children and, when we see something like this, they usually tell us afterwards they just made a mistake and they knew the dangers beforehand but didn’t think it would happen to them.’
