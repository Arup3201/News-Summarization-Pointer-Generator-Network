Unconvinced: Christopher Pincher said Mr Miliband’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run

Tory MPs have challenged David Cameron to bring down energy bills by cutting green taxes.

Helping smaller firms to compete with the dominant Big Six would also lower prices, they added.

This week Ed Miliband pledged to freeze energy bills for two years if Labour wins the next election.

The proposal has been savaged by power firms, which saw another £800million wiped from their values yesterday.

Christopher Pincher, a Conservative member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee, said Mr Miliband’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run.

Controlling bills without controlling wholesale and distribution costs would leave energy firms vulnerable to price spikes for gas and oil, he warned. This could result in them requiring bail-outs.

‘This is what happened in the 1970s,’ he said. ‘British Leyland and British Steel, nationalised industries, made a loss and the Government had to cover it – so the consumer still picks up the tab.’

His committee colleague Peter Lilley, a former Tory cabinet minister, said ministers were ‘aggravating’ the burden of soaring bills with levies to promote the use of renewable energy.

Green taxes currently account for about 10 per cent of the average electricity bill. Under government projections this will rise to 33 per cent by 2020.

Not impressed: Peter Lilley (left) said ministers were ‘aggravating’ the burden of soaring bills. Andrew Tyrie (right) said such green levies 'put Britain on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly'

‘The only thing that the government directly controls in terms of energy bills are the additional costs imposed through unjustifiable green energy taxes,’ Mr Lilley said. 

‘Governments are responsible for all those costs, and yet they pretend price rises are because energy firms are raising profits.

'We need to abandon these attempts to replace carbon with sources of energy which are twice as expensive, and we need to do more to encourage competition.’ 

Price freeze: Ed Miliband introduced the policy in his flagship speech to the Labour Party conference earlier this week

Andrew Tyrie, Tory chairman of the Treasury select committee, said such green levies - introduced as a result of the Climate Change Act, passed when Mr Miliband was Energy Secretary in 2008 - ‘put Britain on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly.’

He said the legislation, passed with overwhelming cross-party support, was ‘a profound mistake’.

Meanwhile, former Tory leadership candidate David Davis and Dominic Raab both called for the Government to invest in a new generation of nuclear power stations.

This would increase electricity bills but lead to more homegrown energy, securing Britain’s power supplies.

Mr Raab admitted that green subsidies ‘inflate bills’, but said encouraging competition with initiatives such as group-switching - when large numbers of customers band together to change suppliers - would ‘bring bills down, reduce carbon emissions and strengthen consumer clout against the energy giants’.

Energy firms are currently trying to raise private sector funding for £110billion of new infrastructure and nuclear power stations, which they say could be jeopardised by Mr Miliband’s price freeze.

When asked about the Labour leader’s speech, Tony Blair said only that it was ‘excellently delivered’, pointedly refusing to comment on its content.

Britain's biggest power companies saw a further £800million wiped from their value yesterday in a second day of turmoil.

Shares
in British Gas owner Centrica and SSE were punished again in a 
relentless investor backlash over Ed Miliband’s election vow to freeze 
power prices.

The 
two companies, which between them supply 21million homes across Britain,
have now seen a staggering £2.8billion stripped from their value in the
past 48 hours. In the day following the Labour leader’s pledge, which 
the industry says will increase the likelihood of power cuts, the stock 
market values of both groups plunged by £2billion. More than a million 
small shareholders will have seen their holdings hammered by the fall.

‘Unfortunately
we see this saga dragging on, with impracticality of the proposals 
juxtaposed against their populist nature,’ said respected energy analyst
Angelos Anastasiou at Whitman Howard. 

Another analyst Peter Atherton, at Liberum, warned of ‘a potentially open-ended loss during the price freeze’.

Former business secretary Peter Mandelson went further, suggesting Mr Miliband had taken the party backwards. 

‘At the Business Department I tried to move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy between state control and laissez-faire,’ he said.

Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour and its pro-business agenda, came under attack himself from the shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, who called him ‘plain wrong’.

She accused the peer of looking after his own financial interests; he is a director of Russian conglomerate Sistema, which operates in the oil industry, and earns a reported £200,000 a year, plus a share of profits.

‘Lord Mandelson may not have to worry about his energy bills, but a lot of consumers and businesses do,’ she said.

Three of the Big Six – npower, EDF and Scottish Power – already give customers the chance to fix their own bills until 2017, with npower advertising the offer online with the tagline: ‘Why wait for Ed?’ 

Under the deals, customers pay above-average bills now, in the hope that price rises will eventually outstrip their premium.

Power firms claim that if the Government paid the green taxes instead of consumers, everyone would save money. 

MPs say that while this would take the heat off energy firms, it would hit consumers just as hard as the money would have to be raised with other taxes.
