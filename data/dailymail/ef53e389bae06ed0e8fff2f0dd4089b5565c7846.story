An Indiana mother says she fears for her son's life after one of his high school classmates made a video threatening to murder the teen.

Christina Horn says cyber-bullying at Goshen High School has been out of control, with teens using Twitter, Facebook and text messages to harass and intimidate one another. 

But according to the mother, she did not grasp the scope of the problem until her son, John, received a video recording from a classmate threatening to kill him.

Menacing message: This video recorded in the school cafeteria shows a teen saying on camera that he plan to 'murder John's face,' referring to Christina Horn's son

The video was recorded a week earlier in the cafeteria of the high school. In the clip, one teen could be heard asking another off camera: 'Hey, what are you gonna do this Saturday, to John?'

Another teen seen in the shot replies: 'I'm gonna murder John's face.'

The mother became alarmed after watching the clip and immediately contacted the school, according to the TV station ABC57.

'That’s my child they are talking about in that video,' Horn said. 'So it really made me scared, scared for my son’s life.'

Officials at Goshen High School responded to Horn’s concerns by suspending the two teens involved, one to three days and the other to five.

However, the punishment apparently did little to stop the bullying.

According to Horn, her son continued receiving threatening phone calls, texts messages and Facebook posts, leaving him afraid to go to school.

Official response: Administrators at Goshen High School suspended the two students involved in the making of the video, one of them to five days and the other to three

The mother told the station that when she brought her concerns to school officials, saying that her son was still being threatened, she was told that it was a 'he said, she said' situation, and that the administration could do nothing about it.

On Monday, Goshen Schools Superintendent Diane Woodworth said that the matter had been addressed.

'We absolutely want every student to feel safe at Goshen High School and all of our schools,' she said.

Woodworth added that she has been unsuccessfully trying to reach Horn to resolve the situation with her son.

Unsatisfied with the official response to the threats, the mother decided to remove her son from Goshen High School, saying that the boy should feel safe and focus on getting an education rather than spend his days fearing for his life.

In a bid to stop the bullying, Horn also has changed her son's cell phone number and is pressing charges against the teens who allegedly have been harassing the boy.
