Nothing brings home the youthfulness 
of England’s squad more than a quick check of their first World Cup 
memories: Raheem Sterling’s are from South Africa 2010.

‘The
 first World Cup I fully remember was the last one, when Steve [Gerrard]
 scored in the first game against the United States,’ said 19-year-old 
Sterling.

‘I was 
sitting at home eating pizza with friends during the game and then we 
went out for a little kick-about at half-time to try to imitate these 
boys.’

Fully focused: Sterling is looking forward to playing in the World Cup at the age of just 19

Sterling gestures towards to Gerrard, who is sting alongside him as part of the World Cup squad.

Four years ago he was a 15-year-old youth playing football on St Raphael’s Estate in the shadow of Wembley, though for most of his early life the stadium was a building site.

Only in his teens did the new stadium emerge and by then Sterling was on QPR’s books before joining Liverpool at 16.

But no one epitomises the youthful potential of this England squad more than Sterling. He is not the youngest — that honour falls to Luke Shaw — but in terms of a young man most likely to make an impression on the world, Sterling is the prime candidate.

As pressure intensified in Liverpool’s title run-in, Sterling looked nerveless, becoming a key player in the title challenge, despite having being marginal at the start of the season. He fairly forced his way into the team with his pace, finishing and skill impossible to ignore. Just ask Arsenal’s back four.

‘It was an enjoyable team to play in,’ 
said Sterling. ‘And the fans as well, the way they got behind us in the 
last few games was brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like it. I got 
real goose bumps.’

England have had their fair share of youthful 
prodigies, from the  over-exposed Theo Walcott, who joined the squad at 
17 in 2006, to Michael Owen, a raw 18-year-old who lit up the World Cup 
in 1998. Wayne Rooney also burst on to the world scene at 18, but that 
was at the European Championship in 2004.

Sterling approaches this 
World Cup with expectations of his experience being more akin to Owen’s 
than Walcott’s, who didn’t play. If anyone is likely to shock opponents,
 it is Sterling.

‘Now I’m just working hard, so anything can happen,
 but I’m not going to say I’m going to do amazing things,’ he said. ‘I 
will give 100 per cent and hopefully what I try will come off and work. 
But I’m not going to put myself under pressure and say I’m going to do 
what Michael Owen did. I’m just going to work hard for the team.’

Even 
the most confident young prodigy can shrink a little when promoted to 
the England squad. ‘It’s a bit nerve-racking, sitting there eating 
dinner with your new England team-mates. You don’t want to be too much 
in someone else’s zone. But I’ve had a lot of help and advice from the 
Liverpool lads.’

Though he was born in Maverley, Jamaica, he came to 
London when he five. His initial emergence saw him given an England cap 
at 17, becoming the third youngest after Walcott and Rooney since 1881. 
Yet the limelight faded as Brendan Rodgers demoted him from the first 
team.

His life off the pitch was also under scrutiny, a 
well-established rumour asserting that he had fathered a number of 
children. In reality he has only one daughter, one-year-old Melody, 
although he is no longer with her mother.

In football terms, it 
looked as though he might have shone brightly but faded quickly. 
Rodgers’ restraint paid off in the second half of last season, 
Sterling’s renaissance bringing him back into the national 
consciousness. Not only was he key to Liverpool’s rise, but he was also 
considered mature enough to play centrally behind the strikers as well 
as wide right or left.

‘It was a new position for me and I had to 
adapt. I think Brendan mainly put me there to move the ball quicker. 
Sometimes I like to stay on the ball a bit too long and I think he put 
me in there so someone might smash me or something like that! He put me 
in there to make sure I play with two touches. I played there when I was
 younger at QPR, just behind the striker, and I quite like it.’

Tactically,
 he has proved himself adept and Rodgers felt he had grown up enough to 
describe him as the best young player in Europe. ‘Obviously that’s nice 
to hear,’ said Sterling. ‘But I try to block it out. For a manager like 
Brendan to say that is obviously good for me, but I just try to keep 
level-headed.’

He says it is his mother, Nadine, who keeps him 
grounded and in the next breath reveals he has moved out to his own 
place. Like most teenagers, he doubtless feels ready to take on the 
world.
