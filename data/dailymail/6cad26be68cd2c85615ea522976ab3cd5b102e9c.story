Daniel Sturridge shared a selfie with Steven Gerrard on Monday, labelling the Liverpool captain 'a legend'.

The 25-year-old, who hasn't played for the Reds since August after suffering with thigh and calf problems, uploaded the picture onto Instagram with the pair all smiles at Melwood training ground.

Alongside the picture Sturridge said: 'The G @stevengerrard. This guy is a legend man... Real talk...'

While Gerrard's career lies away from Liverpool, Sturridge's long-term future lies firmly in Merseyside after signing a new five-year deal in October.

And the sooner the England striker returns to the first-team fold for the Reds the better, as they currently lie eighth in the Premier League - five points off fourth-placed Manchester United.

The former Chelsea forward also posted a picture of him with his boots on saying 'let's get it', with him eagerly awaiting his first-team return which is anticipated to be at some stage this month.

Sturridge has been working hard to get himself back to full fitness - spending the Christmas period in America - and it has certainly paid off with him and team-mate Philippe Coutinho showing off their physiques in a six-pack selfie on Instagram last week.
