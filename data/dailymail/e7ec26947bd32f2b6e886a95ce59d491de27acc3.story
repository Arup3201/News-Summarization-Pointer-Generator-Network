Las Vegas is home to the most expensive room service in the U.S., it has been revealed, with the city’s average delivery costing approximately $68.

New York City comes in as a close second with an average delivery of $67.83, and Washington D.C. has placed third with an average $62 delivery.

The findings stem from a study conducted by TripAdvisor, which evaluated ten four-star hotels in each of the U.S.’s 15 largest cities.

Premium service: Las Vegas is home to the U.S.'s most expensive room service, where the average bill costs $68

The site averaged hotel costs for what it considered to be a realistic room service bill: a room service club sandwich, the dry-cleaning of one shirt, and minibar items including a bottle of water, peanuts, a nip of vodka, and can of soda.

In doing so, TripAdvisor also discovered that Denver is the least expensive U.S. city for room service with an average bill of $41.43.

Seattle was the second cheapest with a $41.48 average, while Minneapolis came in  third with an average delivery costing $45.72.

Mini-bar prices: The world's most expensive mini-bar nuts can be found in Toronto for $18.23

International deals: The cheapest room service in the world, according to TripAdvisor, can be had in Tunis, Tunisia

TripAdvisor also evaluated room 
service prices in 47 international cities and discovered that delivery 
costs are approximately 22per cent higher in the U.S. than in other 
countries.

The average room service bill costs $55 in the U.S. and $45 in international cities.

But that is not to say that the United States is home to the world’s most expensive room service.

That accolade belongs to Finland, 
where the average room delivery in its capital city Helsinki costs 
$88.94. Oslo, Norway clocks in at a close second with an average bill 
costing $87.59.

Seoul came in third place with an average room bill of $73.31.

Vodka vs. Water: In comparing the prices of vodka and water at hotels, it often seems that vodka is a cheaper alternative

And on the flip side, it is not entirely surprising to hear that many developing vacation locales are home to some of the world’s cheapest room service.

Tunis, Tunisia is home to the most affordable in-room delivery with an average of $18.41, while Cape Town came in second with a typical bill costing $22.97. Budabest, Hungary came in third with an average delivery tallying $25.46.
