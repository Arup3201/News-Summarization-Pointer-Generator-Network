They may have been beaten twice here by Australia already to add to five defeats before Christmas against Sri Lanka but, whisper it, England may just be putting together a one-day team that could exceed expectations at the World Cup.

It would still take a giant leap of faith to consider England as realistic contenders but against all previous evidence – and their long run of almost unmitigated 50-over disaster – things just might be alright on the night.

Certainly England seem to have stumbled on their best line-up in the nick of time - as they did ahead of winning the World Twenty20 in 2010 - to at least confound the most pessimistic predictions of another dismal World Cup failure.

CLICK HERE to read Paul Newman's report on England's defeat by Australia on Friday.

The 11 players who should have got over a psychological hurdle and defeated Australia in Hobart on Friday will almost certainly be the team that takes on a much stronger host nation in the opening World Cup match in Melbourne.

And if they keep on showing the improvement which has seen outstanding contributions from Ian Bell, Steven Finn, Moeen Ali, Jimmy Anderson and new captain Eoin Morgan here then they may just be able to go beyond the last eight.

England coach Peter Moores was in bullish when England made the long journey to Perth ahead of another date with India at the WACA on Friday and a potential Tri-series final against Australia here next Sunday.

‘The goal here was to try to settle quickly on our side for the World Cup and it feels as though we’re doing that now,’ said Moores. ‘It’s a squad with options and the good thing is we have three or four out of the side fighting to get in it.

‘We desperately want to get to the Tri-series final and we’ve got a big game on Friday. If we get there we feel if we play at the top of our game it will be a really good contest. Australia are a good side, there’s no doubt, but so are we and we’re starting to show that. We can feel ourselves moving in the right direction.

Steven Finn, who has had a difficult past two years, has been in excellent form while in Australia

‘Anybody who watched the game in Hobart saw an England side score 300 and then say ‘crikey we really should have got more.’ Similarly I think our bowling will only get better. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are coming back from injury and it’s still early on for them.‘

It must be said that the big decisions England made ahead of this tour have been vindicated already even if only one Tri-series game in three has been won.

The sacking of Alastair Cook may have come late in their grand World Cup plan but Morgan is looking an impressive leader who has even been able to take an attempt to blackmail him over his sex life pretty much in his stride.

And the jettisoning of Cook has allowed Ian Bell to emerge from the shadows to justify England’s decision to prefer him at the top of the order ahead of Alex Hales in spectacular fashion, batting as well at the Bellerive Oval in scoring 141 as he can ever have done in limited-overs cricket.

Most promisingly, Finn is starting to again look like the one-day bowler who was almost unplayable in New Zealand two years ago having battled back from a collapse in his action during last year’s traumatic Ashes tour so severe that his international and even county future was in doubt.

‘The whole dressing room and everybody associated with it were really pleased with Finny’s performance at the Gabba,’ said Moores of Finn’s five-wicket haul against India. ‘He has had a tough time and has worked hard to get back. I was equally pleased last night because backing that up is difficult.

‘He came on at a tough time to bowl and he ran in, got the ball reversing and picked up a couple of wickets. He had that bounce back in how he did everything. I think it’s fantastic. He’s a very good performer, we know he’s got a great record and credit to someone who’s put in a lot of hard work.

‘It would be a huge boost for us if he gets back to where he was a couple of years ago. Steven’s gone through quite a journey and he’s got to the point where he just wants to go and enjoy his cricket. He’s in a good place.’

When England lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer and then got thrashed in Sri Lanka they looked a million miles from a side capable of the modern, dynamic one-day cricket other nations are playing.

Now, three weeks from the World Cup, it is possible to start to get ever so slightly optimistic. ‘I said when I took over that it was our job to try to get the best 15 players on the plane for the World Cup,’ said Moores.

‘Alastair didn’t get on that plane and everybody felt for him but it just felt like the right time to do it. Without a shadow of doubt there’s still time for us to compete with the best sides at this World Cup. You don’t get more than 300 in three out of five games here so far without playing well.

‘There’s lots of things going round in our team and I think they’re starting to fit together. We want to keep it simple, get a settled side and enjoy playing. We’re representing our country, I think we’ve got the best 15 players we could and now we need to get stuck in and work hard to win some games.’
