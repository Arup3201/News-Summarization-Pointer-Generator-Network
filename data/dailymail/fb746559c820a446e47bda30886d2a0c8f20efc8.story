A quarter of teachers and a third of police have now been dragged into the 40p tax rate, it emerged last night.

And one in ten nurses are paying the higher rate of income tax, showing that the 40p band once aimed at the rich is now the ‘norm’ for hundreds of thousands of workers who would not consider themselves wealthy.

Over the past decade more than 1.6million employees have started to pay the higher rate, which kicks in when wages exceed £41,865 a year.

A third of police - 70,000 officers - have now been dragged into the 40p tax rate, figures revealed last night

Critics say this ‘fiscal drag’ has been lucrative for the Treasury but hurts families facing rising food and energy prices.

The revelation will pile pressure on David Cameron to use next year’s Conservative manifesto to pledge to raise the threshold in line with rising incomes.

He said last month that he would ‘love’ to raise the 40p threshold.

The figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 120,000 teachers, 70,000 police officers and up to 72,000 nurses have been pulled into the 40p band.

Last night one Tory backbencher said the shocking analysis showed that it looked as if the ‘socialists have won’.

Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, said the shocking analysis showed that it looked as if the 'socialists have won'.

Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, said: ‘Where did Margaret Thatcher go? I thought we had sorted all this out in the 1980s, when we wanted less government and for people to keep all their money.

‘If you had said 20 years ago that we would be paying these sorts of tax rates, you’d have thought Michael Foot had won the election. Who is arguing for lower taxes now?’ The Office for Budget Responsibility says that one in three workers will be higher rate taxpayers within two decades.

More than ten million will have been dragged over the higher rate threshold by 2033, twice as many as at present.

In April, Chancellor George Osborne used his Budget to increase the tax-free personal allowance from £10,000 to £10,500, a change that the Treasury says benefits all workers earning up to £100,000.

But calls to raise the threshold for the 40p rate in line with rising incomes were ignored.

According to the ONS, the number of ‘teaching professionals’ paying the higher rate has trebled, rising from 100,000 to more than 300,000 in the past decade. They now include 87,000 secondary teachers and 34,000 primary teachers.

In 2003, the figures suggest that there were no nurses who were paying the higher rate. By last year, the figure had risen to 72,000, as well as more than 5,000 paramedics. Electricians have also been dragged into the higher rate for the first time, with more than 10,000 paying.

Homeowners in the North with properties worth over £400,000 should pay the ‘mansion tax’, says a Labour councillor in Tameside, Manchester.

The proposed tax is aimed at homes worth £2million-plus but Claire Reynolds, who is married to Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds, said: ‘In the North there are people who could be paying more and aren’t.’

Labour said the idea would not become party policy.
