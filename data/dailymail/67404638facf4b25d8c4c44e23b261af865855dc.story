Scott Brown, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, started his trek back to the Senate on Friday after a party official introduced him as 'Scott Brown of New Hampshire.'

'A political wave is coming ... Obama Democrats are on the wrong side of that wave,' Brown told a capacity crowd in Nashua on Friday during the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference.

'If we don't like Obamacare, we can get rid of it. Period. ... The party that put everything on the line for the takeover of our very good health care system has a lot to answer for.'

A 2013 move to his family's vacation home in Rye, N.H. has made it possible for him to reclaim his old job while representing a different state – much like how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton moved to New York in 2000 in order to take advantage of a looming Senate election there.

Former Sen. Scott Brown, once conservatives' white knight in famously liberal Massachusetts, will try to capture a Senate seat from New Hampshire

Pressing the flesh and hoping history repeats itself: Brown won a come-from-behind victory in a 2010 special election, and wants to do the same thing against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen

'There's only one way – one way – to get rid of Obamacare once and for all,' said Brown, speaking against the backdrop of a 25-foot-wide U.S. flag hung for the occasion.

'And that's to get rid of the Obama Democrats who rammed it through Congress and forced it down the throats of the American people.'

Brown blamed Senate Democrats for most of Washington's chronic dysfunction, saying Majority Leader Harry Reid and his allies have stifled their opponents' efforts to moderate some of the president's policies.

'It's been "My way or the highway," and I'm tired of it,' Brown boomed.

'It's time for the whole crowd to go.'

The former senator, who swept into Washington in 2010 as a surprise replacement for the recently deceased Democratic lion Ted Kennedy, is now poised to give first-term Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen a tough re-election fight.

But the 'carpetbagger' label will dog him the same way it did Mrs. Clinton 14 years ago.

The New Hampshire Democratic Party was waiting for Brown in the tall grass, and quickly released a YouTube video Friday after his announcement, chronicling his past statements about his pride in being from Massachusetts.

'I'll probably die here,' he says in one clip.

But on Friday Brown took every opportunity to paint himself as a New Hampshire-born child from the wrong side of the tracks, sounding like a candidate from the beginning of his 18-minute speech.

He lived in 17 different homes by the time he was 18 years old, Brown said, in a soft voice that countered the impression left by his towering height.

His parents were each 'married and divorced 4 times,' he said, working from notes but scanning the crowd – not a TelePrompTer.

Brown himself has been married to one woman for nearly 30 years.

Brown lost his only bid to defend his Senate seat in 2012, when liberal's liberal Elizabeth Warren swept him aside as part of Obama's re-election year

Dark horse: Brown wants to join a handful of politicians who have represented two or more states in the U.S. Senate, but first he will have to beat the popular Democrat Jeanne Shaheen

The Fox News Channel canceled Brown's on-air contributor contract earlier in the afternoon, as is their custom, when he informed the management there that he would be running for office.

He wouldn't be the first person to serve in the U.S. Senate from more than one state. But Sen. James Shields' record of three states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri – appears safe unless the Republican pays his realtor overtime.

MailOnline confirmed Thursday that Brown would make the move.

Matt Mowers, executive director of the New Hampshire State Republican Committee, shrugged around midnight and said that 'it's a rumor right now.'

But two other sources had confirmed that Brown would use his Nashua speaking engagement as a launching pad.

It's there that he announced on Friday afternoon that he's formed an exploratory committee, a necessary step before he can legally hire staffers to massage the media, poll New Hampshire's voters and craft a strategy for unseating Shaheen in November.

No one knows how Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, will do in New Hampshire, but he's the GOP's most recognizable candidate and one of its most congenial and photogenic  speakers

The New Hampshire Union Leader had reported that Brown's political action committee had sent a total of $29,000 to a group of GOP committees. Those checks included $5,000 contributions to the New Hampshire state party, and the Senate and House Republican PACs.

While passing the hat is a time-tested proposition for political players, Brown aims to double down on his unconventional 2010 victory over Democratic Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, whom he trailed for most of the special-election campaign season.

In New Hampshire, too, Brown is already behind the eight-ball. A Suffolk University poll released March 6 showed Sen. Shaheen with a 13-point edge, 52 to 39, among likely voters.

But those percentages are soft since Brown's candidacy was hypothetical, and because they followed on the heels of $360,000 in negative ads run against him in January and February by Democrats and liberal special interests who were spooked by the idea.

Brown's near-universal name recognition will perk up his numbers now that he has officially entered the race, Republicans hope, and they expect outside conservatives like Americans for Prosperity to continue advertising heavily against Shaheen for her cozy relationship with the increasingly unpopular President Barack Obama.

For now, he's banking on a groundswell of support from breathless Republicans buoyed by the possibility of a return to the majority in the U.S. Senate.

The GOP needs to capture six Democrat-held seats this year to wrest control from Majority Leader Harry Reid.

If he wins in New Hampshire – provided he survives a cakewalk primary – Brown could flip the final seat Republicans want.

In 2010 he was hailed on the right as a latter-day savior because Senate Democrats had passed the Affordable Care Act, but would need to hold a re-vote after the House of Representatives made its own alterations.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick had appointed Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a one-time Ted Kennedy aide, as an interim senator, and Kirk voted yes.

Political melting pot: Just like Republican Gov. Chris Christie's performance in blue-state New Jersey depends on working with a Democrat-controlled legislature, Brown had to work with liberals including fellow senator John Kerry, the future secretary of state

With Brown replacing Kirk after his election, Republicans suddenly had enough votes to filibuster the Obamacare law when it came back from the House.

Reid and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi had an answer: The law was bundled with a host of other legislation and passed in the Senate a second time through a process known as reconciliation – which isn't subject to filibustering.

This time Brown could push the GOP over the top in the upper chamber of Congress, effectively stymieing President Obama's agenda during his lame-duck years.

But first he needs to win.

Brown said Friday that his wife Gail had urged him to 'stop complaining' and 'run for the United States Senate in New Hampshire'

Granite State Republicans have already pulled off one upset this year, in a statewide election for a seat on the New Hampshire Executive Council – a five-member panel that serves as a mixed-party privy council to the governor, approving appointees and green-lighting spending proposals once the legislature has appropriated money.

On Tuesday Republican Joe Kenney defeated Democrat Mike Cryans in a special election for one of those five executive council seats, winning by 1,267 votes in a race he was expected to lose.

Brown, a state party official told MailOnline, wants to harness the sudden boost of energy to send him back to the Senate, this time for a full term.

'I mean, look what we just did,' the official said. 'Now I'm not saying Scott Brown will pull off the same upset, but god, I hope he does. Everyone in New Hampshire knows who he is already, and Jeanne Shaheen voted for Obamacare.'

'We really should be able to win this one.'

At an event where long-shot presidential hopefuls are consuming most of the oxygen – MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum will make appearances – Brown's plunge back into a campaign with national implications has turned the event from a second-tier dog and pony show into a key feature of the GOP's plan to re-take the Senate.

Before Brown's plans were leaked on Thursday, Scarborough was the talk of Nashua.

The former congressman has toyed with running for president, but this weekend will mark the first time he is included in a straw poll alongside serious contenders like Santorum, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, all senators who will share the ballot with Republican Governors Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Susana Martinez and Jindal.

But the biggest crowd so far has been for the man who as a part-time model once appeared naked in Cosmopolitan magazine, his modesty preserved only by creative cropping at the bottom of a centerfold.

'He's a handsome guy,' offered a Nashua hotel guest who identified herself only as 'Ruth from Manchester.'

'I'd vote for him,' she chuckled. 'Just don't tell my husband.'
