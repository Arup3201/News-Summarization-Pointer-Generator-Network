Women around the world went wild for David Beckham's last series of ads for H&M. And if an early look at his new campaign is any indication, the second promises to be just as popular.

The London-born footballer poses in a white vest and underpants in the image, offering a smouldering gaze at the camera.

Some might argue that it is not unlike the famous Blue Steel expression of Ben Stiller's much-loved make model character, Derek Zoolander.

And this new series of ads, which launches on Thursday, will be followed by many more, if Mr Beckham has anything to do with it.

'I'm very happy that so far people seem to like it and the first season was incredibly successful,' he says.

'The challenge is to keep it going and establish a brand that will last many years. That is my ambition.'

The launch will coincide with a 'statue stunt' with larger-than-life Beckhams 
going up in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco .

It will promote new products that will be added to the collection later this year.

The 37-year-old father-of-four, who 
is married to Spice Girl-turned fashion designer Victoria, says the 
formula for the H&M bodywear line is largely about his personal 
preference for 'comfort and fit.'

And
he's not just talking about T-shirts. Apparently, he doesn't mind some 
downtime at home, and that's why there will be more cosy and warm items 
heading into stores.

He explained: 'It's important to me that bodywear means more than just briefs and tees. It's about all the pieces I like.'

Mr
Beckham says he values the input of H&M designers, especially when 
it comes to their technical expertise, to get products to the point 
where he wants his name on them.

'Working with a team has always been a key part of my life,' he says.

But, he adds, he didn't have any help getting in shape so he could feel comfortable minimally dressed in front of the cameras.

'I did nothing different,' he says. 'I'm naturally fit of course as an athlete so there is nothing out of the ordinary I do!'

The footballer took 
centre-stage at the London Olympics Opening Ceremony last month, 
carrying the torch on its final leg along the Thames in a boat.

And his H&M ads were projected onto the White Cliffs of Dover by way of a welcome for tourists flying into the UK for the Games.

'I was incredibly honoured to be part of the team that helped bring the Olympics to my home borough, city and country,' he said.

'I always knew we would put on a fantastic event but it has exceeded even my most optimistic expectations.'

Mr Beckham had hoped to play for Britain's soccer team at the games but to many of his fans' shock, he was not selected for the squad.
