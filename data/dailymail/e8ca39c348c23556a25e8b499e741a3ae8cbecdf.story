The actress who played a starship captain in Star Trek, Kate Mulgrew, has issued a statement about her work as a narrator in the geocentrist documentary The Principle, saying she does not believe in its main tenet.

She voiced a new film promoting the notion that the sun revolves around the Earth instead of the other way around.

Ms Mulgrew claims that she is annoyed and was tricked into working on it in the first place.

For although she played a starship captain exploring the outer reaches of the universe in the 24th century, the film promoted science that was out of date almost 500 years ago.

Duped: Star Trek's Kate Mulgrew says she was tricked into narrating film that argues the Sun revolves around Earth

Frustrated: I was a voice for hire, and a misinformed one, at that. I apologize for any confusion that my voice on this trailer may have caused, said Kate Mulgrew

'I was a voice for hire, and a misinformed one,' says Mulgrew, famous as Star Trek: Voyager's Captain Kathryn Janeway.

Ms Mulgrew made a statement on her Facebook profile.

'I
 understand there has been some controversy about my participation in a 
documentary called THE PRINCIPLE.

'Let me assure everyone that I 
completely agree with the eminent physicist Lawrence Krauss, who was 
himself misrepresented in the film, and who has written a succinct 
rebuttal in SLATE.'

'I am 
not a geocentrist, nor am I in any way a proponent of geocentrism. More 
importantly, I do not subscribe to anything Robert Sungenis has written 
regarding science and history and, had I known of his involvement, would
 most certainly have avoided this documentary.

I was a voice for hire, 
and a misinformed one, at that. I apologize for any confusion that my 
voice on this trailer may have caused.'

Mulgrew became an icon of exploration to Trekkies for her role as the Captain on Star Trek: Voyager

'Everything we think we know about our 
universe is wrong,' Mulgrew's voice says over cosmic images in the 
trailer for 'The Principle.'

The film, set for release this spring,
 was partially backed by a well known far-right 
conservative, Robert Sungenis, who runs a blog called 'Galileo Was Wrong' and has been accused of anti-semitism.

Scientists
 such as Michio Kaku, Lawrence Krauss, and Max Tegmart all appear in the
 trailer, discussing the Earth's unique characteristics that allow it to
 sustain life.

Sungenis himself appears in the trailer to offer some of his conspiracy theory.Â 

'You
 can go on some websites of NASA to see that they've started to take 
down stuff that might hint to a geocentric universe,' he tells the 
audience.

One of the 
physicists involved, Lawrence Krauss, has already come forward to say he
 has no idea how he ended up in this 'stupid' film.

Opposed: Kate Mulgrew has issued a statement about her work as a narrator in the geocentrist documentary The Principle, and not only does she not believe its insane main tenet, she's upset she was tricked into working on it at all.

In his Slate article,
 titled 'I Have No Idea How I Ended Up In That Stupid Geocentrism 
Documentary,' Krauss claims that producers must have taken clips of him 
that were in the public domain, purchased the rights to them from some 
other production company, or simply deceived him as to what their 
project was about.

A 2012 survey claims one in four Americans believe in 
geocentrism, which argues that the Earth is actually the center of the 
universe and that the sun, planets, and stars revolve around it.

It's not the first time Sungenis has taken a position indefensible with historical records, science, or common sense.

As Raw Story
 noted, he once argued that no one has actually proven that 6 million 
Jews died in the Holocaust and claimed that Jews were in a conspiracy 
with Satan to take over the planet.

Sungenis
 has gone so far that even his local bishop told him to stop writing 
about Jews and identifying his organization as a Catholic one after he 
criticized a catechism connected to Judaism.
