Need some inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham?

Sportsmail's Marcus Townend and Peter Scudamore reveal their favourites while Sky Sports News HQ presenter Alex Hammond and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival.

PETER SCUDAMORE 

PTIT ZIG

(JLT Novices’ Chase, 1.30)

I can forgive him his fall on his last run at Ascot — it was a typical novice mistake. But his form otherwise looks pretty strong and he can also boast some top quality Grade One-winning hurdle form. He is taken to fend off the strong Irish threat led by Apache Stronghold and Valseur Lido.

BEST ODDS: 7-2

DON COSSACK

(Ryanair Chase, 2.40)

This gelding, trained by Gordon Elliott (below), looks a much more complete racehorse this season and has won all his four races since being beaten by AP McCoy’s Gold Cup hope Carlingford Lough at the Punchestown Festival in April. He fell at this meeting last year but I would not hold that against him. Plus trainer Elliott already has a winner on the board with Cause of Causes on the first day.

BEST ODDS: 3-1

UN TEMPS POUR TOUT

(Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20)

An expensive recruit from France who has not yet quite reached the heights expected of him. He did, however, run a very promising first race of the season when third to Thursday’s opponent Saphir Du Rheu in the Cleeve Hurdle in January. That was his first run since May so he is entitled to improve significantly and play a big part in a very open race. Confidence will be increased in his chance now that trainer David Pipe has had a winner at the meeting.

BEST ODDS: 12-1

BUYWISE

(Brown Advisory & Merriebell Stable Plate, 4.0)

This Evan Williams-trained eight-year-old was an easy five length winner at Ffos Las on his last run and looks a horse who still has a little in hand with the handicapper.

BEST ODDS: 7-1

MARCUS TOWNEND 

TRUSTAN TIMES

(Pertemps Hurdle, 2.05)

Sybarite looks a good option here but, at even longer odds, this Tim Easterby-trained stayer looks worth a punt. He was fourth in the race 12 months ago, beaten less than half a length in a blanket finish, and he races off a marginally lower handicap mark this afternoon. His stable is in decent form with a couple of winners in its last six runners.

BEST ODDS: 25-1

EDUARD

(Ryanair Chase, 2.40)

Lacks a little match practice for such a hotly-contested event as this but there is no doubt the Nicky Richards-trained gelding possesses talent. He would probably have beaten Wishfull Thinking, a rival again on Thursday, in the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon last time but for an error at the final fence.

BEST ODDS: 16-1

COLE HARDEN

(Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20)

Has failed to win since his first race of the season at Wetherby at the start of November and could be regarded as disappointing. But the positives are that his stable has emerged from a quiet spell and he has had a breathing operation since being beaten behind Saphir Du Rheu here in January. Will be staying on better than most at the finish.

AND THE CELEBS... 

Here's who the celebs are backing in Thursday’s Ladbrokes World Hurdle.

SAPHIR DU RHEU

It should be an open race this year but this is a horse that is well regarded.

RISHI PERSAD - Channel 4 Racing presenter

ZARKANDAR

He is a better horse than last season and they will have learned a lot more how to ride him after his defeat last time out.

TANYA STEVENSON - Channel 4 Racing presenter

MONKSLAND

I can see the race panning out perfectly for jockey Paul Carberry.

............................................................................ 

JOHN PARROTT - Snooker professional

ZARKANDAR

I think he will win as he’ll be ridden to pounce late.

ANGUS LOUGHRAN - Betting pundit

MONKSLAND

You need a true stayer to win this race and he is definitely that.

CORNELIUS LYSAGHT- Radio 5 Live Racing correspondent

A useful horse who should run well at a decent price.
