A retired Rolls Royce worker has died after he slipped overboard on a Vietnamese holiday boat.

British David Wright, who could not swim, may have got up in the night to visit the bathroom when he fell off the boat in the world-famous beauty spot of Ha Long Bay last week.

The 63-year-old's body was found the next morning, hours before he was due to fly back to Derby, East Midlands, at the end of the two-week adventure holiday with friends.

His friend Judy Lomas, 67, said: 'I
 remember David telling me he was so happy that evening. He told me that
 this was the best day of his life.'

The pair often travelled together and were among a group of European travellers from Britain, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.

She said: 'We had been trekking and camping in the northern hills in the run-up to this boat trip, so we were used to being out in the wilds.

'On the night when it happened, we were on the boat and there was a party in the evening. We were out in the bay at anchor and it was lovely.

'At the end of the night we all headed off to our separate cabins and in the morning he just wasn't there.I realised something was wrong when nobody could find him.

'A member of the crew had knocked on his door to tell him breakfast was ready but he was gone. Everyone was searching the boat.

His friend Judy Lomas said: 'I don't blame anyone for what happened. It was a tragic accident' (file photo)

'Someone called the police when he was nowhere to be found and within a couple of hours they had located him on the shore nearby.

'I thought maybe he got up in the night to visit the bathroom but lost his footing on the deck. Maybe he just slipped and fell. David couldn't swim.

'I wondered if he was sleep-walking and at the end of the deck it was open. He could have fallen from there.I don't blame anyone for what happened. It was simply a tragic accident.'

Mr Wright, a keen photographer who also worked for the train manufacturer Bombardier, retired aged 58 to travel the world.

His destinations included Armenia, Slovenia and India and in 2012 he visited the Everest Base Camp, which is higher than many mountains at 16,900ft above sea level.

Mr Wright, who was also a regular bridge player, never married and leaves two brothers and two sisters who his friend said were 'devastated'.

Authorities of Quang Ninh Province 
confirmed Mr Wright was a member of a group of European visitors led by 
Viettour that was touring Ha Long Bay in a boat operated by Hai Phong 
Co, Ltd.

Huong Dinh, of the British Embassy in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi, said it appeared Mr Wright had drowned on the night of last Thursday, April 3.

His body has been taken to the Bai Chay Hospital where authorities are awaiting an autopsy to confirm the cause of death.

Ms Dinh said: 'We are providing consular assistance to David's family at this difficult time. We cannot provide any more information at this stage from the embassy but are so sorry to hear this news.'
