Crook: Chaudry Ali could face another decade in prison if he does not repay £4.3m in criminal gains

A '24-carat' smuggler who brought £100million worth of gold into Britain must repay £4.3million of the tax he dodged - or spend an extra decade in prison.

Chaudry Ali, 52, was jailed for nine years in 2012 for spearheading an international smuggling ring which took precious metals from  Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Using an elaborate system of couriers, he swapped bags with his fellow smugglers in Frankfurt to avoid £9million in VAT because the tax is not payable within the EU.

Chiefs at HM Revenue and Customs branded him a '24-carat criminal' when the scam was finally foiled two years ago.

Images from the raid showed a laptop bag stuffed with gold jewellery including hundreds of bangles and bracelets.

The total resale value of all the gold he brought into Britain was estimated at £100million. 

His trial heard he had benefited to the tune of £7million - but forensic accounting later raised that figure to £9million,  HMRC said. 

A judge has now ruled Ali must repay half of that figure - and the deadline has been set at four months.

If he does not pay it back, another ten years will be added to his sentence.

Making the order, Judge Paul Dodgson said Ali still denied his guilt - but had been 'a dishonest witness who was quite prepared to lie in the face of overwhelming evidence.' 

An HMRC spokesman insisted the figure was  half of Ali's ill-gotten gains because the law states authorities can only claim assets which a criminal actually has.

'If in the future he comes into money we can go back to court', a spokesman said. 'Just because he's only having to pay back half it doesn't mean he will never have to pay the rest back. It's a life-long thing.'

During the original investigation, it was discovered Ali had organised 120 scam trips between January 2007 and April 2008, importing huge quantities of gold into Britain without paying tax.

A courier would leave Britain in the afternoon, arriving in Dubai early the next morning.

They would collect the gold before leaving Dubai the same evening and returning to Britain via Frankfurt, Germany, where they met Ali in an airside lounge.

They would then swap bags – so Ali would leave with the gold and the courier would leave with an ordinary bag of clothes.

The pair would then take separate flights back to the UK, passing through the European Union (EU) entry channel.

In case he was stopped by officers, Ali carried forged paperwork which claimed he was a legitimate VAT-registered gold trader who had travelled to Europe with the gold in his bag.

But as he hadn’t left the EU, no duty would be payable on the gold.

Ali, of Hillingdon, west London, denied all involvement in the scheme when his case came to court in late 2012.

But a jury at Kingston Crown Court in south west London found him guilty of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, and he was jailed.

Two alleged couriers were charged and stood trial, but a jury found them not guilty.

HMRC investigator Kevin Newe said: 'Ali believed he had found the perfect fraud that was beyond detection, but he was wrong.

'Our investigators uncovered the fraud and addition to his current prison term, he will have to spend an extra ten years in jail unless he repays crime profits of over £4.3million within the next four months.

'Our work doesn't stop with sentencing - we will pursue criminal profits to reclaim them for the taxpayer and the UK economy.'

Andrew Sackey, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation for HMRC, said previously: 'Chaudry Ali was a 24-carat criminal. He systematically evaded millions of pounds of VAT in the hope of lining his pockets.

'Our officers worked tirelessly to catch him, and the sentence is the result of that hard work.'
