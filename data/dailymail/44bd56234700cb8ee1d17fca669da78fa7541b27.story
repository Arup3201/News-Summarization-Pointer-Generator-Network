Terrified tourists watched helplessly as a pride of deadly lions pounced on a buffalo. But during the vicious attack, the animal miraculously managed to escape.

Eleven lions targeted and attacked the buffalo in Tanzania, while 12 safari vehicles full of astonished passengers surrounded them.

Despite a relentless attempt by the predators to wrestle it to the ground, the buffalo was somehow able to break free from their grasps.

Photographer Scott MacLeod first spotted the pride while they used the shade of the 4x4s as protection from the heat. However, the group were soon on the move when they caught sight of the herd.

Describing the start of the attack, Mr MacLeod said: 'The lions roused themselves and moved on towards a herd of buffalo in the distance. Two of the strongest females padded stealthily towards their prey as a third lion circled around behind.

'The other lions waited, and watched. After a 20-minute standoff, the largest buffalo made a run for it and was soon caught'.

Onlookers: A dozen vehicles end up encircling the vicious scrap. The buffalo is still surrounded by seven lions with three holding on to its legs and back

Dying down: The vehicles create an arena as the fight continues. But the buffalo appears to be struggling less as some of the lions wait in the grass
