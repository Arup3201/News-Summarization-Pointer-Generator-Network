While promoting his new film in a television interview Friday, actor Forest Whitaker discussed the recent incident in which he was accused of shoplifting at a New York City market and took the opportunity to address New York City’s stop and frisk policy and racial politics in America in general.

While talking about The Butler, a film that revolves around America’s civil rights movement and also stars Oprah Winfrey, film critic Peter Travers asked the 52-year-old what it felt like to be the victim of racial profiling despite his many successes.

‘I was angered,’ said Whitaker, who is black, in the interview which aired on ABC. ‘It’s a humiliating thing for someone to come and do that. It’s attempted dis-empowerment.’

But the modest Oscar winner was quick to turn the topic from himself to the problem of racial profiling in general.

‘Most of the stop and frisk,’ began the actor, though Travers had asked only how Whitaker felt about his own false shoplifting accusation. ‘Nine out of the ten, the person is not a criminal. They don’t ticket them, or they don’t arrest them. 99 percent of them don’t have a weapon. So I think there’s something that has to be examined.’

Whitaker did eventually get around to discussing his own brush with racial profiling, but would only say how he turned it into a positive.

‘It’s attempted disempowerment,’ he said. ‘And for me it just spurred me into action.’

The vehicle for that action, Whitaker said, came in the form of his PeaceEarth Foundation which, according to a foundation video, seeks to build inroads toward peaceful resolutions in areas of conflict around the world.

The shoplifting snafu occurred in February, when Whitaker was perusing the aisles at the Milano Market in Manhattan’s Upper East Side when an employee approached him and made the accusation, according to TMZ.

The worker then frisked the Last King of Scotland actor in front of the other customers as if he was a lowly thief.

Not surprisingly, the employee turned up no contraband on Forest's body, and the actor left the story in a fury.

'Frisking individuals without proof/evidence is a violation of rights,' Whitaker's rep told TMZ at the time.

The statement continued: 'This was an upsetting incident given the fact that Forest did nothing more than walk into the deli.

'What is most unfortunate about this situation is the inappropriate way store employees are treating patrons of their establishment.'

The actor took the higher ground and didn't call the authorities on the employee, instead reasoning with the store manager to 'change their behavior' and 'treat the public in a fair and just manner.'
