An American healthcare worker who contracted Ebola while volunteering in Africa has arrived safely at the National Institutes of Health research hospital in Maryland, the agency announced Friday.

The patient's condition was still being evaluated after being flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane and was admitted at 4.44a.m. 

The patient's name, age and gender were not released.

The patient is the 10th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. and the second admitted to the NIH Clinical Center, which has one of the few containment facilities nationwide set up to treat Ebola patients.

The patient had been volunteering at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, but the NIH did not release any further details about the patient.

Previously, an American nurse was treated there after she contracted Ebola while caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. The nurse, Nina Pham, survived and is Ebola-free.

'The NIH Clinical Center also admitted two individuals who experienced high-risk exposures to the Ebola virus while working on the Ebola response in West Africa, but who were ultimately found not to be infected,' the agency said in its statement.

Spread: The current Ebola outbreak is the largest ever for the disease 

The center's Special Clinical Studies Unit is staffed by specialists in infectious disease and critical care and is designed to prevent the spread of highly contagious viruses, including Ebola. 

The World Health Organization estimated Thursday that the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease, however, as deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.
