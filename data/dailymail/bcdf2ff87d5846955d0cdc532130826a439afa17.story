The scoreboard at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh may have been slow to start but England got off to a flyer, taking two golds and one silver medal on the opening day of the diving.

Jack Laugher, 19, tumbled and twisted his way clear of the 1m springboard field to win gold by a huge margin, before Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree took the 3m synchronised title.

Laugher produced a diving masterclass with a score of 449.90 — well ahead of Australians Matt Mitcham, who took silver with 404.85, and Grant Nell, who clinched bronze with 403.40.

Laugher said: ‘I didn’t realise I would be so far ahead. It feels amazing, it’s been my dream since I was a kid.’

Scotland's James Heatly, grandson of five-time Games diving medallist Sir Peter Heatly, was ninth with 345.60.

The 17-year-old from Edinburgh had qualified in 10th.

It was a tighter finish for surprise winners Blagg and Gallantree. They trailed eventual silver medallists — Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware of Canada — heading into the final dive. But they nailed a forward three-and-a-half somersault dive to clinch a gold medal with a total of 300.24.

‘I literally cannot believe what has happened.’ said Blagg. ‘Is this real life? My family are stunned as well. Rebecca is my hero.’

Earlier in the day Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow kept their composure to win a silver medal in the 10m synchronised, despite the faulty scoring equipment.

Judges were forced to write their scores on cardboard flashcards after attempts to fix the electronic system failed.

They appeared unfazed, opening up an early lead with an impressive 52.80 score for their first dive.

The pair, who finished fifth at the London Olympics, were marked down on their third dive, a tough inward three-and-a-half they had struggled with in training.

Nevertheless, they retained the lead until the final dive, when they were overhauled by the Canadian Olympic bronze medal pairing of Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion.

There was silence among the crowd as Couch and Barrow’s final score was announced as 69.12, giving them an overall score of 307.92, behind the Canadian gold medallists on 310.65 points.

Barrow admitted to some regret. ‘Our last dive is normally pretty good so were a little bit disappointed not to hold onto first,’ she said.

‘But our training wasn’t brilliant so we’re pretty pleased with a medal. We’ve got the individual tomorrow and we’re both going into it with a good chance.’
