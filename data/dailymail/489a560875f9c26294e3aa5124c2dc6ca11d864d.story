A grandfather is seeing red instead of stars after being banned from using his telescope in case he is a Peeping Tom.

Peter Norman, who has suffered a number of cardiac arrests, ditched his hectic life to settle in Swansea Marina with wife Kay to nurture his health and explore his astronomy passion.

But after fixing his 18-inch telescope onto the balcony, he received a letter from his landlord ordering him to pull it down to preserve the privacy of other tenants - even though his balcony overlooks water.

The former carpenter was so upset by the warning he gathered the support of almost 50 neighbours backing him to be allowed to continue his hobby.

Peter is now fearful that the stress of the situation could trigger another angina attack.

The 64-year-old said: 'Astronomy is a bit of a passion of mine, and I was looking forward to taking advantage of the location of the new home, because it has great views of the south and western skies.

'So I bought myself a new telescope and fixed it to the balcony. But then I got a letter to say I couldn’t use it, or any binoculars.

'But from the angle it is situated, it is not possible to see into other properties. You can see some from the side, but only the balconies, and not inside them.

'But the telescope was in a fixed position on the balcony at the front, which doesn’t overlook any properties.'

The grandfather-of-twelve was once given an award from South Wales Police for organising a community support group similar to Neighbourhood Watch.

Since receiving notice to remove his telescope, he sought support from his new neighbours, claiming he got 48 signatures from those living nearby backing his bid to be able to keep his telescope.

And he questioned whether the instruction passed onto him meant he was not even able to use a mobile phone on the balcony.

Peter said: 'The letter said it requested the telescope, or any recording device or camera device, was removed from the balcony within 24 hours.

'Does that mean I can’t even take photos of my grandchildren on the balcony with a mobile phone?'

Peter’s landlord Coastal Housing said the decision was imperative to preserve neighbours’ dignity.

A spokesman said: 'Coastal Housing’s priority is for its tenants to have quiet enjoyment of their tenancies and this applies equally to all residents of our 69 apartments at Harbour Quay.

'We do not want to spoil Peter’s pursuit of his astronomy hobby, but have to balance this with ensuring the privacy of other tenants is not encroached upon.

'We have not received a petition from Peter, but a number of Harbour Quay residents who have signed it have contacted us and asked for their signatures to be removed.

'They have further lodged complaints about the length of time that Peter uses his telescope daily, as his balcony overlooks those of a considerable number of other apartments, and privacy concerns are discouraging others from using their balconies.'

Coastal Housing insist Peter can continue to use his telescope elsewhere on his property as long as it does not threaten to intrude on others

Coastal Housing’s spokesman said: 'We will continue to monitor feedback from other tenants.'
