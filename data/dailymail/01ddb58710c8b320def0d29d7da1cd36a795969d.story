A grandmother who works at a Goodwill warehouse in California says a hug was the only reward she needed.

Bonnie Patton found and returned $40,000 worth of Tiffany jewelry that had been accidentally donated in a box of donated clothes and household items.

Ms Patton, a grandmother of seven, was a temporary worker with Goodwill in April when the alert went out that jewelry was possibly somewhere among the 25,000 items donated to the huge warehouse each day.

Priceless: The jewelry is worth about $40,000 but its sentimental value is irreplaceable

The jewellery belonged to Sandra Williams who had accidentally included some of most precious items along with pieces destined for charity.

Ms. Williams, a banking executive, said she had desperately rummaged around her San Mateo apartment searching for her 'irreplaceable and sentimental' heirloom pieces during renovations of her home in April.

'I thought I'd hid it so well that even I couldn't find it or someone walked off with it,' she told ABC News.

She was having construction work done on her home at the time of the items disappearance she even filed reports with her construction company and the police.

Ms Williams even called the construction company to obtain the name and addresses of all their employees

It was only when she recalled her daughter had dropped off a bag books and clothes to Goodwill earlier in the week that she decided to call them.

The charity explained to her that the chances of her rings being recovered was extremely slim given the enormity of the warehouse.

On the day the rings were found, Ms Patton was working and she remembered hearing about the lost items.

The rings and Tiffany pearls were all recovered in amongst clothes that were being sorted.

'Finding these rings was like a needle in a haystack,' said  Ms Patton.

 'I was so excited for this lady. I would not personally want to lose my heirlooms, my personal memories, so I was very, very excited.'

Mrs Williams was equally as jubilant. "I could not believe the goodwill of Goodwill,' she 'I can’t believe that someone would find a 1.75-carat ring and not put in their pocket.'

'She wanted to give me a reward, but the thank you and the hug was my reward,' Ms Patton said.

Ms Patton was promoted for her honesty when she made the discovery and is now a permanent staff member of Goodwill.
