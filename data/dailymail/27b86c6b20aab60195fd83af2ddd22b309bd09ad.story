Those headed out to Denver are willing to shell out for more than just eggs on Easter weekend which also falls on April 20, the nation's unofficial holiday for the celebration of marijuana.

Ever since Colorado made recreational marijuana use legal, the state has felt a boom in tourist revenue and this weekend, the numbers are expected to smoke out old records.

CBS reports that Denver hotel searches on Hotels.com have increased by 73 per cent nationwide when compared to the same time frame in 2013.

Denver was previously listed as one of the top 20 U.S. destinations and is a popular location for skiing and other snow sports.

Ever since marijuana has made Denver an even more popular tourist spot more and more people are expected to visit the city from all over the globe. 

'People are coming nationally from all over the U.S. but I’m also seeing a lot of international guests as well,' said Christine Lunsford, operations director at the Denver weed shop 3D Cannabis Center.

'They’re all coming here because cannabis is legal in Colorado and they’re all excited to be here,'

CBS spoke with a few of Denver's Easter weekend visitors to see what made them decide to visit Colorado for the special holiday.

'People are coming nationally from all over the U.S. but I¿m also seeing a lot of international guests as well,' said Christine Lunsford, operations director at the Denver weed shop 3D Cannabis Center

'I just think it’s an awesome opportunity that I’m actually here to experience it,' said Jourdan Yelvington who came all the way from Daytona Beach, Florida to attend the 4/20 celebrations.

Yelvington was unable to check in early at her hotel because it was so busy. The marijuana enthusiast decided to kill some time at a pot shop which she describes as a surreal experience.

'I would say that the 4/20 weekend is a destination weekend here in Denver because we have people coming from all over and for tourism there’s been a huge spike,' Lunsford said.

This year Denver will host the fourth annual High Times cannabis Cup. Last year had the highest attendance yet after the recreational legalization of marijuana use.

Even though smoking pot is legal in Colorado doesn't  mean that there aren't laws surrounding its use.

Residents and visitors are not permitted to travel with marijuna, smoke in public areas or on federal land. Nor are they permitted to drive while under the influence of drugs.
