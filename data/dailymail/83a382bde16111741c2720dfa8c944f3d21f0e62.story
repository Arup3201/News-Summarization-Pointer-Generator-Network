The internal report is believed to show that some women have been asked inappropriate questions about their marital status and had been discouraged from seeking leadership positions.

Victorian Liberal MP Inga Peulich claims she was bullied by members of her own party

The internal Liberal Party report apparently found that, during preselection, only female candidates were asked questions about their family and personal life.

The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process

'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report.

It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported.

The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party.

Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters.

'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said. 

The internal report also suggested that a women's network be created to boost morale and allow Liberal women to connect to each other and questioned the need for spouses to be included in the preselection process.
