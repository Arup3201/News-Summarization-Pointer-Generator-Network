A Dallas bus and train station was brought to a standstill on Saturday after a woman reportedly vomited at the facility, sparking fears she had Ebola, but the transit authority now say she was never on a watchlist as someone exposed to the virus.

Panic broke out after the woman exited a northbound train at the White Rock Station and was sick on the platform, leading the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system to close the station as a precaution.

However authorities have now said that, contrary to reports, the woman was not on a watch list of potential people exposed to the virus and had only spat on the platform.

'The person being treated by Dallas Fire Rescue at White Rock Station is NOT on any Ebola watchlist," Morgan Lyons, a DART spokeswoman, wrote in an email to Reuters.

'There are no indications of any biohazards or spills on any vehicle she has used,' said Lyons.

'We're inspecting the train and the platform and will clean the facility and vehicle as needed consistent with our protocol.'

Earlier, a Dallas television station reported the woman had been one of the people in the area monitored for possible exposure to the often-fatal Ebola virus.

Dallas Fire-Rescue have revealed that the woman did live in the same apartment complex as 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 30 after catching the deadly virus will in Liberia. 

And while she had no contact with the man, who died on October 8, officials were still treating the situation very seriously.

The incident highlights the heightened state of awareness of the dangers of spreading the disease, especially in Dallas, where the Liberian national became the first person infected with the virus to die in the United States.

Two nurses who cared for him have also contracted the virus.
