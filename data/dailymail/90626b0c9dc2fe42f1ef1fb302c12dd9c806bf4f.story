Former Dallas Cowboys tackle Josh Brent was released from jail on Sunday following his conviction for a drunken car crash that killed his friend and teammate, Jerry Brown, the Dallas County sheriff's office said.

The 26-year-old Brent was convicted in January of intoxication manslaughter for the December 2012 crash that killed Jerry Brown, a Cowboys practice squad player.

He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years' probation. It was not immediately clear whether he would be required to report to a rehab facility to complete his six-month sentence, which was expected to end in July.

Regret: Brent was convicted of killing his close friend in a 2012 car crash after drinking and driving

He could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for the fiery December 2012 crash.

At Brent's January sentencing hearing, state District Judge Robert Burns scolded Brent for his actions, the Dallas Morning News reported.

'You are not the first Dallas Cowboy to kill someone with a vehicle, but I hope youâ€™re the last,' the judge said.

Brent and Brown were college teammates at the University of Illinois and roommates in Texas, where Brown was a practice squad linebacker for the Cowboys.

Brent was a defensive tackle for the Cowboys. He retired from the NFL months before his January trial, though he could attempt to be reinstated now that he has been released. It's unclear whether the NFL will suspend him before he can play again.

The night of the wreck, the two men were headed home from partying with fellow Cowboys at a nightclub when Brent lost control of his Mercedes, causing a fiery accident. Officers who arrived on scene said Brent was seen trying to pull Brown's body from the wreckage.

Police say Brent's blood-alcohol level was tested shortly after the crash at 0.18 percent, more than twice the legal limit for drivers in Texas.

At trial, prosecutors argued that the
 burly, 320-pound defensive tackle had as many as 17 drinks that night 
of the crash and was driving around 110 miles per hour.

One
 prosecutor, Heath Harris, told jurors in closing arguments: 'This is 
almost like a poster child case for intoxication manslaughter.'

He and fellow prosecutor, Jason Hermus, had urged the jury to send a message about the seriousness of Brent's crime, saying drunk-driving put the public in danger.

Brent's attorneys argued the blood tests
 used by police were faulty and that Brent could not have drank nearly 
that much. Attorney George Milner said his client was 'guilty of being 
stupid behind the wheel of a car,' not drinking beforehand.

Brent retired from the NFL last year, 
but his ties to the Cowboys were prominent at trial.

Two current 
players, Barry Church and Danny McCray, testified about hanging out with
 Brent and Brown, first playing video games, then having dinner and 
going to Privae, a Dallas nightclub.

Jurors
 saw video of Brent appearing to hold bottles of Champagne in each hand 
and credit-card receipts that showed Brent had purchased three bottles.

They
 also saw police dash cam footage of Brent losing his balance during 
field sobriety tests and occasionally stumbling over his words while 
talking to officers.

Among those in the courtroom were Stacey Jackson, Brown's mother. Jackson has publicly forgiven Brent, according to KMSP- TV.

Prosecutor Rebecca Dodds
 had emphasized Brent's 2009 drunken driving arrest in Illinois to press
 the state's argument that he deserved prison time.

In that case, he served 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge.

'Probation doesn't work for Josh Brent,' prosecutor Rebecca Dodds told the jury during closing statements in the punishment phase.

The
 sentencing comes just after weeks of fierce debate about a North Texas 
teen, Ethan Couch, who received probation for intoxication manslaughter 
after a wreck that left four people dead.

Couch's case, and the so-called 'affluenza' defense his attorneys employed, became the subject of fierce, widespread scrutiny.

Brent, a defensive tackle, had played in
 all 12 games of the 2012 NFL season before the crash. He retired in 
July. Brown was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad in the 2012 
season.
