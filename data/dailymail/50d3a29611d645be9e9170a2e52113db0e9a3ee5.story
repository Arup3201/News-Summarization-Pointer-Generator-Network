Mauricio Pochettino believes a break in European football over the next two months will see Tottenham climb into the Premier League top four.

After completing their Europa League group stage against Besiktas in Istanbul on Thursday, Pochettino’s side now face a hectic schedule of seven matches in 21 days over the festive period, starting with Sunday’s visit to Swansea.

But the Argentine boss says the travel that comes with European competition is one of the reasons behind their current mid-table position and is relieved to be back into a purely domestic fixture list for a while.

Despite this Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino believes his side are more than capable of finishing in the top four

Spurs have clocked up over 12,000 miles this season travelling to their four away Europa League matches in Limassol, Belgrade, Tripoli and Istanbul.

Pochettino said: ‘It is good that we stopped playing in the Europa League because it is very difficult to manage the games.

‘Now, I think all of our opponents in the next two or three months will maybe play in the same condition. This is important, it is very important.

‘We are very strong. I think we are going in the right way and now on Sunday we play against Swansea, a very good team, and try to get three points.’

When asked whether Spurs could challenge for the Champions League places, Pochettino said: ‘I believe that is possible because so far, so good.

‘I think that the team arrive in a very condition, physically and mentally. They are ready to compete now in this very, very busy period.

‘It is important to arrive with all the players fit and ready to compete because maybe you play now a lot of games and you need the whole squad.

‘Yes, we are very close but we need to be consistent. It is true.’

Pochettino has been boosted by the return of right-back Kyle Walker following nine months out with an abdominal injury. The England international played 76 minutes in Istanbul and is in contention to start at the Liberty Stadium.

‘It is important for us because I think he is a key player,’ said Pochettino, whose team are set to play on a Sunday for the 32nd time in the last 17 months.
