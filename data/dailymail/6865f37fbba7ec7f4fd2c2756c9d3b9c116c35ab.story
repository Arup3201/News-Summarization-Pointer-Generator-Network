His face contorted in pain, this is the end of the road for one migrant’s desperate bid to reach Britain.

The picture shows the extreme lengths young men and women living in squalid camps in the port of Calais will go to for a new life in the UK.

The migrant had managed to sneak on to a lorry after heavy traffic caused queues on the approach road to the Channel Tunnel.

When he tried to hide he accidentally wedging himself between the cargo of paper bales and the trailer wall, injuring himself in the process. Police were alerted after the lorry driver heard his cries of pain.

Meanwhile French authorities were forced to call in mediators yesterday following two days of violent clashes between rival migrant groups.

And the town’s deputy mayor raised fears of a descent into lawlessness as police lose control of the desperate gangs. Philippe Mignonet also warned the number of migrants in the small port area were expected to swell to 5,000 in the coming weeks.

Calais has been under siege for the past few days as rival ethnic groups battle each other for access to lorries at the ferry port.

Mr Mignonet claimed his town had been ‘sacrificed’ by the British and French governments and Europe.

‘There has been an increase in crime in recent months with migrants stealing phones and breaking into shops,’ he said.

‘We do not know why this is happening, but we suspect that there are people smugglers here who are causing problems in the communities. Most of the migrants are good people, but there are a few bad people who are committing crimes.’

Aid workers say up to 2,000 migrants are currently camped in Calais but Mr Mignonet predicts this could swell to 5,000 before winter sets in.

Tensions have risen in recent weeks as growing numbers of migrants are forced to compete for access to coveted sites where they try and jump onto lorries heading for Britain.

Earlier this week riot police used tear gas on 400 illegal migrants who tried to storm lorries heading for Britain in a seemingly co-ordinated attack.

And last month terrified ferry workers had to use a power hose to keep back up to 250 migrants who forced their way onto a vessel in the port.

On Tuesday a 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was killed as she crossed the Channel Tunnel approach road. Hers is the third such death in as many weeks.

Her distraught sister Gent only discovered that her younger sibling had died when she arrived in Calais yesterday.

‘I’ve been to the hospital to identify her body. My family doesn’t know she is dead,’ she said.

‘I have just arrived from Spain and was told that she was killed.’

Calais sub-prefect Denis Gaudin, has asked the Catholic Relief Services to act as a ‘mediator’ between migrant communities.

‘I believe that the use of police to ensure law enforcement is necessary, but it is also important that mediators can intervene to try to resolve conflicts,’ he said.

‘We have reminded them [the migrants] that Calais welcomed them and in return they had to behave properly.’
