Outraged families have complained after discovering that their local council had put their front gardens up for auction.

Neighbours in Canvey Island, Essex, say they only found out when a brochure arrived advertising their four gardens as a single lot to be sold for development.

The householders, one of whom says the land is the only access he has to his house, have rented the strips of land from Essex County Council for 25 years.

Now their four gardens are up for auction as one lot with a guide price of £2,000, and Mark Durant, whose front garden offers the only access to his home in Marine Parade, has the most to lose.

Mr Durant, 41, said: 'I would technically be trespassing across someone else's land to get to my own front door.

'What if the owner refused to let me access my own home? What would I do?'

Neighbour Mike Bering, 61, also of Marine Parade, said: 'Anyone could buy the land.

'Someone could just turn up, pitch up a caravan in our front garden, and I would be looking down at them from my balcony, powerless to stop them.

'They could cut down all my trees, rip up the path and what could I do about it? It's just such bad practice from the council.

Wanting reimbursement for the work they've done: Bill and Jean Graham in their Beck Road garden

The land in question lies beyond the gravel path crossing the picture, which was taken from the Becks' house

'The very least they could have done is spoken to us individually and given us the chance to buy what we feel is essentially our land.'

The residents say they have been fighting for years to purchase their gardens, but have been refused permission by the county council.

Those affected live on three separate roads, Marine Parade, Zider Pass and Beck Road.  Because the four gardens are being sold as a single lot, if one of the families decided to foot the £2,000 bill, they would also own their neighbours' gardens.

Bill Graham, 66, of Beck Road, said: 'I am absolutely disgusted this can be allowed to go ahead.

'How would I feel if I did buy it, going up to Mike and saying I've just bought your land?

'One thing's for certain: I will be 
wanting reimbursement for all the years and all the money I've spent 
making my garden look beautiful.'

Furious: Resident Angela Hart in front of the land that Essex County Council is auctioning off later this month

Mark Durant, Angela Hart, Mike Bering, and Jean and Bill Graham, left to right, say the first they knew was when the auction brochure arrived

Dave Blackwell, leader of the Canvey Independent Party, is writing to county council chief executive Joanna Killian on behalf of residents to try to stop the auction going ahead.

He said: 'The residents contacted me because they were so desperate, they didn't know what to do. In all my time in public life I have never heard of anything as ridiculous as this.'

The auction, which is being held by Lambert Smith Hampton, will take place at the Millennium Hotel, in Grosvenor Square, London on February 25.

An Essex County Council spokesman said: 'While we appreciate the residents' situation, the land concerned is Essex County Council land, and this would have been made clear when the houses were bought.

'Essex County Council, through our agents, visited all of the auction sites and where possible made contact with all those with an interest in the land.

'We have had no approaches, prior to the auction, from anyone interested in buying the land.  However the auctioneers have discussed how to bid for this land with the homeowners, as this offers a quick and cheaper opportunity for them to buy this land.'
