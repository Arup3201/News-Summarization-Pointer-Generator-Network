A 15-year-old girl who shot dead her brother, 16, suffered years of abuse, including being locked in a room for weeks at a time with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom, according to police.

In documents seen by Daily Mail Online, the girl had been sexually abused for years by an uncle. In 2011, the brother and sister were discovered having sex by their mother. 

The shooting happened on Monday at a small, white house off a dirt road in rural north Florida  while the children's parents were away for work.

The father, a truck driver, and his wife, who often goes with him, left the 16-year-old boy to watch over the 15-year-old, her 11-year-old sister and their three-year-old sister, police said. The parents left on Sunday and were due back on Tuesday.

The 15-year-old had been allegedly caught by the mother having sex with the brother in 2011 and suffered sex abuse at the hands of an uncle

The shooting at a small white house off a dirt road in rural north Florida happened on Monday while the children's parents were away for work 

The girls' mother, 33, told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved. She had recently been removed from school. 

The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police.

In the  room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the girl was stealing and talking back.

Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 

'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their report.

Police documents released on Wednesday said the girl's uncle was convicted of molesting her in 2010.  

The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time.

The 16-year-old victim was allegedly shot dead by his younger sister as he lay sleeping

According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. 

He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. 

The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. 

The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'.

The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year.

The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list.

Police documents also revealed that the children's mother discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. 

The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. 

The mother told police that she separated the siblings.

Authorities and child welfare officials investigated, but no one was charged.

Sometime on Monday, the 15-year-old girl was locked in her room by her brother, police said. After the boy fell asleep, she talked her 11-year-old sister into unlocking her door.

The older girl knew her parents kept a pistol in their room, but they had locked their door. 

So the girl went outside and used a knife to remove an air conditioner from her parents' bedroom window. 

She climbed in while her 11-year-old sister kept watch and grabbed the gun out of a pink bag and loaded it, police said.

The girl went back inside the house, telling her young siblings to hide in the closet, she told police.

She turned her head and fired at her sleeping brother in the living room, and he screamed 'Help! Help!' The victim was shot in the neck from five feet away.

She buried her head in a pillow for a while and upon returning to the living room, the girl found the three-year-old, crying and trying to wake the dead brother, according to the police report.

She then gathered belongings and some money, fleeing with her 11-year-old sister and leaving the youngest sister behind, police said.

'It's hard for us to get our arms around this act,' Columbia County Sheriff Mark Hunter said. 'This is the stuff nightmares are made of.' 

Police caught up with the girls after a friend received a 'weird phone call' from the 11-year-old girl, saying she had run away and needed someone to pick her up from a Dollar General, according to a police report.

The girls had walked four miles from their home to the store. When the woman arrived, she found the older sister there, too.

The older girl said something might have been wrong with another sibling at home. 

As she spoke, she applied makeup and 'would not maintain eye contact and appeared emotionless,' officers wrote in a police report.

The parents, pictured in court on Wednesday, have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved

She soon started crying and told the officers that her brother had beaten her and that she had shot him.

When officers arrived at the home, the three-year-old said: 'he's dead.' The brother's body was lying near the fireplace, under a blanket with his head on a pillow. The gun was found on a blanket in the hallway.

Police have not released a motive for the shooting. 

The girls are in being held in juvenile detention on suspicion of murder, and a prosecutor is trying to decide whether they will be charged as adults. The mother and 37-year-old father were charged with child neglect and failing to supervise.

The parents and daughters appeared before a judge on Wednesday morning. 

The parents' bail was set at $20,000 each and both were ordered to have no contact with their children.

The three-year-old is in the custody of child welfare officials. 

Because of the girls' ages and abuse allegations, the girls, their brother or the parents have not been named.
