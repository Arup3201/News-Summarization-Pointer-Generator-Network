This is the shocking moment a thug jumped on the head of an innocent teenage boy as he lay unconscious in the street after he happened to pass by a scuffle.

Police have released the horrifying CCTV footage of the 18-year-old being floored with a punch before being stamped up to 10 times on the back of his head and neck in Birmingham city centre.

The teenager had approached the attacker in the street after seeing witnessing him getting involved in a scuffle and suddenly found himself being brutally attacked in a savage assault which nearly cost him his sight.

His attacker is believed to be a light-skinned mixed-race male in his early 20s.

Cowardly: Sickening CCTV images showing a cowardly thug repeatedly stamping on the head of a teenager (red top) as he lay unconscious on the floor outside a bar in Birmingham city centre

The victim's vision has thankfully returned but he suffered nasty facial injuries and lost several teeth.

West Midlands Police has deemed the moving footage too shocking to release publically, but the force has issued a still image of the attack and another clearly showing the attacker.

The incident took place just before 4am on the morning of Sunday September 9 near Revolution bar in Broad Street.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Sarah McDonnell, said: 'The victim was a totally innocent party.

Attack: The victim, pictured in hospital, was repeatedly stamped upon after being punched and was unable to defend himself

'He got caught up in an incident and was understandably unhappy at being shoved to the ground.

'He approached the aggressor and was then punched to the floor and repeatedly stamped upon.

'He was lying prone, face down on the floor, and unable to defend himself - it is the most cowardly, sickening attack I’ve ever seen and I’d urge anyone who recognises the offender or any of his friends shown on CCTV to contact us.

'The attacker, who was having an 
altercation with another group moments earlier, is seen on camera 
seemingly trying to justify his actions to some of the throng of people 
who gathered at the scene before he nonchalantly slopes off.

'Many
 people witnessed the attack and I’d also ask them to come forward and 
report what they saw; they could hold important information.

'The
 offender hangs around for up to a minute after the attack, along with 
his friends; there’s a chance one may have referred to the offender by 
name and if so we’d like to know.'

The
 main aggressor is described as a light-skinned male in his late teens 
or early 20s, just over 6ft tall, skinny build with wide shoulders and a
 shaved head.

He was wearing a cap which he handed to a friend before 
the attack.

Find him: The suspected attacker is a light skinned mixed race male in his twenties. Police say they could have been looking at a murder inquiry and have appealed for information about this man

Location: The attack happened near Revolution bar in Broad Street, Birmingham and it was caught on CCTV

DC McDonnell added: 'Thankfully the victim is recovering in hospital but the severity of the attack, the repeated and furious stamping on his head, meant we could have been looking at a murder enquiry.

'We have very clear CCTV images of the offender and also the males who were with him on the night...I’d urge them to make contact with police.'
