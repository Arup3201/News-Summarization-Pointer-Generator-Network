Vanna White is fighting to save her teenage son after fears that he is being brainwashed by a monk from the Hare Krishna movement, it has been revealed today.

The 56-year-old's son Nicholas, who likes to be called Nikko, is living with a monk twice his age while both attend the University of Arizona.

The 19-year-old reportedly has been living with Hare Krishna devotee Jaycee Akinsanya, 34, in his small house in Tucson.

According to the National Enquirer, Ms White, who is worth an estimated $40million, is refusing to give her son the $1million he has demanded to build a new ashram for Hare Krishna followers.

With their distinctive saffron-colored robes, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness - or Hare Krishnas as they are commonly known - have seen a rapid growth in the movement since it started in the mid-Sixties in New York City.

The belief system is based on Indian scripture and aims to spread the practice of bhakti yoga as devotees dedicate themselves to pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna.

The community has 400 centers worldwide, 50 schools and 90 restaurants.

The popular nickname comes from the mantra they often chant in groups, which repeats:      'Hare Krishna Hare Krishna' over and over.

The four central principles of the movement are no eating of meat, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication of alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or other recreational drugs.

The TV star is said to be terrified about losing her son to the organization. The Hare Krishna movement previously has been accused of brainwashing in a lawsuit for false imprisonment, among other claims.

Sophomore student Nikko reportedly met Mr Akinsanya, who is a freshman at the same university, last year.

After Wheel Of Fortune star Vanna and her ex-husband and Nikko's father George Santo Pietro, refused to give the money, the Enquirer claims that the monk has been trying to cut his teenage housemate off from his family, advising that Nikko 'follow his own path'.

Mr Pietro is a former restaurateur who 
is believed to be worth in excess of $20million. The couple married
in December 1990 and divorced in November 2002.

A showbiz friend of Ms White told the Enquirer: 'This man is clearly targeting Nikko for his family's money.'

Akinsanya, who is originally from the war-torn West African nation of Liberia, often appears on the college campus in his tradition yellow Hare Krishna robe to encourage students to visit his meditation center. 

Akinsanya first lived in New Jersey when
he arrived in the U.S. before moving to Seattle, where the Enquirer 
claims he faced money problems in 2001.

Assuming control: Vanna White is said to be deeply concerned that her son is living with a 34-year-old Hare Krishna monk named Jaycee Akinsanya

He was allegedly evicted in King County, Washington after failing to pay rent and legal fees of around $1,500.

Nikko told the Enquirer that he did not ask his parents for $1million to build an ashram.

He added: 'The money I asked for was for my living expenses - food, gas and for living my spiritual life with Jaycee.'

Nikko's Facebook page is filled with pictures of the pair visiting a Hare Krishna temple and taking a road trip to Canada.

It is also claimed by the Enquirer that Jaycee is taking a break from his monk duties and converted his ashram - traditionally a group spiritual hermitage - into a private home for himself and Nikko.

Breaking free: Ms White's teenage son denied that he had asked his parents for money but said he needed cash to cover 'his spiritual live with Jaycee'
