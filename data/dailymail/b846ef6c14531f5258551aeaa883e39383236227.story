A daredevil sailor has had his name written into the record books - after karate chopping a dozen wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000ft.

Ernie Torres, a skydiving instructor who serves in the US Navy, combined his love of jumping from planes with his other hobby - he is a black belt in karate - to smash his way through 12 blocks on his descent back down to earth.

Ernie jumped from such a height that he had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the free fall just so that his brain was engaged enough to pull his parachute chord.

Daredevil: Ernie Torres smashed his way into the record books by karate chopping a dozen wooden blocks during a skydive

Team effort: Fellow skydivers from Team Arizona jumped with Ernie and held up the wooden blocks for him to chop

Charitable: Ernie Torres decided to break the record to raise awareness of a US charity which helps wounded servicemen and women

He completed his unusual feat in a 70 second free fall which saw him plummet 12,000 feet.

He said: 'It really was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of my life.

'As if throwing myself from an airplane and falling towards the earth at terminal velocity wasn't exciting enough, I thought I'd throw a little karate in the mix and try to smash a world record while I was at it.

'We jumped from an altitude of 16,000 feet and I would deploy my parachute at 4,000 feet, which gave me approximately 70 seconds of free fall.

Nerves of steel: Even a delay due to a technical fault with the team's plane couldn't deter Ernie, who leapt from a staggering 16,000 ft to perform his stunt

Down to earth: The intrepid blackbelt, who serves in the US Navy, had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the freefall to avoid developing hypoxia which could have stopped him pulling his parachute chord

'That may seem like forever to some but it's not very long when you're trying to break a world record.'

Ernie had to wear an oxygen mask because falling from such a height can cause hypoxia - a condition caused by lack of oxygen to the brain which can cause a person to become giddy and lack the sensible reasoning needed to pull the parachute chord.

As well as remembering to pull the chord, Ernie had to focus long enough on a team of fellow jumpers from Skydive Arizona holding the wooden boards for him to chop.

Tough task: Ernie had to fight against the force of his fall to chop the 12 wooden boards

Flying high: He is seen here smashing his way through one of the wooden boards during a 70 second freefall high above the Arizona skyline

Challenge: Ernie decided to tackle the task after watching a video of the previous record holder carrying out his stunt

Ernie added: 'The team of guys that held the board for me were amazing.

'It's the equivalent of having a team of flying Michael Jordans on the basketball court with you asking you what you want them to do.'

Virginia based Ernie decided to complete the jump after watching a video of the previous record holder, actor and mixed martial artist Jason David Frank.

Even a nerve-wracking hour long wait thanks to technical difficulties with the team's aircraft didn't deter Ernie and he completed the jump to raise awareness The Wounded Warrior Project, a charity which helps wounded US servicemen and women.

Adventure: The intrepid servicemen said that completing the jump was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of his life

Mission complete: He finally deployed his parachute 4,000 ft above the ground and safely completed the rest of the descent

He said: 'After watching the video of the current record holder, one thought came to mind, I can do better and use the publicity of something like this to raise awareness of what I thought was a well deserving cause - one that had personal meaning to me and many of the people I've served with in the Armed Forces over the years - The Wounded Warrior Project.'

Due to technical difficulties, Ernie and his team had to switch aircraft at the last minute which resulted in Ernie having to wait a long and agonising hour before take-off.

Crack team: Ernie described the team who completed the jump with him as like having a group of Michael Jordans around him on a basketball court
