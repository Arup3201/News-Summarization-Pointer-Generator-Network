Delighted: Genevieve Drinkwater was told by doctors she had less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally. But in December last year she gave birth to twins. She is pictured here with husband Robert and babies Florence and Beatrix

For many women, a thoughtful card from their son or daughter is enough to make them feel extra special on Mother's Day.

But for one woman, just being able to call herself a mother is more than enough.

Genevieve Drinkwater was told by doctors she had less than a 
one per cent chance of conceiving naturally.

But she is now celebrating her first ever Mother's Day -
as the proud mum of twins.

With her husband Robert, the couple were told by doctors that it would be practically impossible for them to conceive naturally.

They went through more than two years of tests at the Bristol Centre for Reproductive Medicine before they were stunned to discover Mrs Drinkwater was pregnant with twins.

And in December last year, babies Florence and Beatrix arrived safely.

The couple, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, had not been planning to start a family for a few years.

But doctors told them that Genevieve had polycystic ovaries and, while her husband had a good sperm count, they were told it might need a little help in moving towards her eggs.

They were told there was less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally.

Once fertility treatment had been mentioned the couple decided that they should consider starting a family earlier.

Mrs Drinkwater said: 'When you are younger you just assume that when you want a child you will have one, that you might try for a couple of months and will be pregnant.

'My husband and I said we would wait until we were 30 but then things were sped up a little bit.

'I am ever so glad that we found out because lots of people try for years and years before they realise.'

Mrs Drinkwater was given drugs that might improve her fertility, but after a year the couple decided to try a procedure called intrauterine insemination (IUI).

The procedure involved the business advisor being given hormones so they could be sure of when her egg would be released. The sperm is then prepared and inserted directly into the womb.

Happy: The couple look on adoringly at their twin babies. They have told how grateful they are to the NHS for helping them start a family

They were told that they could have 
three rounds of the treatment funded by the NHS and on the second 
attempt she became pregnant with her twin daughters.

She added: 'With the first round we had done everything to the letter. I gave up coffee didn't eat certain foods and when it didn't work it was quite disappointing.

'I started to resign myself to the fact we might not have any children and started to relax a lot more and then we heard in April.'

The couple had gone on a cruise to take a break after all the journeys back and forth to Southmead for treatment and tests and did a pregnancy test while they were away.

Mrs Drinkwater said the second round of insemination had almost been cancelled because they were not sure it would work so the news of her pregnancy was all the more special.

The first scan was carried out at six weeks and the couple spotted what looked like 'two grains of rice' but would not believe they were their twins until further into the pregnancy

After the arrival of the twins the couple sent a thank-you card to the Bristol Centre for Reproductive Medicine thanking them for their efforts and the time that consultants spent talking through their options.

'The treatment was outstanding, from the communication through to the technical procedures,' Mrs Drinkwater said.

'We are really grateful for having the NHS.'
