The Discovery Channel has confirmed that they 'will be' donating to the relief fund that they are setting up for the relatives of the Sherpa guides who died in Friday's devastating avalanche on Mount Everest that left 16 dead.

Discovery's executive vice president of communications Laurie Goldberg would not comment on the amount of money that they will be donating to the fund, only confirming to MailOnline that they would be giving money to the cause.

MailOnline previously revealed that at least five of the 16 Sherpas were working as part of the team who were on the mountain preparing for a Discovery Channel special that was due to be broadcast live on March 11 and show adventurer Joby Ogywn jumping off the mountain wearing only a wingsuit.

The special has since been cancelled and on Tuesday they announced that they will be making a documentary about the avalanche using the footage they had already gathered.

'It gives us a sense of responsibility
 because we are there and have the resources and wherewithal to tell the
 story,' Discovery president Eileen O'Neill said.

'We want to have the right tribute.'

They also announced that they would be establishing a relief fund for the relatives of the victims and encouraging viewers to donate.

They did not specify if the relatives of only the five Sherpas who were working with their crew or all 16 who died on Friday will be able to access the funds.Â 

The Nepalese government released a list of the 16 Sherpas on Friday, and at the time only 12 bodies had been found and four were still missing. That number has since increased as a total of 13 bodies have been found and the remaining three are presumed dead.

Discovery Channel was set to air the live jump on March 11 with Today Show personality Willie Geist set to host the special as it was broadcast across 224 countries simultaneously.

Organizers cancelled the jump on Sunday, ahead of calls that the Sherpa community would strike if the government would not force changes within their industry so that disability and life insurance rates were raised.

'The success rate of such an ambitious
 project that needed to have everything go right was greatly 
compromised,' Ms O'Neill told the Associated Press.

'It was a collection of issues that really gave us no choice.'

O'Neill wouldn't say how much 
Discovery had paid for the mission, which the network hoped would be a 
big ratings-grabber along the lines of Nik Wallenda's tightrope walk 
across the Grand Canyon.

Making a documentary on the disaster would allow the network to recoup some of its investment.

On Tuesday, it was confirmed that many of the Sherpas have decided not to climb Everest this season- which is generally confined to the month of May due to more favorable weather conditions.

'It is just impossible for many of us to continue climbing while there are three of our friends buried in the snow,' longtime guide Dorje Sherpa said.

'I can't imagine stepping over them.'

Government-mandated death insurance for the local guides hired to help bring adventurers and their gear up the harrowing mountain was recently raised from $4,600 to $10,400, and earlier this week the Sherpas argued that the fee should be boosted to $20,800.

The $4,600 death and accident insurance fee that had been the standard rate for years was never enough, and families regularly went into debt in order to give their loved ones a full Buddhist ceremony meant to speed up the soul's journey towards reincarnation.

That number was doubled earlier this year, but it has not addressed the continuing problems of inequality surrounding the Everest climbs: foreign groups and adventurers pay upwards of $50,000 or $60,000 to make the storied trek, but the Sherpas see very little of that money.

The Nepalese ministry of tourism gets a much larger cut, and now the Sherpas have demanded that a portion of the visa fees be set aside for a relief fund.

The government has issued 334 permits this season, up from 328 last year and it is unclear what exactly will happen to them as a result of the walk out.

After the avalanche, the government quickly said it would pay the families of each Sherpa who died 40,000 rupees, or about $415.

The Sherpas said they deserved far more - including more insurance money, more financial aid for the victims' families and new regulations that would ensure climbers' rights.

On Tuesday, the government's offer was modified to include a relief fund to help Sherpas injured in mountaineering accidents and the families of those killed, and to pay for rescue during accidents on the mountain.

The government said it would stock the fund annually with 5 per cent of its earnings from Everest climbing fees - well below the 30 percent the Sherpas are demanding.

Nepal earns some $3.5million annually in Everest climbing fees.

The insurance payout for those killed on the mountain will also be doubled to $15,620 (2 million rupees), the Ministry of Tourism said - far short of the Sherpas' demand for $20,800.
