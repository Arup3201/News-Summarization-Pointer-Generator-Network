A BRITISH family are grieving the death of a bank chief killed by Hurricane Sandy as it ripped through the Bahamas.

Father-of-two Timothy Fraser-Smith, 63, fell from the roof of his home in the exclusive gated community of Lyford Cay, just outside the capital Nassau, as he tried to fit a shutter as protection against the advancing storm.

His wife of 39 years, Hilann,  short for Hillary-Ann, 64, was  at home at the time but was unharmed, her mother Joy Smith, 92, said last night.

Some U.S. airlines are giving travelers a way out if they want to scrap their plans due to Hurricane Sandy.

JetBlue,
 US Airways and Spirit Airlines are offering waivers to customers who 
wish to reschedule their flights without paying the typical fee of up to
 $150. The offers cover passengers flying just about anywhere from Latin
 America to New Hampshire.

Most
 other airlines are monitoring the storm and plan to update passengers 
later Friday. The airlines have only canceled a handful of flights so 
far, nearly all of them in and out of Florida and the Caribbean.

Local forecaster's in Philadelphia have warned that the storm could directly hit the City of Brotherly Love and residents in South Jersey have begun stocking up on bottled water and batteries to prepare.
