Plus-size fashion is a hard market  to crack. Many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have  little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress.

And that is exactly why  Evans, who pioneered the first-ever plus-size fashion week, want to change that. 

The high street store, which falls under Sir Philip Green's Arcadia umbrella, has set up an initiative with universities to teach students how to design plus-size clothes for the brand's Cut for Evans range.

They've cracked it: Cut for Evans is a new range designed for fuller-figured women by two university students (cardigan, £45)

Evans Head of Design Rebecca Vann Reicher wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus-size. 

So, she asked students from Nottingham Trent and Kingston University to design a 6-piece collection that was fashion forward and not limited by size.

A judging panel of industry experts collectively selected a winner from each University and included: Trish Halpin (Editor at Marie Claire), Jess Spiring (Lifestyle Editor at Now Magazine), Laura Puddy (Stylist and Plus Size Columnist), and Georgina Horne (Fuller Figure, Fuller Bust Blog).

Each of the winning designs will receive a £1,000 cash prize and see their collection launched in selected Evans stores and online across the UK, US and Europe this week.

Rebecca said of the project: 'Cut is an exciting opportunity for students to learn and develop as designers and challenges what they have been taught.  

'It pushes them to create something that can be bold yet beautiful, regardless of size that empowers and delights all at once and ultimately changes attitudes about plus size and its fashion credentials.'

Eve Turley is a second year student from Kingston University studying a BA (Hons) in Fashion Design. She took inspiration from vintage fabrics to create a sophisticated yet technical collection of wearable knitwear. 

Whilst Ellie Northway, a BA (Hons) Fashion Design student at Nottingham Trent University, created a collection of vibrant kaleidoscopic prints drawn from portraits of inspirational women throughout history. 

A spokesperson for Evans, which stocks sizes 14-32, said: 'We are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry and our commitment to Cut for Evans highlights how we believe great fashion design can be aspirational and inclusive.'

So what do the plus-size industry think? Rivkie Baum, editor  SLiNK magazine, an aspirational fashion and lifestyle for women with curves, said: 'We feel that The Cut for Evans is possibly the most important and exciting collaboration of any plus-size brand at the moment. 

'As a former design student, I have been long aware and exposed to the fact that our university programs aren't preparing designers for the plus-size market, a retail industry that is currently booming. 

'The Cut for Evans is both an educational experience for design students as well as a really exciting way of breathing new life into the  industry. By inviting students to design for Evans, they are opening their eyes to designing for varying body shapes and a consumer, not just a fantasy subject.

'From the results of both the last collaboration and the new collection, they are producing some really great prints and designs that are both wearable and beautiful, showing that plus-size women don't have to shy away from print and colour.'

Cosy knits: A spokesperson for Evans, which stocks sizes 14-32, said: 'We are dedicated to changing attitudes about the plus industry' 

Fashion writer Simon Glazin said of the range: 'Plus-size fashion has thankfully come on a long way, the days of just awfully cut, boxy shapes and elasticated waist trousers are long gone. From this brilliant design project, Evans are offering plus-size women some amazing pieces that can be dressed up and down, for all occasions.

'As someone who used to be very big, I struggled to find anything that was fashion forward. I lived in black. Bigger girlfriends had the same problem. But Ellie Northway's brilliant prints put an end to all that. And who ever said knitted dresses were not for big people can think again...Eve Turley's must-have dress cleverly contours the body, drawing in the eye to the smallest part of the waist.

'Both these collections are worth investing in: having separates like these in your wardrobe means you can create multiple outfits. That red knitted longline sleeveless cardigan is the ultimate for this season!

'Well done Evans.'
