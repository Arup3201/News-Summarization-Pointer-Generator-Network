Roberto Martinez has embraced Everton’s return to Europe and made it his aim to ensure this is the start of prolonged spell on the big stage.

It is five years since Everton last played in the Europa League - they were knocked out by Sporting Lisbon in February 2010 - but, unlike some managers, Martinez is relishing the prospects of having a Thursday-Sunday schedule for the first half of the campaign.

Martinez sees European football as being crucial to the development of his squad and while he believes they face a ‘phenomenal challenge’ against Wolfsburg at Goodison Park on Thursday evening, he is confident they can handle the demands.

Reaching the knockout stages is a prime objective for Martinez but he is also looking at the bigger picture. Everton had a spell of qualifying for Europe four times in five seasons under David Moyes but, prior to that, there had only been one campaign since the 1980s.

That is why Martinez believes it is essential Everton maintain their place in the Barclays Premier League’s top six so that nights like the one that beckons against Wolfsburg are not something out of the ordinary.

‘Our fans know we are not going to stand still,’ said Martinez. ’We are trying to be successful today but having a clear target of where we want to get to. We want to be a football club that replicates the glories in the past.

‘That doesn’t just happen on the pitch there are a lot of aspects which need to come together. On the pitch and the mentality you develop we want to put the demand on being in Europe every season that is a goal.

‘It is not easy because there are another eight or nine teams in the Premier League who have the same mentality and are spending money to achieve that. The competition is there for that, but we want to get back to how it was in the 60s and 80s here in the years ahead.

‘I get satisfaction from how good we can be as a team and part of that process is how good we can be in Europe. We need Europe for us to be as good as we can be. The potential in the squad is incredible. The next step is to be facing European sides and that is what we need to progress.’

Everton captain Phil Jagielka admits he would like to three cups with the club before he retires

Phil Jagielka, Everton’s captain, has bittersweet memories of Everton’s last European campaign, as he made his return from a cruciate ligament problem in their final game against Sporting Lisbon. He has experienced highs and lows in the Europa League but he has missed being out of it.

‘I’ve just turned 32, so the number of times I’m going to get into cup competitions is drastically coming down,’ he said. ‘I’m desperate to finish as high up as we can in the Premier League and also win a cup, two cups or three cups. These are the competitions you go into.

‘You tune into the latter stages of the Europa League and you see the teams involved, why would you not want to be one of those teams? We’re desperate to do as well as we can. We put a lot of faith in the manager picking the right team. We have full confidence in him.
