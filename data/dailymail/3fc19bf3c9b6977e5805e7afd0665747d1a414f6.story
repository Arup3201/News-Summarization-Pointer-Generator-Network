There was a thrilling combination of comedy and carnage today as weird and wonderful motorless soapboxes hurtled downhill in the 'world's wackiest road race'.

Several of the 70 imaginative homemade designs were smashed to smithereens as they attempted jumps at the spectacular 'Red Bull Soapbox Race' in north London.

Competitors reaching speeds of up to 40mph on the steep slope included a loaf of bread, coffin, rugby scrum, pink stiletto, Elvis's blue suede shoe and bagpipes.

Each entrant had 20 seconds to impress 
the judges with crowd-pleasing antics before taking to the specially 
built track at Alexandra Palace in front of 20,000 noisy spectators.

First up in glorious sunshine were a team of Arriva bus company workers from Leicester in a mini replica 1960s London Routemaster red double-decker bus.

They took a cautious approach and safely negotiated all four jumps - named 'Mind the Gap', 'The Apples and Pears', 'The Wedge' and 'The Kicker'.

But the second and third teams both 
came a complete cropper on 'The Kicker' - their designs imploded on 
impact with the track after flying over the jump.

As
 their 'Dambusters' design disintegrated, the two plane's pilots from 
the third team out were sent flying into the ground and one needed 
medical attention.

Later, a VW camper van lost a wheel on one jump but careered crazily on down the track to cheers from the crowd before fatally flipping onto its side attempting The Kicker.

Dubbed the 'world's wackiest road 
race', the event has been staged over 40 times worldwide since 2000 and 
was returning to London after a nine year absence.

The eventual winners were Newcastle's 'Phya-Bird' team - Mark Wells, 35, Greg Seed, 28, Thomas Kasher, 23 and Roy Norton, 24.

Fittingly, the four motorcycle engineers' kart was designed to pay tribute to Britain's great land speed pioneers.

Mr Wells said: 'When we heard about the race we immediately decided that we had to enter.

'We
 specialise in styling, design and modelling for the motorcycle 
industry, which is where we have taken our design influence from. 'We've ended up taking this project a bit too seriously - and allowed it to take over most of our lives.'

Their prize is a tour of Red Bull's 
racing factory and a chance to show off their driving skills on a high 
performance track day.

Other weird and wonderful designs included a burrito, black cab, Apache helicopter, Beatles yellow submarine and lego car.

Ex-undertaker Russell Wynn, 53, had been hoping to leave all his rivals for dead - in a coffin-themed car.

The self-proclaimed 'Coffin Dodger', 
of Homerton, east London, said: "I initially thought of a casket design 
but I quite like the shape of coffins."

A team of women known as the 'Blonde Bimbos', from St Albans, Herts, raced in a giant, pink stiletto.But rival footwear came in the shape of Elvis Presley's blue suede shoe.

Butcher Rhys Hughes, 18, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, got behind the wheel of the car dressed as Elvis.

Toby Curslake, 22, of Wembley, north-west London, soared over the jumps in a mini black cab.

Lucy Bannerman, 22, of Putney, south-west London, sported a WPC uniform in her replica police panda car.

It
 took three weeks to make; has a steel framework with BMX bike wheels 
attached to an axle; and boasts flashing blue lights and a customised 
number plate.

The crowd of 20,000 cheered on all 70 of the soapbox teams

Carl White, 27, of Shoreditch, east London, took to the course in his Beatles-inspired yellow submarine.

A team representing Poncho8, a chain of City-based Mexican food outlets, raced in 'The Flying Burrito'.

It
 was designed to look like a giant, half-eaten burrito with chicken, 
guacamole, rice and black beans spilling out of its silver foil wrapper.

Baker Richard Sayles, 25, of Hovingham, Yorkshire, had made a giant loaf of bread that his car carried on the course.

And four helicopter engineers, from Yeovil, Somerset, created an Apache themed car.

Will
 Miller, 23, said: 'We've tried to make it look as much like an Apache 
as possible. Why would you want to build a boring helicopter?

'The fact that we get to wear a real pilot's uniform and 'fly' a helicopter is pretty awesome.'

Meanwhile, four Welshmen from Swansea dressed as Transformers robots to compete as 'The Autobots'.

And Peter Kerr, 42, of Fife, Scotland, sped down the course in a kart made to look like a set of tartan bagpipes.

He said: 'I hope we have created the fastest bagpipes in the world.'

Judging entrants for creativity and showmanship were champion mountain bike racer Gee Atherton and professional street trials rider Danny MacAskill.
