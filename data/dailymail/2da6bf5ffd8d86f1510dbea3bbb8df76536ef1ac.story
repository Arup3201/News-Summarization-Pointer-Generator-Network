World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso has told Hamilton he is the perfect man to develop the next generation of Accies starlets.

The former Rangers and AC Milan midfielder has applied for the New Douglas Park manager's job and is hoping that the wisdom garnered from a glittering career will work in his favour when the Accies directors make their decision.

Applications for the vacancy created when Alex Neil left for Norwich City close on Wednesday and Sportsmail understands the Hamilton board are keen to have a new manager in place by the middle of next week. Caretaker Martin Canning will remain in charge for Wednesday's clash at Partick Thistle and Saturday's home fixture with Inverness.

'I know a lot about Hamilton,' said the Italian. 'They have a great academy there and have already produced so many good young players.

'With the experience I have gained during my playing career, I can teach them a lot. I like working with young players.' Another Scottish connection for Gattuso is that his wife, Monica, is Glaswegian but his reasons for wanting to return to the dear green place are, he insists, purely professional.

'I will not be coming to Scotland for a holiday,' he said. 'I will work as hard as I possibly can to be successful.

'I think my style is perfectly suited to the way the game is played in the UK. I like aggressive football and for players to put pressure on the ball.

Gattuso was signed for Rangers by Walter Smith in 1997, but was moved on 15 months later 

'My agent has already spoken to the people from Hamilton and I have told him to put everything on hold until we have a response from them.

'There have been clubs from Hungary, Israel and other countries who have contacted us to offer me jobs but Hamilton is at the top of my list and I will not speak to anyone else for the next few weeks.

'I have family in Scotland but that is not the only reason I want to work there. The football is a good standard and there is a good atmosphere at the matches.

'Hamilton are also a nice club to go to. Their results this season have been impressive – especially beating Celtic at Parkhead – and they are in the top half of the table.

'Their previous manager has just been chosen by Norwich and he is younger than me so that proves it is a good job!'

The tigerish midfielder is, of course, no stranger to the Scottish game. Signed for Rangers by Walter Smith in 1997, Dick Advocaat sold him to Salernitana for £4million just 15 months later, setting in motion a career which saw him lift the Champions League twice with AC Milan.

But Gattuso, who won the 2006 World Cup with Italy, hasn't enjoyed the best of luck in his initial attempts at management. He lasted just three months in his first two jobs, as player/coach of Swiss side Sion in 2012 and as manager of Serie B club Palermo the following year.

He then spent six months with Greek Super League side OFI Crete before finally throwing in the towel just three weeks ago.

Caretaker Canning, meanwhile, has still not officially applied for Neil's job but would welcome discussions with Les Gray and his board.

Should he ultimately be overlooked by the Accies, however, Canning insists he would happily work under Italian World Cup winner Gattuso or whomever lands the post.

At 33, he feels time is on his side to finish his career as a defender before one day eventually fulfilling his dream of taking charge of a team.

'If someone else comes in as manager I'll be fine going back as a player,' said Canning, who has his B-Licence and has coached the Hamilton Under-17s since 2012.

'I always knew that could be the case. I'd like to continue playing and there will be no hard feelings on my part if another man is in charge.

'But management is something that interests me. I feel I have a decent knowledge in football and it's something I see myself doing, if not now then certainly in the future.

'I've not applied but the chairman and board will decide what way they want to go. And if they want to come and speak to me then that's great but until that happens I will continue to do what I'm doing and look to try and win games.

'The most important thing for me is the next game and right now that's Partick Thistle on Wednesday night.'

Canning believes the success of Neil, who stepped up from captain to replace manager Billy Reid, shows that promoting from within can be the right move. And should he get the job, he jokes he has already planned his first major signing.

'My playing contract is up in the summer and I haven't spoken to the club about that yet,' he smiled.

'But I still think I've got something to offer on the pitch. I feel good physically and experience-wise I think I can be a help to the younger players round about me. So if I get the job maybe I can give myself a five-year deal!

'I'm best mates with Alex Neil and it shows how you can progress from player to manager and be a success.

'A few clubs have gone that way recently in terms of promoting players from within the squad and it's certainly been successful at Hamilton.

'But you just don't know what's going to happen. Until I do, I've got a lot more to think and worry about in terms of preparing the team than worrying about things I can't influence.'
