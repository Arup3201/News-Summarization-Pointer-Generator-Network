The mother of a murdered 4-year-old boy is outraged that a YouTube user refuses to stop posting videos about her slain son.

Brendan Gonzalez disappeared when he was only 4, his father later convicted of his murder

Brendan Gonzalez was murdered by father Ivan Henk in Nebraska in 2003.

While the body was never recovered, mother Rebecca Gonzalez told KHOU she's come to accept her son's death.

'Nobody wants to be a part of a club like this,' she said. 'You always think about your children whether they’re with you
 or not.'

Then in January, YouTube user changinglittlethings posted a montage of the boy's pictures with a suggestion that he may still be alive.

Not only is there a suggestion that the boy's disappearance may be linked to a child trafficking ring, the user even speculates on his current appearance were he alive.

The video hast torn open old wounds for Gonzalez.

'If someones posting lies about your loved one, you want to fight 
it. You just can’t let it go,'  she said.

She
 has flagged the video more than 100 times and asked both the user and 
YouTube to remove the video but it has remained online.

'She needs to leave my son out of it,' she said. 'We’ve been through enough. My son’s memory deserves more than that.'

Mother Rebecca Gonzalez says she's begged both YouTube and the user to remove the video but to no avail

The user has argued that any objection to the video is simply acting on behalf of a conspiracy to hide the truth of Brendan's disappearance.

The woman, who's real name has not been released, has vowed to continue posting until she is put in jail or killed.

Gonzalez says she simple wants he boy's name and photos out of the videos.

She says she is currently seeking legal representation.

'It can happen to anybody’s child, and that’s scary,' she said. 'You can’t just use people’s images of their loved ones for sick 
twisted missions.'
