Fated: Anya Ponorovskaya and civil-rights lawyer Wylie Stecklow 'married' on a Mexican beach in 2010 in front of 100 guests

A Manhattan wife claims her husband tricked her into thinking they were married and now wants to kick her out of their $2 million apartment.

Noted fashion designer Anya Ponorovskaya and lawyer Wylie Stecklow married on a Mexico beach in 2010 and a few months later the couple bought a $1 million home in Tribeca, in New York City.

Ponorovskaya paid part of the mortgage, but Stecklow said that she shouldn't worry about her name not being on the deed because they were legally married.

However, when Ponorovskaya, 44, filed for divorce in 2013, she was stunned to learn that her marriage was possibly a sham and that her money was locked into the apartment - which Stecklow will not sell.

Now the 
couple are both living in the same apartment in War of the Roses style 
acrimony while Stecklow, 48, tries to evict his ex-wife.

'He tricked me into removing my name from the deed. He said we’re married and it doesn’t matter,' she said to The New York Post.

'I
 spent years renovating and almost drowned my own business. With the 
amount of physical labor I put into this loft, it would make me a slave 
to just walk away.'

Ponorovskaya's lawyer, Rita Warner, tried to argue in court last month that the marriage is legitimate.

Stecklow's cousin, who is an Internet minister, officiated at the Jewish-style ceremony that had a chuppah canopy and the ceremonial breaking of glass by the groom.

'He’s very, very greedy,' Ponorovskaya said about her husband's alleged trickery.

However, a Manhattan judge ruled that the Mexico marriage was not legally binding because the couple didn't even get a basic marriage license.

'The law would undoubtedly come as a surprise to all those couples who patiently wait on the long lines at the Marriage License Bureau . . . to learn that, despite the instructions they were given, a marriage license is not really a requirement for marrying after all,' the judge wrote.

Undeterred, Ponorovskaya is arguing that Stecklow was cruel in his deception and that she should at least have her investment returned.

'He used influence over me to try to gain a Tribeca apartment that is skyrocketing in value by the day,' said the owner of two high-end boutiques in New York and one in Miami to The New York Post.

Stecklow’s lawyer, Dave Thompson, said to The New York Post, 'In the absence of a marriage, the courts generally do not, and should not, get involved in the parties’ private affairs.'
