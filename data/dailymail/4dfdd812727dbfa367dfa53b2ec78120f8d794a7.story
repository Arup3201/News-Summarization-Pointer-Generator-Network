Hard work is a sacred truth in the Ruhr Valley. This sweep of Germany was famous for its coalmines, and it provided the fuel for two world wars, a cold war and eventually one of the most powerful economies in the world.

But as Germany transformed, tough, physical labour remained the central tenet of life in cities like Gelsenkirchen. Between the end of the 19th century and the 1980s, the region produced €120 billion worth of coal, and since then it has been in decline.

The evidence is easily seen in a city like Gelsenkirchen, but there remains an abiding respect for backbreaking labour – and an empathy for honest triers who toil in more sophisticated times.

Men like Stephen Quinn, Glenn Whelan and Jon Walters did not need lamps and soot-streaked faces to sync in with the culture of backbreaking labour that survives in cities like this one. Stadion Gelsenkirchen, the home of Schalke, is modern and appointed in the way one expects of a superior Bundesliga ground, but around it the city shrivels at the edges.

Mining made this entire region live, and with the steady closure of pit after pit the tradition of honest, brutal labour survived only in folk memory – until Tuesday night. There must have been tough old men who watched on during this match and recognised more in the valiant attempts of the visitors than in the complex, rapid movements of their own world champions.

There have been a number of attempts to try and connect the cities and clubs of this part of Germany with its past. During the summer, for instance, Schalke transformed the players' tunnel at their stadium. They changed the area that used to be decorated in the club colours of blue and white and instead turned it into a replica mineshaft.

Robbie Keane and Manuel Neuer led their teams through grey plastic modelled on the cold, dark tunnels which swallowed generations of German workers. It looked tacky but well meaning, and there is a virtue in reminding millionaire World Cup winners of the plain and sturdy lives many have lived.

Toni Kroos, Mario Gotze and perpetual cry-baby Thomas Muller are more used to being confronted by uncomplicated hard work when facing opponents, but few rivals can have toiled against them the way Quinn, Whelan and Walters did.

If the Germans are working through some wrinkles in getting used to life as champions of the world, they remain studies in close control and offensive movement. The Irish defenders – and 11 players were defenders here on Tuesday night – had to constantly reckon with an opponent darting into space, or a German moving the ball to a team-mate with an instant flick of his boot.

They worked tight, intricate patterns and while David Forde was not having to fling himself the length of his goal time after time, from early on it was clear the home team needed to get lucky just once; eventually, a teasing Kroos pass or a bullet run from Gotze would get free.

That it took 70 minutes for this to happen must be down to the efforts of Ireland as much as the constant prompting of the German midfield. Quinn was the pick of the Irish triers in the first half, doing his best to unsettle the regal-looking Kroos.

Whelan played deeper again, trying to fill as much space as possible in front of his central defenders as Germans swarmed around in buzzing arcs.

Walters was the closest thing to an Irish avenue of escape from their half. He started the game on the right side of five midfielders, and was targeted regularly by Forde from kick-outs. German left-back Erik Durm is said to be clumsy and is regularly criticised, but he is a big man and happily signed up for an evening of flinging himself against the Stoke forward. He was shellacked with criticism for his non-role in defending the second Polish goal on Saturday, but even aristocrats need labourers and it was he who blocked the late shot of Wes Hoolahan.

Three minutes before half time, Walters ran over to the sideline for a drink of water during an interruption to play. Roy Keane jumped up off his seat in the dugout and beckoned Walters over for some advice. After quick words Walters turned and trudged back for more labour.

He had got his brief glimpse of daylight and it was back down to the coalface then.

For a small period in the second half, maybe just five minutes, Germany looked frustrated and rushed and perhaps a little lost. The ball ricocheted between home and away midfielders and they looked no more in control of the match than the men of Martin O'Neill did.

However, Ireland appeared to be emptying themselves just to survive. Turning the game into a mess was absorbing a tremendous amount of energy, evidenced by the substation of Quinn and the injury to Whelan that saw him taken off as well.

Jeff Hendrick and Darron Gibson took their places, with O'Neill recognising the need for a cuter side to Ireland's game after going 1-0 down when introducing Hoolahan. He made the stadium shake with fright when reaching McClean's shot before Durm slid in and intercepted, but Ireland's effort was a limited one, as necessitated by resources.

The old ways are honourable but people here would have told you before 10pm on a Tuesday evening in October that they are helpless against the smartest ideas of the modern world. There are a score of background reasons why Germany should always be better than Ireland, like tradition and population and finance.

These disparities should emerge on the field, when 11 take on 11 but one team is sourced in the slickest practices money can buy and the other must rely on more basic principles.

There is a nobility to honest effort – and sometimes it can withstand the creep of the new. Old men who can just about remember when this part of Germany was rich and powerful know that now, thanks to John O'Shea.
