Andy Murray has won the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition in Abu Dhabi after Novak Djokovic withdrew from Saturday's final with a fever.

There had been uncertainty over Murray's fitness after he had complained of a sore left shoulder following his semi-final victory against Rafael Nadal on Friday.

But it was world No 1 Djokovic who was forced to pull out after coming down with a fever overnight.

Djokovic said: 'Unfortunately I am not to be able to play in the final in Abu Dhabi tonight. I’ve been sick today with a fever and I’m not fit to play.

'I said after my match last night, the crowds here have shown their love of tennis again this year and always inspire me to play my best so I am hugely disappointed not to be able to play for them tonight.

'I love being a part of this tournament and I’m really disappointed not be able to take my chance of winning the trophy here again.

'Congratulations to Andy, it’s a shame I couldn’t play him today but I’m sure we will meet again soon.'

Djokovic is scheduled to compete in both singles and doubles at the Qatar Exxonmobil Open in Doha this coming week.

Murray, meanwhile, immediately heads Down Under to represent Great Britain alongside Heather Watson in the Hopman Cup in Perth, before the Australian Open gets underway on January 19.
