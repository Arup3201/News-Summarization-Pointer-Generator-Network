It was introduced last Christmas as a special party food treat under the banner of Michelin star chef, Heston Blumenthal.

However, the ham hock and piccalilli terrine sold by Waitrose has since proved remarkably elusive.

One shopper has revealed that she has tried to order the terrine 13 times in recent months via the supermarket’s website without once seeing it arrive in her kitchen.

The ham hock and piccalilli terrine sold by Waitrose under the banner of Michelin star chef, Heston Blumenthal, has proved remarkably ellusive

Heston offered a glowing description when the terrine was launched, saying: ‘This is a chunk ham hock and smoked ham mixed with zingy piccalilli – a pork and pickly combo to really get your teeth into.’

The absence of the terrine is something of a mystery and suggests either Waitrose has been unable to keep up with demand or, more worrying for Heston, that production has been restricted because of poor demand.

The reviews on the Waitrose website and food blogs offers a distinctly mixed verdict, with some suggesting it has left a nasty taste in the mouth.

The single review on the Waitrose website from a woman who lives near Devizes in Wiltshire, appears under the heading ‘Underwhelming’. It adds: ‘Absolutely nothing special about this, nowhere near as good as my own fromage de tête (J Grigson recipe), will not buy again.’

A blog on a food lovers website offers an even grimmer description, suggesting the two slices in the pack, ‘do look alarmingly like dog food with a bit of colour added’.

It adds: ‘I peeled back the cellophane and it was like someone had just farted in my face.’

The blog concluded: ‘The texture was really good, it wasn’t over processed and had chunks of ham alongside the broken down pulled apart pork, it was a satisfying meaty mouthful.

‘Unfortunately that is where the positives end, because it didn’t taste too good. In fact it tasted just like cheap hot dog sausages.’

However, there were other positive reviews on the web, particularly the Ocado website. One five star rating described it as the ‘nicest pate we’ve had in a long time’.

Another reviewer wrote: ‘A rather coarse terrine but tasty all the same. Comes in two slices individually packaged which is extremely handy for picnics or packed lunch. Has a nice mix of flavour with a kick from the pickle.’ 

A Waitrose spokesman said: 'This is a speciality product and branches don't hold a great deal of stock - so we are sorry this has caused availability problems for this online customer. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused.'
