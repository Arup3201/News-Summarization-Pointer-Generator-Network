An Airforce general in charge of nuclear missiles was sacked because he got so drunk on a delegation to Russia that he bragged of the 'hot women' he had met, boasted of saving the world... and tried to 'fist bump' a guide during a tour of a monastery.

Maj. Gen. Michael Carey was removed as chief of the 20th Air Force Global Strike Command, based in Wyoming and responsible for 450 ballistic missiles at three bases across the country, in October.

And today it emerged he was relieved of his duties for a catalogue of misdemeanors while leading a U.S. delegation to a nuclear security training exercise in Russia in mid-July.

Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey was fired  in response to an investigation into alleged personal misbehavior

It was the second sacking in a week of a senior commander of nuclear forces.

An investigation into his behaviour said Carey was frequently rude to his Russian hosts and others, and that he associated with foreign national women whom he acknowledged were 'suspect.'

During a stopover in 
Switzerland, the report reveals, he bragged loudly about his position as 
commander of a nuclear force, saying he 'saves the world from war every 
day.'

Upon his arrival in Moscow he and an unidentified man were seen visiting a nearby hotel to meet 'two foreign national women' not to return to his Marriott hotel room until the early hours of the next day.

It meant he was 45 minutes late for in joining the delegation to the Moscow suburb of Sergiyev Posad. He blamed his lateness on jet lag, saying his body clock was out of sync.

He then drank so heavily at an official lunch that afternoon that he began talking loudly about sensitive issues including NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the civil war in Syria.

Russian diplomat were not amused. The former Soviet state earlier this year granted asylum to Snowden amid U.S. requests to extradite him home for trial. It is also an ally of the Syrian regime.

He also claimed he had 'met two hot women the night before,' and repeatedly butted in during a guided tour of a monastery.

'At
 one point, he tried to give her (the guide) a fist bump,' the report 
says, citing a witness. 'She had no idea what he was trying to do. It 
was again, very, very embarrassing.'

Established in 1944 to bolster forces fighting on the Pacific front of World War II, 20th Air Force has has a proud, if controversial, history.

Operating initially from bases in India and staging though bases in China, 20 AF conducted strategic bombardment of the Japanese Islands.

In August 1945, its 509th Composite Group conducted the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima (pictured) and Nagasaki, Japan, killing more than 200,000 Japanese citizens.

It was inactivated between 1955 and 1991, when it was incorporated into the Strategic Air Command (SAC) becoming responsible for all land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

That
 evening, at a Mexican restaurant, he even tried to perform with the 
live band - who, the report states, were not interested - before going 
to sit at another table with the women he had met.

The report also says he continually interrupted Russian toasts to make his own.

The decision to sack him was made by Lt. Gen. James Kowalski, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command.

Kowalski is in charge of all Air Force nuclear weapons, including bombers.

The second-in-command at U.S. Strategic Command, Vice Adm. 
Tim Giardina, was relieved of command amid an investigation into alleged
 gambling issues.

Strategic Command is responsible for all Air Force and Navy nuclear forces.

'It's
 unfortunate that I've had to relieve an officer who's had an otherwise 
distinctive career spanning 35 years of commendable service,' Kowalski 
said in a written statement from his headquarters at Barksdale Air Force
 Base, La.

Carey began his Air Force career in the enlisted ranks in 1978.

He was commissioned as an officer in 1983 and is a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He took command of the ICBM force, based at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo., in June 2012.
