Bill Cosby has thanked actor Ben Vereen after he showed his support for him in the midst of ongoing rape allegations against the comedian.

The Emmy-award winning star of the 1970s miniseries Roots said 'I love the man' when asked about the scandal on Thursday and added that he is 'praying for him'.

It prompted the 77-year-old to respond on social media, saying: 'I heard you, @BenVereen. Thank you for speaking with great clarity.'

Backing: Bill Cosby has thanked actor Ben Vereen after coming out in support of the comedian in the midst of ongoing rape allegations against the comedian

Support: The comedian said the star of Roots had spoken with 'great clarity' after he said people should 'pray for the those scandalizing' the 77-year-old

'Pray for Bill Cosby. Pray for the ones who are scandalizing him, more so,' 68-year-old Vereen told Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet during the New York premiere of Chris Rock's comedy Top Five.

'I love the man. I support you, Bill. We're praying for you... aren't there more important things to talk about in this world?'

Vereen added, 'I think the majority of people are praying for him.'

Vereen isn't the only celebrity to come out in support of Cosby as the accusations continue to resurface.

Singer Jill Scott defended Cosby on Twitter, saying, 'I'm respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.'

Social media: Cosby also thanked singer Jill Scott and The View's Whoopi Goldberg for their continued support as accusations against the comedian continue to resurface 

On Wednesday, Cosby responded on social media, thanking Scott and 'The View's' Whoopi Goldberg for their support.

On Thursday, Cosby's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been defaced with the word 'rapist' after mounting allegations of sexual assault.

On Thursday night, the word was scrawled three times on the star on the storied Walk of Fame - the stretch of celebrity themed sidewalk visited by millions of tourists every year.

'When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,' the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. 'The star is being cleaned up at this time.'

Photographs taken on Friday showed workers scrubbing the stone. 

The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them.

In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court. 

Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape.

He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974.

Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old.

As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving.

He also resigned from Temple University's board of trustees, which he joined in 1982. 

Cosby has denied the allegations.
