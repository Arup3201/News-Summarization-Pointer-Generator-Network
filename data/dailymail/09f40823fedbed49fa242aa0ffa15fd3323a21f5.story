A future British king met the king of basketball on Monday night.

Prince William, accompanied by his pregnant wife, Kate, was invited to go backstage with Cleveland Cavaliers' star LeBron James following the team's 110-88 win against the Brooklyn Nets.

Down in the Vaults at the Barclays Center, a basement hospitality suite, they were introduced to the athlete, who handed them a gift-wrapped box of cup cakes from his home town of Akron, Ohio.

The superstar, dubbed 'King James', also presented the couple with two Cavaliers jerseys, including a maroon one for Prince George - who remains in England - that had 'George 1' printed on it.

The other jersey - in yellow - featured the words: 'Cambridge 7'. During the pre-arranged encounter, William told James he and Kate had been impressed by their very first NBA game.

'It was good, really good. Our first time,' the Prince, who was sat directly opposite singer Beyonce and her rapper husband Jay-Z during the game, told the 6ft 8in 29-year-old star

He added: 'I went to the White House for the first time. It was quite daunting.'

Earlier in the day, the Duke of Cambridge had flown to Washington D.C. to meet with President Barack Obama and address an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank.

Meanwhile, his wife - who is nearly five months' pregnant - had been visiting disadvantaged children in Harlem, New York, who thought she was a princess from the popular Disney film, Frozen. 

During his backstage meeting with the royal couple, James asked William what size shoes he wore, to which the Prince replied, 'Half the size of yours,' while pointing at the star's huge feet.

Earlier on Monday, the athlete had told ESPN it was an honor to play for royalty. 'It's a huge honor,' he said. 'The stuff that you read about, people like them are only in books growing up.'

'To hear that they're coming to town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honor,' the athlete continued.

James had also backed protests over the death of black 43-year-old, Eric Garner, at the hands of a white police officer by wearing an 'I Can't Breathe' T shirt during his warm up.

Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving and multiple Nets players, including Kevin Garentt and Deron Williams, also wore T-shirts featuring the same slogan to demonstrate against a grand jury's decision in the case. 

Before the game, James said: 'Obviously as a society we have to do better, we have to have empathy better for one another no matter what race you are.'

However, there was no mention of the controversy when James met the royal couple, who are expecting their second child in April next year.
