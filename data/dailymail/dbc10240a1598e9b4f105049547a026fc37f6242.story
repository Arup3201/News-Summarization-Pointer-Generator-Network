A massive £35billion was wiped off the value of Britain’s biggest companies yesterday as the global economy sunk deeper into crisis.

Stock markets around the world fell as the debt storm in America blew back across the Atlantic to Europe and threatened to engulf Italy and Spain.

Panicked investors were also rattled by signs of a severe slowdown in the United States, the world’s biggest economy, as it edged closer to a double-dip recession.

'Bumpy ride': The FTSE sank to it's lowest point this year with a 132 point drop

In New York, the Dow Jones index of American stocks recovered only slightly after falling for eight straight days.

The loss of confidence on financial  
markets threatens to destroy momentum in the world economy and send 
unemployment soaring. A renewed global slump would be devastating for 
Britain and could tip the economy back into recession.

The
number of Britons who will never find work has risen by as much as half
a million as a result of damage done during the recession, leading 
economists say.

Even when the economy has recovered around two million will still be jobless.

Research
by the Institute of Economic and Social Research and the International 
Monetary Fund said unemployment has fallen in recently but is still at 
7.7 per cent, or 2.45million. The NIESR expects it to peak at 8.3 per 
cent next year.

It 
estimated that so-called structural unemployment, which remains after 
the economy recovers, has risen from 5.2 per cent before the crisis to 
6.2 per cent today.

That 
means the number of  permanently unemployed has increased from 
1.66million to 1.98million. The IMF puts the figure at 2.18 million.

In
its last forecast in May it predicted growth of 1.4% but it said today 
that weaker spending will 'hinder any meaningful recovery' this year.

NIESR today repeated its call for 'a modest loosening in fiscal policy' to improve prospects for output and employment.

The FTSE 100 index tumbled 133.88 
points to 5584.51– slashing the value of Britain’s blue chip companies 
by £35billion. It is the worst fall for nine months.

London’s index of leading shares has 
lost £75billion of value in the past four days and is down more than 500
points, or £135billion, since its 2011 high in February.

Louise Cooper, an analyst at broker 
BGC Partners in London, said: ‘Everybody is phenomenally nervous. There 
is a lot of fear out there.’

The carnage in London was mirrored in
Europe where the debt crisis sweeping the single currency bloc pushed 
Italy and Spain closer to the brink.

More than £1.2trillion has been 
erased from the value of global shares in the past week amid concern the
economic recovery is faltering.

Falls of this magnitude affect 
millions of families as well as investors because workers’ pension funds
are tied up in the stock market.

David Jones, chief market strategist 
at IG Index, said: ‘It has been an ugly day for shares. It is the now 
familiar double-whammy of sovereign debt and a stumbling recovery that 
has smashed sentiment once again.

‘It really is bounce or bust time for
markets at the moment, but it is difficult to see what the positive 
news could be that pulls stock markets back from the brink.’

A succession of crises has battered 
the global economy in recent months, from violent uprisings in the 
Middle East, to the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent threat of nuclear
meltdown in Japan.

The Eurozone debt crisis that flattened Greece, Portugal and Ireland hurtled across the Atlantic to America.

The U.S. was only saved from an 
unprecedented default by 11th-hour deal to raise the $14.3trillion debt 
ceiling on Tuesday night.

With political leaders heading away 
for their summer holidays, analysts warned the global economy faces its 
biggest crisis since the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in 
2008.

Spooked investors: Obama's deal on the U.S. debt ceiling has done nothing to instil confidence in the markets

Simon Derrick, chief currency 
strategist at BNY Mellon Global Markets in London, said: ‘It feels as if
the past few days have seen global markets reach a tipping point.’

It came as the White House insisted 
the U.S. is not in danger of a double-dip recession even though the 
services sector – which employs nearly 90 per cent of U.S. workers – had
its worst month for 17 months.

Barack Obama held an emergency 
cabinet meeting last night to discuss the economy. The President also 
admitted that wrangling over the country’s debts has caused unnecessary 
damage.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi, 74, last night tried to calm jitters that Italy was heading 
into the financial abyss, insisting the economy was ‘solid’.

European leaders  defended the single
currency bloc amid fears that Italy and Spain will follow Greece, 
Ireland and Portugal towards collapse.

European Commission president Jose 
Manuel Barros said the treatment of Spain and Italy was ‘a cause of deep
concern’ and blamed the financial markets for the crisis – rather than 
towering debts across the Eurozone.

Fading fortunes: The FTSE 100 looked like it was set for a summer of gains but is now heading for its lowest point in five months

With
more eurozone economies apparently set to follow Greece, Portugal and 
Ireland on the road to debt crisis, we ask how the euro is managing hold
its own against the pound?

Still strong: Despite the financial turmoil in the Eurozone the currency itself is holding up well

What is happening with the pound versus the euro?The
pound is currently worth 1.147euros, down from this year’s high of 
1.202euros, but above this year's low of 1.107euros. The pound was last 
worth 1.30euros in early 2008.

Why is the euro so strong?The
euro isn’t so much strong – it is just not as weak as the pound. The 
severity of the UK recession – compared to France and Germany - combined
with the shock remedies of record low interest rates and quantitative 
easing, all served to weaken the pound against both the dollar and the 
euro from 2008 onwards. The dollar has recently been kept weak by the US
debt crisis and the threat from the Federal Reserve of more 
quantitative easing.

Why do low rates and QE weaken a currency?Higher
UK interest rates mean higher returns on assets that international 
investors hold in the UK, so more money will flow into the country and 
more sterling will be bought on the global currency markets. 
Quantitative easing, by flooding the economy with more money and 
increasing the supply of sterling, devalues the price of that currency 
in terms of rival currencies.

But why has the euro-zone crisis not swung things back in sterling’s favour?With
Chancellor George Osborne unswerving in his commitment to cutting the 
UK budget deficit, you might think that the worsening problems in 
several euro-zone economies would mean the pound should be in favour 
over the euro.

But two 
things have worked against that. One, the commitment of the stronger 
euro zone economies like France and Germany to propping up the single 
currency and the ailing second-tier economies has shored up confidence 
in the euro.

More 
importantly, the European Central Bank has raised interest rates twice 
this year to 1.5 per cent, while the Bank of England has kept rates at a
rock-bottom 0.5 per cent: this has opened up an interest rate gap 
between the UK and the continent, which means investors’ money is more 
likely to drift into euros.

And the prospects for the rest of the year?More
of the same: the ECB has warned it is likely to raise rates again, 
while the outlook for UK rates is that they will not go up until next 
year.

If the euro, dollar and pound are all weak – who is strong?The
Swiss franc has been the big beneficiary as a safe haven from the 
turmoil in the US and Europe recently. And over the last year or so the 
Canadian and Australian dollars have done well.
