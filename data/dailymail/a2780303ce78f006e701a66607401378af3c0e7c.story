Barcelona have confirmed that former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu will be joining Sevilla on a season-long loan deal.

The La Liga giants have explained their reasons behind the move commenting: 'It is an operation designed to maximise his participation and optimise his progression as a player.'

Deulofeu is highly-rated by the Catalan side and is considered to be one of the most promising youngsters to recently emerge from Barcelona's 'La Masia' football academy.

Potential: Deulofeu showed signs he can become a top player in the future on loan at Everton last season

Last season the 20-year-old was loaned out to Goodison Park where he impressed despite scoring just four times in 29 appearances. 

However, new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique didn't feel that particular loan spell aided Deulofeu's development and is far more confident of him progressing on loan this time around. 

It was initially believed that Deulofeu would form part of Barcelona's attack this season but Enrique has opted to send the youngster out on loan, believing his chances of playing first-team football were minimal after the £75million signing of Luis Suarez.

Deulofeu is the second Barcelona player to be loaned out to Sevilla before the start of the new season, along with former Manchester City youngster Denis Suarez.
