Firefighters who desperately tried to save a family of six killed in a blaze which tore through their home paid a silent tribute today.

With their heads bowed scores of firefighters remembered Hanin Kua, 14, sister Basma, 13, mother Muna Elmufatish, 41, and 
little brothers Mustafa and Yehya, aged five and two who were killed when a fire
swept through their home in Neasden, north west London in the early 
hours of yesterday.

Father Bassam Kua, 51, and 16-year-old daughter Nur escaped from the 
house but remained in hospital - the Metropolitan Police today said he 
was in a stable condition while she was described as critical.

Firefighters from across the country were taking part in the UK Rescue Challenge this weekend when news of the fateful fire broke.

And on the last day of the event in London firefighters gathered to pay a silent tribute to the family.

In other tributes across London friends of two teenage girls gathered at their school today to grieve.

Tearful girls from the Crest Girl's Academy where the sisters studied paid tribute to them by leaving flowers at the school.

Bev Bell, principal teacher at Crest Academy, said: 'This is the focal point of the community.

'A lot of the girls won't know where the house was so we felt that we 
needed to open up today so they could come and grieve with their 
friends.'

Mrs Bell described Hanin and Basma as 'lovely students' who were both 'bright and intelligent'.

'One girl had just started the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and the other had just started in a debating society,' she said.

She also paid tribute to injured Nur Kua, a former student at Crest Academy.

The principal teacher said: 'Nur was in year eleven until July.

'She was very high achieving and was in the top 10 per cent of 
performance in the school. Our hopes and thoughts are with her and her 
family.'

Crest Academy will be opening as normal tomorrow but there will be an assembly at 9.50am for students to pay their respects.

A counselling service for girls traumatised by the tragedy will be offered at the school by a children's bereavement agency.

The Metropolitan Police today confirmed that post-mortem examinations 
for the six family members who died have been scheduled for tomorrow 
morning at Northwick Park mortuary.

The head teacher at the school attended by two girls killed in a house fire said she was 'shocked' by the 'terrible tragedy'.

Bev Bell, principal of Crest Girls' Academy in Neasden, north-west London, said the school would do whatever it could to help after learning of the death of students Hanin Kua, 14, and her sister Basma, 13.

She added their sister Nur, 16, who escaped from the house but remained in hospital, was also a former student at the academy.

Mrs Bell said: 'It is a terrible tragedy and the whole Academy community is absolutely devastated.'

Investigations into the cause of the fire, which was yesterday deemed 'non-suspicious', are ongoing.

Thirty firefighters were called to 
the semi-detached property in Sonia Gardens, Neasden, north-west London during the early 
hours of yesterday morning after a blaze took hold of the ground and first 
floors.

A picture posted on a Facebook tribute page identifies a young girl wearing red as the 13-year-old victim Basma.

The
family are believed to be Palestinian refugees who came to Britain 
seeking a better life. They were renting the semi-detached house.

The fire is being treated as 
unexplained, and the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade have 
begun an investigation, a police spokesman said.

Matthew Gardner, Met Police borough commander, said it was 'not being treated as suspicious'.

At a press conference this afternoon, he said officers would be making 'reassuring patrols' across the area in the coming days.

Neighbour
Mary O'Keefe, 54, told The People: 'There was a loud woosh like a gas 
canister had blown up and I heard a man shouting over and over again, 
"My wife, my wife'.

The fire ravaged both the ground and first floors of the semi-detached house in Neasden, north-west London

It is not yet known how the fire, which left six dead, started

'After that all I could hear were children crying and screaming. It was terrible.'

A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I was in my room and the window was open.

'I heard a loud bang, it was literally like an explosion, almost like a bomb.

'I thought it was really strange and 
within four minutes I heard sirens and police cars and we looked out the
window and the fire had literally reached the top within five minutes.

'We all went outside and we saw firemen looking out the window and shouting "there's people in there".'

'It was horrific, my dad says he's never seen anything like it in his whole life, honestly I was so shocked.'

Tia
Hirani, 13, said in the immediate aftermath: 'I'm not 100 per cent sure
if it was Basma in the fire but from here it looks like it was her 
house.

The fire swept through the house in the early hours of the morning

'She's one of the most caring people 
I've ever met, she helps everyone. I've known her for two years roughly,
we go to Crest Academy together. I've known her from year seven, we've had a few falling outs but that's just what friends do.'

The fire brigade said the blaze was under control by 2.50am.

An
LFB spokesman said: 'It is understood that there were six fatalities - 
it is thought that this may be three children, two teenagers and one 
adult, but we await confirmation.

'Two further people escaped from the 
house before firefighters arrived at the scene, both were injured and 
were taken to hospital by ambulance.'

An
LAS spokeswoman said that the two injured victims, a 51-year-old man 
and 16-year-old girl, were taken to Saint Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

She said: 'We were called at 12.51am 
by the LFB to reports of a fire at Sonia Gardens.

Firefighters were called during the early hours of this morning after the blaze took hold

A forensics officer and firefighters attempt to establish what caused the devastating blaze

'We sent the air 
ambulance doctor in a car, four ambulance crews and a hazardous area 
response team.

'Sadly 
four youngsters and an adult were dead at the scene.

'Our staff treated a
five-year-old boy in cardiac arrest but despite extensive efforts they 
were unable to resuscitate him.

Station manager Glen Gorman, who attended the scene, said: 'There's no doubt, this is an absolute tragedy.

'My
thoughts, and those of my colleagues at the London Fire Brigade, are 
with the friends, family and loved ones of those affected at this 
extremely sad and difficult time.

'We are now working with the police to ensure a full and thorough investigation is carried out.'

He
added: 'Crews worked extremely hard in some very, very, difficult 
conditions and were able to prevent fire spreading to adjoining 
properties and causing further injuries or even further tragedy.'
