A baby-faced teenage gang's reign of terror over a housing estate in Preston is over after they were given ASBOs banning them from meeting up, going to their usual haunts and even swearing.

The three boys and two girls brought misery to their neighbourhood with a wave of intimidation and vandalism, causing 'mayhem' and shouting abuse at foreign students living there.

The gang - Kian Lowe, 13, his cousins Charlie Blakey, 15, and Ryan Blakey, 16, and their female accomplices Chloe Scott, 15, and Toni O'Sullivan, 15, were all given strict two-year ASBOs at a court hearing yesterday.

The gang, including 13-year-old Kian Lowe (pictured), were handed ASBOs stopping them from meeting up and even banning them from swearing, marking an end to their reign of terror over a block of flats in Preston

The group blighted the local community for years with anti-social behaviour, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to student flats and forcing a local youth club to close.

The unruly teenagers boasted of their exploits on Facebook, posting pictures of themselves making gun signals and creating the word: 'Mob' out of £20 notes with a machete underneath.

In court, the youngsters, who attended with relatives, made jokes and complained about how long the four-hour hearing was taking.

Their application for a blanket ban on naming them on the grounds of 'privacy' was firmly rejected by District Judge Jane Goodwin.

Prosecutor Rachel Fung said: 'This is one of the worst cases I have seen in recent years. They caused mayhem.'

Judge Goodwin said: 'ASBOs are provided to protect the community and publicity should be expected in most cases. This group of young persons have wreaked havoc on the local community and housing estate for at least two years.

She told the baby-faced gang: 'I'm satisfied you have engaged in acts of an anti-social manner which has caused persistent alarm or distress to one or more persons not in your home. I am satisfied it is necessary to issue an ASBO on you with cause to protect people from further acts of anti-social behaviour.'

The order bans all five gang members from using foul language in public, as well as stopping them from entering eight different apartment blocks and University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) buildings where they used to meet up.

The group 'wreaked havoc' on innocent housing estate residents, a judge said, leaving people too afraid to leave their homes because of the 'frightening' youths

O'Sullivan and Ryan Blakey (pictured), as well as the other three members of their gang, are now banned from eight different blocks of flats where they used to meet

They also cannot meet each other for any reason - apart from O'Sullivan and Charlie Blakey as they are in a relationship. 

This morning Tim Saul, 48, the landlord of the flats at Bedford Court, where the gang would intimidate residents, described the damage they caused.

'Most of the people living in the flats are international students coming to the country for the first time and they've been absolutely terrified,' said Mr Saul, who spent £1,110 on CCTV cameras to help police gather evidence against the gang.

'They won't come out off their flats because they are so frightened of these youngsters. These kids were targeting the communal areas, not breaking into the apartments, but generally causing a nuisance and being very destructive.

'They are running up and kicking the doors in and we have had to get security doors that are very expensive, £1,200 to keep them out. Once inside they are damaging things, damaging the mailboxes, ripping them open and removing the mail.

'They have kicked holes in every single wall from the ground floor to the fourth floor, ripped lights off walls. They have been setting alight the carpets with cigarettes.They force open the windows and urinate in lifts. They are drinking and smoking and causing a lot of noise and leaving rubbish. It was on a daily basis but was worse at the weekends.'

Baby-faced: Lowe and the gang 'terrified' international students living in flats near the UCLAN campus

Bedford Court landlord Tim Saul, 48, described the abuse the gang would give his tenants and asked: 'Where are the parents?'

He added: 'It's just one group and together they all terrorise the neighbours.  One girl could hear them kicking holes in the walls and she feared they were going to come through into her apartment. If it continues people will no longer want to live here. 

'They swear at people. They are abusive to the international students and throw stones at them and cars. Some of it is racist to the Chinese [students]. They seem to have no respect for anyone. 

'What I want to know is where are their parents? Why are these young people out at all hours causing misery for everyone?'

Sgt Darren Carr, from Lancashire Police, said: 'These individuals have caused a catalogue of problems for local residents for over two years, despite many efforts to address their behaviour. I am delighted that the court has today taken the decision to impose five full ASBOs.

'The problems caused by this group were exasperated when a local youth club was forced to close owing to their bad behaviour, resulting in other youngsters losing out. They targeted multi-occupancy premises and thousands of pounds worth of repairs were required to replace doors to communal buildings and to fix damage caused, resulting in increased maintenance fees for residents.

'Some residents were too scared to leave their home in the evening and many international students at UCLAN felt intimated and were afraid to walk through the area.

'These ASBOs will give us the ability to closely monitor these individuals' activities and hopefully prevent many more people becoming victims. It will also give us the means to get these individuals quickly before a court for any breaches.

Sgt Carr added: 'These teenagers are now suffering the consequences of their pack mentality and anti-social behaviour.'
