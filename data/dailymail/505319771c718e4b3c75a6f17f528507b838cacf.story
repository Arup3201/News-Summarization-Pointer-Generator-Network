Today, Zimbabwe's government tried to deny that the President had tripped at all, saying said Mugabe, 90, did not fall down the steps, but 'managed to break the fall.'

Information Minister Jonathan Moyo  cited examples of leaders who have stumbled, from Jesus to George W. Bush, adding that, despite photos spreading around the globe, there was also no evidence that Mugabe had actually fallen.

'What happened is that the president tripped over a hump on the carpet on one of the steps of the dais as he was stepping down from the platform but he remarkably managed to break the fall on his own,' Information Minister Jonathan Moyo told the state-owned Herald newspaper.

'I repeat that the president managed to break the fall.'

Some Mugabe Falls memes also made fun of his staff, who allegedly asked photographers to delete images of the president when he took a tumble

Mugabe took a tumble as he walked down some steps from a podium where he had been addressing the crowd at Harare International Airport.

His supporters had gathered to welcome Mugabe back from a trip to Ethiopia - where he had been elected chairman of the 54-state African Nation.

He claimed 'no African country' had opposed Zimbabwe's elevation to lead the organisation. 

It is understood the President - who has overseen his once-prosperous nation's steep decline since starting to seize white-owned farms in 2000 - was helped up quickly by aides, before being whisked away in his waiting limousine.

Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe, 91, tripped as he came down some podium stairs at the airport

Despite clear evidence that the president did indeed fall over, the Zimbabwian government has today claimed Mugabe did not tumble

He had been addressing his adoring supporters on his return from an African Union meeting in Ethiopia, where he became the 54-nation organisation's chairman

He had been welcomed to the airport by cheering supporters, who held placards aloft - one of which said 'Your greatness resonates across Africa and beyond'.

But this is a far from widespread sentiment. 

Mugabe, who celebrates his 91st birthday on February 21, has been accused of using widespread violence to win several disputed elections, according to human rights groups.  

The country suffered hyperinflation until it abandoned its currency for the US dollar in 2009, 

However, Mugabe - who, along with his wife Grace, is on the EU blacklist - still has time to take annual vacations every January to Asia, including Singapore where he has visited specialists for check-ups on his eyes, according to Zimbabwean officials.
