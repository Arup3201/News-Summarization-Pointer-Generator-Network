An imam associated with al Qaeda ‘hid in plain sight’ at London’s notorious Finsbury Park Mosque, posing as a firebrand imam and community leader while secretly engaged in a ‘global campaign to spread terror’, a New York court heard today.

Prosecutors told how Abu Hamza, the 56-year-old former nightclub bouncer on trial in lower Manhattan, used the mosque as a base from which to try make hundreds of converts to his creed of violent jihad.

They said in their opening statements on Thursday that Hamza would send his recruits as far afield as the western United States and Afghanistan in the cause of killing non-Muslims, prosecutor Edward Kim told a courtroom in Manhattan.

Without his trademark: The court has ordered that Abu Hamza, seen here in a court sketch from Monday, could not wear his hook for security reasons but is allowed to wear a prosthetic that allows him to write and take notes

Denied: Hamza asked to give his opening statement himself but the judge ruled that he could not

‘For Abu Hamza, his cause was war and it was all-consuming,’ said prosecutor Edward Kim on the first day of testimony.

‘His goals were clear, simple and 
vicious.  All able-bodied Muslims had a duty to wage war against 
non-Muslims – a duty to kill. This duty was violent, global and 
mandatory.’

Dressed in a 
light blue smock and alternating between scribbling notes and peering 
intently through his spectacles at evidence on a computer screen in 
front of him, Hamza was a far cry in court from the fiery preacher who 
for years spouted hatred for the West and America in particular.

His
 signature hook hands had been removed for security reasons, replaced by
 a pen-holding prosthetic on his right arm that allowed him to take 
notes.

Although Judge 
Katherine Forrest denied his request to give the defense’s opening 
statement himself, Hamza replied politely to her on the sole occasion he
 was asked to speak yesterday in response to a technical question about 
his case.

Known figure: Hamza, who was arrested under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, was arrested in the UK and served a different sentence there before being extradited to the United States (pictured in 2003)

He listened quietly as the prosecution painted a damning picture of a man who did far more than simply praise terrorism.

‘Abu Hamza didn’t just talk the talk, he walked the walk,’ said Mr Kim.  

‘He was a trainer of terrorists who used the cover of religion so could hide in plain sight in London.’

The
 jury heard that when police searched the mosque’s attic they found a 
stockpile of military equipment including gas masks, knives, flak 
jackets and chemical warfare suits.

They
 were also told that Hamza, a former nightclub bouncer who was born in 
Egypt, sent two men to establish a terrorist training base in Oregon and
 another to become an al Qaeda fighter in Afghanistan.

Mr
 Kim also outlined how Hamza offered ‘crucial resources and guidance’ to
 a ‘terrifying’ 1998 kidnapping of tourists in Yemen in which four of 
them, including three British travelers, were killed.

Hiding in plain sight: The prosecution alleged that Hamza used his role as an imam at the Finsbury Park mosque to recruit jihadists that then were order to carry out missions in the northwest United States and Afghanistan (pictured in 2003)

Hamza
 not only provided a satellite phone that was used by the hostages to 
talk to negotiators but the gunmen spoke with him during the kidnapping,
 ‘seeking his direction’, the court heard.

Mr
 Kim told jurors they will hear testimony from one of the surviving 
hostages, Mary Quinn, who  visited the Finsbury Park Mosque two years 
later so she could confront Hamza.

In a recorded conversation the court will hear, Hamza told her that the kidnapping was ‘justified’, said the prosecutor.

Hamza, who was extradited to the US in 2012, denies 11 charges. If found guilty, he faces a life sentence.

Defense
 attorney Joshua Dratel said Hamza had simply been a devoted imam and 
community leader who had worked to rebuild Afghanistan after the Soviet 
invasion, but by creating schools for girls rather than supporting the 
Taliban.

He even compared 
him to Nelson Mandela and George Washington – both men, said Mr Dratel, 
who once been regarded as terrorists or rebels but who were now 
considered ‘icons’.

Hamza 
only espoused ‘outrageous’ views as imam at the mosque because he wanted
 to reach the entire Muslim community and not be regarded as a 
‘sell-out’, the court heard.

‘He’s not a follower of Osama bin Laden, he’s not a follower of anyone but the Koran,’ Mr Dratel told jurors.

‘He said a lot of harsh things. These are views not acts.’

The
 defense said MI5 and Scotland Yard had actually appealed for Hamza’s 
help in providing a ‘moderating influence’ on Britain’s Muslim community
 and ‘he had acted on that’.

‘They approached him repeatedly to help keep the situation under control,’ said Mr Dratel.

The case continues.
