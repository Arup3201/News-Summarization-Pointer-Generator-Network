Her floral teapots and polka dot aprons have been winning over middle-class mothers since she opened her first 'glorified junk shop' in London's Holland Park 20 years ago.

Having expanded to incorporate everything from pastel wallpaper to pink spotty dog collars, Cath Kidston's oh-so-British brand of flower-bedecked homeware has now succeeded in attracting an unlikely - and lucrative - new fan base.

Asian customers eager to snap up a slice of the 54-year-old's vision of domestic bliss - inspired by her own childhood in rural Hampshire - have helped to propel sales past the £100million mark for the first time.

Business is blooming: Demand from Asian consumers has helped to propel sales of Cath Kidston's distinctive brand of floral homeware past the £100million mark for the first time

The retail chain's latest annual figures reveal overseas sales have rocketed by 53 per cent - driven by demand in Asia for the British heritage encapsulated in Kidston's floral cake stands or pastel tablecloths.

Cath Kidston will add a second Shanghai store to its 30 other outlets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan later this year. There are 32 Cath Kidston stores in Japan, meaning the brand now has more overseas outlets than British stores.

But Kidston's signature style still has plenty of fans at home in the UK, where sales rose 21 per cent in spite of the tough economic climate.

Overall the firm's results for the year to March 31 indicate annual sales are up 19 per cent to £105million.

And it seems the business - controlled since 2010 by American private equity group TA Associates, who own a 60 per cent stake - has no intention of resting on its laurels now.

Yet more new stores are planned in Singapore and Indonesia - where the growing middle-class population has been identified as a potential market for Kidston's aspirational products.

China and Japan have also been earmarked by the firm for further expansion.

The firm's chief executive Kenny Wilson told The Telegraph: 'We feel confident that consumers in Asia like the brand.

'With the broad appeal of our products across the globe and the strong customer response to our brand in both the UK and Asia, we look to the future with confidence,' he added.

The continued demand for the instantly recognisable brand is evident in the sheer amount of products that have been given Kidston's retro treatment.

A scan of the retailer's website reveals how devotees can deck out not just their home but also themselves and their children in Kidston's trademark blooms and pastels.

Her signature antique rosebuds adorn everything from babyclothes and women's dresses to garden gazebos and wellingtons.

Aspirational: Today Cath Kidston sells dresses and shoes alongside kitchenware and floral cushion covers

The 54-year-old designer, who retains an estimated 20 per cent stake in the business and remains its creative director, is the niece of Charles Henry Allsopp, the 6th Baron Hindlip.

Her cousin is the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, who herself is bringing her own brand of vintage-style homeware to the masses with a range for Marks & Spencer.

Kidston worked for the interior designer Nicky Haslam before setting up her own business, after spotting potential in her homemade ironing board cover.

Modern vintage: Cath Kidston's floral tents began cropping up at the Glastonbury festival as her popularity grew

As a young designer, her idyllic childhood in the English countryside provided Cath Kidston with the inspiration she need to create what is now a global brand.

It was nostalgia for the colours, prints and fabrics of her childhood home that informed Kidston's concept of 'modern vintage' - the style she hit upon after spotting a picture in a magazine of rose wallpaper on the side of a bath.

She opened her first tiny store close to Holland Park in 1993, with a start-up budget of £15,000 - almost a third of which she ploughed into creating her first print, Rose Bouquet.

Kidston used vintage fabrics to 
produce cheerful floral ironing board covers and cushion covers which 
she sold alongside second hand furniture.

As her store grew in popularity, press attention followed, and so too did hordes of customers.

By
the late 1990s the Cath Kidston brand was expanding with more London 
stores and new prints and products, and she attracted a celebrity fan 
base. Glastonbury was first accused of having become middle-class when 
festival-goers were spotted sporting playful Cath Kidston wellies to 
tramp through the mud between stages.

After
Kidston sold the majority share in the business to fund further 
expansion, stores popped up in Bath, Brighton, Bristol, Edinburgh and 
York among others, eventually leading to a stable of 35 UK stores.

In 2006 the first Cath Kidston store opened in Tokyo, Japan, with customers queuing around the block to get in.

In
2010 TA Associates bought a majority stake and, with the help of new 
Asian partners, the retailer opened further stores in Taiwan, Korea, 
Hong Kong and Thailand.

Today
there are 59 stores and concessions in the UK and Ireland, and 54 
across Spain, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
