Supporters of the popular football film Mike Bassett: England Manager have been given the opportunity to have a speaking part in the sequel for £5,000.

Titled Mike Bassett: Interim Manager, the second instalment of the movie hit will be part funded by fans via crowd-sourcing website Kickstarter.

The joint initiative means fans who contribute financially towards the film will be rewarded with prizes in correlation to the production.

A sequel to the hit movie Mike Bassett: England Manager will be released in  2016

Ranging between a pledge of £5-£5,000 donators can receive a Mike Bassett ringtone to having their own role within the film.

Filming for the movie will begin in March 2015 with a silver screen release date expected in 2016.

Directed by Steve Barron, Ricky Tomlinson reprises his role as Bassett who has fallen on hard times after a series of ill-advised and hilarious career moves, including stints in Germany and with the Iranian national team - who have mistaken him for QPR manager Harry Redknapp.

However, when England's successful German manager gets another job just weeks before the World Cup, a desperate situation calls for Bassett to take over the reigns as interim boss.

As well as Tomlinson, Amanda Redman and Bradley Walsh are in the frame to reprise their roles as Karine Bassett and assistant manager Dave 'Doddsy' Dodds.

'It was an easy decision for me to play Mike again. Who wouldn't want to be England manager without all the stress of actually having the job?' said Tomlinson on reprising the role.

'Whenever I speak to football fans there's such affection for Bassett that it's hard to ignore the demand.

Barron echoed Tomlinson's sentiments: 'I had such a great time making the first movie, and watching Bassett become such a football icon over the years has been wonderful. With the Germans dominating football again, we brainstormed a really fun idea and it felt right to bring him back. We can't wait to get started.

'It's the passion of the fans that convinced us a Bassett return is welcome and that's why we're looking to create a film that is partially fan-funded via Kickstarter. It's innovative fundraising and enables us to create a film for football fans, made by football fans.'

'The Kickstarter element is a brilliant way of getting people involved in the film. It's a football film for football fans so it's great to recreate the same collectiveness you see on the terraces in a movie.'

Fans can have a speaking role in the film if they pledge £5000 towards helping the film being funded
