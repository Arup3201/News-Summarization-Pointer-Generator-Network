Swansea and FC Utrecht are embroiled in a bitter financial row over Michel Vorm's move to Tottenham.

The Dutch club secured a 30 per cent sell-on clause when they agreed to sell the goalkeeper to Swansea in 2011.

But FC Utrecht are still waiting for their money due to confusion over Vorm's switch to White Hart Lane.

Row: Swansea are discussing a payment they owe Utrecht after Michel Vorm's move to Tottenham

It is understood that Swansea are claiming the keeper moved to Spurs as part of the deal that saw Gylfi Sigurdsson head in the opposite direction.

FC Utrecht are insistent that they are owed a percentage of the fee for Vorm, but it is understood that Swansea are claiming there is no sell on because the shot-stopper moved as part of a makeweight in the Sigurdsson's move.

And the Dutch club has started seeking legal advice in an attempt to resolve the issue.

Vorm spent six years at FC Utrecht before his move to the Barclays Premier League for £1.5million.

And the Dutchman, who has 15 caps for Holland, has developed a reputation as one of the most reliable keepers in the country.

However, he is likely to be reserve keeper to Hugo Lloris at Tottenham next season.
