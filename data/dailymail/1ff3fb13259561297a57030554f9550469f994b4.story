The Duchess of Cambridge is of Irish descent and is distantly related to singer Chris de Burgh, the Irish have insisted.

Kate's family tree has working class and middle class connections and a link to royalty, according to genealogists at a roadshow for the BBC's Who Do You Think 
You Are? programme.

Experts traced Kate's ancestry on her 
father Michael's side back to King Edward III. In 1352 his son Lionel of Antwerp married the Countess of Ulster Elizabeth de Burgh, who the Lady in Red singer is
descended from.

'At least we'd have something to talk about over tea': Chris de Burgh was previously unaware of his link to Kate

Members of the royal family have attended the parade by 1st Battalion Irish Guards for more than 100 years

Although the Duchess's Irish heritage 
dates back to the 14th century, Tourism Ireland has deemed this link 
strong enough to feature in a campaign to attract visitors to the 
country.

The Irish Tourism 
board has yet to release its findings, but chief executive Niall Gibbons
said Kate's Irish links had been proven.

Mr de Burgh, who has sold 45 million records over a 40-year career, told 
the Daily Telegraph: 'I was unaware that there is a distant connection 
between the de Burgh family and the Middletons.

'At least that will give us something to talk about should we ever have a cup of tea together.'

The Argentinian-born singer added: 'There are probably many others also connected to both families.'

Mr
de Burgh's guess was correct, as the duchess can name film director Guy
Ritchie, actor Sir John Gielgud and authors Beatrix Potter and Arthur 
Ransome, among her distant relatives.

Mr de Burgh has military tradition in his ancestry, with his 
grandfather having been British Army General Sir Eric de Burgh, who 
became chief of general staff in India in 1939.

Last year Kate celebrated St Patrick's Day by presenting soldiers from the Irish Guard with shamrocks, as part of a royal family tradition.

The duchess was pictured this week with her husband Prince William at the wedding of Mark Tomlinson and Laura Bechtolsheimer in Switzerland.
