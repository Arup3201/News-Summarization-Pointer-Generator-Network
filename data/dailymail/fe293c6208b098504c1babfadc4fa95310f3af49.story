Ashley Williams believes Swansea are thriving with a flexible, grittier style after admitting their sleek passing game was found out last season.

Garry Monk’s side are up to fifth in the table after fighting their way to a stunning 2-1 win over Arsenal on Sunday.

In collecting five bookings they also showed a more rough and ready side than has been the norm in three attractive Premier League seasons - a performance which followed comments that came across as criticism from Roberto Martinez a week earlier when he lamented Swansea’s approach in the 0-0 draw at Everton.

But far from being concerned, Williams says the changes are born out of necessity and have been vindicated by the superb results in Garry Monk’s first campaign as permanent manager.

Williams said: ‘I think the gaffer’s plan has been to work on the defensive side for a period until he felt we got it and now are starting on the attacking side.

‘The Everton game was one where everyone understood their role. We did what we needed to do to get that point. Probably we made a conscious effort (this season) that instead of people saying, “This is Swansea, same old Swansea”, because people definitely figured out how to play against us, we tried to change it up a bit.

‘The next step is to beat the top teams. We have done really well this season. We really feel this is a season where we can make a mark and have a successful season.’ Williams added: ‘I don’t want to put a target on what we can do. We just want a good season. I’m 30, I don’t want to waste one. Last season felt like we wasted one. I loved the Europa League and I always remember it. But apart from that we were trying to stay up. That’s not what we are used to here. It is not what the club is about.

‘We have been here a number of years, we feel we have the quality and work ethic to be in the top half at least.’
