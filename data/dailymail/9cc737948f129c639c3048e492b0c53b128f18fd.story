A Mexican policeman has been fired after he was caught on camera, while on duty and in uniform, having sex with a woman.

David Raymundo Vazquez Ucan, 31, was sacked after footage of his seedy rendezvous - in broad daylight on a car bonnet by the side of a road - was uploaded online and went viral.

The video begins with an unidentified woman leaving a nearby house in Merida and walking over to the Yucatan State Police officer's squad truck.

Viral: David Raymundo Vazquez Ucan, 31, was sacked after footage of his seedy rendezvous - in broad daylight on a car bonnet by the side of a road - was uploaded online and went viral

With his colleague Benjamin Gaspar Sanchez remaining sat in the driver's seat, Vazquez walks with the female to the rear of the vehicle.

He is seen laughing and flirting with her, before he drops to his knees to perform oral sex.

Some time later he then removes his belt, including his gun holster, so she can return the favour.  

He was fired, alongside Sanchez who was reprimanded for not taking any action, on Sunday morning, reports Union Yucatan

The duo were officially dismissed on Monday after undergoing a humiliating ceremony where their entire platoon turned their back on them as they handed over their badges

The footage was filmed on October 23.
 It's unclear who was behind the camera, but many have speculated the 
officer was subjected to a sting.

The
 video was then forwarded to police headquarters, where Vanguardia 
reports Vazquez was formally identified by his vehicle's ID number of 
2037 which is clearly seen in the clip.

He was fired, alongside Sanchez who was reprimanded for not taking any action, on Sunday morning, reports Union Yucatan.

The
 duo were officially dismissed on Monday after undergoing a humiliating 
ceremony where their entire platoon turned their back on them as they 
handed over their badges.
