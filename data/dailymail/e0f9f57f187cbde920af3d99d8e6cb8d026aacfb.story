A start-up CEO revealed that women in positions of authority face sexism constantly - even in forward-thinking Silicon Valley.

In an essay for Medium, Yunha Kim described what her first year of being an executive was like, sharing the inappropriate email she received from a potential hire.

Ms Kim, the head of Locket, a  start-up app for Android, was trying to hire an engineer when she got the following response:

'Hey Yunha, I'm pretty happy with current job (sic), but if you're single I'd like to date you. Perhaps there are some unconventional ways to lure me away from my company (besides stock options) if you know what I mean ;)'

Offensive: While trying to hire one engineer, Ms Kim received this sexist response

Perhaps the most shocking part of the essay was when Ms Kim confessed how often this happens.

'The sad news is, this is one of the more professional emails.'

'The first time i got a similar type of email, I gawked at it,' she elaborated in an interview with Yahoo Shine. 'Now, I just don't take it so seriously anymore. We simply joke about it at Locket, and forget about it.'

Ms Kim says gender divisions come up all the time, and she attributes being a woman to getting more sales meetings.

'If you turn down their advances (and it gets awkward), doing deals with their companies can become difficult,' she wrote.

Above it: Ms Kim says the first time she got a sexist email it baffled her, but she no longer takes such messages seriously

A good thing too: Ms Kim also admits there are advantages to being a woman in the workplace, such as investors looking to help companies headed by other females. Some of her staff pictured working out of the office in a picture posted on Ms Kim's Facebook

However, Ms Kim admits that there are some advantages to being a woman in the start-up workplace.

She says men are more willing to help her because she's a girl,  but that it works the other way as well.

'Girls will help you because you are a "fellow female entrepreneur.' This is one of the rarely spoken benefits of a being a female CEO. Especially when you are trying to get things off the ground.

It certainly helped Ms Kim, who secured funding from a prominent female investor - former supermodel Tyra Banks.

Ms Kim's app Locket is currently available to download for free from the Android app store. 

Locket brings curated content to the lock screens on Android phones.
