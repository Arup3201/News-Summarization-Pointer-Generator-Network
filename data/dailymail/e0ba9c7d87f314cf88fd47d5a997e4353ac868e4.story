Luca Di Montezemolo's tenure as president of Ferrari would appear to be drawing to a close, despite his statements to the contrary during the course of the Italian Grand Prix.

Rumours swirled ahead of the race at Monza that after 23 years at the helm, Di Montezemolo was on his way out.

But on Saturday, standing on the steps of the Ferrari motorhome, the 67-year-old made clear he would be seeing out a three-year contract he signed in March.

Defiant: Di Montezemolo made it clear at Monza he wanted to see out his three-year contract with Ferrari

Results: Despite a strong driving line-up, Ferrari under Di Montezemolo have failed in recent years to win

Such comments, however, have earned a rebuke from Sergio Marchionne, the head of Ferrari's parent company, FIAT/Chrysler.

Marchionne's comments followed a miserable home race for Ferrari as Fernando Alonso retired whilst Kimi Raikkonen was only ninth.

Whilst Di Montezemolo has revitalised Ferrari as a car company, with the prestige manufacturer poised to announce record results soon, on track in Formula One the Maranello marque has floundered.

If Di Montezemolo is to leave, then Marchionne has suggested it will be on the basis Ferrari are without a title in F1 for six years.

Criticism: FIAT and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne has claimed that Di Montezemolo is not bulletproof

Not present at the grand prix, but speaking to reporters post-race at an event 25 miles from Monza, Marchionne said: 'The heart of Ferrari is winning in Formula One.

'I don't want to see our drivers in seventh and 12th place. To see the Reds in this state,with the best drivers, exceptional facilities, engineers who are really good, to see all that and then to consider we have not won since 2008...

'The important thing for Ferrari is not just the financial results, but also it is winning, and we have been struggling for six years.'

Marchionne has also confirmed that whilst Di Montezemolo may have put pen to paper on a new deal six months ago, he is not bulletproof.

Last time: Kimi Raikkonen lifted the Drivers' Championship in 2007, the last time Ferrari won the title

'On volume and economic results, Luca has done an outstanding job,' added Marchionne.

'We are good friends, but when I read his statements these are things I would not have said myself.

'I consider myself essential, of course, but I also know very well I am at the service of this company.

'So to create positions, illusions that one can operate outside the rules, is talking rubbish.

'It's the same for him as it is for me - we serve the company.

'When the company has a change of plan, or if there is no longer a convergence of ideas, things change.'
