A family had their Christmas stolen twice by a real-life grinch who broke into their house and stole £2,500 worth of presents.

The burglar was caught on camera as he broke into Anthony and Sarah Dixon's semi-detached house, where their three-children's presents were wrapped underneath the Christmas tree.

The Christmas criminal can be seen on CCTV coming and going six times to finish the job of ruining one households festive cheer. It also shows the thug carrying presents in a bag, leaving the property.

Grinch stole their Christmas: The Dixon family had their home broken into by a burglar who stole £2,500 worth of presents

Since the incident the Dixon family have been living separated from each other, in their respective parents homes - they have now decided to look for a new home as they are too afraid to go back to their house in Bradford, West Yorkshire, since the break-ins.

Mr Dixon, 46, first noticed that the presents belonging to Elisha, six, Kieron, five, and Bethany, nearly two, were gone when he came downstairs on Christmas Eve.

He said: 'The CCTV showed this lad breaking into our car on the drive. You can see him come and go six times.

'We had been buying presents throughout the year and our hall was like an Aladdin's Cave. All that was left was four or five gifts.

'When I realised somebody had stolen them I was gutted. We were really upset and couldn't believe it had happened.

'We went to the shops on Christmas Eve trying to pick up a few replacement presents, but the children only had a handful to open on Christmas morning.

'Fortunately their grandparents had bought lots for them, so we told them Santa had taken them there. But it ruined Christmas for us.'

Mrs Dixon and the children have been too scared to go back to the house since and have been staying with her mother.

Mr Dixon did return but was woken by what they believe to be the same intruder in the early hours of December 28.

He said: 'I heard a couple of thuds and went into the kitchen to investigate and saw a shadow outside the window.

'I saw him running away. If I could have caught him I would have walloped him, I was so annoyed. We are looking for somewhere else to live now. You just feel scared and that you are watching your back all the time. Every time a car goes by or somebody walks past you are thinking about who it is and what they want.'

Mr Dixon contacted Yorkshire Housing Association, owners of the property, about the alarm and front door lock but had been told his case was not a priority and it would take 28 days to deal with.

West Yorkshire Police confirmed they were investigating the two break-ins at the property and are studying CCTV footage of a potential suspect.

A spokesman for Yorkshire Housing said: 'Mr Dixon called us on December 24 to report a faulty alarm.

'We then booked this job in as a routine appointment. After speaking to the electrician who was assigned this job, we were advised that the part needed to fix the alarm would need to be ordered as they did not have it in stock. We then informed Mr Dixon.

'On December 29, Mr Dixon called us again to say that the door handle is also broken due to another attempted burglary and he was concerned about the safety of the property as the alarm had not been fixed too.

'We advised Mr Dixon that there are a number of properties in the area without burglar alarms and as such we can't class this as an emergency, however we have pushed this job forward and we hope to have the alarm and door handle fixed in the first week in January.'
