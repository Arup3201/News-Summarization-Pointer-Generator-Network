Scott Arfield hopes Burnley can emulate Crystal Palace and recover from a poor start to retain their place in the Premier League.

The Clarets have failed to win any of their opening nine games and have the worst record of any team in the top four flights of English football.

Last season Palace lost nine of their first 10 games but a stunning revival over the second half of the season saw them finish 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three.

Midfielder Arfield sees no reason why Burnley cannot turn their season around, saying: 'We saw that last season with the likes of Palace. We can take a lot of belief out of that and hopefully we can get that win and kick-start us.

'I don't think we've been too far away. Palace away and Sunderland at home were two in particular that we could have got the three points in each game.

'We were under no illusions how hard this season was going to be and it's just that elusive win. Hopefully we can get there. I think we've given a good account of ourselves over the duration of the games and that's the main aim.

'The mood in the camp is exactly the same as it was last year when we were winning. You want to win every game but there's a realism about that.

'On a Saturday, when you go home you reflect on the game - did you do your best? - and I think everybody in the team can say that.'

Arfield celebrates his 26th birthday on Saturday with a trip to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal.

On paper, it is another daunting challenge, but Arsenal have not won at home in the league since the opening day of the season and needed a late equaliser to draw with Hull two weeks ago.

Burnley have already drawn with Manchester United, and Arfield hopes being major underdogs can play into his side's hands.

'There are games that are not in your division,' he said.

Burnley have conceded 16 goals in their first nine league games, and have scored only five times

'There's a league within a league and then you go through certain games and think that's where you're going to pick up points. But it doesn't always happen like that and that's why you need to look at every game the same.

'When you go to Arsenal you need to stick to your game plan. We know how good they are and what quality they possess as a team and individually, but I think if we go there and stay compact and stay in the game then you never know what can happen.'

One of the best moments of Burnley's season came via the boot of Arfield, who put them 1-0 up against Chelsea in the opening game at Turf Moor.

The Blues came back to win, and it remains the only time during the campaign so far that the Clarets have been ahead in a game.

Arfield has looked one of the most likely sources for goal-shy Burnley, always willing to have a long-range shot with his powerful right foot, and he is desperate to add to his tally.

'It's one of the aspects that I'm dying to do,' he said.

'Last season I got nine and I was off this season in the first game. If the penalty goes in at Palace, I'd have been up to two already.

'You get fewer chances than you do in the Championship and when you get them you need to put them away. I think we've been a bit naive at times in front of goal.'
