Julian Savea will aim to continue his astonishing scoring streak against England at Twickenham on Saturday, having been feted as ‘better’ than Jonah Lomu — his childhood idol.

Last month, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen suggested that his team’s supreme finisher had become a more deadly threat than Lomu, who terrorised England at the 1995 World Cup. Savea has certainly demonstrated a greater scoring knack, having touched down 29 times in 30 Tests.

He is on course to be the most predatory accumulator of tries in the history of the international game — eclipsing Lomu and other Kiwi icons such as Doug Howlett and Christian Cullen.

And while the Wellington wing known as the ‘Bus’ has caused havoc against all-comers, he has been especially prolific whenever he has had the Red Rose in his sights; striking eight times in just four matches.

Hansen’s tribute to his demolition man in the No 11 shirt was emphatic. ‘I think he’s probably better than Lomu,’ he said during the recent Rugby Championship.

‘He can do more things than Jonah. Jonah was a great player, but I think Julian has got more to his game and that’s saying something. I genuinely believe that. He’s very good going back, under the high ball, with the ball on the ground, as well as being a greater carrier.’

Savea was reminded on Tuesday of being placed on a higher pedestal than his iconic hero and he found it difficult to come to terms with such heady praise.

Lomu and Savea are similar in stature and the younger has drawn many comparisons to his idol

‘For Steve to compare me to Lomu and say I am better was an honour and a privilege,’ he said. ‘But for me, no-one’s better than Jonah.

‘He was my idol growing up. I even had his haircut! I fell asleep at the barbers and the guy shaved it off. I was pretty upset. Lomu changed the game back in his era and inspired a lot of kids, so to me no-one is ever going to be better. He was one in a million.’

Savea is 24, and was only four when Lomu created one of the game’s enduring images as he trampled Tony Underwood and Mike Catt under foot on his way to scoring against England. His stunning performance in that 1995 World Cup semi-final led the then England captain, Will Carling, to label him a ‘freak’. Asked if he recalled the game, Savea smiled and said: ‘I remember that!’

Savea is 13kg lighter than Lomu in his prime, but is creating similar mayhem among opposition defences as the great man once did, and he is crossing the line more often, too. Asked if he hoped to surpass Howlett’s national try record of 49 in 62 Tests, he admitted: ‘It would be pretty special to get there.’

His latest telling contribution against England was a first-half hat-trick as the All Blacks thrashed the tourists in Hamilton in June, but the executioner-in-chief is utterly modest in assessing his own devastating work. ‘I try to bring a lot of excitement,’ he said.

‘I try to execute as much as I can. The boys inside me come up with their offloads and skill execution, and I’m just happy to finish them off. It just happens to be against England.’

Such is Savea’s desire to emphasise the collective contribution to his solo feats, it is more instructive to listen to others talking about him. New Zealand No 8 Kieran Read — the current IRB world Player of the Year, offered a strong endorsement of his electric team-mate. 

‘The majority of his tries are looking after a team effort and him finishing them off, but he is probably the best winger in the world at the moment. We just have to give him a bit of space. It’s my job and our job to give him the ball in as much space as we can and let him do his thing.’

The hosts certainly know all about his potency. ‘He’s very powerful first and foremost,’ said Owen Farrell yesterday.

‘One on one you have to be able to put your head down and get stuck in. He constantly holds really good width and the players inside him can get the ball to him. He’s a brilliant finisher, but he’s got that power as well.’

As a finisher, Savea is on course to trump his idol and be the greatest there has ever been. No matter how well they prepare, England will struggle to contain him.
