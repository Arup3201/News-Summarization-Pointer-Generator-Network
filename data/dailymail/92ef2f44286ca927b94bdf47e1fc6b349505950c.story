Police are investigating a break in at the home of Texans linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, who says that someone took his three Super Bowl rings he won as a player.

Vrabel tweeted Saturday about the break in at his home in the Houston enclave of Bellaire.

'To all the Houston area pawn shops: 3 super bowl rings are headed your way. Courtesy of the (expletive) who smashed our back door in,' Vrabel tweeted

Good sport: Mike Vrabel is a former New England Patriots linebacker and is currently a linebackers coach for the Houston Texans. Vrabel won three Super Bowl titles with the Patriots during their dominance of the NFL

Stolen: The former linebacker allowed his words to show just how upset he was after his home was broken into and his possessions were taken

According to a tweet sent out by Vrabel,  burglars smashed in the back door of his Houston home and made out with the rings. 

He doesn't mention if anything else was taken.

While Vrabel's anger is certainly justified, the good news is it doesn't appear as if anyone was harmed during the incident.

Vrabel's wife also took to Twitter to express her anger. 

Vrabel, in his first season as a coach with the Texans, won the rings when he played for the New England Patriots in the 2001-02, 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons.

Bellaire police said the break in occurred at around 11 a.m. Saturday. No arrests have been made in the case.

Upset: Vrabel tweeted out on Saturday that those prized possessions of his were taken from his Houston home

The incident took place less than a week after the Patriots honored the 22 members of all three of the team’s Super Bowl championship teams, from the 2001, 2003, and 2004 seasons, although Vrabel did not attend the ceremony at halftime of last Sunday’s Patriots-Broncos game in Foxborough. 

A third-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1997, the linebacker played 14 seasons in the NFL for the Steelers, Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. 

He is currently in his first season as a linebackers coach with the Houston Texans after spending three years as an assistant at his alma mater Ohio State.

History: Mike Vrabel played eight seasons with the Patriots, and won three Super Bowls with the team
