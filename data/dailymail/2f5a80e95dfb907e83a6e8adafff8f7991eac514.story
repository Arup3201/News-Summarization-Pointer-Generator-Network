These incredible pictures show the Milky Way and impressive star trails around some of the UK's most scenic locations.

From Stonehenge, St Michael's Mount in Cornwall and Southampton's Netley Abbey, these magical images show the night-sky looking picture perfect.

Photographer David Sharp spent countless hours observing the night skies and patiently waiting for the right shots.

He dedicates much of his spare time to researching the Milky Way galaxy in order to give himself the best opportunity to see it.

His favourite locations to take astronomy pictures are on the south coast as the conditions tend to be better.

Mr Sharp has enjoyed taking pictures of the Milky Way above Stonehenge, Wiltshire, because of its ancient astronomy links.

The IT project manager, who regards photography as a hobby, spends up to four hours into the early hours of the morning taking pictures of the sky.

He says there is a very narrow window available to get shots of the Milky Way so he was pleased to capture them.

Mr Sharp , 50, from Portsmouth, said: 'In the UK the Milky Way can only be seen in summer, between May and August.

'The optimum time frame to shoot it is between 12.30am and 02.30am, before it gets too light.

'And even then you can only really see it in the dark moon phase - a week either side of a full moon.

'What's more, the skies have to be crystal clear to allow for good shots - which all makes for a very narrow window of opportunity.

'It's a very spectacular sight, especially when you see it with the naked eye - and I like the challenge of seeing it in the UK.

'The best location for me has to be at St Michael's Mount, but it was nice to get some at Stonehenge too with it's historic link to astronomy.'

He also created a selection of star trails - made by collating hours of photographs to show the apparent motion of stars.

Mr Sharp added: 'My star trail photos tend to be the result of about four hours of photography and what you're seeing is the Earth's rotation.

'Normally I will finish up shooting at about 1am.

'Astronomy photography takes dedication and a lot of research beforehand, and luck comes into play too.'

Mr Sharp's shot of the Milky Way above Stonehenge is one he believes may not be possible in the future due to the closure of the adjacent A344 road.

He said: 'I believe the opportunity for photos like I took may now be gone forever as there will be no access to that viewpoint.'
