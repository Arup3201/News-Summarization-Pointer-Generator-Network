President Obama had his hands full at the White House on Friday, as he bounced babies at a Father's Day luncheon and basketballs as he praised the Indiana Fever team on their first ever WNBA win.

Children were at the heart of both events, with members of the Becoming a Man program joining the father's day lunch, and the Fever team running a basketball clinic for youngsters on the South Lawn.

However, one young guest looked distinctly underwhelmed by his encounter with the President.Â

President Obama, who has two daughters, cradled the baby as he dropped in on a Father's Day Lunch at the White House.

While the baby's father looked delighted at his son's big moment with the Commander in Chief, the little boy seemed unfazed by the fuss.

The President told the specially selected gathering at the luncheon that being a father is the best job he's got.

He also had fatherly words of encouragement for the winners of the WNBA, who turned around their fortunes in the final to go from underdog to champions at the end of last year.

'While our towns have a friendly 
rivalry 
going on, I still recognize those Midwestern values when I see them. We 
saw it in the Indiana Fever, which is, you look out for your teammates. 
You kept fighting, no matter what gets thrown at you,' President Obama 
said, as he bounced a basketball effortlessly while giving his speech.

The President also praised the team for being such good role models to young athletes, including his daughter Sasha's team, which he sometimes coaches, Fox Sports reported.

'For her to have wonderful role models like this, who work hard and know how to play like a team, are incredibly poised, are competitors but also show good sportsmanship, that's the kind of models you want for your children,' he said.

After meeting the President, the team, who take part in several charity projects such as helping children read, held a basketball clinic on the South Lawn for youngsters in Washington DC.

At the Father's Day luncheon, President Obama had a message closer to home, telling the guests Sunday's celebration was the perfect time for fathers to remember how lucky 
they are.

Fathers and their children, along with 
students and leaders from the Becoming a Man program at Chicago's Hyde 
Park Academy were among those treated to burgers, fries and lemonade in 
the State Dining Room. President Obama spoke at the school in February.

His chief of staff, several economic advisers and his legislative affairs director sat with guests during the lunch.

Father's Day is Sunday. Obama leaves 
that night on a three-day trip to Northern Ireland and Germany, giving 
him a bit of time to enjoy the celebration with daughters Malia, 14, and Sasha,12.
