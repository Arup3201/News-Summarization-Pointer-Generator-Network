A nine-year-old girl who was hit by a plane as it crashed on a Florida beach on Sunday has passed away two days after her father was killed in the same accident.

Oceana Irizarry, from Fort Stewart, Georgia, was with her father, Ommy Irizarry, on Caspersen Beach in Venice when a 1972 Piper Cherokee plane made an emergency 
landing after reporting problems.

The duo were hit by the plane or debris and Mr Irizarry, an Army sergeant celebrating his ninth anniversary with his wife, died at the scene on Sunday afternoon.

Oceana was airlifted to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg but on Tuesday, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said they were notified by the medical examiner's office that the little girl had died.

Loss: The dad and daughter were walking along the beach when they were hit by the plane or debris

It was unclear how the plane or the debris hit the father and his daughter.

Just hours before, Mr Irizarry had posted a message on Facebook to mark his ninth anniversary.

'I
 am very happy and can't wait to see what the next 100 have in store for
 us,' he wrote, and tagged his wife, Rebecca, in the post.

But as he walked on the beach with Oceana, officials say a plane pilot radioed the airport that he was having trouble with his aircraft and was planning to land on the beach.

'He's trying to make the airport,' a woman calling 911 from the airport said. 'He says he's not going to make the airport. But he's going to be on the beach.'

The 1972 Piper Cherokee lost a wheel,
 damaged a wing and smashed its propeller shortly after making a 
distress call about 2:45 p.m. Sunday to Venice Municipal Airport, 
officials said.

The plane crash-landed on Caspersen Beach, just south of the airport, at the southern tip of the island of Venice and the plane or debris hit the father and daughter.

In other 911 calls, a family friend cried as she described the scene while screams and wailing could be heard in the background. Another man told a dispatcher about the little girl's condition.

'She's breathing a little right now,' a man said. 'Rapid pulse and difficult breathing. She's unconscious.'

The proud dad-of-three was an Army sergeant stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia, according to
 officials, and Howard said the family was scheduled to be stationed in 
Alaska.

The couple's Facebook pages were filled with photos of the family enjoying beaches in Georgia and in Ommy's native Puerto Rico.

Runway: The pilot indicated to air traffic controllers that he was going to use the hard sand bank on Caspersen Beach as a runway to land

Rebecca's
 page showed a photo of her and her husband in the water, smiling for 
the camera, while they vacationed in Florida with their family - before 
other posts asking for prayers.

Family friend Kim Howard described Irizarry as 'a great, hands-on father' to three children.

The pilot of the doomed plane was 
identified as Karl Kokomoor, 57, and the passenger was David Theen, 60, 
both of nearby Englewood. They were not injured.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
