And James Jnr did just that as he dictated play during a match against a rival side in the competition.

In fact, NBA superstar James - who sealed a move back to Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 - has revealed his son has already received offers to join several colleges.

The 30-year-old, speaking to CBS, said: 'He’s already got some offers from colleges, it’s pretty crazy.

'It should be a violation, you shouldn’t be recruiting 10-year-old kids.'

King James' side, who are currently fourth in the Eastern Conference standings, face Golden State Warriors at the Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday.
