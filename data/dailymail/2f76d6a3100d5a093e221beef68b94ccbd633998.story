She's famous for her poise but even Queen Letizia, 42, couldn't help taking a step back when confronted with an angry-looking bull during a visit to a farm show.

And the enormous beast wasn't the only one to leave her with ruffled feathers. An Andalusian horse that shied while being gingerly petted by the royal also had her reeling back to safety.

By contrast, husband King Felipe, 46, appeared to take a shine to the horse although even he looked a little on the nervous side while holding the bull's lead rope.

Not a fan: Letizia jerks back in alarm after the Andalusian horse she was petting shied and tossed its head

Happily, the 6ft 5" monarch soon had beasts of a smaller size to contend with and was spotted towering over a flock of sheep while enjoying a chat with their owner.

Letizia, meanwhile, went outside to meet the crowds waiting outside the venue in Zafra, a town in Spain's southern Extremadura region, where she was soon busy with selfies.

She also had a close encounter of an altogether more amenable kind, when she plucked a young well-wisher out of her mother's arms for a cuddle - much to the family's delight.

The trip to the International Cattle Fair in Zafra was a far cry from yesterday's business, which saw the Spanish royal couple welcome President Juan Orlando Hernández of the Honduras and his wife to Spain.

Honduras' presidential couple were welcomed at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid as they began a state visit to Spain with a formal reception.

Letizia, who opted for a businesslike grey suit and white shirt for today's visit, was glamorous in a cerise Felipe Varela dress for the event.

King Felipe, meanwhile, was dapper in a navy suit with a pink tie that matched his wife's ensemble - a trick he repeated in Zafra with a suit that came in an identical shade of grey to Letizia's.

The Spanish royals have had a busy schedule to contend with of late, with a visit to New York last week followed by a series of engagements at home in Spain. 

Earlier this week, the couple enjoyed a rapturous reception as they arrived at the Castilla-La Mancha University in Toledo ahead of a reception with academics.

It isn't the first time the couple have spent time with academics in recent weeks, with a visit to meet Spanish intellectuals working in New York included in their American trip at the end of last month.

The visit, which saw Letizia reunited with her old friend Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, saw King Felipe make a speech at the UN in which he called for Spain to be given a temporary seat on the UN Security Council.
