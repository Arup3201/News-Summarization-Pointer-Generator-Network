Appeal: Kester David, whose badly burnt body was found, behind a Travis Perkins building in Bloomfield Lane, Palmers Green, London on July 7, 2010

The 80-year-old mother of a man burned to death four years ago is pleading for witnesses to help unravel the mystery surrounding her son's death.

Kester David, 53, a bus driver, was found badly burned beneath a railway arch in Palmers Green, North London, in July 2010, but the circumstances of his death have never been explained.

The Metropolitan Police initially insisted he took his own life but, after an inquiry revealed a 'catalogue of errors' in the investigation, his family accused its officers of failing to fulfil their duties because he was black.

Now Mr David's mother, who has asked not to be named, is imploring anyone who knows anything about her son's death to come forward to help the investigation.

'When the detectives informed me that the burnt body of a bus driver had been found, the one thing I hoped in my heart was that he was already dead when he was set alight,' she said.

'No mother should have to bury their child under such horrifying circumstances.

'I appeal to anyone out there who may have heard his cry for help or seen anything unusual on the night of 6-7 July 2010 to come forward however small the information.

'I am sure a third party was involved and they must be stopped from doing this again.'

Mr David worked part-time for Arriva from their Wood Green depot, and was also a DJ, using the stage name DJ Bain.

He worked for an internet radio station in Stoke Newington called Lynx Radio for a short time before he died.

The fitness enthusiast, who was killed by burns and inhalation of fumes, was found under a railway arch at Broomfield Lane in Enfield that can only be reached by climbing over a metal fence.

CCTV from a nearby Travis Perkins yard captured a bright light coming from under the arches in the early hours of the morning before Mr David was found, and witnesses heard screams at that time.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, said: 'Kester was a hard working, well-respected individual in his local community and I am committed to finding out why he died.

'Despite continued efforts to identify the circumstances surrounding Kester's death, it remains unexplained and we appeal to anyone who can assist with information to come forward.

'Kester's mother is now 80 years of age and one can only imagine the agony she has endured since July 2010 not knowing why her son died.'

His family have been fiercely critical of the initial bungled inquiry into his death, and have accused Scotland Yard of racism.

A report into the way officers handled the investigation found that they missed CCTV footage which has since been lost, botched DNA analysis and failed to secure crucial mobile phone data.

Two witnesses who came forward the day after Mr David's death were not interviewed for more than a year. One of them said they heard screams of fear. Another said he saw a van near to the scene and two white men, an unusual sight in the area at 4.20am.

Detectives, who are issuing an appeal for information tonight on BBC's Crimewatch, are trying to trace Mr David's movements in the days up to his death on July 7 2010.

They are looking for a unidentified man who answered Mr David's mobile phone on July 5. The Blackberry Curve was also used after he died, on July 14, 15 and 22, but has never been found.

Two weeks after his death, a woman called Sharon emailed police to claim that she knew who had killed him, but officers have never found her.
