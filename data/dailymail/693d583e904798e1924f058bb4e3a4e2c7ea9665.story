NFL linebacker Russell Allen is to retire from professional football at the age of 27 after suffering a concussion and stroke during a game in December.

Allen, who lives in San Diego with his wife and two-year-old son, had been playing for Jacksonville Jaguars when he got knocked during a game against the Buffalo Bills.

The footballer wasn't knocked unconscious, but he had blurred vision for the rest of the game and a pounding headache the following morning.

Game over: A head injury has forced Russell Allen to retire from the Jacksonville Jaguars

Allen has what he described as a dead spot, no bigger than a dime, on his cerebellum which controls motor movement and coordination.

The Jaguars released Allen last week after his personal physician consulted with the team's medical staff before a scheduled physical.

The Jaguars declined to comment on Tuesday, citing medical privacy laws. Allen did not immediately return a message left on his cellphone.

'I told my story so athletes understand you can't ignore head injuries,' Allen posted on his Twitter page today.

'If you're not sure you have one, then you do. Report it immediately,' he warned.

In the months after Allen's initial stroke diagnosis, he saw three neurosurgeons. The last one advised him to quit playing football.

Allen told MMQB he has struggled to pick up and grip objects - doctors believe this will subside in time - and will be on blood-thinning medication for the rest of his life.

The footballer hopes others will learn from his experience.

'Guys talk about it all the time, "I'm all right; I just got my bell rung",' he said.

'I've had, maybe 10 times in my career, when for a second I felt woozy after a hit. And what I've learned from this is that it's not something to be overlooked.

'If it feels like something's wrong, something's wrong. I want someone to know my experience, so they can know when they experience something similar.'

Allen sustained the concussion and stroke in Week 15 against the Buffalo Bills, after running into the team's center, Eric Wood, several yards downfield.

'It was strange because it was so routine,' Allen said. 'We hit, I got off the block, no big deal. I felt something flash - like they say when you get your bell rung.

'I didn't lose consciousness. I walked back to the huddle and finished the drive.'

Later in the game, though, Allen began having double vision on the sideline. He did not notify team trainers, instead asking teammate Paul Posluszny if his eye was OK.

Allen had a headache after the game and again when he woke up the next day, which prompted him to tell the team.

The Jaguars ordered a MRI and sent Allen home. That Tuesday, the Jags told Allen to meet a team physician at the emergency room. Allen was told he had suffered a stroke and had tests for three days at the hospital.

Wood responded to Allen's retirement through Twitter, saying: 'Pretty sobering reading on ESPN bottom line that a collision I had with a LB for the Jags gave him a stroke and career over.'
