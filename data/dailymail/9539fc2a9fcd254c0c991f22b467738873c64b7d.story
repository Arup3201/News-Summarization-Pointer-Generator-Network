A professor's son who attacked his roommate with an axe while he slept before dismembering and eating his heart and parts of his brain today pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible.

Former Morgan State student, Alexander Kinyua, 22, entered the plea for the first-degree murder of Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, whose body parts were discovered four days after he vanished last year.

Agyei-Kodie, 37, had recently moved from Ghana and was staying with Kinyua's family in Joppatown, a suburb of Baltimore when he was attacked.

Kinyua spoke softly as he responded to questions from the judge in Bel Air, Maryland on Monday, saying he had agreed to the plea and that medications he had been taking were helping him.

Judge Stephen Waldron said he had concerns about agreeing to the plea, but had to accept determinations by psychiatrists for the defense and prosecution that Kinyua could not be held criminally responsible. He expressed condolences to family and friends of the Agyei-Kodie.

'My heart breaks for you,' Waldron said. 'I am very, very sorry.'

Kinyua, whose father is a physics professor at Morgan State, has been held at the state's maximum-security psychiatric hospital and returned there after the hearing. It is likely he will remain there for the rest of his life.

Percess Veronica Mattison, a longtime family friend who knew Agyei-Kodie, revealed how devastated the victim's family are as she spoke to the court.

'We all could see him soaring to great heights in the world. This was not to be,' Mattison said. 'He was slaughtered in the most brutal, inhumane fashion by Alexander Kinyua. This is an irreplaceable loss accompanied by much pain.'

She also noted that Kinyua carefully tried to conceal evidence.

'Someone acting with such care to conceal evidence, and demonstrating the capacity to cover his tracks so competently does not appear to be experiencing a mental deficiency,' Mattison said.

'Alexander did not impulsively commit the crime, he prepared Kujoe for consumption.'

Harford County State's Attorney Joseph Cassilly told reporters after the hearing he had concerns about the planning before and after the crime.

'But we went out and consulted with another psychiatrist that we'd used in other cases, had him review this evidence, and we really had no evidence, no testimony or opinion from other medical personnel that would dispute the findings of the doctors at Clifton Perkins that he was not criminally responsible at the time he committed the crime,' Cassilly said.

Kinyua, a U.S. citizen originally from Kenya, told detectives that he killed Agyei-Kodie with an axe while he was sleeping.

He also said he dismembered the body, consuming his heart, hiding his head and hands at the home and placing the remaining body parts in a trash bin in a nearby church parking lot.

Agyei-Kodie, a native of Ghana, had been staying with the Kinyua family for about six weeks at their townhouse in a Baltimore suburb when he disappeared in May 2012.

His father 
alerted a detective to his son, saying that his other son Jarrod 
discovered what appeared to be a human head and hands in two metal tins 
above the washing machine.

Horrified, Jarrod Kinyua brought his 
father down to the basement where Antony said he saw Alexander Kinyu 
cleaning out the containers.

Kinyua then directed police to Towne Baptist Church on Trimble Road, where they said they found the rest of Agyei-Kodieâ€™s remains.

Authorities say Kinyua ranted about 'human sacrifices' and ethnic cleansing on Facebook before the slaying.

In a separate case, Kinyua pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible in a baseball bat attack at Morgan State days before the killing of Agyei-Kodie.

The victim, who has been left partially blind, is now suing Morgan State University saying they knew Kinyua was a danger to others and they did nothing to stop him.

In the weeks and months leading up to 
the first attack, Kinyua had been caught punching out walls at the ROTC 
office and writing satanic rants on Facebook.

One of his own ROTC instructors even told police after the fact that he was a 'Virginia Tech waiting to happen', in a reference to the 2007 shooting massacre that left 37 people dead.
