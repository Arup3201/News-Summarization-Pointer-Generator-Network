Golf started out as a kind of sanctuary for Erik Compton. A means of escape from the playground bullies who took exception to his change in appearance after the first of two heart transplants.

He was 12 at the time and the drugs he needed to stay alive, to accept the heart that had come from a 15-year-old girl killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, had caused certain side-effects.

‘I gained a lot of weight, my face became really bloated and I grew facial hair that meant my eyebrows met my hairline,’ said this extra-ordinary American professional.

‘I was like “El Gordo” (a well-built TV host in the States) and some of the kids at school did give me a hard time. I’d gone from being this athlete with Scandinavian blond hair to someone who was called “Fatso” for two years.’

In the end, this softly spoken 34-year-old had to change schools. But it was golf that provided him with peace and solitude.

‘Golf was an escape from some of the things I had to deal with, but the people around me were also proud that I was out there doing something,’ he said.

After being diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy at nine and having a transplant three years later, golf was also one of the few outdoor sports his body would permit him to do.

Rough time: 34-year-old American Compton has had two heart transplants

It wasn’t easy at first. He would have to get special permission to use a golf cart in competitions because even walking the course was difficult. But he had talent, and as he grew stronger his game improved.

But even today, following a second transplant six years ago, Compton has to pace himself carefully.

No sooner had he walked off the course here at Hoylake after a very tidy 18 holes with Sir Nick Faldo than his caddie, Victor, was passing him a pill along with his watch and his wallet. ‘It’s my blood pressure tablet,’ he explained.

On Monday he started out with the intention of playing just nine practice holes, but the thrill of being invited by Faldo to join him on the course kept him out there for the full 18.

‘I have had blood checks, and the results in the last couple of weeks are better than they’ve been in years,’ he said. ‘I rested up before this by having a couple of weeks off so I actually feel great right now.’

Sadly, it’s not always the case, which is what makes Compton’s story, and the fact that he is enjoying a career that enables him to provide for his wife and daughter in Miami, all the more remarkable.

‘If I withdrew from every golf tournament I play in when I’m not feeling well, I wouldn’t finish half of them,’ he said in a recent interview. ‘That’s why I always give it a shot because sometimes I do start to feel better. But it doesn’t always happen that way. Some days it gets worse.’

Some days it gets seriously bad. Before his last transplant he suffered a heart attack, and just about got himself to hospital and called his parents — fearing he might never speak to them again.  

Here in Hoylake this week the outlook is rather more positive. He talks candidly and courageously about the challenges he will face when his third heart runs out of steam — the first one lasted 16 years — but he would rather focus on playing well in his first Open Championship, and perhaps even securing a spot on the US Ryder Cup team later this year.

‘Absolutely, that has to be a target,’ he says of breaking into Tom Watson’s team. ‘Just because I came second in the US Open doesn’t mean I’m going to play well here. But I think my game suits this course.

'It will demand that you create some pars but I think I’m good at that. At the same time, though, this is my first Open here and I will learn a lot this week.’

He will learn with the intention of coming back for many years to come. ‘There are a lot of things they can do now, and hopefully in the next 10 or 15 years things would have moved on again in terms of medical science,’ he said.

‘Hopefully, I’ll be healthy enough to benefit from that. And hopefully people, other transplant recipients, will benefit from seeing how I’ve lived my life.’

Big decision: Compton hopes to impress US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson at the Open

In that sense he is an inspiration — living proof that a heart transplant does not have to stop you from becoming a professional sportsman.

‘I’m not any more special than any other transplant recipient,’ he said. ‘That’s why people have to keep a close eye on me.

‘But if this heart lasts as long as the first one it should definitely allow me to keep playing  competitive golf for as long as I want to. And then after that, well who wants to be old b******s like you guys anyway?!

‘For me, though, it’s about more than that.

Realistic: Compton hopes his current heart will enable him to play competitive golf for as long as possible

‘I was heading to the driving range here when I met a lady who was with her son, who has a heart issue. He must have been three or four years old and I picked him up so that we could have a photo together.

‘They were excited, and for the parents of kids like that I think it’s good. It helps.

‘Look, if anything happens to me I don’t care. I’m dead. But it’s the people you leave behind; those around you who are affected. The parents in particular. They are the ones giving the medication to their kids. It’s very hard on families.’

He only hopes those families take some comfort and encouragement in seeing him play golf this week.
