The 48-year-old left the Philadelphia school and drove about a mile south to a Holiday Inn (pictured) where she was found in a pool of blood in a bathroom stall

She drove about a mile south to the hotel and left her purse in her car before walking straight to  first-floor bathroom a few feet from a packed conference room, reports Philadelphia Daily News. 

Just minutes later, one of the conference's attendees notified hotel staff that she saw blood coming from the stall.

Hotel staff found that the stall was locked and when it was opened they discovered Newman, who had a steak knife and scissors at her feet.

Newman (pictured with her family) was taken to hospital in a critical condition just after 8am, but after undergoing surgery she was pronounced dead at 3:40 p.m

Shortly after she died, investigators found what appeared to be a suicide note at the school, the source said

Newman, from Newtown, Bucks County, was taken to hospital in a critical condition just after 8am, but after undergoing surgery she was pronounced dead at 3:40 p.m.

Shortly after she died, investigators found what appeared to be a suicide note at the school, the source said. 

Crime scene investigators interviewed her husband before determining that she likely killed herself, reports NBC Philadelphia. 

Newman's Facebook profile page shows her happily smiling with her two teenage children and a man thought to be her husband.

One of her posts talks about how she 'can't wait for summer,' while another states: 'Home after a fabulous trip with my awesome daughter.'

Another former student expressed their sorrow. Grief counselors would be made available to pupils and faculty at Key

Police said hotel surveillance shows the victim entering the restroom at 7:46 a.m.

They said Newman arrived for work Thursday to drop off some materials but left a short time later. 

'There are no indications that this incident was related to the school in any way and did not occur on school grounds,' the district said. 

'However, we are working with the School District of Philadelphia in making sure grief counselors are available for any student that may need one as a result of the news of this incident.'

'The entire school community is very much in shock,' said district spokesman Fernando Gallard, who declined to confirm Newman's identity.

'This is a very difficult time for them.'

Gallard said that grief counselors would be made available to pupils and faculty at Key.  

Former pupil Frank Noce, 21, told the Philadelphia Daily News, Newman gave him a bag of chips and a soda and helped to calm him after an altercation with another student at school.

Students have expressed their sorrow at the math teacher's death on social media.

One user wrote: 'It's even hard to lose a teacher who taught you so much in so little time with great accomplishments in just a year.' 

Another posted: 'It's so upsetting to hear what happened to my 6th grade teacher. I will be praying for her friends and family. Rest in peace, Mrs. Newman.'
