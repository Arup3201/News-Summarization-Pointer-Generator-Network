One Panda at the Toronto Zoo hasn't let the snowy weather get in the way of a good time or in the way of starring in a viral video.

Toronto saw heavy snow fall on Saturday, and the Toronto Zoo's five-year-old adorable Panda, De Mao, looked impossibly cute while flopping about in the the fluffy white mounds.

The National Post reported that the Toronto Zoo closed early for the weather but that the security cameras were still capturing footage of animals at play.

This 46 second video shows De Mao rolling around and doing an impressive nose dive off of a rock.

The playful video already has 486, 549 views. See why for yourself.
