Hidden in a suburb of Paris, this is the world's oldest pet cemetery and home to Hollywood's most famous acting dog, Rin Tin Tin and other species including a monkey, birds and fish.

The 'Le cimetiere des chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques' - which translates as 'Cemetery of Dogs and Other Domestic Animals' - was founded in 1899.

It was built following the introduction of a French law in 1898 that put a stop to the practice of Parisians burying pets where they liked or throwing the bodies into the rubbish or river.

The new law decreed that domestic animals could be buried, provided they were at least 100 metres from human dwellings and were covered by at least a metre of earth.

Today the cemetery in Asnieres-sur-Seine, a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris,Â  is filled with elaborate tombs to beloved pets.

Famous residents include the canine star of 27 Hollywood films Rin Tin Tin who at one point is said to have received the most votes for the Academy Award for Best Actor - but was declined because he wasn't human.

Patrick Roberts, 73, from North Wales, visited the cemetery to see for himself the hidden treasure outside the French capital.

Patrick, who runs the website Purr-n-fur, said: 'It contains not only dogs, but a fair number of cats and a variety of other species, including a lion, a monkey, a racehorse, mice, birds, rabbits and more, even fish.

'The founders of the cemetery, lawyer Georges Harmois and journalist Marguerite Durand, formed a company and acquired a strip of land on a small island near the Pont de Clichy, which is where it remains today, although the site is no longer an island it is close to the river.

'Just inside the site, near the entrance, the visitor is greeted by a large and elaborate memorial dedicated to the legendary St Bernard dog Barry, who died in 1814.

'According to the inscription he was responsible for saving 40 lives in the Swiss Alps, including that of a young boy trapped on an icy, inaccessible ledge.

'But Barry was killed in the rescue of the 41st person. Barry himself is not actually buried here, his body was stuffed and is displayed in the Swiss Natural History Museum in Bern.'

Patrick said despite being very popular at the start the cemetery did fall on hard times in recent years and was almost closed.

He said: 'By 1986 severe financial problems caused the administrative council to decide to stop any further activity and to close it for good from September 1987.

Miket, Habel and Grisette (who reached an impressive 19-years-of-age) share this plot. The cemetery is now recognised as a place of historical interest and its future is protected

'Our baby darling Kiki', 15, (left) and Cachou, 29, and Smoky, 13, (right) rest here.

'However, supporters and lovers of the old cemetery, had other ideas. As a result the mayor's department of the town prepared a plan to save it and requested the state authorities to list the site as one of historical interest.

'Eventually this was agreed and it was recognised as being of 'picturesque, artistic, historical and legendary interest' and its immediate future was secured.

'Work was done to consolidate the river bank at the site, and from February 1, 1997, the community of Asnihres took over responsibility for the cemetery.'

Patrick said the memorials to pets range from the simple unmarked to the very elaborate.

He said: 'Often you'll see graves with a picture of the cat or dog, and then you'll see them modified to have another added and the pets are buried in the same plot.

'The French seem to have really gone overboard with some of the memorials perhaps as only the French can.'
