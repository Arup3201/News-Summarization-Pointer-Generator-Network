Number one fan: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne leaves the conference hall with his wife Frances following his his keynote speech

Britain faces seven more years of austerity in public spending –but will reap the reward in the shape of tax cuts after the next election, George Osborne said yesterday.

The Chancellor used a confident conference speech to announce that he aims to put the public finances back in the black by 2020.

Mr Osborne said a Tory government would aim to run a budget surplus by that stage – a strategy adopted by countries such as Canada and Sweden to prepare themselves better for financial shocks.

Following his pledge yesterday to 
make thousands of long-term unemployed work for their benefits, he said 
he would rewrite his fiscal mandate so the Tories achieved an absolute 
surplus in the next Parliament, provided the recovery was sustained. At 
the same time, capital spending – on new roads, rail and broadband, for 
example – would grow, meaning intense new pressure on day-to-day 
Whitehall spending.

Economists
said it would mean overall public spending effectively being frozen in 
real terms for a decade, between 2010 and 2020, and a significant 
retreat of the size of the state.

In
a speech that borrowed rhetorical flourishes from Ronald Reagan and 
Tony Blair, the Chancellor drew a critical electoral dividing line with 
his pledge to go further than current  government plans for paying off 
the structural deficit.

This
would allow him to start paying off Britain’s national debt, which is 
on course to reach £1.4trillion by the next election – rather than just 
the deficit, effectively the nation’s credit card.

The
Chancellor gave a strong signal that he favours tax cuts, however, 
telling the conference: ‘Together we are going to share in the rewards.’

Recalling the Tories’ 
slogan that Labour didn’t ‘fix the roof when the sun was shining’, by 
running a budget deficit even in its boom years, Mr Osborne declared: 
‘Let us never make that same mistake again.

Warning: George Osborne told the Tory party conference that the recovery was still at risk and it would be some time before incomes started rising

‘Never
again should anyone doing my job be so foolish, so deluded, as to 
believe that they have abolished the age-old cycle of boom and bust.

‘When
we’ve dealt with Labour’s deficit, we will have a surplus in good times
as insurance against difficult times ahead. Provided the recovery is 
sustained, our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next Parliament.

‘If
we want to protect those things we care about, like generous pensions 
and decent healthcare, and buy the best equipment for the brave men and 
women who fight in our Armed Forces, all of us are going to have to 
confront the costs of modern government – and cap working-age welfare 
bills. And only if we properly control public expenditure will we be 
able to keep lowering taxes for hard-working people in a way that lasts.

Carl Emmerson, of the 
Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘If you don’t want to put taxes up, 
then you could go for flat public spending – freezing it in real terms 
for two more years to 2020. That would mean we’ve had ten years of no 
growth in public spending. If people are expecting the next parliament 
to be a couple of years more austerity and then lots of giveaways, then 
they are going to be disappointed.

‘Obviously,
there is a benefit in having a lower deficit – you have lower debt 
interest payments, you get debt down quicker, you have more 
flexibility.’

Mr Emmerson 
said the extension of austerity would lead to new questions about the 
viability of the Government’s ring-fences on areas of spending including
the NHS, schools and foreign aid, which have meant deeper cuts 
elsewhere. Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said the Chancellor 
could not be trusted after pledging earlier to run a budget surplus from
2015.

‘George Osborne 
promised in 2010 that by the time of the next election in 2015 he would 
balance the books completely; we wouldn’t have a deficit at all and it 
turns out we’re going to end up with a £96billion deficit. So he’s 
promising something he should have delivered in 2015.’
