Sharks and free-diving are two things you wouldn't normally associate with seven-year-old girls.

But this remarkable little girl loves nothing better than to swim underwater with such terrifying creatures.

This incredible footage shows brave Sophia Martinez, from Alamo in Texas, US, snorkelling and free-diving alongside dozens of whale sharks off the coast of Mexico.

Water-baby: Sophia Martinez loves to swim with whale sharks and has no issue with snorkelling and free diving to get as close as possible

Sophia couldn't wait to jump into the open water with the enormous creatures and spent up to two hours in the sea with them

While most girls her age would be scared to swim in the ocean, daring Sophia couldn't wait to jump in as she spent up to two hours in the water swimming within touching distance of the 20 ton creatures.

Sophia joined her shark diving dad Eli Martinez at Isla Mujeres, where hundreds of whale sharks come to feed each year - it's the largest gathering of the whale sharks in the world.

Incredibly this isn't the first time Sophia has swam with the 12-metre long sharks - she has been joining her dad Eli Martinez on shark diving expeditions since she was just five and had her first shark encounter was aged six.

Sophia has always been a fan of sharks and has an array of shark cuddly toys and enjoys flicking through magazines showing images of her dad swimming with deadly sharks in oceans across the world.

Her father said sharks have always been a huge part of Sophia's life, 'she's never been scared of them,' he said

Mr Martinez, 42, who works for Shark Diver Magazine said his daughter took to shark diving like a duck to water and it was incredible to see her enjoy it so much.

He said: 'We started taking her out when she was five but she was too young to get into the water then it was all a bit overwhelming for her, the ocean can seem a scary place to a child.

'But when we went again the following year she did get in the water for a few minutes. And then this year, she loved it so much we couldn't get her out of the water.

'I was glowing just watching her, there is no better feeling to watch her in the water knowing she was comfortable and was enjoying it so much.

From a very young age, the little girl showed a love of sharks

Sophia's father Eli, who works for Shark Diver Magazine, said his daughter took to shark diving like a duck to water

'Since this is what I do for a living Sophia has always had an interest in sharks, she's grown up looking at pictures of me swimming with sharks and she's always adored them.

'Sharks have always been a huge part of her life, she's never been scared of them, she's seen pictures of me swimming with them and she knows they're nothing to be scared of.

'Sophia was out there swimming for at least two hours, she was close enough to touch the sharks but she didn't as you're obviously not allowed to disturb them.

'She wasn't in any danger at all, Sophia knows you just need to have respect for the animals and swim carefully.

'The biggest danger is that you frighten them and they hit you with their tail as they swim off.

'As she gets older she'll probably be doing more and more diving.

'She's definitely the youngest we've ever taken out to swim with the sharks but seven is definitely a good age to start.'
