A former art teacher who studied under Picasso and turned down a job offer from Walt Disney because of his love of education, died when his home full of hoarded 'junk' caught fire in the middle of the night.

Builders smashed down the door and tried to rescue pensioner Donald 'Brian' Starkey but were defeated by toxic fumes.

An inquest heard how the pensioner, from Dachet, Berkshire, had collected large amounts of clothing and paperwork in his later years, filling his home and not allowing other people in.

A former art teacher who studied under Picasso and turned down a job offer from Walt Disney died when his home full of hoarded 'junk' caught fire in the middle of the night, an inquest has heard

The house fire in Dachet, Berkshire, claimed the life of 81 year old artist and hoarder Brian Starkey

Fire investigators suspected an electric heater in his bedroom ignited clothing, paper or bedding.

While firefighters were still damping down the smouldering remains Mr Starkey's son arrived for an appointment with his father and social workers and was confronted by the large-scale emergency operation.

Until he suffered a second stroke days before he died, the last known visitor to the 81-year-old's home had been 10 years previously. His son said he had not been in his father's house for 25 years.

Following his death relatives paid tribute to a 'brilliant potter and artist' who had displayed a talent for illustration and animation.

Walt Disney himself was said to have tried to tempt him to work for him but a love of teaching saw Mr Starkey turn down the opportunity.

On March 6 this year nearby builders noticed smoke coming from his home and went to help, while also dialling 999.

The blaze was so fierce that a large part of the interior of the property was gutted and Mr Starkey, who had been in his first floor bedroom, was found to have fallen through into the living room and then into the crawl space below that as the flames destroyed the detached house.

His son Jonathan prepared a statement for his father's inquest in which he revealed his father's physical and mental deterioration.

An inquest heard:''He accumulated junk over many years. Downstairs in places it was waist-high and, in places upstairs, shoulder-high'

Reading the statement, coroner Peter Bedford said: 'He was a bit of a hoarder.

'He accumulated junk over many years. Downstairs in places it was waist-high and, in places upstairs, shoulder-high.

'It was paper, clothes and so on. All flammable.'

He said Mr Starkey had suffered a stroke two years earlier which had affected his sight and rendered him almost deaf. He then had another one two weeks before he died which severely restricted his mobility, meaning he could only shuffle along in small steps.

The son said he had tried to get him to go into a care home.

'He was a proud man and didn't like the idea of accepting help,' he said.

'He had made comments to me on several occasions, saying: "I can't cope. I don't want to go on", but I'm not sure he had the capacity to consider harming himself.'

The pensioner, who had taught pottery and ceramics at Sutton College of Art for 30 years, would habitually sleep with an electric blanket on his bed all night.

He also used electric heaters throughout the house and had done some of his own electrical wiring.Steve Wallbanks, aged 36 years, who was working at a nearby house, in Linchfield Road, Datchet, Berks., on the fateful day, said: 'We got here to work at 8am and were climbing up the scaffolding when we saw smoke on the tiles of the house over there.

'We thought we would go and have a look and as we went over the smell was incredible. It was toxic.

'We noticed the smoke was coming out of the roof and we knocked at the neighbour's and she said an elderly gent lived there.

'I went around straightaway and kicked in the door and tried to get in there but it was the fumes that stopped me.

'I could see up the stairs and I felt the front room door and it was really hot so I knew not to open that.'I went in and out three times, deciding whether or not to go upstairs but I thought: "I've got five kids of my own".'

turn down the opportunity.

Colleague Damian Glaister, aged 27 years, remained outside on the phone to emergency services.Mr Wallbanks, who was left coughing and spluttering because of the smoke he inhaled, said: 'Any one of us here would have done the same. I just wanted to go in and see what we could do. It's just sad that there was somebody in there.'

More than 20 firefighters had tackled the flames.

An investigation found 'it is most probably an electric heater in bedroom one (Mr Starkey's) was placed too close to combustible material' yet could not rule out another potential source.

Mr Bedford, the coroner for Berkshire, told the hearing in Windsor Guildhall that he was recording a verdict of accidental death.

Mr Starkey is survived by his former wife Margaret, four sons, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
