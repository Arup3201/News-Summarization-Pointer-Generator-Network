Worried: Jerri Lee fed the milk to her two-month-old daughter Milan who was then sick

A child was sick for 48 hours after her mother inadvertently fed her baby milk from Tesco that was ten months out of date.

Jerri Lee gave two-month-old daughter Milan a bottle of organic milk she had bought on the way home from work.

But within moments the baby was sick and then remained ill for two days.

Photographer and model Miss Lee checked the bottle as Milan had never been sick before and had been healthy since she was born.

To her horror she found that the milk she had just given her was from a box of six small bottles whose sell-by date had expired ten months earlier.

Miss Lee, who has appeared in The Only Way is Essex, said: ‘You don’t know what could have been in that bottle.

‘They expire for a reason – who knows what harm it could have done? She is not a sicky baby but she was sick continuously over a 48 hour period. I was absolutely disgusted, the bottle was nearly a year old, she was only two-and-a-half months old, it’s awful.

‘It is milk for a newborn, so it could have been so much worse, with an immune system that has no back up. It could have been so dangerous.’

Miss Lee said she took Milan to her doctor who confirmed her daughter had been made sick by the milk.

Ill: Jerri Lee's daughter Milan and the out of date baby milk from Tesco which she drank

The 28-year-old had chosen a box of six ready-made HiPP organic first infant milk for her baby as she believed it would be the easiest option to feed her on their car ride home.

She messaged the HiPP helpline where staff told her there was nothing dangerous in the product and it could not do any lasting harm to her baby.

Miss Lee added: ‘I rang NHS Direct straight after that where I was told to keep an eye on Milan and check her throughout the night.

'She just kept being sick, she wasn’t back to her normal self until at least 48 hours later. Even when I gave her normal milk she refused it.’

Store: Miss Lee says she bought the out of date milk from Tesco's Barkingside store in Ilford, Essex

Miss Lee, from Epping Forest, Essex, bought the £8.50 milk at Tesco’s Barkingside store in Ilford on her way home from an assignment.

'I was absolutely disgusted, the bottle was nearly a year old, she was only two-and-a-half months old, it’s awful'

She said: ‘The next day I drove back to Tesco to take the bottles back and asked for a manager and she simply told me she could give me a refund for it.

‘I spent £134 in that shop, and around £20 for fuel to get there and back because it is an hour away from my home. Just a refund is unacceptable. She filled in a report for customer services and that was it.’

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We are taking this matter very seriously and are urgently investigating how this has happened.’
