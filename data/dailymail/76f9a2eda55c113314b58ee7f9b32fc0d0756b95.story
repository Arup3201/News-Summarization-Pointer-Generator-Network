A New Year's Eve reveller could lose the sight in one eye after he was viciously beaten by a gang of thugs in an alleged racist attack.

The unnamed 23-year-old was with a friend in the early hours when police believe they were racially abused and then set upon in a convenience store in Brighton, East Sussex.

An onlooker managed to flag down police who stepped in to stop the fight and chased one of the offenders and arrested him as the gang fled.

Treatment: The Royal Sussex County Hospital, in Brighton, where the victim of an alleged racist attack in the early hours of New Years Day is being treated

The victim, who is from Brighton, remains in hospital tonight and specialists fear that he could be left blind in one eye after the savage assault.

Detective Inspector Miles Ockwell, of Sussex Police, said: 'I would like anyone who witnessed the fight or who may have seen a group of men in the area in the time leading up to it, especially if they witnessed any form of confrontation before the incident, to contact us.

'This was a very serious assault and the victim remains in the Royal Sussex County Hospital where he may lose an eye as a result of the attack.

'We believe that racist language was directed towards the victim and his friend before they were attacked and we are keen to establish the exact circumstances.'

A 19-year-old man from Burgess Hill, West Sussex, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, possesion of Class A drugs and possession of cannabis.

He was questioned and released on bail until March 6.

Crime scene: The attack took place at the M&A Convenience Store in Lewes Road, Brighton
