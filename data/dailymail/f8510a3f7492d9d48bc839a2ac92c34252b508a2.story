Alan Pardew will sign a four-deal at Crystal Palace after being given permission by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to hold talks with the south London club. With Pardew set to leave St James' Park, we asked Harry Savill from The Spectator's View to comment on his impending departure. 

Upon arriving on Tyneside in 2010, a conspicuous outsider, it was clear from the very beginning that the appointment of Alan Pardew would cause controversy among the ever-expectant Geordie faithful.

His managerial record up until that point had been underwhelming, and he had become just another face on the managerial carousel that spins between the dregs of the Premier League and the top of League One.

He was, one might say, an Alan Curbishley or an Iain Dowie: a generic manager associated with little beyond actually just being a football manager. And when juxtaposed alongside his club’s coaching predecessors of Kenny Dalglish, Sir Bobby Robson and Kevin Keegan, he appeared a less than ambitious choice.

His appointment at Newcastle was without doubt a flattering anomaly on his CV, and though he had fashioned for himself an image of high self-regard, he had never actually done anything in his career that had warranted such a lofty appointment, a seat in charge at one of the country’s biggest football clubs.

And it didn’t take long for him to be branded ‘Mike Ashley’s Man’, a symbol of the much-hated regime which had stagnated the growth of the club over the past seven years.

It would be fair to say that opinion on Pardew among Newcastle fans has been divided. To some (a distinct minority), it would seem blasphemous to dare criticise the man who guided Newcastle to fifth in 2012, while to others his record in the Tyne-Wear derby and in the domestic cups remain unforgivable.

Pardew’s integrity as both a football manager and a man forms the basis of the majority of pub punditry (of which there is no shortage) on the Tyne and has done so ever since his appointment.

As the nature of modern football decrees, the league must be treated as a priority - and yet, under Pardew’s guidance, Newcastle’s league standings over the past four years have fallen some way short of expectation.

From the outsider’s perspective, 12th, 5th, 16th and 10th might not look bad for a team that was playing in the Championship just five years ago, but Newcastle are not a small club.

In the eye of the modern fan, Newcastle have been consigned to an afterthought of ‘past-its’, rather than ever noted as serious contenders.

This, in part, has been down to a lack of ambition. Pardew (and indeed Ashley) seem perfectly happy to tread water, to do just about enough to satisfy the very minimum of fan demands and to keep the club chugging along. As a result, many fans have accused Pardew of merely towing the party line, attempting to stay in the good books of his puppeteer, Ashley.

Unfortunately, however, passivity and hollowness have been the least of our worries when it comes to Pardew: the headbutting of David Meyler sticks most readily in the memory, but one must not forget his swearing at the much-revered Manuel Pellegrini, a verbal attack that verged on criminal.

When it comes to tactics, too, he appears to be way out of his depth. He seems to completely disregard the positional strengths of our players (Hatem Ben Arfa, Remy Cabella, Sylvain Marveaux to name a few) who, under the right direction, should be challenging for top-seven football. These managerial shortcomings have manifested themselves in our awful domestic cup runs, and his quite frankly embarrassing record against Sunderland.

However, in spite of all of these glaring managerial infirmities, he has somehow clung to a sense of entitlement that has only served to intensify the dislike that surrounds him. Instead of being humble, he’s been brash and self-celebrating. And as a fan, it has become intolerable.

We tolerate arrogance in football these days, perhaps because we have become immune to it. Though it isn’t the most endearing of traits in a sporting idol, often it can be just about justified through success.

We may roll our eyes when Zlatan Ibrahimovic reminds us of his brilliance, but his goalscoring record is so unbelievably good that we can at least grant him liberties when it comes to self-appraisal.

When the posturing and prancing comes from Pardew, however, whose sense of self-entitlement is so odious it is almost tangible, it is far less acceptable.

He was someone who could bring about short-term gains. However, as demonstrated during his time at Newcastle, he was also obviously flawed and incapable of preventing alarming slumps in form, and for a man who is tied down to an eight-year contract, that sort of flaw is unforgiveable.

When the Chronicle, in October of this year, conducted a poll on whether Pardew should be sacked from the job, a staggering 94 per cent of Newcastle fans called for his head.

And when bearing in mind the popular opinion that this remaining six per cent was comprised of Sunderland fans, it is pretty clear just how disliked this man is on Tyneside and how little he will be missed.
