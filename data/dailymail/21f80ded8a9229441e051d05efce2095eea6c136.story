When Rio Ferdinand talks about the England job, he speaks with authority.

He wants a successful national team. To think that he could soon be taking the sessions as England’s head coach is a tantalising, exciting prospect.

He is the first from the Golden Generation — the term given to England’s players by the FA a decade ago — to say he wants the biggest job of the lot.

England dream: Rio Ferdinand wants the biggest job of the lot

In a couple of years, when Roy Hodgson’s contract is up, Ferdinand will be 37 and perhaps, with a senior figure alongside him as a sounding board or working in an advisory capacity, this really could work. We have tried everything else and everything else has failed.

Ferdinand has already started his coaching badges. When he gets his ProLicence, he could be further down the route of landing the biggest job in English football. 

In many ways international football could be a young man’s game, with Ferdinand commanding the respect of the dressing room after a glittering playing career. 

England’s players will be aware of his achievements in the game, fully aware that Ferdinand was one of the finest central defenders of his generation. He has worked with some big names in club football — Harry Redknapp, David O’Leary, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes — and learned from all of them.

At international level he was inspired by Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, people he respects and admires.

He has made mistakes, but he will be right to question those in power if he doesn’t get an opportunity to manage when his playing career ends.

It feels right that Ferdinand should be part of the future of English football and he should be encouraged by the FA to fulfil his dream.

If it becomes a reality, England really could be on to something.
