Liverpool midfielder Suso is facing two months out with a groin injury.

The 20-year-old, who is poised to join AC Milan next year, travelled to Switzerland for Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to FC Basel in the Champions League but did not make the substitutes' bench.

Suso made his first appearance of the season when he came off the bench to score in last week's League Cup tie with Middlesbrough but has aggravated a groin injury and will undergo surgery next week.

Liverpool forward Suso confirmed the news of his groin injury by posting a picture on his Instagram account

The Spaniard took to Instagram to confirm, saying: 'Just to tell you I'll be out of the team for a couple of months. I'm having surgery next week because of my groins. I'll be back soon. Stronger than ever. YNWA.'

Liverpool are already without Daniel Sturridge, Glen Johnson, Jon Flanagan, Joe Allen and Emre Can through injury.
