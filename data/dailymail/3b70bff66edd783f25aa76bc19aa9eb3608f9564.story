It may all end in tears, but there is enough of Paul Gascoigne in Ross Barkley to suggest it is right for England to give youth a chance at this year’s World Cup.

That is the view of Gary Lineker, who thinks the touch and confidence to try the audacious has seemingly passed from the man who lit up Italia 90 to a 20-year-old who is one of England’s brightest hopes heading to Brazil.

Lineker is convinced the youthful combination of Barkley, Adam Lallana and particularly Raheem Sterling represents England’s best hope of surviving Group D.

The striker who scored 48 goals for his country said: ‘I think a good percentage of them will start. I think he (Roy Hodgson) knows that’s his best chance, rather than trying the ones that have been there, seen that, done it. 

‘I see things in Barkley’s game, in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Like Gazza he can go past people. He’s incredibly strong. He’s got a similar stature, got amazing ability and will score amazing goals like Gazza.

‘On the defensive side he’s slightly lacking in terms of tactical nous, but if you play him in a certain position that wouldn’t necessarily be that important. I’m not going to say Barkley’s the next Gazza, but I think there are two or three (who could take a World Cup by storm like Gazza).’

While Barkley has excelled from central positions, it is Sterling, magnificently effective across Liverpool’s attack, who has most grabbed Lineker’s attention.

The 19-year-old has won only two caps - only Luke Shaw of the 20 outfield players in the squad has fewer - but his versatility and form excite Lineker.

‘Sterling is a phenomenal talent,’ he said. ‘He’s probably the best of the youngsters. He looks slightly ahead of Barkley in terms of consistency, and his ability to play in a number of positions is incredible for one so inexperienced.

‘Lallana is a beautiful footballer. He lacks a bit of pace but he is wonderfully gifted with both feet and he keeps the ball well. Daniel Sturridge could also comfortably emerge and become a star.’

Only six of the squad have experienced a World Cup, but Lineker, who believes reaching the quarter-finals ‘would be a pretty good effort’, said: ‘We’ve got exciting young players not stained by  previous tournaments.’
