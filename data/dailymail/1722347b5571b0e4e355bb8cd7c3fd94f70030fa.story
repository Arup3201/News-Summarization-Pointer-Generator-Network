A search and rescue plane crashed in storms while trying to find two fishermen missing off the coast of Jersey.

Lifeboats and coastguards were called to search for the men who lost control of their boat in the Les Ecrehous region, north-east of Jersey, at around 6pm.

But just over an hour into the search an aircraft assisting in the operation was forced to make an emergency landing in a farmer's field. All five crew members from the Channel Island Air Search escaped without any serious injuries.

Found: This rescue plane crash landed on Jersey while assisting in a search for two missing fishermen off the coast of the island

Damaged: Lion's Pride is in a farmer's field near the Priory Devil's hole - all five crew members from the Channel Island Air Search escaped serious injury

Rescue: Several hours after the plane crash, the two fishermen were found by rescue crews. Emergency workers last night took the men to hospital in Jersey

Another search and rescue aircraft was sent from France to continue hunting for the fishermen who were found late last night.

Jersey Coastguard said: 'The two missing men involved in this evening's incident at Les Ecrehous have been found.

'A rescue operation is currently underway and we will update as and when we have further information.'

The pilot on the search and rescue plane reportedly used the lights of a pub located on the coast to try and land the aircraft on dry land.

John Gripton, managing editor of BBC Radio Jersey, said: 'There are reports that engines on the aircraft failed and that the plane used the twinkling lights of the pub in the darkness on the north coast as a target to try to land the craft on dry land.'

The five crew members went to the pub shortly after landing to receive medical treatment.

John Dowling, manager of The Priory Inn, said: 'No one was injured, everyone was all right and that's the main thing, isn't it?

Rescue: It is believed the fishermen lost control of their boat in the Les Ecrehous region, north-east of Jersey at 6pm yesterday. They were found shortly before midnight

Joint effort: Rescue crews from St Helier, Jersey, Alderney and France all assisted in the search and rescue mission

'Of course they were shaken up. You would be too if you'd just crash landed a plane, wouldn't you?'

A spokesperson for Jersey Police added: 'We received calls at 7.15pm yesterday evening and we were informed by coastguards of a plane in difficulty.

'The plane then made an emergency landing in a field at St Mary, Jersey, with no injuries and minimal damage to the undercarriage of the plane.

'It is no longer a police matter and there will be no further action taken by the police.'

Crews from St Helier, Jersey, Alderney, a nearby island, and France were involved in the rescue of the fishermen.

A spokesman for the St Helier Lifeboat said: 'Lifeboat crews were launched from Jersey, France and Alderne.

'The weather here really was rather grim, wind force of 7-8 and heavy rain showers, which isn't ideal for a search.'

Officials confirmed that resources had also been sent across from France to help with the search - including a helicopter from Cherbourg.
