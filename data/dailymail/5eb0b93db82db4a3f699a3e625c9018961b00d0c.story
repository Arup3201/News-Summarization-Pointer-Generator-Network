What a disastrous festive period it has been for referees. They have sunk to their worst performance level that I can remember.

It does not seem to matter who is appointed to which game as the majority of them cause controversy and ill-feeling.

Managers are not even bothering to speak to them after games as limp apologies or poor excuses do nothing to help them in a popular period for sackings.

Neil Warnock and Alan Irvine have lost their jobs — but the manager with the worst record of all appears safe in his position. 

Mike Riley heads up the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), who are responsible for the officiating of top-flight games and he is therefore the man who is in charge of the select group of referees.

If any team manager oversaw a festive period including as many errors as these by his players he would be sacked:

The ball hits Wes Morgan (right) in the face but Mike Jones gave Liverpool a penalty for handball

Referee Anthony Taylor failed to send off QPR goalkeeper Robert Green for this handball outside of his area

Alarmingly there are more errors than I have listed and in what is a very close and competitive Premier League, these mistakes are starting to affect the look of the table.

I'm often asked why isn't there a No 1 referee who we turn to for the big games.

Well, that is Riley's call. He was never the No 1 when he reffed and he doesn't like to put one man above another.

There's no real hierachy for Premier League referees.

Mark Clattenburg, the best referee in the country, was the fourth official at Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace on New Year's Day.

He seems out of favour at the moment - probably because of off-the-field incidents, like breaking protocol by travelling in his own car to referee a match earlier this season because he wanted to watch an Ed Sheeran concert. When he’s on the pitch, he outperforms others .

Howard Webb is wasted. He is the obvious successor to Riley, but is currently working as technical director at the PGMO. This is a guy who has taken charge of a World Cup final. Surely he has much more to offer than Riley?

When raising the question of blatant errors with some officials, the response to me is worrying. I’m told there is no confidence in the camp as they feel unsupported and not motivated. They tell me to expect more errors.

As ever, Riley remains silent and this cannot continue. I took great pride in doing my best to perform in every minute in every match and I am not enjoying highlighting so many errors. But at least I am doing my job.
