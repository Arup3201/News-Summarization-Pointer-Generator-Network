Surfers from around the world are flocking to the beaches of Oahu for the chance to ride the once-in-a-decade 'super swell' that has caused huge 50-foot waves to crash down on the shore.

According to local weather services, the monster waves which began on Wednesday will continue through today till Friday and are the result of a potent area of low pressure which is passing over Hawaii.

At one point the world-famous Mavericks surfing competition was canceled such were the worries about the huge swells, but on Thursday, organizers said the event would go ahead as planned on Friday morning.

An intense storm in the north Pacific Ocean with a large area of strong winds has generated the large ocean swell heading for Hawaii, said Chris Jacobson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.

Mike Cantin, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Honolulu, characterized the waves as potentially life threatening.

'If this swell pans out we're expecting one wave every 20 seconds. The last time we had these types of conditions was 2004,' Cantin said, adding that the winds would also increase risks for those on shore, by pushing water further over land.

'We're expecting water over roads and infrastructure,' he said. 'Those waves will have the potential to cause problems to homeowners. People need to stay away from these waves. They will be big enough to wash over cliffs.'

A National Weather Service forecast discussion had a strongly-worded warning for residents as they gear up for the monster waves: 'Anyone approaching the shoreline could face significant injury or death. Significant coastal inundation and property damage is possible.

Road closures are likely and breaking waves may make it impossible to enter or leave harbors.'

Local residents placed sandbags outside the fronts of their homes to protect their property.

'We will sandbag our laundry area and the beach key access area where we do have some electronic rooms and stuff on the lower level that we don't want to get damaged, you know, elevator rooms and stuff like that,' said Greg Roe, manager of a residential complex that sits close to the beach, in an interview with Hawaii News Now.
