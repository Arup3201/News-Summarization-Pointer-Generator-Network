50 Shades of Grey is making pain more popular than ever, meaning the ultimate agonising activity Tough Mudder has upped the ante for 2015.

‘Tough Mudder 2015 Redefined’ promises mud, sweat and tears like never before, thanks to the radical inclusion of tear gas.

The team have introduced eight new adrenaline-inducing obstacles to their military-style course in the ultimate test of participants’ physical strength and mental grit.

Seven other obstacles have also been revamped, including the notorious ‘electric shock’ mud crawl; each more terrifying and exhilarating than before.

'Cry baby': One of the eight new adrenaline-inducing obstacles include the 'cry baby' where participants are forced to with endure a crawl around obstacles whilst being subjected to tear-gas type substance

Ring of fire: Mudders are forced to climb up a 25-foot scaffold structure, latch onto a fireman’s pole and plummet through a giant ring of fire and into an awaiting tank of water

Mud Mile 2.0: The Mud Mile has been updated to be even more intense than the traditional obstacle. In Mud Mile 2.0 participants face waist-deep mud, double-high entrance and exit mounds and completely vertical mud masses

'We’ve ramped up everything ten times more this year,’ said a Tough Mudder spokesperson.

The challenge is a team-oriented 18 to 20 kilometre course. More than 50 events will be held across the globe this year.

‘Cry Baby’ is one of the extreme new challenges which brave participants must face.

‘While whining has never been tolerated on course, an exception might have to be made for this never-before-seen tearjerker of an obstacle,’ advise the Tough Mudder crew.

Dead ringer: This challenge requires impeccable upper body strength and hand-eye coordination or you WILL fall! Mudders must sideways climb along a series of ascending and descending pegs using heavy-duty rings

The teams will crawl through an enclosed space filled with a safe tear gas-like substance, while dodging hazards along the way

In 'Kiss of Mud' participants must keep their head down whilst sliding into deep trenches and crawling over hay bales to avoid the barbed wire above them

Another exciting addition is ‘Shawshanked’ which, as the name suggests, took its inspiration from the film Shawshank Redemption. 

Specifically, it is a recreation of Andy Dufresne’s thrilling yet unpleasant escape from prison through a sewage pipe.

The obstacle requires that participants crawl through an inclined, mud-infested tube, ending with a backwards drop into a water pit.

In 'Meat Slab' participants must swing like Tarzan, hopping across a near-vertical 50-foot-long wall by swinging from one rope to the next

‘Fire in your hole’ is a course which promises a mix of thrill and danger. 

Participants must embark on a vertical plunge down a slide with a five-foot wall of fire awaiting at the bottom.

Tough Mudder 2015 will first take place in South East Queensland on September 12 and 13. It will then be held in Melbourne on October 17 and 18.

Sydneysiders can take part on November 21 and 22.

The event, which is not a time trial but rather a challenge, emphasises the importance of camaraderie and overcoming fears. 

Age, size and fitness do not matter nearly as much as the participants' attitude. In other word, whingers need not apply!
