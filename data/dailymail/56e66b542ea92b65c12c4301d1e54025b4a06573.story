Rose McGowan apologized Wednesday on Twitter for making generalizations about the gay community but reaffirmed comments she made about misogyny among gay men last month.

While a guest on author Bret Easton Ellis's podcast, McGowan spoke about her frustration with gay men not supporting feminists causes, with some comments drawing criticism from the gay community.

'Gay men are as misogynistic as straight men, if not more so,' the actor claimed. 'I have an indictment of the gay community right now, I’m actually really upset with them.'

Attack: Rose McGowan criticized gay men for being misogynists, but apologized later for a 'dumb generalization' of gay activists 

'You wanna talk about the fact that I have heard nobody in the gay community, no gay males, standing up for women on any level?' she added.

The comments were in response to a discussion of a boycott by gay rights groups of the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel operator owned by the Sultan of Brunei.

Mic reports that activist groups such as Human Rights Campaign and celebrities including Stephen Fry boycotted the chain over the Sultan's proposed introduction of Sharia law to the Southeast Asian nation.

Ellis, who identifies as gay, called the boycott a 'form of narcissistic, self-victimization, gay insanity' and said that criticism of the new laws was based on 'illusionary and tenuous' information about the codes.

Under Sharia as it would be interpreted in Brunei, acts of sodomy and adultery criminal would be considered criminal and allows for punishment by death.

McGowan, who held an anti-boycott party at the Dorchester's Beverly Hills Hotel over the summer, called activists boycotting the chain 'delusional idiots' and attacked them for not being critical of countries engaging in violence against women.

Activist: McGowan says that she has not seen gay men support feminist causes the way that women support gay activist causes, and noticed misogyny in day-to-day conversations

'There is Sharia law active in Saudi Arabia, there’s a woman who’s about to be stoned,' she said. 'I have not heard Cleve Jones,' an AIDS activist, 'discuss her, and nor will he.'

'Women, by-and-large, have very much helped the gay community get to where they are today,' she noted. 'What I would hope they would do is extend a hand to women.'

'I see now people who have basically fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange Speedo and take molly,' she said, according to the Advocate. 

In a follow-up editorial, McGowan, who has participated in pro-equality campaigns such as NOH8, called the generalization 'dumb,' but reiterated that misogyny was still a problem among gay men.

She related an anecdote about a gay friend calling Blanche Deveraux from the TV series The Golden Girls a 'slut.'

'I asked why he'd say that so thoughtlessly. If I'm not supposed to say (and I don't) "that's so gay," surely this man can start thinking about why it's acceptable to slut-shame. He thanked me for opening his eyes.'
