Wales manager Chris Coleman knows his team cannot afford to become reliant on Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.

Coleman is without his two star players for this week's international friendly against Holland in Amsterdam.

Bale withdrew with a leg injury after helping Real Madrid win the Champions League while Arsenal's FA Cup final match-winner Ramsey has been rested after an impressive but injury-hit campaign.

This week's game is also Holland's last friendly before they fly to Brazil for the World Cup and their manager Louis van Gaal has voiced frustration Wales are not at full strength.

Coleman is also disappointed not to have the pair, but he feels the rest of the players could benefit from the experience ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying.

Coleman said: 'They'd be a loss to any team in the world because they are top-quality players and you always want them in your team, but it is not to be.

'We have 10 qualifying games and we may not have them for one or two games and we have to adapt to that.

'We went to Belgium with 15 players missing and we got a super performance from the lads who were with us (drawing 1-1 last October).

'That is what we need whoever we have got. If we are missing Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey we just have to get on with it as we have a job to do.

'We are up against a world-class team and that is how it is.'

Annoyed: Holland boss Louis van Gaal is irked by Wales' failure to produce a full-strength squad

Wales have a number of other senior players missing, most notably Ashley Williams and James Collins, and are travelling with an inexperienced squad.

Defenders James Chester and Paul Dummett, of Hull and Newcastle respectively, could be handed first caps.

Another potential debutant is 20-year-old Manchester United midfielder Tom Lawrence, who came to prominence last month when handed a surprise Premier League start against Hull by Old Trafford interim boss Ryan Giggs.

Manchester City's highly-rated youngster Emyr Huws, who featured against Iceland in March, could get another chance.

Cardiff defender Declan John, 18, Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams, 20, and Fulham midfielder George Williams, 18, could also be in the reckoning.

The future: Chris Coleman has taken the opportunity to call up some youngsters into the Wales squad

Coleman said: 'They are all at different stages as some had their season finish three weeks ago and others earlier than that.

'But when we took this game we knew what we were doing and we knew it would be a tough game and we knew we'd have some players missing.

'We thought we would have a weakened squad but the lads who are here have been good.

'Our European campaign is two years and 10 games and every squad I've picked the one that turns up is always different.

'We need to give all of these guys experience of playing international football because you never know when you are going to have to call on them.

'No doubt in the next two years we will be calling on them so they need experience of playing at this level, playing a team like Holland, who are a top-level team.

'The only way they can get used to it is by experiencing it so we don't have any fear.

'We are full of respect of Holland but we have our own way of doing things and we will stick to that.'

Coleman may be without Bale this week but he has been hugely impressed by the 24-year-old since his world record Â£85million move to Spain last summer.

Bale scored a stunning goal to win the Copa del Rey for Real and then topped that with a decisive header in the Champions League final.

Coleman said: 'To do what he has done in his first year - he had a huge input in them winning the Champions League and it doesn't get much better than that.

'They have won two cups and Madrid are that one team where the Champions League is the Holy Grail and they have achieved that. He has had a magnificent year.'
