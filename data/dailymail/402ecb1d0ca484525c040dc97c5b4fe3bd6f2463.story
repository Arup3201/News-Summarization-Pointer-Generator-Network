Dressed in a stripy uniform, Alice band and purple sneakers, Skyler Burns skips merrily through the  school gates eager to start her morning.

Her nails are painted pink, her hair is a golden mane of shoulder-length locks, and her cheeky smile is as infectious as her effervescent nature.

Yet, the cherubic six-year-old was in fact born a boy called Seth who has now begun school life as a girl, happily telling her new friends on Queensland's Gold Coast: ‘Mummy said the doctors told her I was a boy - but they got it wrong ... I've always been a girl.'

Happy in her skin: Transgender girl Skyler Burns began prep school on the Gold Coast, Queensland, in February having transitioned from a boy to a girl

Cherubic: The bubby six-year-old was born a boy called Seth (L) who has started school as a girl

Skyler, who lives near Surfers' Paradise, began prep school in February and her parents Summer, 45, and Brett, 30, are understandably anxious, only too aware of the challenges that lay ahead.

They have chosen to share their story with Daily Mail Australia to educate people about what transgender means - so that their daughter does not have to study in a hostile environment.

With the advice of medical experts, Skyler spent most of last year transitioning at kindy, introducing pretty tops and colourful shoes to her wardrobe.

From the age of two she would break down in tears and tantrums whenever she was forced to dress as a boy.

All smiles: She showed 'marked gender variant behaviours' from the age of two associated with 'escalating distress and disruptive behavioural problems,' doctors found

Doctors at the Royal Childrens’ Hospital Brisbane confirm she is in essence a girl, although still genetically a boy, and this year wrote a letter to the school supporting her parents' decision to allow her to live as female.

Director of the hospital’s child and youth mental health service, doctor Stephen Strathis, notes that Skyler showed ‘marked gender variant behaviours’ from the age of two and 'disruptive behavioural problems' whenever her parents forced her to dress as a male.

In a letter penned to the school this year, he said: ‘I believe it would be in her best interest to live as a female at school.'

Well adjusted: Skyler currently uses the girls' school toilets but changes separately from her classmates after swimming lessons to avoid unnecessary questions

The school principal and deputy have shown unwavering support to Skyler and have agreed to use her preferred name.

Although unofficially unable to comment, they are keen for her to excel without facing discrimination.

Summer maintains school chiefs are considering lobbying the education board to add the option of ‘preferred gender’ to its enrolment forms so that Skyler's chosen name can appear on future report cards.

She currently uses the girls’ school toilets but changes separately from her classmates in an adjacent classroom after swimming lessons to avoid unnecessary questions.

Her mother Summer, a beauty therapist, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We love her so much, she is so precious to us, we want her to be proud of who she is. 

‘As a mother you blame yourself, I thought perhaps because I had her late in life I could be the cause of this.'

Pretty in pink: The six-year-old never had any interest in toys his boisterous older brothers loved

She added: 'I still miss Seth and I occasionally check in with Skyler and ask he if she does, too, and she tells me each time “mummy, let's leave Sethy in the cage where she belongs.” It breaks my heart every time.’

She added: ‘This has not been an easy decision but Seth’s gender just didn’t fit. She is exactly who she intended to be. We are lucky to live on the Gold Coast in a community that is accepting and open-minded.’

Unique: Her favourite colour is (pink), her kindergarten friends were 'girls because boys play hard' and she loves dolls' houses

The insistence that Skyler was a boy began age two and became more pronounced as the years went on.

As Seth he never had any interest in toys his boisterous brothers Archer and stepbrothers Chayse, 17, Dayne, 21, and Jye, 22, loved.

Instead he would ask sister Nykisha, 19, to take him to the girls' section of stores, ignoring Thomas the Tank Engine and Lego sets, to play with the Barbie dolls, tiaras and dresses.

Birthday girl: She celebrated her sixth birthday earlier this month with a Pocho Hontas theme party

Dad Brett Burns, a roofer, would tell the family not to encourage the ‘girlish behaviour’ as doctors initially dismissed it as a 'phase'.

But their child's continuing angst was heart-breaking.

Doctor Stathis asked their son a series of questions including what his favourite colour was (pink), who his kindergarten friends were ('girls because boys play hard'), what his best toys are (dolls house and a pink hippo), and if he prefers being a boy or girl ('I am a girl').

He diagnosed Skyler as having gender dysphoria,- when you are born into the wrong body and did not advise the family other than to say ‘let him be.’

Despite the young age, the concerned parents have made the decision to let Seth live her life as a female and she chose the name Skyler 'because she loved it.'

Once they made the decision, it was like night and day. 

‘The crying had stopped and now she wears dresses she's such a happy child,’ Summer said.

If Skyler's desire to be a girl persists, her parents will give her the option to start on hormone treatment when she is 12-14, which will stall male puberty; her voice won't deepen, and she not develop wide hips or masculine features such as an Adam's apple.

Pretty: Her cheeky smile is as infectious as her bubbly character

Tablets containing a synthetic version of the female sex-hormone oestrogen are given – a process known as cross-hormone therapy. This encourages breast tissue growth and females characteristics such as larger hips.

Brett said: ‘The new school has been fantastic but for a lot of people, it's hard to swallow.

‘If these children are not allowed to be what they really are, the outcome is something I don't want to think about.

’Right now I have a little boy who needs to be a little girl and we're only just catching up with her.’
