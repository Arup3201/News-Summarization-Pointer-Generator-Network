A Chicago man has been arrested for abusing his wife after she was found starved, blind and covered in four-inch wide bedsores.

Mary Jane Duffy, 60, was discovered alone and suffering by police on August 23, 2011, at the Brookfield, Illinois, home she shared with her husband.

Weighing just 56 pounds, the frail 4-foot-11 woman was in the foetal position, covered in ulcers and had severe bruising, fractured bones and missing teeth.

Her toenails were long and dirty, she was blind and in the last stages of dementia, according to Cook County sheriff's office.

She was rushed to Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago where she died a week later on September 1.

The woman's husband, Joseph Duffy, 70, was 
arrested on Wednesday and charged with two counts of criminal abuse or neglect of a person
 with a disability. He faces up to seven years in prison.

When the woman was wheeled out of the 
home, Mr Duffy told officers that he didn't want her to leave the house 
because he would 'lose money', referring to his wife's social security 
and pension payments.

Mr Duffy was pocketing $3,000 in 
benefits every month, which included a disability pension from his 
wife's former employer Con Edison, according to the sheriff's office.

'We have not seen any indication of remorse,' Sheriff Thomas Dart said.

According to the Cook County medical 
examiner's office, Ms Duffy died of bronchopneumonia and 'spousal 
neglect'. The office ruled the death a homicide.

The woman also had an underlying 
condition called congenital hydrocephalus, or fluid on the brain at 
birth, which contributed to her death, the office's report said.

Mr Dart told MailOnline that his office had been pushing for murder charges and was disappointed Mr Duffy had only been charged with abuse.

'As far as elder abuse goes, this is the worst case our office has ever handled,' he said.

Between 2006 and 2011, Ms Duffy was treated for dementia and other ailments.

Staff at hospitals, 
nursing homes and home-care agencies had repeatedly told authorities 
they feared the woman was being abused by her husband.

One healthcare company stopped 
treating the woman after Mr Duffy refused to let a nurse into his home 
because of her ethnicity, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

A hospice company visiting the 
couple's home to assess Ms Duffy for a home-care program first 
discovered the woman covered in ulcers and unable to speak. Staff then 
tipped off police.

'Numerous people came into contact 
with the victim and one after another they tried to get the defendant to
 do basic things to care for her but he refused and prevented her from 
getting the help she needed,' Mr Dart said.

'Workers regularly heard the man saying things like 'I wish you would die' and 'why don't you just drop 
dead'. Who knows how he treated her when the workers weren't there.

'He 
did nothing to help her and did all sorts of things that contributed to 
her death.'

Mr Dart said Mr Duffy lived a comfortable life on his wife's social security and pension payments.

'Workers pointed out that the woman was sleeping in a cot covered in her own waste,' he said. 'Meanwhile, he was sleeping in the master bedroom as comfortable as can be.'
