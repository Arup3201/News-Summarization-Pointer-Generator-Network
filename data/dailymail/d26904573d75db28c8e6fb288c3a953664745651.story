Neil Redfearn has signed a 12-month rolling contract to become the third permanent boss of Leeds United this season.

The 49-year-old has been in temporary charge since Darko Milanic was sacked last Saturday after only 32 days at the helm.

Redfearn will once again step up from his secure role with the club’s academy with the club confirming the news on Twitter ‘Leeds United can confirm the appointment of Neil Redfearn as the club's head coach. #DoItForRedders #lufc’. Leeds then tweeted: ‘Redfearn has signed a 12-month rolling contract with the option of a further year or returning to the academy. #DoItForRedders #lufc’.
