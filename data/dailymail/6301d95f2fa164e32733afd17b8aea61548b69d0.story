Louis van Gaal says that Danny Welbeck was sold to Arsenal because he was not good enough for Manchester United but denies that the club have ditched their vaunted youth policy.

United’s £150million summer spend on six new players, including Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, has led to concerns that they are turning their back on homegrown talent – especially after England striker Welbeck was sold to Arsenal for £16m.

But at a press conference to unveil Falcao and Daley Blind on Thursday, Van Gaal claimed that United remain as committed as ever to promoting young players.

He explained the reason behind selling Manchester-born Welbeck, who has been at the club since childhood, pointing out that the England striker’s record of 29 goals from 142 games was not nearly as good as Wayne Rooney or Robin van Persie. 

‘I have given all the players a chance to convince me of their qualities,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When you ask about Danny Welbeck, he was here since the age of nine and after Sunderland (on loan) he played three seasons at United but he doesn’t have the record of Van Persie or Rooney and that’s the standard. That’s why we let him go. 

‘Falcao, okay, but also the youngsters who will fit in. That’s the policy and that’s why I’m here. The transformation is in this new process.

‘We spoke with Danny Welbeck and also Chicharito [Javier Hernandez] before we got the chance to sign Falcao. We have to be fair about that. In that part (area of the team) we had a lot of youth who can fit in. They have to take their chance to play football. I have to put them in the squad.’

Former United favourites Gary Neville and Paul Scholes have questioned United’s transfer policy, while Sir Alex Ferguson’s former No 2 Mike Phelan has claimed that the club are losing their ‘identity’ by selling Welbeck.

I can’t work it out and I know I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England], but it’s odd,' Neville said. 'I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me.

‘Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m?

‘How have Arsenal got him [Welbeck] for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly.

‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.

But Van Gaal was quick to point out that having let 14 players go this summer and signed six, United have created the possibility of eight vacancies for young players at the club. 

James Wilson will be in contention for Welbeck’s place and Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett have made the first-team debuts already this season.

He added: ‘We let go 14 players so how to fit them all isn’t so difficult when you let go 14 and only six come in. We need the youth education, that is the policy of Manchester United also.  

‘I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can’t do that for them. The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that.

‘There is a new hierarchy in the dressing-room so there is a new process. It’s not so easy, and that’s why I have asked for time because I knew in advance that this would happen.

‘When you don’t let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a chance.

‘The question is if they take the chance. It’s of course more risky but it’s the only way to do it, and United have always grown players in the squad.

‘I hope so because they have to perform our philosophy, and that is not so easy to perform. You have seen that already.

‘I think the players we have selected will do that better, otherwise we wouldn’t have to buy these players.’

Van Gaal paid tribute to Falcao and described how the Colombia striker – who could cost United a total of £52m if they make his £6m loan from Monaco permanent next summer – had demonstrated his class in his very first training session at Carrington.

‘When you can hire or buy a player like Falcao then I don’t have doubts because he is for me one of the best strikers in the world. When you see his record it’s unbelievable.

‘Today at training he got one ball and it was in the goal. He confirmed it in his first training session with me. When I say that I put too much pressure on him and that’s not good.’
