Luscious, long and glossy are all adjectives frequently deployed to describe the Duchess of Cambridge's hair, as are beautiful and glamorous.

Now the Duke of Cambridge has added another one to the list - nightmare. William made the joke about Kate's locks during a private visit to the homeless charity Centrepoint.

Chatting to a trainee hairdresser named Angel during a mentoring session, the second-in-line to the throne quipped that she should try styling Kate's 'nightmare hair'.  

'Nightmare'! Prince William said his wife's hair is a 'nightmare' during a visit to Centrepoint this morning

The moment came during a visit to Centrepoint's health and wellbeing centre in Soho, central London, for a breakfast. 

In addition to the encounter with Angel, the Duke also met business volunteers and young homeless people being helped by the charity. 

While it might not always meet with William's approval, the Duchess is famous for her glossy locks, which are tended by hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker.

Ms Cook Tucker was among the entourage that travelled with the Cambridges when they flew to New York earlier this month.

She is also widely believed to be responsible for Kate's increasingly glamorous style, including the succession of chic up-do's worn in recent months. 

Gorgeous: Kate's locks have been described as many things but nightmare has not previously been used

On her travels: The Duchess' hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker travelled with the couple to New York

Sweet tooth: Although he was supposed to be learning about healthy eating, William displayed a sweet tooth

Supporter: William has long been a supporter of Centrepoint and often champions homeless charities

All together: William has been part of the Centrepoint team since 2005 and is a regular visitor to its centres

The Duke, who was without his wife for the event, also joined in a healthy breakfast session where young people were learning about nutritional food.

But it appears the Duke might have been more interested in the treats on offer as Centrepoint tweeted that William has a 'sweet tooth' and included the hashtag #whoateallthechocolate.

As patron of Centrepoint, William takes a keen interest in its work and since taking up the post in 2005 has toured a number of its facilities and centres.

Seyi Obakin, Centrepoint’s chief executive, said: 'The Duke of Cambridge’s visit provided a huge boost for all the young people he met ahead of Christmas, which for them can be a difficult and emotional time.

'Fortunately for many vulnerable young people staying with us in London, Sunderland and Bradford, while they won’t have their families around them, they will have Centrepoint. 

Glamorous: The Duchess of Cambridge has opted for a series of glamorous up-dos in recent months

All smiles: The Duchess took part in a charity event of her own last night, joining young Beavers in Bow

Campaign: The Duchess was there to help launch the Scout Association's Better Prepared campaign

'We estimate that 15,000 young people will face homelessness alone this Christmas. Whether they’re exposed to the elements or moving from one floor or sofa to another, the futures of these young people are at risk. Homeless young people are twice as likely to die as their peers.

'We must ensure that, wherever they are, young people have the vital support they need to leave homelessness behind.'

The visit came less than 24 hours after the Duchess stepped out on behalf of another charity, joining Beavers in East London for a gathering last night.

There, Kate, who was unusually dressed down in a hoodie and black J Brand jeans, spent the evening helping children aged between five and eight earn their disability awareness badges.

In order to get them, they - and the Duchess - had to ice a cake blindfolded and learn the Scout promise in sign language.

The visit, at the Old Ford Primary School in Bow, was intended to highlight the Scout Association's new campaign, Better Prepared, which is designed to increase the number of Scout and Beaver groups nationwide.

Challenge: The Duchess took part in several challenges, including icing a cake blindfolded

Volunteer: Kate, who helped out with local Scouts during her time in Wales, joins in the fun

Low key: The Duchess chose an unusually relaxed ensemble of a Scout hoodie and J Brand jeans
