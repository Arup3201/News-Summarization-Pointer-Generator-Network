You never quite know who you might meet when you go abroad and it seems the same even applies to Premier League clubs on their pre-season tours.

Swansea are no exception, but the Welsh side have perhaps hit the big time when it comes to chance meetings after coming face-to-face with Lady Gaga.

Poker-faced: Lady Gaga poses with Lukasz Fabianksi and Swansea staff in Chicago

On tour: Lady Gaga performed in Chicago last Friday as part of her ongoing tour

The pop star posed rather poker-faced with the Swans' new signing from Arsenal, Lukas Fabianski, as well as members of the club's back room team for a quick picture, with the former Gunners keeper just about squeezing into shot standing at the back.

With Fabianski were under 21 kitman Shaun Baggridge, Chris Watkins, sports massage therapist Matthew Murray and Swans kitman Michael Eames.

Eames said of the meting: 'Lady Gaga asked for a picture, couldnâ€™t say no! We are on pre-season in Chicago.'

All smiles: Lukasz Fabianski has joined Swansea after leaving Arsenal on a free transfer

Looking ahead: Swansea will hope to keep hold of key stars including Wilfried Bony going into the new season

For once there was little paparazzi about to catch the artist, who looked more than happy to be pictured with a team hoping to at least reach the edge of glory over the 2014/15 campaign.

The Swans are currently in Chicago for their tour of the USA before they play Chivas Guadalajara in Milwaukee for their first friendly on July 16.

Garry Monk's side then conclude their American trip with with a clash against Minnesota United three days later.
