HIV could be cured by genetically editing stem cells, researchers believe.

U.S. scientists say they have already demonstrated that it is possible to alter the genetic material of some stem cells.

This in turn provides HIV resistance, they report.

The researchers, at the University of California, San Francisco, have found a way of removing one DNA sequence and replacing it with a different one, a technique known as ‘genome editing’, New Scientist reports.

In this case, they replaced it with a rare DNA sequence that gives some people natural HIV resistance.

This DNA sequence comes from people who have two copies of a mutation in a gene linked to the protein CCR5.

HIV attaches to CCR5 when attempting to invade a person’s white blood cells.

In people with the gene mutation, HIV is unable to attach to this protein meaning the person cannot become HIV positive.

Only about one per cent of European people have two copies of the gene mutation.

The technique involves removing a DNA sequence from a stem cell and replacing it with another, HIV-resistant one

The idea behind the research was the treatment of the so-called Berlin patient.

Timothy Ray Brown was ‘cured’ of HIV after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a person who was resistant to the virus.

This is not a practical way of curing patients as there are hardly any HIV-resistant bone marrow donors.

So, the University of California researchers attempted to achieve the same thing but without a bone marrow donor.

They say it is quite easy to make the necessary stem cells from a patient’s own cells and that these stem cells – which can be used to create white blood cells – can then be genetically edited to offer HIV-resistance.

These edited stem cells could then be transplanted into patients causing them to develop HIV-resistance.

It is hoped this technique could eventually offer a personalised equivalent of the treatment Mr Brown received.

The researchers accept, however, that they are a long way from being able to use the technique in practice.

To date, they have only got so far as to prove it is possible to edit the genome to produce white blood cells that are HIV-resistant.

Currently 98,400 people in the UK are HIV positive, according to data from Public Health England.

The most affected group are gay men, followed by black African men and women.

One of the key difficulties in preventing the spread of HIV is that about one in five people who are HIV positive do not know this is the case.
