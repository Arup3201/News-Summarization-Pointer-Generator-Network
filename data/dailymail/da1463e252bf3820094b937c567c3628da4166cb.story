Newcastle

Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul is set to return for his side's Premier League trip to Chelsea on Saturday.

The Dutchman has been out injured since November but came through a behind-closed-doors friendly against Celtic on Thursday and is set to replace Jak Alnwick in caretaker-boss John Carver's line-up.
