Speaking out: Cecilia Attias has detailed the breakdown of her marriage of Nicolas Sarkozy

A
former wife of ex-French president Nicolas Sarkozy has claimed that when the pair split 
her  friends immediately moved to divorce their husbands in the
hope of ensnaring the former French 
president.

But their hopes were dashed when Mr Sarkozy married Carla Bruni  following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days.

Cecilia Attias, 55, who left him for another man just as he became head of state in 2007, will publish her long-awaited autobiography next month.

In the book, extracts of which were published in Le Point and Elle magazine, the former first lady reveals that she felt compelled to leave the 11-year marriage because she felt after his 2007 election victory that he had 'sort of forgotten me'.

The autobiography  'Une envie de verité (A desire for the truth) sees Ms Attias describe how Mr Sarkozy was transformed from 'dynamic' politician to an 'agitated' president, prone to 'terrible rages,' reported The Independent.

'It
is strange,' she writes 'that this man who was totally placid in his 
private life, a man who never raised his voice at home… managed to 
project such an impulsive public image.'

It has often been suggested that Ms Attias, who has a 16-year-old son with Mr Sakozy, was the driving force behind her husband.

She acted as an unpaid adviser when Mr
Sarkozy was finance minister in 2004 and headed his private office at 
the ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party.

'Contrary to what has been written, I 
never sought to influence my former husband,' she writes.

'I never 
advised him to take one direction rather than another.'

Moving on: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla married only 80 days after meeting - they met at a party a month after her split with his second wife

The potentially highly explosive memoire
will be of great concern to Mr Sarkozy, who is fighting corruption 
allegations.

Ms Attias, is expected to discuss meetings with 
former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, whom Sarkozy is accused of 
illegally accepting the equivalent millions of pounds in cash from.

She helped secure the release of five Bulgarian nurses and a 
Palestinian doctor being held captive, with many suspecting underhand 
dealings.

The mother-of-three also addresses Sarkozy's controversial decision to hold his election party at a luxury  club on the Champs Elysée.

Following criticism Sarkozy implied that she had suggested it, but Ms Attias stresses it was a joint decision.

She also insists that the decision to take a trip on the billionaire’s yacht after his victory, was Mr Sarkozy’s idea and designed to entertain their son.

'Wherever we would have gone that night, we would have suffered heavy fire from the critics.'

Just as controversially, there have been persistent claims 
about Mr Sarkozy’s behaviour towards Ms Attias.

Among the allegations in
‘Love, Rupture and Betrayal’, a 2008 book by the highly respected 
French author Hubert Coudurier, were claims of a vicious row between Mr 
Sarkozy and his then wife before the presidential elections of May 2007.

It led to a complaint to police, although no action was taken against
Mr Sarkozy, said Mr Coudurier.   Instead Mr Sarkozy moved out of the 
family home after being warned by the then interior minister, Francois 
Baroin, about the complaint. 

His ex-wife famously refused to vote for 
her husband during the presidential election, and did not attend his 
victory celebrations. 

When she finally surfaced, she looked haggard 
and tearful. She was so depressed at the time that she was briefly 
admitted to hospital and put on antidepressants.  

During a split from 
his second wife in early 2005 and before he met current wife Carla 
Bruni-Sarkozy, Mr Sarkozy used to spend nights with Anne Fulda, a 
political journalist.

Even while he was sleeping with Mrs Fulda, Mr 
Sarkozy would text and telephone Cecilia constantly, even though she was
conducting her own affair with Moroccan-born events organiser Richard 
Attias, whom she subsequently married. 

In early 2006 Mr Sarkozy and 
Cecilia were briefly reconciled, before Mrs Fulda returned to Mr 
Sarkozy, and Cecilia to Mr Attias, whom she eventually married.

Mr 
Sarkozy desperately tried to win Cecilia back when he was elected 
president, suggesting that she would be the 'new Jackie Kennedy' and 
sending her off on the controversial mission to Libya to rescue the 
prisoners. 

‘He is extremely considerate to people when they're on his 
side,’ said Coudurier. ‘But he can also be brutal.’ 

Ms Attias has previously spoken said the 5ft 6ins former president couldn’t keep his admirers away.

‘They’re very much attracted to power,’ she said as she discussed sex and politics on ABC in 2011.

‘I saw women giving him their phone number even when I was next to him.’

She
once described  her turbulent  relationship with Mr Sarkozy,  saying he
was a ‘philanderer who  loves no-body except himself.’

She also once accused him of inviting young women back to the Elysee Palace in  Paris for ‘late night karaoke sessions.’

She says that she fell for Mr Attias because he was 'solid, precise and reassuring'

'I am just a simple person who has had a complicated life,' she writes.

As well as the 
Gaddafi allegations, Mr Sarkozy is facing claims that he received 
illegal cash donations from Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oreal heiress and
France’s richest woman.  

Publishers Flammarion have not released a 
title for Ms Attias’s book yet, nor details of what it contains.
