A woman from California who just moved to Texas has been told she is not eligible for a state driving lisence because her same-sex marriage isn't legally recognized there. 

Connie Wilson, her spouse, and three kids have moved to Houston but the last thing she was expecting was having issues in obtaining a Texas driver's license.

Upon presenting her California marriage license to a DPS employee as a secondary form of identification, she was told that because gay marriage isn't legal in Texas, the certificate could not be used as a form of ID. 

Connie Wilson, her spouse, and three kids packed up their life and moved halfway across the country to Texas, the last hurdle she expected was getting a Texas driver's license

Wilson brought her California driver's license, birth certificate, social security card and marriage license to a Texas Department of Public Safety office in Pasadena. 

 

'The employee asked, 'Is this a same?' I knew what she meant, and I knew I would have a problem,' recalled Ms. Wilson to ABC 13.

DPS officials say that Ms Wilson who changed her name to her partners' last name, must switch it back to her original birth name - and even then she would have to pay a huge number of fees.

'To receive a Texas driver license or identification card reflecting a name change from a same-sex marriage, a court order is required,' officials stated.

Connie Wilson and her partner Aimee have relocated to the Houston area with their three kids. Connie took on Aimee's last name when they were legally married in California more than a year ago

Texas doesn't recognize same sex marriage. The DPS employee told Wilson even though she and her spouse are legally married, the certificate cannot be used to authenticate who she is. She was denied a Texas License

Ms. Wilson says she doesn't understand why she needs to spend money on a court order when the license already states her legal name.

'I'm not asking for a name change, I'm just asking for a new resident driver's license,' said Wilson. 

'As of right now, I can't vote in the elections, which may be part of what they're after, I don't know,' she said. 'I'm being prohibited from having the last name of my children. I think that's a violation of me as a person,' said Wilson. 'I may as well pick another name out a hat.'

 If DPS will not relent, her one alternative is to renew her passport. 

Once she has the federal passport with her name, Connie Wilson, on it, she will not need a secondary identification to get a Texas driver's license.

'I love Texas and I just want to be a Texan,' says Wilson, who is moving with her spouse and their three children into a new home in the next two weeks.
