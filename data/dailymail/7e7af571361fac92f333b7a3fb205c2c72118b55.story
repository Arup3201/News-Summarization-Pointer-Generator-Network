An academy has sent home 152 pupils in one day after they failed to meet the school's new strict uniform policy.

Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, strictly enforced a new dress code on Tuesday and nearly ten per cent of its pupils failed to meet the standards on its first day.

Today, another 63 students had to be sent home, taking the total number of pupils banned over the new uniform rules to 215. 

Clear rules: This is the Hanson Academy's own online guide which is set to inform parents what students can and cannot wear

Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard.

A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. 

Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers.

His mother Lindsay Stansfield, 34, has been forced to buy him new shoes so Mason can return to school, despite only having got them in September.

Mrs Stansfield, who works as teaching assistant at nearby Wellington Primary School, said: ‘Mason was sent home but I don't know what he was expected to change into.

‘He was wearing black leather style footwear with a decent sole, they are certainly not trainers and I wouldn't like to play sport in them.’

The school want pupils to dress in a blazer with a correctly-tied tie and a school lanyard around their necks

A statement made by the school states the rules are necessary to prepare children for the workplace

Mason said: ‘I've been wearing these shoes since September and I thought they were okay for school rules.

‘I couldn't believe it when if was turned away at the gates on Tuesday.’

Joe White, 17, who was sent home for not wearing a lanyard to carry his school ID, said: ‘I feel some of the rules are quite mean and the only thing they have caused us is to waste our education.

‘It has all come out of the blue. Last year they were strict but flexible and more understanding. Since we have come back they have made all these demands about how we dress.'. 

Damien McDevitt claimed his stepson was refused entry for ‘wearing a winter coat over his blazer’ and said he was sent home at the school gate.

‘He just arrived home with no warning from the school and said that he had been sent home,’ he said. 

A number of parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the 'harsh' new measures.

One parent said: 'Some of our children are wearing shoes that were perfectly acceptable last term, but deemed not this year. Provide my son with the perfect shoes so he can have an education he has a legal right to.

Another joked: 'Can you advise what thread count their underwear should be please?'

However, Hanson Academy claims made clear its expectations to parents for this school year.

Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including wearing hoop earrings, two earrings or patterned trousers.

Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors.

There are also strict rules about the type of footwear allowed, with information on this posted on the academy's website.

Headteacher Elizabeth Churton, who has been at the school for two years, said the rules were not new and staff were simply ‘reinforcing the rules that are in place.’

She said: ‘I am a head doing her job. I believe that we have to start from ground zero. If we get the basics right then we can push on to make this outstanding. Students need to know the boundaries and it is our job to make sure they are ready for the real world.

‘There was no consultation with parents and there will not be one, as we are just reinforcing the rules.

‘Basic expectations have to be abided by. We have had very, very mixed feedback from parents.’

Elizabeth Churton, head of Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, sent 152 pupils home on Tuesday for not wearing the correct uniform. Some parents have complained about the strict rules

In an official statement, Mrs Churton added: 'Our uniform and dress codes set the tone for our community and provide the scaffolding for high standards in every aspect of school life.

'To ensure that parents and students were fully aware of the high expectations that we would have this academic year we communicated clearly our expectations with parents and students at the end of the summer term, during the school holidays and at the start of this term; we were clear that we would be diligent with monitoring school uniform.

'We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.

'As forewarned, some students were sent home today for this reason. We are very grateful for the support of the majority of our parents in ensuring that their child fully complied with our expectations.

'Hanson School is proud of the achievements made over the past couple of years and we continue our drive for excellence.'

'The school has a responsibility to properly prepare our young people for the world of work and this means understanding the appropriate dress required in today's society.

'On Tuesday 4th November we sent 152 students home, which represents 8 per cent of our whole school community.

'They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn. This means that 92 per cent of our school community supports our drive in standards of dress code.

'We continue to work closely with parents and carers and we offer additional support to families who are in most need.' 

Pupils and parents around the country have reported being shocked at the stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's schools after they returned from the summer holidays.

Around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them their footwear was not 'black, leather shoes' and was 'inappropriate'.

Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good.

'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing?

'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.'

A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School.

His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help.

'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.'

Later last month, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight.

They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform.

Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight.

She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her.
