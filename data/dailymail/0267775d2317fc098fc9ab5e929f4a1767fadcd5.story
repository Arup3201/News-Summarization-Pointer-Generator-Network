Footage has emerged of a 33-year-old man dancing and jumping in the middle of Sydney's CBD as he is pepper-sprayed by a police officer.

The video, posted anonymously onto a social media sharing site, shows the man blocking traffic in the middle of the busy city road, dancing as cars and pedestrians attempt to continue their journeys.

The unidentified 33-year-old man is shown flailing his arms and jumping at approximately 4.30pm on Thursday afternoon near the corner of Bridge and Pitt streets.

The video shows a large crowd gathered to watch as a police officer subdues the man, approaching him as he dances, with the videographer shouting 'taser, taser'.

The police officer sprays the man with pepper spray, to large cheers from the crowd, as the man, wearing a white shirt, black jeans, and a yellow hat continues to jump.

'F*** he took that pretty well,' says the man taking the video.

'Spray him again,' he says.

The police officer sprays the man again and the 33-year-old slows his dancing, before hanging his head and putting his hands on his knees.

'He took a few gulps of it,' the man taking the video says.

'He's f***ed now, he's pretty dusted,' he says.

Police later confirmed that the 33-year-old was arrested and later charged with assaulting police, obstructing traffic and offensive behaviour and language.

Members of the public contacted police when they noticed the man on the road, before a motorcycle officer began speaking with the man, who allegedly became abusive and assaulted him.

The man was taken to the Day Street police station where he was then charged.

The 33-year-old was refused bail, and will appear at Central Local Court on Friday.
