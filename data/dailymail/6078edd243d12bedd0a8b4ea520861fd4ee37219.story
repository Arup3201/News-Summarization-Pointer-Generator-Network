Retail giant Target Australia has issued a nationwide recall of Easter chocolates, including bunnies and ducks.

The recall is happening after product batches containing tree nuts and peanuts were labelled incorrectly.

Instead of the label reading it 'may contain tree nuts and peanuts', it says 'may contain shell fruit'.
