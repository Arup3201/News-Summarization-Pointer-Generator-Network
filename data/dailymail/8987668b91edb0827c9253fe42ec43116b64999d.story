Ten children is a sizable brood for any set of parents, but it is particularly astounding in a country with a one child per family policy.

Liu Xiangying, 58, and his wife Yi Mamei, 40, have five daughters and five sons.

The pair, who have been married 22 years, have nine more children than the law allows in China because they did not know about contraception.

The family, who are uneducated and poor, live in a hut in Chefang township in east China's Jiangsu province and do not have any contact with authorities.

The couple's eldest children are two girls, 22-year-old Liu Huan and 16-year-old Liu Min.

They have a son, Liu Cheng, 13, a daughter, Liu Xiaoxiao, 11, and another two sons, Liu Peng,10, and Liu Chang, 7.

China is preparing for two million extra babies a year as a result of a loosening of its 'one child' birth limits that will allow more couples to have two children.

The ruling Communist Party introduced birth limits in 1980 to curb population growth and demand for water and other resources.

Most urban couples are allowed one child and face fines and other penalties for additional births. Pressure to enforce limits has led local officials to force women to abort fetuses or to be sterilized, even though such measures are illegal.

The party announced in November that couples in which one parent was an only child would be allowed to have a second baby in some areas. Previously, both parents had to be an only child to qualify for this exemption.

Local authorities have been told to build more health facilities for women and children and add maternity beds, said Zhang Shikun, an official with the commission in charge of women and children's health.

The figure of two million additional births is at the top end of forecasts by experts based on the less restrictive policy. Some say the figure might be lower due to the growing acceptance in China of smaller families.

The looser policy has taken effect in the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong and Jiangsu.

There are two younger boys, Liu Zhuang, 5 and  Liu Jian, 4, as well as newly born twin sisters.

The seventh child, a boy, Liu Zhuang drowned at the age of five, and his mother says she cries every day at the loss.

They have a small one bedroom flat where some of the family live.

The owner of the building also rents out a shed at the end of the garden where the rest of the family are housed.

But now their future is in jeopardy because Liu  has fallen ill.

When
 he sought medical treatment the authorities learned of their large 
family which breaches the strict one child only law in place across the 
country.

Until now Liu has made a living by collecting and selling garbage.

Now he has become ill, three of the children have had to leave their education due to a lack of money. 

Chinese communist party officials say they have not yet decided whether the couple will be punished.

But for father Liu, the lack of a welfare network now he has been taken ill is punishment enough: 'I don't know how I am going to feed my family.

'I talked with my wife about offering some of them for adoptions but we can't bear to be parted from them, we love them too much.'

Doctors say they don't know when the Liu will be back on his feet, saying: 'He is worn out, ten children to feed and no break in what is a seven days a week job, year in and year out.'

According to the couple, they will 'adopt measures' to avoid pregnancy in the future.
