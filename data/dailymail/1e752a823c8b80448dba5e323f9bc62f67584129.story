It's the special cosmological treat that had social media buzzing on Sunday night.

The year's biggest and brightest full moon was luminous as it lit up skylines across the world and Australia was no exception.Â 

The captivating supermoon occurs when the full moon reaches the point in its orbit that is closest to the Earth, which makes it appear much larger and brighter than usual.

It's up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than other full moons throughout the year.

Supermoons occur every 13 months and 18 days, but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather.

Hundreds of Australians subsequently took to social media to capture and share the phenomenal supermoon.

This is technically the only supermoon that will occur this year but there's others that have come close, with the next to occur on September 9.
