Wendi Deng, the third ex-wife of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch, will receive a traditional Chinese mansion adjacent to Beijing's Forbidden City as part of her divorce settlement, it has been reported.

Ms Deng, 45, and the 82-year-old media mogul reached an agreement to end their 14-year marriage on November 20, 2013.

Sources say under the terms of the divorce settlement Deng will not receive a share of Murdoch's media empire and that their split will not affect the rules of the Murdoch family trust.

Notable visitors are said to include former British prime minister Tony Blair, actress and TV star Fan Bingbing and pop star Zhang Liangying

Luxury: The property could be worth as much as 100 million yuan (£10million)

However, she will keep their three-story Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan as it has become a home for their daughters as well as a traditional siheyuan, or courtyard-style residence, near the former imperial palace in Beijing that Murdoch purchased and refurbished in 2004 for at least 10 million yuan.

The luxurious property, which has never been open to the public, reportedly has a total floor area of 21,500 square feet, and is said to have an underground swimming pool, a simulated golf driving range and a billiards room.

Notable visitors are said to include former British prime minister Tony Blair, actress and TV star Fan Bingbing and pop star Zhang Liangying.

The property could be worth as much as 100 million yuan (£10million), according to Wantchinatimes.com, which adds that while this type of residence was popular around the time of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, their value has since wavered and Chinese law makes them tricky to sell as buyers must purchase them with a single cash transaction.

Mr Murdoch attended the Vanity Fair Oscar party on Sunday alongside Juliet de Baubigny, 44, a partner at a venture capital firm in California.

Ms Baubigny is a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufiled & Byers in Silicon Valley and a mother-of-two.

She's not only successful in business, but also in fashion and was listed on Vanity Fair's list of 'Silicon Valley's Most Stylish' person's list in April 2013.
