Home secretary Theresa May is the latest Tory member of the Government to be booed by spectators at the Paralympic Games - just two days after chancellor George Osborne received the same reception.

The crowds jeered when it was announced that Theresa May would present the medals for the men's 1500m T20 won by Peyman Bazanjan of Iran.

It comes after Chancellor George Osborne was booed in the Olympic Stadium on Monday when it was announced he was to present the winners of the men's T38 400m race with their medals.

Putting a brave face on things: Spectators at the Olympic Stadium jeered when it was announced Home Secretary Theresa May would be presenting some medals

Mr Osborne initially laughed as the jeering at the 80,000 seater Olympic Stadium erupted but seemed to become embarrassed as it continued.

It appears spectators at the London 2012 Games are determined to deliver their verdict on the Coalition government with Prime Minister David Cameron also meeting a less than enthusiastic reception at the Aquatics Centre on Sunday.

While Mr Cameron presented Ellie Simmonds with her gold medal some members of the crowd booed the PM but they were drowned out by cheers for the Paralympic poster girl.

But Sebastian Coe ministers are 
'brave' enough to deal with being booed as he defended asking ministers 
to take part in medal ceremonies.

Brave: Chair of the London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Lord Sebastian Coe said politicians are 'brave enough' to cope with being booed

Lord Coe said it was common for political figures to become 'the pantomime villain' at times in their careers.

He
said: 'I think it is right that the political leadership of the United 
Kingdom should be seen supporting something that they've supported right
from the very moment we flung our hat in the ring.

'There
are 500 medal ceremonies, we require over 1,000 people, not just 
politicians, and from time to time, I know from my own personal 
experience, you do become the pantomime villain in politics.

Stoney-faced: George Osborne looked as if he didn't see the funny side of the crowd's abuse

'I don't think that we should read too
much into that and I think it's really important that politicians have 
been seen supporting the two greatest sporting events in our lifetimes.

'Politicians are bold enough and brave enough to know that sometimes that is the landscape that they are in.'

The
reception given to Mrs May and Mr Osborne contrasted sharply with 
enthusiastic cheers for other public figures including the Earl of 
Wessex and former Olympian Tessa Sanderson.

South Africa has made an official complaint that athletes are switching the size of their running blades after Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius claimed longer prosthetics gave a rival an unfair advantage.

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) received a letter yesterday morning alleging that athletes had changed the length of their blades, breaking competition rules.

Staff spoke to coaches in the athletes' village yesterday but found no evidence to back the South African claims.

Controversy: South Africa's Oscar Pistorius with his silver medal, left, after losing to Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira, right, in the Men's 200m - T44

Pistorius sparked controversy with angry comments he made after losing out on gold in the 200 metres.

He alleged that Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira's use of longer blades gave him an unfair advantage.

Today, Craig Spence from the IPC said: 'When we put that allegation to the coaches there was a look of shock to be honest because running on different size prostheses or swapping them for races is extremely difficult to do for an athlete.

'There is no evidence that any athlete competed on different size running blades.

'Unless the South Africans can come to us with some evidence that proves otherwise, it's something that we won't continue investigating.'

He said that blades were measured before the heats and the final, and that running on different size prostheses would involving adapting to a different running technique.

The letter from the chief executive of the South African national Paralympic committee asked the IPC to 'urgently' investigate its allegation.

It also asked to meet with members of the committee to discuss the existing rules.

As things stand, it is against the rules to swap blades mid-competition, Mr Spence said.

Organisers contacted competitors in April asking them to raise any concerns about Paralympic regulations, and they heard nothing from South Africa, he added.

LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Pistorius had spoken out 'in the heat of the moment'.

He said: 'In sport we've all been in a mixed zone 40 or 50 seconds after a big emotional moment in your career and said all sorts of things.

'It's the nature of sport at the highest level. We shouldn't be surprised that from time to time emotions run high.

'As far as Oscar is concerned he's raised those concerns, he was very clear yesterday morning I think in trimming what he said in the heat of the moment.'
