Private school pupil Zoe Miller, 13, was said to be in the habit of taking exercise to help her sleep.

An inquest heard she enjoyed skipping and running to burn off energy, and on the night in question had  clambered on to the parapet of a bridge to cross over railway tracks.

Energetic Zoe Miller was trying to burn off some energy in one of her 
typical late night runs, but when she was standing on a bridge lost her 
balance when a speeding train passed beneath her

When a 60mph train passed underneath in the dark she is thought to have become 'disorientated' and fallen on to it.

Her body was spotted the next morning by another train driver as he passed through Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.

Zoe's parents, who live 100 yards away, had already realised that their daughter was missing and police contacted them shortly afterwards with the devastating news.

The inquest heard how Zoe's footprints had been found on a set of metal 
railings leading up to the bridge and it would have been an easy step up
onto the parapet

The adventurous teenager plunged to her death, the inquest heard, after walking barefoot to the bridge. Her body was not discovered until the following morning

Deputy coroner Graham Danbury heard 
that Zoe had spent much of her life in South Africa, Nigeria and Zambia 
where she regularly went out walking or running barefoot to help her 
sleep.

She returned to the UK last summer 
with her mother Jane, 46, a senior health adviser for the Department for
International Development, father Rob, 48, a scientist specialising in 
storing biological data, and sister Sam, 11.

Her parents released a statement after the inquest in which they said they 'miss her desperately'.

The happy teenager died when she fell from the bridge over the railway lines on Ivy House Lane in Berkhamstead

The coroner's court heard how Zoe slipped out into the garden and made her way to the bridge on the fateful night in April this year

They added: 'We are privileged to 
have memories of nearly 14 wonderful years travelling the world with 
Zoe, and her adventurous free spirit will remain in our hearts for ever.
We are now doing our best to move forward as a family of three.'

The court heard that Zoe was told to 
go to bed at 10pm on April 22. The following morning her parents 
discovered the back door closed but unlocked.

Police believe she crept out and 
walked to the bridge, which spans the busy West Coast line. The inquest 
in Hatfield heard she probably used a roadside barrier and 3ft-tall 
fence to climb on to the 5ft-tall stone parapet.

A southbound train heading towards Euston went under the bridge at 11.45pm. It came to a stop after a brief loss of power but was allowed to continue after no problem was found.

A post-mortem examination was carried out after Zoe's body was found at 6am. Her injuries were found to be consistent with falling on to a moving train.

Detective Inspector Andrew  Rose said there was no evidence of anyone else being in the area at  the time.

Diaries belonging to the pupil at £15,000-a-year all-girls Abbot's Hill School in Hemel Hempstead gave no indication that she was unhappy.

'Zoe was not a good sleeper and it was not unusual for her to go out at night and run around,' he said.Speaking shortly after her daughter's death, Mrs Miller said her school bag and uniform were laid out ready for classes the next day and she had not left a suicide note.

Mr Danbury said: 'I am entirely satisfied this was a tragic accident.'

A Network Rail spokesman said it was planning changes to the structure of the bridge.
