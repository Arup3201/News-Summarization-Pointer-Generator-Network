A Hofstra University 
sorority girl has been shot dead after a masked, armed intruder forced 
his way into the home she shared with her twin sister and college 
friends.

The victim, 
identified by friends as 21-year-old Andrea Rebello, was at the 
home on Long Island, New York with two other girls - including her 
sister Jessica - and a male when the tragedy occurred at 2.30am on 
Friday.

The suspect, who has not been named, was also shot dead at the home during gunfire from police.

The
 man had knocked on the door of the home on California Avenue - which is
 just a block from the university campus - at 2.20am and then forced his
 way inside, police said on Friday morning.

The
 suspect, who was not a student at the university, was armed with a 
handgun and wearing a ski mask. He then headed to the second floor and 
held the residents hostage, according to reports.

Loss: The twins reportedly lived at the home just a block from campus with more of their sorority sisters

He allowed one of the women to leave the home to withdraw money from an ATM and she called 911, Nassau County Deputy Inspector Kenneth Lack told NBC New York.

She
 told the 911 dispatcher that the intruder had a silver handgun pointed 
at her friend's head in a second-floor bedroom, NBC reported. She added 
that there were multiple hostages.

The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau
 County police officers reached the home.

When they arrived, shots went off. Lack said it is not clear who fired, but a law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him.

It is unknown at this time whether her twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while the other girl was allowed outside.

'We
 don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a 
robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference on Friday.

One of the 
victim's friends told NBC that she was a member of the Beta Sigma Phi 
sorority and lived with six of her sorority sisters at the home.

Students
 flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many 
writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their 
best wishes and prayers.

Andrea,
 a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology, grew up in
 Westchester, New York, according to her blog.

'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote in the bio.

Photographs
 on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed 
hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents 
her cooking hobby.

Sisters: Jessica and Andrea Rebello, pictured, remained in the home while another girl was allowed out to collect money from an ATM. The girl called police immediately and they arrived minutes later

Break in: Police said that the masked, armed intruder knocked on the front door before forcing his way inside the home and holding the friends, including Andrea (left), hostage

Authorities said that the twin sister is now with their family.

Police
 added that the unnamed male hostage is from Brooklyn, and the other 
female victim who escaped the home is from Connecticut.

Victoria Dehel, who lives four houses
 away, said she had heard what sounded like fighting coming from the 
home. She ignored it as first, believing it was rowdy students coming 
home from a bar.

But then 'this girl was shrieking,' she said, and loud bangs followed just seconds later. 
'It didnâ€™t sound good at all,' Dehel said. 'I turned to my boyfriend and
 I said, "I think someone just got murdered." It was awful.'

Neighbors told CBS New York that they heard cries for help from the home.

Sadness: The suspect and the girl were both shot after police arrived at the Long Island home

'I
 came home last night ten minutes before it happened and I heard 
screams,' one woman said. 'I ran outside and police officers were like, 
"go back inside your house, go back inside your house".'

On Friday morning, Hofstra University 
President Stuart Rabinowitz released a statement condemning the shooting
 as a 'senseless act of violence'.

'The Nassau County Police have 
notified us that early this morning a Hofstra student was killed during a
 tragic crime which took place in a rental house off campus,' the 
statement read.

'The police investigation is ongoing,
 and we do not yet know all of the relevant details. What we do know is 
that a young member of the Hofstra family has been taken from us in a 
senseless act of violence.'

Home: The victim lived at the home which is just a block from the university campus with sorority sisters

Campus: The private university, on Long Island in New York, has nearly 13,000 students

Friday is the last day of exams
 for students at the university and graduation is being held on Sunday, 
but Rabinowitz added that the ceremonies would go ahead as scheduled.

'The accomplishments of our graduates 
must be recognized, and together our community will heal and find the 
strength to move forward,' he said.

Hofstra University is a private 
college on Long Island, New York. Nearly 13,000 students attend the 
university, which is about 25 miles east of New York City.
