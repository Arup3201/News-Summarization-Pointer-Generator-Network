The search for a Canadian man and a Japanese woman who went missing during a fishing trip in Montana has been suspended due to  severe weather conditions.

It is believed 56-year-old father-of-two Danny Heyland and 75-year-old Fuki Nishibayashi fell into Mission Lake - known for its cutthroat and rainbow trout - while out on the water on November 22.

The body of their friend, 63-year-old Canadian Kazuhiko Hayashizaki was discovered by divers three days later but now the lake has frozen over and heavy snowfall has made it almost impossible to get to.

There were no visible signs of trauma on Hayashizaki's body indicating a struggle, according to the Glacier County sheriff’s office.

Relatives of the fishermen reported them missing when they did not return from their one-day fishing trip in late November.

They were meant to be joined by another man, who ended up staying home for health reasons.  

A pickup truck that the trio were travelling in was discovered at Mission Lake, along with fishing gear and Heyland’s cell phone.

Officers began to comb the area, using underwater sonar and scuba equipment and that's when Hayashizaki's body was discovered. 

Heyland’s sister, Jude Heyland, told the Calgary Sun that the family wasn’t expecting good news.

'He was enjoying what he loved to the end. We’re just wanting closure,' she said.

Heyland had apparently accompanied his two friends on fishing trips to Montana before and was a seasoned fisherman.

The Claresholm, Alberta resident worked as a psychiatric nurse while Nishibayashi was a retired language teacher from the University of Lethbridge.

Hayashizaki, also retired, was a well-known table tennis athlete in the Lethbridge area.

The three anglers had reportedly enjoyed lunch Saturday afternoon before venturing onto Mission Lake.

Glacier County deputies suspect they might have fallen through ice on the lake.

The agency will return to monitor the area when road and weather conditions allow. 

Sgt. Judd Milender said in a statement Tuesday that the sheriff's office is 'committed' to recovering Heyland and Nishibayashi.
