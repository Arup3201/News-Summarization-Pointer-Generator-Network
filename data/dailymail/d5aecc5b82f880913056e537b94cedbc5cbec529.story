A coroner has issued a stark warning after the agonising death of a two-year-old boy who mistook a bottle of plant food for his favourite Fruit Shoot drink.

Aaron Booth - who had not been fed or given a drink since the previous day - suffered horrific internal burns from the toxic liquid.

The pH Up plant food was being used to grow cannabis and it had been left on a windowsill next to some crisps within easy reach of the child.

His mother Lauren Booth, 25, has been convicted of wilful neglect over the tragedy and refused to co-operate with the inquest into her son’s death.

Coroner Professor Paul Marks said he was considering a recommendation for the pH Up bottle design to be changed because it looks like the popular children’s drink.

He said: ‘I am extremely concerned the packaging of plant fertiliser resembles a soft drink enjoyed by children.

‘Toxic domestic chemicals must be kept out of the reach of children at all times.

‘This accident could and should have been avoided by the appropriate storage of the chemicals.’

He added that Aaron’s death at his home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was a tragic accident that ‘could and should have been avoided’.

Huddersfield Coroner’s Court heard how the youngster drank the plant food - a mixture of potassium hydroxide and water - after it was left on a window ledge outside his bedroom.

His mother was still in bed at 12.45pm with her partner Sean Williams when she heard a thud and got up to find her son struggling for breath with blue froth coming from his mouth.

Aaron, who had drank around 10ml of the liquid, was rushed to hospital and transferred to intensive care but died 11 days later in November 2010.

The powerful chemical wreaked extensive damage to his body, burning - among other things - his oral cavity, trachea, oesophagus, spleen and stomach.

Detective Sergeant Jane Taylor said Ms Booth and her partner told her that Aaron liked to drink Fruit Shoots.

She added there was some indication that cannabis cultivation was going on in the house.

The inquest heard that Aaron and his mother were known to several agencies as he was born prematurely and had both hearing and learning problems.

Kirklees Safeguarding Children Board carried out a serious case review into the death.

It found that social workers should have stepped in sooner when it was clear Ms Booth was struggling around six months before Aaron’s death.

But the review concluded that Aaron’s death ‘could not have been anticipated or prevented’.

Ms Booth was convicted of neglect in May 2012 and left court grinning as she was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years.

The trial heard how Aaron hadn’t been fed since the day before and was ‘hungry and thirsty’ when he got hold of the bottle while searching for something to drink.

Trial Judge Colin Burn told Ms Booth: ‘It was a cataclysmic, single failure to act.

‘Aaron was almost three, at an age where he was curious and everything was a challenge, therefore by failing to supervise him you allowed this terrible event to happen.

‘I’m bound to say that Aaron’s death was a prolonged and frankly horrible one.

‘There is no other way to describe it. And it was preventable.’

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death contributed to by neglect.
