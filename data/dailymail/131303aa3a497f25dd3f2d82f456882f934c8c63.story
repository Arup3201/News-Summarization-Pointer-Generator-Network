Thousands of travellers were stranded yesterday as winds as fast as 140mph wrought havoc across the transport network.

Roads were shut and train services cancelled, with Network Rail’s tracks covered with debris.

A spokesman said: ‘We’ve had a trampoline, items of garden furniture, trees ... It’s quite extensive.’

By yesterday afternoon, there was not a single train running in Scotland, while services for almost the entire north of England were suspended.

Elsewhere, passengers were forced to leave trains mid-journey after fallen trees meant it was not safe to continue.

Glasgow Central station was evacuated during the morning rush-hour after flying debris smashed glass in the roof, but fortunately no one was hurt.

Flights were also disrupted, with high winds leaving some unable to land. One easyJet plane with 112 passengers aborted two attempted landings in Scotland, before being diverted to Manchester.

The flight from Gatwick to Glasgow was initially diverted to Edinburgh – but the storm soon reached that city too.

Passenger Hazel Bedford, a charity worker, said: ‘I’m feeling really lucky to be alive. I was absolutely terrified.

‘The captain said there was a chance it could be a bit bumpy north of the border and there could be some delays while landing.

‘But we got further north and suddenly everything started shaking and bumping – we were going up and down, up and down, like a roller coaster.’

Glasgow, Leeds Bradford and Birmingham airports also faced disruption.

Ferry services were cancelled at ports around the country, while motorists were confronted with fallen trees and flash-flooding. As a result, accidents caused further major delays.

The winds were so powerful that vehicles were flipped onto their roofs; one overturned lorry caused long tailbacks on the M60.

In Scotland, a man and woman had to be cut free from a taxi after a tree collapsed on top of it, while in Wales two drivers escaped when a 50-tonne tree fell onto their vehicles on the A40 near Abergavenny, South Wales.

Another driver was similarly lucky to escape with his life, after his van was crushed by a tree with him inside it near the centre of Manchester.

The tree missed the windscreen by just inches.

Witness Kathleen McGuiness, 51, said: ‘It’s a miracle he’s walked away from it. I think he should make sure he plays the lottery on Saturday.

‘It landed right on his bonnet and made a massive bang. He was trapped inside, and he had to kick through the windscreen to get out.’

Another onlooker added: ‘He was very lucky to escape with just cuts  and bruises.’

In Birmingham, Muhammad Sial told how a tree had smashed his car – missing him by mere seconds.

The 66-year-old said: ‘I didn’t hear a noise, I just got to the front door and turned to look back and the tree had smashed my car. It smashed the front and the windscreen.

'The trunk of the tree was lying right across my car – it had happened just in an instant. I think my prayers must have been answered. Every morning I pray to Allah to save me and others, so I am grateful.’

Scaffolding being used to repair the roof of an Aldi in Flintshire, north-east Wales, collapsed onto cars in high winds, and in Merseyside parts of a newly-built block of flats blew into the road and onto cars, smashing windscreens.

Police said nobody was injured, although a number of residents were ‘severely shaken’.
