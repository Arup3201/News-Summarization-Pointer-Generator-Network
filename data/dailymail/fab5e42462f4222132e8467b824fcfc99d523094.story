She has just replaced Kate Moss as the face of David Yurman and she's the fresh-faced star of the campaign for Chanel's new 'Les Beiges' make-up collection.

And now it has been announced that Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen has joined the ranks of superstars who have posed for Swedish high street giant H&M.

While no images from the finished campaign have been released, the brand unveiled a sneak peek in the form of a behind-the-scenes preview showing the model dressed in a military-style coat, smiling over her shoulder.

Bündchen also tweeted an photo of herself on set, perched on a kerb in a pair of tight black jeans and a slouchy cream knit.

Like all of H&M's recent campaigns, the pictures, shot on location on the streets of London,  emphasise the brand's edgier side.

Along with Beyoncé, who stars in the brand's high summer adverts, the signing of Bündchen means that H&M can now boast campaigns starring some of the most stellar models around.

Among the H&M stars are Daphne Groeneveld, Joan Smalls, Liu Wen and Lindsey Wixson, all of whom star as the faces of the brand's New Icons range.

Recently, it was announced that H&M had been signed up to design the kit for the Swedish Olympic team - and the stars will also be modelling the store's sportswear range.

Bündchen, whose career took off in 1997, was last year named top of Forbes' highest-paid models list.

She was also recently described as 'the only true remaining supermodel by fellow veterans, Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell.

The 32-year-old, who gave birth to her second child, daughter Vivian Lake Brady, last December, is married to American Football star Tom Brady.
