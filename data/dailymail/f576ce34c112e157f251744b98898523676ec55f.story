Dr Conrad Murray was $500,000 in a debt and willing to do anything to get paid while he was treating Michael Jackson, said the detective who investigated the King of Pop's 2005 death.

Detective Orlando Martinez told jurors on Tuesday that Murray depended on the $150,000-a-month salary that he received from Jackson's concert promoter AEG Live.

Lawyers for Jackson's mother Katherine argued that AEG should have vetted Murray. AEG is defending itself from a wrongful death lawsuit that alleges the company bears responsibility for Dr Murray allegedly giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol.

Martinez testified that he looked into Murray's finances searching for a financial motive for his role in Jackson's death and relied mostly on public records. He turned up that Murray's Las Vegas home was in foreclosure proceedings, and Murray faced several liens for unpaid child support and other unpaid debts.

The searches led Martinez to conclude that Murray's financial condition was 'severely distressed.'

Martinez said that led him to believe Murray's actions were motivated by the $150,000 a month he expected to be paid by AEG.

'He may break the rules, bend the rules, do whatever he needed to do to get paid,' Martinez said. 'It might solve his money problems.'

Murray's finances were not a factor in the criminal case that ended with his 2011 conviction for administering a fatal dose of propofol to Jackson.

Martinez also showed jurors photographs the various medications officers uncovered in Jackson's bedroom, including several vials of propofol.

The paramedic who discovered Jackson dead in his bedroom nearly four years ago told the jury earlier Tuesday that the King of Pop appeared to have been dead at least an hour when he arrived on the scene.

Jackson's
blue hands, feet and lips, and the singer's dry eyes all signaled to paramedic Richard 
Senneff that the singer was dead and hadn't been breathing for a long 
time.

'To
me, he looked like someone who was at the end stage of a long disease 
process,' Senneff said Tuesday during his testimony in the civil case between Michael Jackson's mother and concert giant AEG Live.

Senneff also recalled how Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, was frantically trying to revive the singer.

'He was pale, he was sweaty,' the paramedic said of Murray. 'He was very busy.'

Murray claimed he was treating Jackson for dehydration and he never mentioned propofol, the 
hospital-grade anesthetic that killed the singer, Senneff said.Â 

He told the panel that he found an IV pole, oxygen tanks and a nightstand with several medicine bottles.

In the nearly four years since his 
death, nearly every aspect of Jackson's life has been explored in court 
proceedings, documentaries, books and news stories.

Still,
the negligence case filed by his mother against AEG promises to deliver
the most detailed account of the singer's addiction struggles, 
including testimony from his ex-wife Debbie Rowe about treatments 
involving the anesthetic propofol dating back to the 1990s.

Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson leaves the sentencing hearing of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of pop star Michael Jackson

Jackson died from a propofol overdose in 2009 while preparing for a series of comeback concerts at AEG's O2 Arena in London.

Katherine
Jackson contends AEG didn't properly investigate Murray, the doctor who later 
administered the fatal dose. The company denies wrongdoing.

During opening statements, attorneys framed Jackson's prescription drug addiction through the prism of his superstar status.

Attorney
Brian Panish, who represents Katherine Jackson, said the drug problems 
worsened when the pop star was under the stress of live performances.

AEG
attorney Marvin S. Putnam countered that Jackson's stardom provided a 
cover to receive multiple, secret medical treatments, many involving 
propofol.

At one point 
in the proceedings, the harsh portrayal of Jackson's struggle with 
addiction, led one juror to lean forward and stare at the floor for 
several moments.

Katherine
Jackson and two of the superstar's children, Prince and Paris, are 
potential witnesses whose testimony will likely focus heavily on their 
grieving and losses.

On
Monday, Panish played a song Jackson wrote for his children as a 
montage of photos played during opening statements. He also read a 
handwritten note from Jackson that his mother framed and has hanging on 
her wall.

'The only way
you can assess damages, is to know what they had,' Panish said before 
reading the letter and playing 'You Are My Life.'

Katherine
Jackson dabbed her eyes with a tissue. On Tuesday, she left the 
courtroom while the paramedic described her son's condition on the day 
he died.

It may be several days before jurors get another look at Jackson's softer side.

The
trial will also feature testimony on Jackson's troubled finances, with 
debts that reached nearly $400 million by the time he died.

AEG contends the debts made him desperate to have a successful concert series.

'The
private Michael Jackson was like a lot of American in the 2000s, 
spending a lot more than he was making,' Putnam told the jury after 
describing the singer's lavish Neverland Ranch, his art collection and 
other spending.

Many other private moments from the singer's life will be exposed as the case progresses over the next several months, with witnesses expected to testify about secret medical treatments, lavish spending and tender moments spent with his mother and children.
