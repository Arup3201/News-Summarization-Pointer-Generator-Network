For the last two years, Dale Decker has suffered 100 orgasms a day - but has not enjoyed one.

The 37-year-old is the first man to speak out about suffering persistent genital arousal syndrome.

He developed the condition in September 2012 after slipping a disc in his back while getting out of a chair.

While he was en route to the hospital, he suffered five orgasms.

Since that moment he has been plagued by the condition, he describes as 'disgusting and horrendous'.  

According to medical literature, trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this area. 

The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm. 

The condition that causes him to suffer more than 100 orgasms each day after he slipped a disc in his back two years ago. Since that moment he has been plagued by the condition, he describes as 'disgusting'

He said: 'Imagine being on your knees at your father's funeral beside his casket - saying goodbye to him and then you have nine orgasms right there.

'While your whole family is standing behind you. It makes you never want to have another orgasm for as long as you live.

'There's nothing pleasurable about it because even though it might feel physically good - you're completely disgusted by what's going on.'

He added: 'If you're in public, if you're in front of kids - it's disgusting and it can break you real fast.

'It happened to me at the grocery store and when it was over there were around 150 people looking straight at me - why would I leave the house when something like this can happen.'

The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm. He is pictured experiencing orgasms while out playing frisbee golf at his home in Two Rivers, Wisconsin

Mr Decker lives in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, with his wife April and two sons Christian, 12, and Tayten, 11.

While doing all she can to support her husband, Mrs Decker said his condition is 'hard to live with'.

She said: 'We really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family and I feel like all the strain is on me.

'It's really upsetting, we don't do things that man and wife should do and we argue over things that should not be affecting us.

'Because he sometimes has episodes at night we took the decision to sleep in separate beds.

'That can be very frustrating. You want the comfort from another person, particularly your husband, but we don't have that.

'I really miss the old Dale, we used to have a lot of fun and one day I pray that he will come back to me.

'Maybe the doctors will find a cure for this - I don't know - I just really hope that they do.'

The horrific condition has cost Mr Decker many of his friends and the relationship he shares with his sons has also been affected.

Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire.

'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer.

'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms.

'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon.

'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know.

'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.'

'He struggles to be a good father to the children because they obviously don't understand what is happening,' his wife added.

'He can't take them to practice - can't play ball with them, it's really hard.'

Despite suffering from a near constant erection Mr and Mrs Decker rarely have sex.

'Occasionally we will but it's very frustrating for both of us,' Mr Decker said.

'I've tried reading about it, tried going to doctors but nobody can help me - I don't know what I'm going to do.

'I just want to get my old life back - I just want to get back what this condition has taken from me.'

Despite many medical professionals being unable to even diagnose the condition, there are some specialists in the field.

Dr Dena Harris is a gynecologist who has mainly worked with women who suffer with PGAS.

Speaking from her office in New York City, she said: 'It's clear Dale is really suffering and I'm sure there are some people who will say that this is just in his head.

'But it's not - it's a serious medical condition and I just hope he gets the help he so desperately needs.

'Being aroused can be a wonderful thing but this is not like arousal, it's not even sexual.

'It's a horrendous spasm and it can be terribly painful.

'Dale looks like he is in pain - not just emotionally but physically as well.

'I've got to be honest, there is help available but if Dale doesn't get help soon then there could be huge risks in the future.

'Suicide is always a concern when people suffer from this condition - they feel like they have no other way to escape it.'
