Shamed HSBC bosses are under pressure to hand back their multi-million pound payouts as Britain’s high street banks prepare to award bonuses worth a total of more than £5bn.

Stuart Gulliver, the HSBC chief executive, is in line for pay and perks of £7.4m, including a bonus of £1.3m. 

The disgraced bank, which has been under fire for a string of scandals including tax avoidance at its Swiss private banking arm, is preparing to reward its top staff with a total bonus pool of £2.2bn. 

Documents alleged that the Swiss arm helped wealthy clients to cheat the taxman by hiding their assets.

The payout to Mr Gulliver is below last year’s £8m but will spark outrage coming in the wake of the Swiss tax scandal.

Dame Colette Bowe, chairman of the Banking Standards Review Council which has been set up to improve the behaviour of leading lenders, said: ‘Those leading our banking businesses need to think very carefully about the patterns of behaviours they are seeking to reward.’

The revelations come as the banking giant will next week report profits of nearly £15bn – or a staggering £40m a day. 

Mr Gulliver has worked at HSBC since 1980, working his way up the ranks. He has sat on the HSBC group management board since 2004, including the period when the Swiss private banking scandal was at its peak, between 2005-2007, and became chief executive in 2011.

He will be questioned by Parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday along with chairman Douglas Flint, who is paid around £2.4m a year. 

Mr Flint will be quizzed over his role as finance director at the time when the bank was found to be helping customers avoid taxes through its Swiss unit.

Levels of excess at the UK’s scandal ridden lenders has reached such a pitch that even bosses organisation the Institute of Directors, which represents executives at companies across Britain, is urging banks to show ‘restraint as we approach the general election and with so much anti-business mood music in the country at the moment’.

Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said: ‘As the banks announce pay and bonus deals for 2014, I would urge them to show restraint. Now is the time to restore the link between long-term performance and financial reward for senior bankers. This has been broken for a number of years, but never has the political imperative of doing something about it been greater.’

The lavish payouts at HSBC, which owns the former Midland bank in the UK, are expected to be announced alongside the bank’s annual results on Monday. Rival high street lenders will reveal their profit figures in the following days.

Taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing a bonus pot of around £500m while Lloyds Banking Group will announce total payouts of around £375m.

Its chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio is in line for a package of £7m, including the release of long-term share incentives from 2012 that come to fruit this year.

Barclays will unveil its results the following week and is lining up bonuses of just under £2bn for its bankers, only slightly below the £2.4bn it paid last year.

Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, who sits on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and will be questioning HSBC’s chiefs, said: ‘I don’t think chief executives should be paid a bonus at all. The bonus system is fundamentally flawed and must be re-thought.

‘Why do people deserve this much money when brain surgeons and army chiefs earn less and do far more?’

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, added: ‘Chief executives should give up their bonuses. 

'There is no other industry that has so much ongoing criminality as bankers, from Libor and forex to the Swiss tax scandal. The idea that there should be any bonuses paid is extraordinary.’

In order to receive his performance-linked bonuses, Mr Gulliver has to meet standards of ethical behaviour set by the pay committee. He received an annual incentive last year of £1.83m after the committee ruled he had shown ‘leadership in promoting HSBC Values,’ including acting with ‘courageous integrity.’

The bank says on its website: ‘At HSBC we put great emphasis on our values. We want to ensure that our employees feel empowered to do the right thing and to act with courageous integrity. By doing so we will meet the expectations of society, customers, regulators and investors.’

The comments are at odds with the revelations emerging about its behaviour at its Swiss arm and with previous scandals including a £1.2bn fine for money laundering in Mexico and sanctions-busting in the Middle East. 

American lawmakers have warned that HSBC is in danger of further sanctions that could include losing its banking licence in the US over the Swiss allegations.

Across Britain’s other major banks, Barclays chief executive Anthony Jenkins could be in line for £1m bonus for 2014 while tax-payer backed Lloyds is expected to release long-term share awards that will total £7m.

RBS’s chief executive Ross McEwan will receive £1m salary and a £1m allowance but does not receive a bonus from the tax-payer controlled bank.

News of the size of the bonuses come at a particularly sensitive time ahead of polling day in May and follows another year of scandal for the banking industry which has been embroiled in a series of embarrassments from the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to the rigging of foreign exchange markets.

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘While the real value of wages has fallen every year since the crash, top bankers continue to rake it in. It is one rule for those at the top, and another for everyone else.

‘And when HSBC has come under such widespread criticism for its role in tax evasion and avoidance, bank customers will not understand huge bonuses especially when branches are being closed.’

David Hillman, Robin Hood Tax Campaign spokesman, said: ‘It's shocking that the chief executives of HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds are taking home more than a million pounds each in bonuses while their industry remains mired in scandal.

‘You might have thought the recent revelations of misdemeanours would prompt restraint, but the opposite is true - total remuneration packages for the three of them look set to exceed a staggering £5 million each.

‘It's high time the Government ensured banks contribute to society instead of lining their own pockets.’ 

Deborah Hargreaves, founding director of think tank High Pay Centre, said: ‘It is insensitive to be paying out such huge bonuses when we read about endless scandal when people are not enjoying pay rises themselves. There is a general feeling that banks haven’t been putting their houses in order.’
