Four-time overall champion and reigning Olympic downhill gold medalist Lindsey Vonn came in almost last at a World Cup downhill race at Canadaâ€™s Lake Louise, Alberta, on Friday.

It was the first time the American skier had raced in 10 months after coming back from having major knee surgery after a crash at the world championships in February.

It is also the first time she is racing since her recent crash on November 19 in Copper Mountain, Colorado, during a practice training session after which she was taken down the hill on a sled.

Vonn, 29, who had won seven consecutive races at Lake Louise, finished 40th of 60 starters at the first day of the championship.

She had returned to the slopes on Thursday for her first training run at Lake Louise, a course that has been dubbed 'Lake Lindsey' after the Olympian took 14 World Cup race victories there.

When she slid across the finish line after the training run she declared her repaired right knee was 'stable'.

It was her first training run since the high-speed crash at the world championships in February, where she tore two ligaments in her knee and broke a bone in her lower leg.

Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany took the title on Friday and won the World Cup downhill by more than a half-second for her first victory of the season, according to the Associated Press.

Hoefl-Riesch, the 2011 overall World 
Cup champion and a double gold medalist at the 2010 Olympics, finished 
the course in 1 minute, 56.03 seconds.

Marianne Kaufmann-Abderhalden of Switzerland was next in 1:56.73, with Elena Fanchini of Italy third in 1:57.23.

Lara Gut of Switzerland, who began the day leading the overall standings, was 10th.

There are also downhill events slated for
 Saturday and a super-G on Sunday at a mountain where Vonn has earned 14
 of her 59 career World Cup race wins. That includes three-victory 
sweeps in both 2011 and 2012.

She
 had hoped to return last week at Beaver Creek, Colo., not far from her 
home in Vail, but her setback from the crash on November 19 scrapped those 
plans.

The Winter Olympics in Sochi are just a few months away.

Vonn
 told the Associated Press last weekend that she needs another operation
 on her right knee but is trying to put it off as long as possible in 
order to be able to ski at the Sochi Olympics, which begin in a little 
more than two months.

Vonn is famously dating American golf pro, Tiger Woods.
