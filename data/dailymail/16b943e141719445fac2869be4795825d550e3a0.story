A shocking new video shows a man screaming in agony as police officers shock him with a Taser for 42 seconds without stopping after he tried to run away from them.

The video was posted online Saturday night and it has prompted a police investigation of the Fredericksburg, Virgina, officers involved in the incident.

The man, later identified as 36-year-old Lantz Day, had been a passenger in a car that had hit five parked vehicles as it sped down a street, the Free Lance-Star reports.

Tasered: Lantz Day can be seen making a break for it (left) after he was detained by police. Officers then shocked him with a Taser for 42 seconds until they cuffed him

Police Tasered him when he suddenly took off and tried to run from officers.

Officers say he was being unruly and had threatened to hurt anyone who had called police to report the out-of-control car.

Arrested: Lantz Day, 36, was charged with obstruction of justice

A Taser fires two sharp probes that imbed in the target's skin. The probes are attached to wires that deliver more 5,000 volts of electric shock.

The high voltage makes muscles to contract, usually causing the target of the Taser shock to fall to the ground and become temporarily unable to move arms or legs.Â 

Lanz can be heard screaming in pain and yelling 'Stop it! Stop it!' as he writhes in pain on the ground.

The distinct clicking sound of the Taser delivering electric shock to Day's body can be heard for unabated for fully 42 seconds until officers handcuffed him.

Police spokeswoman Natatia Bledsoe told the Free Lance-Star that the 2-minute video, which was posted to YouTube and several social media sites Saturday, shows only a portion of the incident.

She said the officers involved in Lanz's arrest are currently under investigation by the department.

Lanz, who was charged with obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor.
