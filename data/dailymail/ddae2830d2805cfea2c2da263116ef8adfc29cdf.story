Former Cuban president Fidel Castro's 88th birthday is being celebrated all over Cuba - but with there having been a rumoured 600-plus attempts of his life it is a miracle he has made it this far.

His birthday is today, and it is being recognised with tributes in official media, a concert and a photo exhibit in the capital Havana and a newly inaugurated restoration of the home where he was born.

Communist leader Castro is loathed by many exiles in Florida who say he ruled with an iron fist and stamped out civil liberties. He was celebrated on  Wednesday Island as a fighter for equality and social justice who defied the U.S. for five decades.

He ruled in Cuba from 1959 to 2008, when he retired following a near-fatal illness, ceding power to his younger brother Raul.

Fabian Escalante, who protected Castro during his 49 years in power, claims that there were 638 CIA plots to assassinate him, ranging from an exploding cigar to a poisonous fountain pen, mostly during the first half of the 1960s.

Some of these attempts were part of Operation Mongoose - a plan which aimed to take down the Cuban government.

Castro made his first public appearance in months when he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin

Some of the assassination plots were aired on Channel 4 in 2006, in a documentary called '638 Ways to Kill Castro'. 

One of the most famous came when the CIA hired his ex-mistress Marita Lorenz to feed him poisoned capsules. However, Castro found out about the attempt, and allegedly handed her a gun and told her to shoot him, which she said she could not.

The concert to celebrate Castro's remarkable 88 years took place last night, and featured Cuban duet Buena Fe.

The photographs at the exhibition were taken by Roberto Chile and were displayed at the Jose Marti Memorial. 

Meanwhile, an article in Communist Party newspaper Granma said 'paying homage to Fidel is a great party'.  

Earlier this year, a new book on the hidden life of  the Cuban leader claimed he lived in luxury on his own private island, which included a turtle farm.

It was thought that Castro lived a simple, austere life similar to his fellow Cubans in the communist country.

However, in the  book La Vie Cachée de Fidel Castro (Fidel Castro's Hidden Life), a former bodyguard says Castro never renounced 'capitalist comforts'.

Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, who worked for the leader for 17 years and now lives in America, says that the vast majority of his countrymen weren't aware of their leader's lavish lifestyle, which is in stark comparison to normal Cubans.

He claims that Castro had a private island, Cayo Piedra, south of the Bay of Pigs, describing it as a 'Garden of Eden', complete with a turtles and dolphin farm.

Castro rarely appears in public these days, and in recent years has not taken part in official celebrations of his birthday.
