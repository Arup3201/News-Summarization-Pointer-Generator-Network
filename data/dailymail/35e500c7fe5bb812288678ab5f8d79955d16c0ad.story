Tourists have fled a luxury resort on a Malaysian island after Al-Qaeda-linked gunmen stormed the hotel by boat, shot dead a policeman and kidnapped a second officer.

Eight assailants in military fatigues snuck in by boat, climbed onto a wharf and began unleashing a hail of bullets into the restaurant at Water Bungalow Resort on Mabul Island, off the north east coast of Borneo, shortly before midnight.

Police guards, who were on duty there due to previous attacks on islands off the east coast of Borneo, returned fire but one was fatally wounded and a second is believed to have been dragged away as a hostage.

The island is a popular destination for Western tourists attracted by the spectacular diving experience offered in the turquoise waters that are abundant with spectacular coral and exotic fish.

The resort was closed off today after guests were ordered to leave for their safety and because a large team of police arrived from Kuala Lumpur to search for the gunmen and carry out a forensic examination of the resort.

Tour officials said that despite the bullets that smashed into the restaurant and the reception area guests had not been injured, but it was not immediately known how close any were to being shot.

'I've contacted one of the salesmen for the resort and I've been told that all guests are safe and accounted for,' said Emily Majaham, a manager of the booking company, Asia Dive Holidays.

Another spokeswoman told the Daily Mail: 'We always have a number of guests from Britain, Australia, America and European countries staying with us. 

'I understand they have all been moved to other resorts or to other islands or the mainland.'

Police said that a marine police officer identified as 32-year-old Corporal Abdul Rajah Jamuan was shot dead and his colleague, Constable Zakiah Aleip remains missing, having possibly been taken away as a hostage.

Up to eight gunman in black shirts and and military fatigue pants came to the resort under cover of darknes and as they neared the jetty they began firing.

Bullets smashed into the reception area and the restaurant as the gunmen ran along the jetty. 

After a brief exchange of fire, the gunmen escaped, taking with them - it is believed - Constable Aleip and an M16 semi-automatic rifle.

Investigators believe the attackers are from the Al Qaeda-linked group Abu Sayyaf, based in the southern Philippines. 

The short stretch of water between their base and Borneo's outlying islands has made it relatively easy for militants to kidnap people.

Mabul Water Bungalows Resort, where a policeman was killed and another is missing

It was only in the past week that Malaysia stepped up security in the region after a state of abductions off Borneo's north east coast, an area that is notorious for human trafficking and drugs smuggling.

An initial security zone was established last year after Islamic guerrillas from the southern Philippines staged a bloody assault in the area, leaving dozens dead, including security forces.

The Abu Sayyaf group has also been blamed for numerous terror attacks and kidnappings in the Philippines.

The resort states on its website that it offers tourists 'an unforgettable encounter with the beauty of the coral seas and the laid back atmosphere of a luxury water resort.'

The 15 air conditioned bungalows stand on stilts over the water and meals are served in an open air pavilion restaurant. There is also a white-sand private beach.
