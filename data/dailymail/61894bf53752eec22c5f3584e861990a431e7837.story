Liverpool are locked in a straight fight with Inter Milan for Emre Can but are confident of landing him after discovering he has a £10million release clause in his Bayer Leverkusen contract.

Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller claimed there had been ‘no official approach’ for the 20-year old Germany Under 21 midfielder, but he is known to be aware that Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has made several personal checks on the former Bayern Munich prospect and wants to sign him this summer.

Inter are also keen, but sources close to Leverkusen believe Can will opt for the Barclays Premier League ahead of Serie A and is ready to push for his release clause to be activated.

A fee of around £9.6million would represent a bargain for an energetic box-to-box midfielder whose stamina levels have been likened to Forrest Gump by one Bundesliga observer, who said: ‘He just never stops running and would be perfect for Liverpool.’

Rodgers’ chances of winning the race to sign him can only be enhanced by his agent being a familiar face at Anfield. Reza Fazeli took Nuri Sahin to Liverpool and is well known among Anfield bosses.
