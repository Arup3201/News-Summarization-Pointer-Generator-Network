Diane Krish-Veeramany, 30, with her newborn son Jonah

A teacher gave birth in a classroom the day before she was due to start maternity leave – forcing her  colleagues to act as midwives.

Diane Krish-Veeramany, 30, went into labour at 39 weeks just as the morning school bell rang last Thursday.

After just 20 minutes of contractions, she gave birth on a chair in an empty classroom helped by three teaching assistants, who took directions from paramedics over the phone to deliver baby Jonah.

The school head had rang an ambulance but the healthy 9lb boy arrived before it got there.

Mrs Krish-Veeramany, 30, who also has
an 18-month-year-old, Noah, with her husband Vijaye, 31, said the birth
was like nothing she had ever planned.

She
said: ‘Everyone who has had a baby knows you try and plan these things 
in your head but everything happened so quickly, it was nothing like I 
had imagined.

‘It 
was so perfect, he’s completely fine, I’m completely fine, and I’m 
grateful because otherwise I would have had it in the back of a car.’

Mrs Krish-Veeramany, a junior 
teacher, said she had arrived to work at Manford Primary School, in 
Hainault, north east London, early to attend Breakfast Club last 
Thursday.

Shortly after eating a slice of toast she was getting hot flushes and felt a few tightenings, but carried on as normal.

She said: ‘At about 8.20am I text my husband saying I don’t feel right. Then after a staff meeting I spoke to the head and said I felt a bit funny and couldn’t stay at school.

‘The head asked if I wanted an ambulance but I refused and said it was nothing serious. I was walking to the other side of the school with my teaching assistant when I felt something.

‘The children were about to come in and I said I didn’t want the kids seeing me like this because I didn’t want to frighten them so we went into a classroom that was not being used.’

She said she sat at a computer desk on a computer chair as her contractions become stronger.

Now joined by three teaching assistants, she still refused an ambulance, and was determined to wait for her husband to arrive so he could drive her to hospital.

She said: ‘I was adamant I was not going to have a baby on the classroom floor.

‘But twenty minutes after the contractions began and within 40 minutes of telling the head I felt sick a little bundle of joy arrived.’

Colleagues Sam Mustafa, Dita Gojnovci and Chris Sword delivered the baby while taking instructions from paramedics over the phone.

Her husband made it just in time for the birth and a teaching assistant caught the baby as he came out at 9.13am - as Mrs Krish-Veeramany remained practically standing.

Mrs Krish-Veeramany, from Ilford, Essex, added: ‘One of the midwives (teaching assistants) said you’ve got a boy, and he’s crying.’

By the time the paramedics arrived the baby was already in its mother’s arms.

It was only until after the birth that towels were collected from around the school and Jonah was wrapped in a cardigan.

Jonah’s first presents were nappies and an outfit from a nearby shop.

Mrs Krish-Veeramany said she had been planning to finish work last Friday for a leisurely week off before giving birth.

She added: ‘I intended to work until the week before but I didn’t dream I would have to have my baby in a classroom.

‘I’m still in shock, I really am, I can’t believe I had him at school. There was so much hype, all the children were so excited.

‘His dad said he was in such a hurry to get here but he still late for his first day at school.’

Head teacher Tina Jacobs said: ‘We phoned an ambulance but before they could get here she gave birth in an empty classroom with three classroom assistants. It happened so fast.

‘The three classroom assistants were brilliant and I awarded them certificates and medals in Friday’s assembly.

‘Everyone has seen this sort of thing on the television before but you never dream it will happen in real life.’
