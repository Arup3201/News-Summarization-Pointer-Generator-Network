For many New Yorkers, the subway is an easy - often, stressful - means to get across the city.

But for one couple, it was a place of joy on Friday as they exchanged their wedding vows on it.  

In a moving ceremony, Hector Irakliotis, 26, and Tatyana Sandler, 25, got married in front of dozens of stunned commuters on the N train as it crossed the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn.

They had  chosen to wed on the subway line because they had spent a large amount of time traveling on it during their courtship, according to the New York Daily News.

'We’ve been through a lot. Good times, bad times, and a lot of the good times have taken place on the train,' Mr Irakliotis told the newspaper. 

'Confessions of love, reconciliations, goofy, ridiculous conversations - the whole spectrum. In New York, you spend so much time on the train, we thought why not?'

On the day, Mr Irakliotis, a game designer,  boarded the line at Kings Highway at around 3.30pm with his groomsmen, who then decorated the car's poles and seats with white ribbons.

Unorthodox: The couple, who exited the N train at Canal Street and headed to a bar for  drinks, had chosen to wed on the subway line because they had spent a large amount of time traveling on it during their courtship

Donning a black suit and bow tie, the groom-to-be told commuters: 'Everyone, hi. I have an announcement to make. I am going to be getting married in 20 minutes.'

As wedding guests flocked into the car, he then invited others to stay to watch the ceremony, but asked if they would kindly move to the back, which they willingly did.

Ten stops later, a beaming Miss Sandler, a Ukranian film editor, boarded the line at 36th Street, before walking down the aisle to 'City Love' by John Mayer, played on the best man's iPhone. 

The bride-to-be, who was donning a beautiful white gown and was accompanied by her maid of honor, then exchanged vows with Mr Irakliotis as the train traveled over the Manhattan Bridge.

Speaking of the ceremony, performed by an interfaith chaplain, Miss Sandler said her partner had deliberately planned it so they would see the skyline as they were wed.

'I’m originally from Ukraine, and each time we’d come back here, I’d say to Hector, "It doesn't feel like home until I see the skyline as we're crossing the bridge". And he remembered that,' she said.

Arrangements: On the day, Mr Irakliotis boarded the subway at Kings Highway in Brooklyn. Miss Sandler then got on at 36th Street. They wed as they crossed the Manhattan Bridge, before exiting the train at Canal Street

'He planned it out specifically so that we'd see the skyline as we were married.' 

The couple, who were applauded and cheered as they became husband and wife, exited the subway at Canal Street in Manhattan, before heading to a bar for celebratory drinks.

Guests later told the newspaper of their shock at the unorthodox ceremony, with many deeming it 'cute', 'romantic' and 'unique'.
