A new survey of voters has revealed the TV characters they most associate with party leaders with David Cameron described as Dick Dastardly, while Ed Miliband is compared to Mr Bean.

The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also saw Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg likened to Fred from Scooby Doo.

While Ukip's Nigel Farage was associated with tough-guy actor Ray Winstone.

The survey comes as the poll that a study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral 'deadlock' in May, with neither party able to govern. 

It also revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown’s seat and rob Labour of a Commons majority. 

It suggests the Scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in May, winning as many as 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats – up from just six at present.

The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. 

The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat.

The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority.

Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year’s independence referendum had thrown a ‘giant spanner in Labour’s works’. 

The poll suggests a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be likely.

The two parties would have a combined total of 328 seats – producing a Commons majority of just three.

Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, could become deputy prime minister in any deal. 

His party has ruled out supporting the Conservatives.

And it has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent.

Gordon Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. 

But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead.

In Edinburgh South West, where former chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll predicts an SNP win with a 22 per cent swing. 

The Scottish nationalists are also set to win Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983.

New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire – but he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining.

Polling was also conducted in a number of marginal seats in England and Wales.

The Tories are set to hold on in Vale of Glamorgan as well as Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, where they are narrowly ahead. 

But Labour is edging towards victory in two other Tory-held marginals – Norwich North and High Peak, in Derbyshire.
