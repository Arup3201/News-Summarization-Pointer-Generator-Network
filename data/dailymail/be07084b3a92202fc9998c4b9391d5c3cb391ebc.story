One of the world's most revered style
icons, David Beckham has surely spearheaded more trends than any other 
man in the public eye.

But
while he has dabbled with double leather, manskirts and posing in his 
pants, no element of his style has changed more often than his hair.

Now a new poll, designed to find out  men’s favourite hairstyles of the last 100 years, reveals that Mr Beckham has sported all the top ten hairstyles of all time – and the three worst ones, too.

The footballer, who was recently signed as Paris Saint-Germain's forward, showcased the number one hairstyle - the quiff - as he arrived at his hotel in Valencia today.

Number one: The quiff, made famous by Elvis in the 60s and one of Beckham's favorite styles was voted top 'do'

The father-of-four, who has dabbled with 
double leather, manskirts and posing in his pants, has changed his hairstyle almost more often than he's changed his clothes - and in doing so, has notched up every hairstyle on the best - and worst - list.

The poll revealed the quiff - the classic slicked-back look made famous by Elvis Presley in the Fifties -  as the top hairstyle in a new survey of 1,000 men.

In second place was the classic side parting and in third place was 'the Bieber' - the long-fringed look favoured by the Canadian pop hunk.

More modern cuts dominated the top ten, and a short-back-and-sides – the staple haircut of men for decades – didn’t even make the top 20.

Researchers were stunned when they studied the results to discover that style icon Beckham, 37, has adopted every single hairstyle in the top ten.

The classic side sweep was voted the second best style, and seeing it on David in his latest H&M underwear advert it is not hard to see why is such a popular look

The brushed forward, forehead sweep, now synonymous with pop sensation Justin Bieber (left) was voted the third best style and has, of course, also been seen on Beckham (right)

The 'Spiky Crop'- shaved at the sides and spiky on the top- also made the top ten

More modern cuts such as the pony tail (left) and the centre parting (right) dominated the top ten

Cornrows, which even manage to look bad on David Beckham, were voted one of the top three worse hairstyles a man could have

Beckham has sported some truly bizarre hairstyles such as the Mohican (left) and curtains (right) which both made the top three worst styles

Men were also asked to nominate the three worst hairstyles. These were curtains, cornrows and a mohican.

And Becks has had all three of these looks, too.

The poll was carried out by the Crown Clinic in Manchester - Britain's leading hair transplant centre.

It said that more men seeking transplants wanted their hair to be like Beckham's than any other celebrity.

The quiff became a staple of the British Teddy Boy movement in the Fifties before going out of fashion in the Sixties.

In more recent years, David Beckham, 
Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw and pop stars like Zayn Malik from One 
Direction have all helped to spark a revival.

Becks has had a quiff this year and 
is currently wearing his hair longer and slicked back in a side parting,
as he showed off in his latest H&M underwear campaign.

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, from the 
Crown Clinic, said: 'We will see men at the clinic who have a picture of
David Beckham or sometimes another celebrity and they will ask us: 'Can
I look like that?'

‘On
most occasions, we can help patients to look like their idol. If they 
can fill out their hairline with a hair transplant, they can adopt many 
of the looks Beckham has.

‘Beckham has a wonderful head of hair
and he has adopted so many amazing styles - that is why he is an 
inspiration to so many British men.

‘Whatever look he adopts always seems right - and sets the fashion for other men.

‘It is not surprise to me that, at some point in his life, he has adopted every single look in our top ten.’

Dr Shahmalak, hair loss expert on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, said for many balding men the only style option was the short crop - number 8 in the poll.

He explained:  ‘Men who are losing their hair typically shave it off to cover up their baldness.

‘That really only gives them one option on their hairstyle - and after a while that can get a little dull.

‘A shaved head is not appropriate for all professions - if you think of lawyers or actors.

‘We work with a lot of celebrities who are losing their hair but cannot adopt the same look all the time. They come to us for a transplant and it gives their careers a boost.’

Dr Shahmalak has performed hair transplants on several stars including Christian Jessen from Embarrassing Bodies and the model-turned-actor Calum Best.

There was a 25 per cent increase in bookings after Wayne Rooney went public with his transplant.
