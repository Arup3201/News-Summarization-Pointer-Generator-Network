She's the creative mind behind the elegant and original handmade garments worn by the likes of Angelina Jolie and Beyoncé.

But the story of Ralph & Russo's co-founder and creative director, Tamara Ralph, begins in Sydney's beach town of Cronulla, where she grew up sketching and sewing clothes for her friends and family.

The 31-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that her childhood memories consist of sitting in the small sewing room alongside her mother and grandmother, surrounded by archives of sewing patterns, watching them at work.

Tamara Ralph, from Cronulla in Sydney, and Michael Russo, from Carseldine in Queensland, started their brand in a small office with one furnishing, one mannequin and one computer. Now the duo's international business is designing the clothes of A-list stars like Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie

'A lot of my family were in the fashion industry; my mother worked as a stylist and is now an interior designer, my grandmother and great grandmother were both couturiers, so it was always something I had an interest in from a young age,' Ms Ralph said.

'I used to watch them create beautiful dresses in our sewing room and when I got older, at about 10, they started teaching me draping and hand sewing and I was so interested in it that I would spend all my time sewing and sketching – I was just obsessed with creating.

'When I was really young, even two or three, my mother says I would refuse to sketch anything but dresses. If I got asked to draw a house at school, I said "no, I'm drawing a dress".

'It started as a passion, and when I was very young I would just start making dresses for myself and obviously when my girlfriends saw what I was wearing they'd want one as well.'

Ralph's interest in fashion grew at her Cronulla home, where she would watch her mother and grandmother for hours in their sewing room. By 10-years-old, she was learning how to hand sew on her own and would eventually make clothes for her self and her friends 

Now, she and her fiancé Michael Russo are the brains behind the hundred-million dollar exclusive brand Ralph & Russo, whose fashion expertise is in such high-demand that they've joined the ranks of Chanel, Christian Dior and Valentino and have been invited to the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris – something no Australian has ever achieved before; the highest accolade in in Haute Couture.

Their recently launched accessories range – made-up of sheik handmade bags and shoes – has already sold out. 

But their unique business was born from just a chance encounter. After studying at the White House Institute of design in Sydney, Ralph set out to London for a holiday, where she hoped to make a break in the world of fashion.

Instead, she ran into Russo, a banker from Carseldine in Queensland, who was sent to London for work.

This year, Ralph & Russo were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that Angelina Jolie donned at the premiere of Unbroken (right) as well as Beyoncé  shimmering costumes during her Mrs Carter World Tour

Jolie's dove grey couture suit, that she dressed in when presented with her Damehood by the Queen, was also a Ralph & Russo design

'Within four hours of arriving in the country, Michael and I accidentally ran into each other and started talking for some reason and we just kept talking for an hour and a half – it was a fate encounter,' Ralph said.

With both of them looking for something different, they noticed a gap in the London market for Haute Couture and decided to take a leap of faith and combine their skills, while taking advantage of the international clientele constantly coming through London.

'We started in a very humble office – one furnishing, one mannequin, one computer – and grew to offices, and then floors, and then buildings,' Russo told Daily Mail Australia.

Fast forward ten years later and the couple are expanding rapidly internationally – with boutiques and show rooms opening in Paris, New York and Hong Kong. Not to mention the constant travelling they do, to meet personally with their international clients in their very homes.

The duo said that they began as a word-of-mouth business, 'we'd do one dress at an event and the next day we'd have five ladies calling and asking for something – it just spiralled'.

But this year, they were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that Angelina Jolie donned at the premiere of Unbroken, as well as the dove grey couture suit she dressed in when she was presented with her Damehood from the Queen.

Beyoncé is another known fan of the couple's creative designs, who Ralph & Russo said they worked with right from the begging of their business. The American singer chose their shimmering costumes for her Mrs Carter World Tour, including the iconic white crystal and pearl bodysuit, worn at her opening performance.

Their unique business was born from a chance encounter. Ralph literally stumbled into Russo during a holiday in London 10 years ago, and the pair struck up a conversation

'It's a lot of fun,' Ralph said of working with Beyoncé, refusing to give too much away. 

'We prefer to work closely with a small selection of people so that we can work together and collaborate and create the perfect garment. They get really involved and there's a lot of collaboration.'

Russo added, of Beyoncé and Jolie: 'They're just really lovely to work with. It's all about the event and finding what's perfect for that event and how they want to be perceived so that we can design something for them especially.

Ralph only shared minimal details about one of the couple's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding - admitting that she would design four dresses and choose what she'd wear on the day, to surprise her fiancée 

'We have private collections for a lot of our clients so that's why we prefer to keep it very exclusive and personal.'

The couple are very serious about their privacy. Alongside their refusal to comment on rumours that they're in talks with royal Kate Middleton, Ralph only shared minimal details about one of the couple's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding.

'It's something that's still in the works – it's a big secret,' Ralph said of her wedding dress.

'There will be a number of designs - I thought I should design about four and then I can choose what I'm going to wear on the day, so that he [Michael] doesn't know which one it will be.'
