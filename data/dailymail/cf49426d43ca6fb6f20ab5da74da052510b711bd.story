A firm has been fined after a worker was crushed to death by a three tonne steel container.

Michael Wickstead was working at a factory in Oldham, Greater Manchester when he was struck by an object which was knocked onto him by two cranes which had collided.

The 63-year-old, from Radcliffe, Bury, suffered fatal crush injuries as a result of the tragic incident in Chadderton.

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) launched an investigation into what happened, on July 11, 2011, at Refinery Supplies Ltd.

During the course of the probe it was discovered cranes had collided on several other occasions at the site on the Greengate Industrial Estate and they were prosecuted.

Manchester Crown Court heard that Mr Wickstead had been involved in manufacturing the large steel container, which was used to hold molten lead or zinc, and had been resting on a stand with chains hanging down to it from an overhead crane.

A colleague was using another crane on the same overhead rail to move another container when the cranes collided, knocking the one Mr Wickstead was working on off its stand.

Michael was hit by a steel container which caused fatal crush injuries.

The court was told Refinery Supplies should have had a clear working system in place to prevent workers from being injured by the cranes. 

This could have included fitting anti-collision devices to the cranes, or making sure there was a safe method in place to avoid the two cranes coming into contact with each other.

Refinery Supplies Ltd, of Greenside Way, has now been ordered to pay a total of £125,000 for failing to do more to prevent the tragedy.

The company was fined £90,000 and ordered to pay £35,000 in prosecution costs after pleading guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

Speaking after the hearing, HSE Inspector Helen Jones said: 'Michael sadly lost his life because the safety standards of his employer fell well below the minimum legal standards.

'Refinery Supplies knew there was a risk of cranes colliding at the factory and, in fact, this had happened on several previous occasions without the same catastrophic result. 

'However, the firm failed to take any action to make sure workers weren't put at risk of being injured.

'It's vital that manufacturers carefully consider the dangers facing their employees and then implement safety improvements.

'If Refinery Supplies had done this then Michael's tragic death could have been avoided.'
