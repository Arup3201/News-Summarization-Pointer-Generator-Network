A mother whose weight ballooned after passing her driving test has told how ditching her car helped her to beat the bulge.

Alyson Larkin gorged on junk food and fizzy drinks and saw her weight soar after she stopped walking regularly.

The 33-year-old lived on microwave meals and takeaways while drinking five cans of coke and downing a glass of wine every day.

But the beauty therapist decided to change her unhealthy lifestyle when she could no longer fit into her trousers.

Alyson of Gourock, Inverclyde, sold her Vauxhall Corsa car and started a strict exercise regime and healthy diet which soon saw the weight fall off.

She lost three stone (42lbs) and dropped three dress sizes through an online weight loss programme that encourages people to eat healthily and exercise.

She said: 'All my life I had been eight and a half stone but when I turned 29, I learned to drive and bought a car.

'Pretty soon I wasn't walking anywhere anymore. I used to walk around seven miles a day and never took public transport.

'I was also working 30 hours a week in a beauty salon and studying at college. Because I was shattered I would just have a microwave meal or a takeaway, like an Indian or Chinese most nights.'

Alyson sold her Vauxhall Corsa car and started a strict exercise regime and healthy diet which soon saw her extra weight fall off 

She continued: 'I would also have a glass or two of wine as I was over-tired and I thought it would help me sleep.

'Before I knew it, I was always wearing leggings and jogging bottoms because that was how I felt comfortable.'

During this time, Alyson, who is single, said her weight changed from eight stone (112lbs) to 11 stone (154lbs), with her dress going from a size 8 to a size 14/16.

She added: 'I didn't realise how much weight I had put on as I wore a stretchy tunic and leggings for work.

'But I finally realised when I went to try on a pair of size 10 trousers and I couldn't get anywhere near fitting into them.'

After getting a car, Alyson said her weight changed from eight stone (112 lbs) to 11 stone (154lbs), with her dress going from a size 8 to a size 14/16 

She continued: 'One day I was moaning to a friend about how much weight I had gained and she said that'll be because of the car, you're not exercising anymore.

'I realised she was right and set about getting rid of it. It made me really sad because it was a mint green Corsa and pretty distinctive but I had to let it go.'

Alyson then stumbled across a weight loss scheme called 'Frank Personal Training,' which she says has changed her life.

She changed her diet and started taking regular exercise.

Since changing her diet and starting to take regular exercise, Alyson has successfully lost three stone and is back to her original weight of just over eight stone (112lbs).

Alyson said: 'When I came off the diet coke in the first couple of days, I was shaking and had such bad headaches.

'But after just two weeks I could feel the difference. I had so much more energy and I was bouncing out of bed in the morning.'

Alyson has successfully lost three stone and is back to her original weight of just over eight stone.

She added: 'I have always been really chatty and outgoing but I think I hid how I was feeling. Now I have bundles of energy and I feel a lot more confident.

'But getting rid of the car was the best thing I have done and helped more than anything.'
