Comparison: Bernie Attridge, Flintshire County Council deputy leader, 
said closing the school would save £119,328 per year

A Labour councillor has said pupils from one of Britain's smallest schools may as well be sent to Eton with the money it costs to run the establishment.

Ysgol Rhes y Cae, which has just nine pupils, costs Flintshire County Council more than £14,000 per 
pupil, per year or £126,000 per year.

It now wants to close the school in north-east Wales to save money.

Bernie Attridge, council deputy leader said while no-one wanted to see any school closed, 'with the money that would be saved we may as well send each child to Eton'.

However, fees at the prestigious 
college, which boasts David Cameron and Boris Johnson as alumni, are almost 
£31,000 per pupil, per year, meaning it would cost £279,000 to send all 
nine children there.

In the past two years the number of children attending the Welsh school, which has room for 45 pupils, has almost halved.

Council officers say the annual cost per pupil at Ysgol Rhes y Cae is £14,029 compared to the county average £3,139.

Flintshire Council says closing the school would save £119,328 per year.

Mr Attridge, said: 'Why should children in one school only have £3,000 spent on them when some in another have £14,000 spent on them?'

Pupils will be sent to nearby schools and teachers redeployed although redundancies cannot be ruled out.

The school is controlled by the Church in Wales and the Diocese of St Asaph called the decision 'sad news'.

Closure was first proposed in 2010 
when pupil numbers dropped to 18 but the plans were put on hold after 
objections from parents and teachers.

However, the school’s long-term future has been in doubt ever since and pupil numbers have continued to dwindle.

Cabinet
member for education Colin Bithell said keeping the school open was 
'unrealistic' and any savings would be pumped back into the authority’s 
education budget.

He said: 'The school is the smallest in the county. The cost per child is four-and-a-half times the county average.

'We have to draw a line somewhere in the sand and in some ways it is quite unrealistic to continue.

'We would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.'

Parents, teachers and governors will now be consulted on the planned closure and a final decision is expected in two months.

Council leader, Aaron Shotton, said: 'Uncertainty has existed in the local community for some time.

'It is clearly a very emotive issue but every surplus place that exists is a tax on other children.'

Cllr Bithell believes pupils would receive higher quality education by moving to larger schools.

He said: 'It is not only about savings, it is also about the quality of education that is being provided for children in schools of this size.

'You can’t even have a football team or a netball team when you have classes of this size.

'There are adequate places to accommodate the children affected close by. We want to get as much money out there for the benefit of every child in our schools.'

A spokesman for the Diocese of St Asaph, said: 'While this is sad news, our primary concern is for the pupils and staff at Ysgol Rhes y Cae and we will be supporting the governors in finding a way forward that meets the needs of everyone.'
