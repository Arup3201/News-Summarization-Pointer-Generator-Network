Mile Jedinak admits it is becoming difficult for Crystal Palace players to come to terms with recent refereeing decisions which have gone against the club.

The Eagles' skipper was sent off in the 3-1 reverse to Sunderland on Monday night after seeing his side have two legitimate penalty claims turned away by referee Phil Dowd.

Santiago Vergini was lucky to avoid conceding a first-minute penalty when he brought down Fraizer Campbell, with Patrick van Aanholt tangling with Wilfried Zaha in what could have been easily given as a spot-kick.

The Crystal Palace skipper leaves the pitch at Selhurst Park on what was a miserable night for the home night 

As it turned out neither were given and Steven Fletcher put the Black Cats ahead before the break and, despite Palace drawing level courtesy of a Wes Brown own goal, Jordi Gomez and Fletcher struck either side of Jedinak's red card to seal a second Barclays Premier League win of the campaign.

'I think we gave them two soft goals,' said Jedinak. 'Apart from that I thought we were really good.

'I think they (the penalty claims) were both pretty clear to be honest with you, so, there's not a lot I'm going to comment on in that sense, but he (Dowd) made both decisions and we have taken the brunt of them. It was unfortunate - both times.

Neil Warnock was unhappy with the decision not to award a penalty and made his feelings known to Dowd 

'It's disappointing when you don't receive the decisions and particularly so early on, particularly when you're on top. You're not going to cry over that, but when they are that obvious it's a little bit difficult.'

The defeat saw Palace drop to 17th in the table, with only a better goal record keeping Neil Warnock's side outside of the relegation zone.

The 65-year-old revealed after the match that Jedinak had apologised for his sending off and labelled the two bookings as 'silly' - with the Australia midfielder now ruled out of Saturday's trip to Manchester United.

'He (Dowd) decided to give me a yellow on the first one which for whatever reason, the second one I got caught in him it looked like he was right behind me and he's deemed it a yellow card,' Jedinak added.

'I've got to accept that now, I'm disappointed within myself to be missing the game and not being a part (of it) with the boys on Saturday.

'We've got a game in five days' time, everybody has got to be ready and prepared. It's an opportunity for somebody else to step in and whoever is fit and available to be ready and I think the boys are going to give a good account of themselves. I have no doubt about that.'

The win at Selhurst Park was Sunderland's second of the season and manager Gus Poyet will be hoping the result banishes the embarrassment of an 8-0 thrashing at Southampton two weeks ago.

Gomez grabbed his first league goal for the Wearsiders since his summer move from Wigan and the Spaniard is hoping to build on the victory when they welcome Everton to the Stadium of Light on Sunday.

'It's a very good result for us,' he said.

'It was much needed and it's an important three points on the board. I'm very happy to get my goal but more so with the team performance and final result.

'We're now looking forward to playing at home on Sunday in front of the fans, turn in another performance and get another three points.

'Our fans were brilliant. It has been tough for them lately after the last two results but they backed us in their numbers and they deserve to enjoy this result, they are very important for us and did us proud here.'

One downside on the evening for Sunderland was a shoulder injury suffered by Van Aanholt during his challenge with Zaha.

The former Chelsea full-back was taken straight to hospital and Poyet confirmed after the match that the Dutchman had suffered a dislocation.
