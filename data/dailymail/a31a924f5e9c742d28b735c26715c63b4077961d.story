Former Hey Dad! child star Sarah Monahan said she 'got away light' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict.

The principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! are to appear on A Current Affair on Wednesday, following leading actor Hughes, 65, being convicted of child sex offences on Tuesday.

Monahan, who was six years old when she joined the show in 1987, first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. She went on to repeat allegations on A Current Affair, that she was abused while on the set of Hey Dad! by Hughes.

In another interview on A Current Affair a year later, Monahan said she planned on initiating legal action against Hughes.

Now 36, the actress said Hughes' guilty verdict of 10 offences relating to the sexual and indecent assault of young girls in the '80s and '90s 'vindicated' her.

Monahan revealed on the program: 'It wasn’t about me. He did some awful, terrible things to them. I feel like I got away lightly,' she told Grimshaw.

She claims to have been just 10 years old when she was first flashed by Hughes.

Channel Nine revealed on Tuesday night that Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan, and Sarah Monahan would appear together on the show and be interviewed by Tracy Grimshaw.

The program's executive producer Grant Williams stopped short of what the cast members were likely to say during the interview, but heaped praise on the victims, the police, and - of course - A Current Affair itself for bringing the case to light.

On the Today Show on Wednesday morning, Grimshaw defended the cast's decision to reveal the abuse. 'They have been punished within the industry for speaking out and I think that is the most shocking thing that Hughes has done that, that culture of shut up that culture of cover up,' the host said.

By speaking up, Grimshaw said it would empower other victims who were abused as children and break the culture that enabled Hughes to act in this way.

'Some knew more than others. Ben and Simone knew, Chris knew a little bit, this culture of cover up,' which she added still exists now.

'We know he did more things to more people but they don’t want to bring it up,' she said.

Simone Buchanan supported Monahan in 2010, and testified at Hughes's trial that she had heard allegations about his inappropriate behaviour, but had not seen it herself.

In a statement released to the Press, Mr Williams said: 'I just want to pay tribute once again to these brave women who had the courage to come forward. Without them, justice would not have been possible.

'I’m also very proud of the role my team at A Current Affair played in bringing our investigation to the attention of the police, and congratulate the detectives of the NSW Sex Crime Squad on their outstanding police work.'

Robert Hughes was convicted on ten of 11 child sex charges on Tuesday - the jury being discharged after not being able to reach a majority verdict on the 11th charge.

Brought into Sydney's Downing Centre District Court by prison officers, 65-year-old Hughes looked teary but managed to mouth 'I'm OK' from the dock to his wife.

Celebrity agent Robyn Gardiner asked for a vacant seat in the public gallery so she could be closer to her husband during the jury's verdict on the final two of 11 child sex charges.

A Current Affair has a long history with the case, with the Channel Nine show claiming that it was its investigation and its naming of Hughes in 2010 that prompted the police to investigate further.

On Monday, while Hughes was still awaiting the jury's verdicts on two charges, a Current Affair's Tracy Grimshaw spoke about the case with reporter Ben McCormack.

During the TV segment, Grimshaw said: 'Our involvement in this case dates back to 2010, when we undertook an intensive investigation, and took the unprecedented step of naming Hughes.'

McCormack replied: 'We copped a lot of criticism at the time. People were saying "This is trial by media, why don't these victims go straight to the police? What's the media got to do with this?".

Hughes, pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences  committed between 1983 and 1991

'When it comes to historical sexual assault cases, they're very very difficult to prove... If you're a sole victim it's going to be your word versus the perpetrator's. It would be very difficult to come forward.

'Where we came in in this particular case, when people came forward to tell us their stories, other people heard those stories and felt that they could also come forward, and that of course is what led to the police investigation.'

McCormack led the praise for officers from the NSW Sex Crimes Squad, who investigated the case for years and had the very difficult taksk of convincing the victims to press forward with their stories and bring a conviction against Hughes.

McCormack said: 'The strength of the prosecution case lay in the fact that these women didn't know each other; these women didn't know each other as little girls, they didn't know each other as adults, yet they were all telling very similar stories.

'Added to that, two of these victims went to the police at the time to make complaints.' 

The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault.

The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial.

Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed.

Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her her to swim between his legs and trapping her there.

Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself.

Hughes denied all the allegations.

The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations.
