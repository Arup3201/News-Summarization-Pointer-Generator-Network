Older mothers with high expectations are putting maternity wards under increasing strain, midwives have warned.

The obesity epidemic is also contributing to a 'buckling' maternity service, according to the Royal College of Midwives.

It says that the combination of a baby boom and staff shortages means the NHS coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for.

In other words, it is lacking resources to deliver one in five of the 700,000 babies born in England each year.

In its annual State of Maternity 
Services report, the RCM says the situation is exacerbated by growing 
numbers of complex pregnancies.

There are also concerns that older mothers have idealised views about the care they should receive.

'The importance of complexity on the midwifery workload has been often overlooked,' says the report.

'One example of rising complexity is the continuing growth of births to older women.'

In
 2012, there were almost twice as many babies born to women aged over 40
 than a decade earlier – the biggest rise in birth rate in any age 
group.

The RCM says that 
while older women are as entitled to maternity care as their younger 
counterparts, they are likely to require more support during pregnancy 
and labour.

They are more 
likely to miscarry, as well as to have complicated pregnancies and to 
deliver babies that are underweight or premature.

Stillbirths are more 
than twice as common in over-35s than younger women, while deterioration
 of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having 
babies with Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders.

It is claimed that older mothers can also be more demanding, as they have had time to build up a 'rose-tinted' view of the type of care they should receive.

The obesity crisis is adding to the strain, with tens of thousands of women requiring more demanding care in pregnancy because of  their weight.

Around half of women of child-bearing age are overweight or obese and more than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese.

This raises their odds of dying in pregnancy, of their baby being stillborn and of a host of pregnancy complications. The RCM's most recent estimates suggest that there are nearly 50,000 more mothers-to-be in need of extra help because of their weight than 20 years earlier.

And it is not just mothers that are getting older – midwives are, too.

The largest single age group is now 45 to 49, leading to fears that the staffing shortage will be compounded when they retire.

The RCM acknowledges that midwives are being recruited.

Between May 2010, when the Coalition was formed, and July last year the number of full-time-midwives working in the NHS in England rose by 1,311 or 6.5 per cent.

Statistics from the start of 2013 also suggest that the birth rate has started to drop.

But the RCM stresses that with England still 4,800 midwives short, there is no room for complacency.

Louise Silverton, the RCM's director of midwifery, said: 'Midwives in England have been run ragged for years as the number of babies born has gone up and up.

'Thousands of midwives short, as we are today, they are still running to catch up.

'We have reached a make or break point. The Government must  continue to pump money into maternity care. We need determined action from the Government and the NHS.'
