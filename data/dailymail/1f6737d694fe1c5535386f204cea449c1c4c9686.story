U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating complaints that the ceilings can catch fire in 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs.

The probe, announced Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covers an estimated 146,000 of the popular sport utility vehicles.

Three customers complained to the government that their ceilings caught fire near the passenger-side sun visor while they were driving, starting with a burning smell, then smoke and flames. In all three cases, customers lowered their windows to clear the smoke, but that increased the fire's intensity, NHTSA said in documents posted on its website.

Ceiling fires: The probe, announced Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covers an estimated 146,000 of the popular sport utility vehicles

Sun visor: Three customers complained to the government that their ceilings caught fire near the passenger-side sun visor while they were driving, starting with a burning smell, then smoke and flames

The ceiling fire probe comes after years
of criticism that older model Cherokees were erupting into flames 
because of a fault with the fuel tanks.

In all three cases, the fires 
continued after the SUVs had been shut off, and flames had to be put out
with fire extinguishers or by firefighters. The flames caused a sunroof
to shatter in one instance, while in another, a burning sun visor fell 
to the passenger seat and spread the flames, NHTSA said.

The safety agency said it had no reports of any injuries.

After the fires were put out, all three SUVs had to be towed to a dealership for repairs.

Investigators will decide if the problem is serious enough to cause a recall.

In
one of the complaints, a customer told NHTSA that he or she smelled 
smoke while driving a Grand Cherokee. The driver rolled down the 
windows, then saw white smoke on the right side of the SUV.

'Then the passenger visor melted off 
the ceiling,' the customer wrote. That was followed by a fire in the 
hole near where the visor had been attached. 'The fire dripped down onto
the passenger seat and I called 911 and pulled over.'

The customer said two men used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames, according to the complaint.

Chrysler
said its engineers are working with the government on the case. The 
company said no determination has been made about the cause and the 
investigation is in its early stages. 'A vehicle fire is a complex 
event. Determining whether any two fires share a cause is a complicated 
analysis,' Chrysler said in a statement.

The
company said it will advise customers if they need to take any action, 
and those with concerns can consult with dealers or call Chrysler at 
1-800-853-1403.

Other problems: The ceiling fires come after a government probe into fuel tanks on older models. Experts claim the tanks are vulnerable to rupture in rear-end collisions, something which just last week tragically killed a family of seven, including four young children

Victims: Lindsey Williams, Yazmin Goldman and Arielle Goldman were killed in the devastating crash and resulting fire in Indiana last week

The ceiling fire investigation comes after claims older model Cherokees were erupting into flames because of a deadly fault with the fuel tanks.

In June, the government called for a major recall of nearly three million Chrysler sport utility vehicles claiming a deadly fire hazard in the design had left more than 51 people dead.

The automaker denied the claims saying that its vehicles are safe and not defective.

But the government's experts said initial findings show a safety defect in older model Jeeps â€” the Jeep Grand Cherokee from 1993 to 2004, and the Jeep Liberty 2002 to 2007.

It said fuel tanks are vulnerable to rupture in rear-end collisions, something which just last week tragically killed a family of seven, including four young children.
