Over the past few years, Japanese consumers have, as in markets the world over, abandoned their old phones for newer, shinier smartphones like the iPhone.

But one particular demographic subset have remained faithful to their old flip phones - and, ironically, it's Japan's philanderers.

Those who like to play away are snared in an enduring love affair with one particular series of Fujitsu mobiles which feature a range of privacy features to hide calls and texts.

Fujitsu's ageing F-Series flip phones - nicknamed the 'uwaki keitai' of 'infidelity phone' - are the mobiles of choice for customers who believe newer versions are not as discreet at hiding their affairs.

They feature a nearly invisible 'privacy mode' that hides missed calls, emails and texts from any contacts that are designated as private.

The only indication that such a person has got in touch is a subtle change in the colour of shape of how the battery level icon of the network signal antenna bars are shown.

A secret combination of keys is needed to turn off the privacy mode, revealing the concealed calls and messages and making voicemail available.

'privacy mode' that hides missed calls, emails and texts from any 
contacts designated as private

A Japanese pick-up artist and blogger 
who goes by the name Bakanabe, said he uses the phone because women he's
seeing might try to check his phone for strange calls or emails when 
he's not around.

'With Fujitsu's "privacy mode", they can't see that information at all. The key is to give off the impression that you're not locking your phone at all,' he told the Wall Street Journal.

Another Japanese blogger, nicknamed Poza, who claims to carry on various dating site romances while stringing along three girlfriends, said he uses the privacy features to avoid getting caught.

Although he has had the Fujitsu phone for nearly five years and owns an iPhone too, he told the Journal giving up his stealthy flip phone entirely is 'unthinkable'.

'In terms of keeping my cheating hidden, this does more than enough,' said Poza, who declined to give his real name but said he worked for a design company in western Japan.

It was more stringent security requirements for all phones offered by NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile network, that first prompted Fujitsu to include the privacy mode in 2002.

Former senior DoCoMo executive Takeshi Natsuno said he insisted on tougher security after hearing of couples splitting up because unfaithful lovers left their phones unguarded. 

'If Tiger Woods had this Japanese feature in his phone, he wouldn't have gotten in trouble,' said Mr Natsuno.

When contacted by the Journal, Fujitsu refused to comment on its devices infidelity phone nickname.

The enduring appeal of the Fujitsu infidelity phones has continued despite the launch of a range of so-called cheater apps that are meant to bring similar features to Android and iOS.

These, and even Fujitsu's own attempts to bring privacy features to its smartphone range, have been derided by the F-Series loyal cheater fanbase.

Fujitsu's offering in particular needs customers to use a separate proprietary mail and address book app rather than the carrier's default programs - giving the game away.

'It's totally useless,' Watanabe said. 'I hold out hope that Fujitsu adds the real privacy mode with its next smartphone.'

But other app designers are already racing to fill the gap, with software such as the Call and Text Eraser, available on Android, which hides messages and calls from people on a 'blacklist'.

The popularity of the $4.99 app is such that it has already been downloaded more than 10,000 times.
