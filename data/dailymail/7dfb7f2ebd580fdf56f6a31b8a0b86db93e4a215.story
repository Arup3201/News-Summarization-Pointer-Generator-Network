Roy Hodgson should place his trust in Harry Kane and start the in-form Tottenham striker in England's upcoming fixtures, according to Alan Shearer.

Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season, including a hat-trick against Leicester City on Saturday, and was handed his first call-up to the senior squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

And Shearer believes the 21-year-old has done enough to merit a start for the Three Lions, despite competing up front with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge.

The former England striker said on Match of the Day: 'Well considering he didn't start playing regular Premier league football until November he is now top scorer in the league with 19 goals. I think Roy Hodgson should start him. Yes, he's in the squad but start him in the team.

'He's (Hodgson's) watched him enough times this season, he knows what he is all about an he is on fire.

'The form he is in, I think get him in there and he will score goals. He will be a great foil for Rooney and I am a big fan of his.

'I like his attitude and the way he scores all sorts of goals. I couldn't believe we aren't going to show his goals (during the analysis) but the editor said "he only scored a tap-in, a deflection and a penalty". I said "is that all?". If it was that easy Soldado would have been doing it.

'I am a huge fan of his and would without doubt get him in the England team.'
