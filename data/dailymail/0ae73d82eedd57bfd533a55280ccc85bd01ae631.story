A man convicted of imprisoning a 9-year-old girl for 17 days in a suburban New York dungeon has been found dead in his prison cell.

A state corrections spokeswoman said John Esposito, 64, was found unresponsive in his cell at Sing Sing Wednesday. She said the death was under investigation but didn't appear to be suspicious.

He was serving a 15-to-life term for kidnapping Katie Beers and hiding her for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home in 1992.

Linda Foglia said a corrections officer observed Esposito ‘not breathing’ around 3.30pm at the Ossining, New York, correctional facility.

Officials said they believe the 64-year-old inmate died of natural causes. 

According to Beers, her tormentor was found dead in his cell after appearing before a parole board to find out if he would be released after serving 20 years in prison, News 12 Long Island reported.

Miss Beers said in a statement to CBS-TV she is saddened at the loss of a life, but at the same time happy Esposito will ‘never be granted parole or have the opportunity to hurt anyone ever again.’

The survivor of the kidnapping also took to Twitter to share her thoughts on the passing of her abductor.

‘Less than 24 hours apart, the world lost 2 monsters - Ariel Castro & John Esposito,’ she wrote.

Miss Beers was referring to the convicted kidnapper from Ohio, who committed suicide Tuesday night less than a month after being sentenced to 1,000 years in prison for holding three women captive for about a decade in his Cleveland home.   

Memoir: Beers published a book about her captivity in January, which she had co-written with a reporter

In a statement that was posted on Beers’ Google+ account, the 30-year-old married mother of two wrote that she was saddened for Esposito’s family.

‘They lost John a long time ago, but now they've lost him forever,’ she stated.

In January, Beers granted an exclusive interview to CBS to promote her book about her ordeal, offering chilling details of her captivity and abuse.

At the time, the woman said she can never 'fully have closure' on the events that she suffered as a 10-year-old girl.

Beers was kidnapped three days before
her tenth birthday on December 27, 1992 by family friend Esposito. He took 
her to his house and imprisoned her in a padlocked cabinet the size of a
coffin.

During her period in captivity, Beers
recalls that Esposito repeatedly molested her and provided only a diet 
of soft drinks and candy, including After Eight mints.

'Big John came down to my cage regularly. It seemed like once a day,' she told People magazine.

'He would bring me a toy or juice, and then he would rape me.'

Now: Katie is a 30-year-old married mother-of-two and has finally decided to speak about her ordeal in her book Buried Memoirs

Then: Katie vanished just days before her tenth birthday and was kept chained in an underground dungeon by John Esposito

Beer's kidnapping attracted nationwide 
attention in early 1993, when revelations surfaced while she was still 
missing that she had suffered years of neglect from her mother and had 
been repeatedly sexually assaulted by her godmother's husband since she 
was a toddler.

After kidnapper Esposito admitted to detectives on January 13, 1993, that he
had kidnapped Beers and showed them the dungeon where she was hidden 
for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home, the little girl was 
placed in foster care and raised in a comfortable East Hampton home with
four siblings.

Her foster 
parents not only imposed newfound discipline into her life, making her 
go to school regularly and do small chores around the house, but they 
also shielded Beers from intense media interest.

Beers is now a 30-year-old married 
mother of two who earned a degree in business management and works in 
insurance sales near her home in rural Pennsylvania.

Little has been seen or heard of 
Beers since then until this past January, when she has reintroduced herself to 
the world at large as part of a media blitz to promote a book she co-wrote titled 'Buried Memories: Katie Beers' Story.'.

Twenty years later, she described her abduction as 'the best thing that happened to me.'

'I would have never gotten out of the abuse situation I was in,' she reasoned.

She went on to play volleyball at East Hampton High, participated in drama productions and went to college in Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree and in 2004 met Derek, the man who would become her husband and the father of their two children.

'There's no point really in me right now being sad or wondering what if,' she told the AP.

'I try not to be sad about what happened, because ultimately it made me who I am today, and I'm very satisfied and happy with my life,' she said.

Beers agreed about four years ago to co-write the book with WCBS-TV reporter Carolyn Gusoff, although she had thought about writing a book for many years.

'I want to be able to help people who might not know where to turn,' she explained. 'To see that there is a road to recovery.'

She has declined to disclose her exact hometown, married surname or college alma mater, citing privacy concerns for her family.

In
the book, Beers writes that she had been molested and raped by Sal 
Inghilleri - her godmother's husband - from the time she was a toddler.

Inghilleri, who served 12 years in prison for molesting Beers, died in jail in 2009 following his arrest on a parole violation.

Beers
also wrote that Esposito raped her in the dungeon, explaining that she
repressed her memory of the sexual assault for many years as a defense 
mechanism.

Esposito, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping, was never charged with rape.

At
a 2007 parole hearing, Esposito described himself as asexual and said 
while he kissed the child, he never engaged in sexual relations.

He told Gusoff in a letter published in the book that he believes he deserves to be released.

'I
think Katie knows I will always wish her well,' Esposito wrote. 'I'm 
sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry I even thought it up. It was a 
mistake.'

During her time in the dungeon, Beers said in the book, she rarely slept, fearing abuse from Esposito.

She said she was afraid Esposito 
might molest her while she slept, but also was concerned that he would 
photograph her sleeping and send the image to police.

She feared if police thought she was dead, they might stop looking for her.

She
'celebrated' her 10th birthday while a prisoner of Esposito's and was 
heard on an audiotape found in the dungeon after her release singing 
'Happy Birthday' to herself, although she says today she has no 
recollection of that.

Esposito,
she writes, fed her primarily junk food and soda; to this day she is 
repulsed by After Eight mints because they were a staple in captivity.

She
did have access to a small television, but says she can no longer 
listen to Whitney Houston's version of 'I Will Always Love You' because 
it played incessantly on MTV and VH1 while she in the dungeon.

She didn't realize it until many 
years later, but says now that she frequently watched Gusoff - then a 
reporter for Long Island's News12 cable station - filing reports on the 
police search for her while she was missing.

'It was like I had known her for 16 years' when they met in 2008 to begin work on the book, she said.

Neglect: Marilyn Beers, Katie's mother, often left her young daughter with her godmother and husband, who sexually abused and raped her for years

Gusoff notes that as abhorrent as 
Beers' sexual abuse and neglect was at the hands of her elders before 
the kidnapping, it may have steeled her into a survival mode.

Dominick
Varrone, the Suffolk County detective who led the investigation, 
agreed, telling Gusoff in the book that 'because of her upbringing, the 
sexual experiences, the abuse, and street smarts and toughness, she was 
much more advanced than the normal nine-year-old, and we believe that 
contributed to her survival.'

Marilyn
Beers, who is described in the book as a hard-working but largely 
absentee mother who ceded responsibility for raising Katie and her older
brother to Inghilleri's wife and others, did not return a telephone 
message seeking comment about the book.

'I
hope that more does come out of the book,' Katie Beers said. 'I would 
love to be able to help other kids or adults or to be an inspirational 
or motivational speaker, something like that.

But if I go back to my life in rural Pennsylvania and go back to my insurance sales job I would love that, too.

'I'm very happy with where I'm at.'
