OJ Simpson has been announced as a finalist from the 1960s for the Rose Bowl Game All-Century Class.

In commemoration of the 100th Rose Bowl Game, an annual college football game, the All-Century Class will honor players and coaches throughout the game's history.

It's unlikely Simpson, 66, will attend the January 1 ceremony. He is currently serving time in Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada for armed robbery and kidnapping.

College era: OJ Simpson was tailback for the University of Southern California Trojans football team

The former champion footballer and sometime actor was named Player of the Game in the 1968 Rose Bowl in which he ran 128 years and scored two touchdowns for the Trojans against Indiana.

His illustrious sporting career was overshadowed by his sensational murder trial in 1994 for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.

The eight-month trial ended with Simpson's acquittal.

In September 2007, he was arrested in Las Vegas on kidnapping and armed robbery charges. He was found guilty in 2008 and sentenced to 33 years in prison with a minimum of nine years without parole.

According to CBS, Simpson's manager, Norman Pardo, has said his client is interested in pursuing a career as a televangelist once he is released from prison.

Simpson had a successful acting career following his returement from football, starring in mini-series, major films and hosting Saturday Night Live.

The first Rose Bowl Game was played in 1902, and since then has earned the nickname The Granddaddy of Them All.

It's usually played on January 1 each year at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

Since 1945, it has been the most-attended college football bowl game.

Nominated alongside Simpson are former USC football coach John McKay and former Wisconsin quarterback Ron VanderKelen.
