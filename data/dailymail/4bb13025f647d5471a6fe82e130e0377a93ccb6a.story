Vince Cable held a secret ‘ski summit’ in the French Alps with a long-term ally who has called for Nick Clegg to be replaced as the Liberal Democrat leader.

Mr Cable was spotted at the exclusive resort of Courchevel enjoying a £3,000 break with Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, who is widely regarded in Westminster as the unofficial ‘campaign chief’ for the 70-year-old Cabinet Minister.

The Alpine get-together is bound to reignite speculation about the Business Secretary’s undimmed ambition to succeed Mr Clegg as leader if the party performs poorly in next year’s Election.

Mr Cable, who was accompanied by his wife, Rachel, spent the week in a £410-a-night suite at Les Ducs De Savoie Hotel, which boasts a swimming pool, jacuzzi and a gym as well as direct access to the slopes.

Former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott was seen there huddled in conversation with Mr and Mrs Cable.

The Cabinet Minister was forced to distance himself from Lord Oakeshott last September after he said Mr Clegg’s ratings were ‘very poor and have been for a long time’ – the latest in a long line of his anti-Clegg interventions.

He added: ‘We need to face facts, there’s quite a lot of complacency going on and self-delusion going on. We are likely to lose seats.’

Lord Oakeshott then compared the Deputy Prime Minister to Michael Foot – the former Labour leader who led his party to a crushing General Election defeat in 1983.

During the interview, he also indicated that Mr Cable would be the best candidate to take over as leader.

Mr Cable claimed at the time that he found the remarks ‘seriously unhelpful’, while Mr Clegg said the peer appeared ‘like clockwork’ every year to make similar criticisms.

He added: ‘When it’s conference and the weather turns bad, up pops Matthew Oakeshott with some disobliging remarks about me.’

Courchevel is part of the Three Valleys, which is the  largest ski complex in the world. It is a hotspot for celebrities and Royals, including Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, who holidayed there in 2010.

The resort, which is popular with wealthy Russians, is full of Michelin-star restaurants and designer shops.

Chancellor George Osborne found himself facing criticism three years ago when he took his family on an £11,000 ski trip to Switzerland after telling the public that ‘we’re all in this together’.

But Mr Cable took time out of his own skiing break to urge the Chancellor to introduce a VAT cut for homeowners trying to repair flood damage.

The move, which could cost the Treasury £150 million, was viewed as another attempt by the Lib Dems to distance themselves from their Coalition partners as next year’s Election draws closer.

Last night Mr Cable went out of his way to stress that Lord Oakeshott was with him on the skiing trip as an old friend – not as his political spokesman.

Mr Cable said: ‘There’s a lot of difference between expressing distinct political views and personal friendships which go back for many years.’

He added that as well as Lord Oakeshott and his wife, the skiing party also included Lib Dem peer Lord Strasburger and ‘other people’.

Later, aides for Mr Cable insisted that ‘Matthew does not speak for Vince’ and said Mr Cable had met the costs of his holiday out of his own pocket.
