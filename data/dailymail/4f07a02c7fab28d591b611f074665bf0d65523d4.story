Former Australian Test player Brett Lee has been dragged into the Glenn McGrath hunting controversy after an image of the pair posing with a dead animal emerged.

Daily Mail Australia has uncovered a photograph of the cricketers in the company of two young boys, smiling next to a bleeding deer.

Lee has one hand placed casually on the dead animal and the other around a child's shoulders.

A spokesman for the 38-year-old confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'yes, that photo was taken on a farm in South Africa'.

The new image comes just a day after McGrath attracted mass criticism for a series of images from a 2008 African hunting trip.

The fast bowler is pictured holding a gun and smiling with his kill, including an elephant, water buffalo and hyenas.

A series of photographs of ex-cricketer Glenn McGrath posing next to dead African animals, emerged the day before the image of McGrath with Brett Lee

In 2006, McGrath opened up about the hunting trips he has enjoyed on his New South Wales country property with Lee and fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie, in an interview with Australian Shooter.  

He explained that Lee enjoys hunting, whilst Gillespie was an amateur with firearms.  

McGrath is a life member with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia and defended the practice in 2006, explaining that he sees it as a 'bonding' activity between himself and his mates.

'I don't expect people to feel the same way about [shooting], and at the same time, I don't expect others to force their opinions on me,' he told AS in 2006.

'I do have a passion for hunting and it is something I do want to continue once I've finished with cricket.'  

Social media users slammed the former cricketer on Twitter and Facebook

Some went as far as to announce they would boycott his cancer charity the McGrath Foundation 

However, McGrath issued a statement on Twitter soon after the images surfaced on Saturday, saying he 'deeply regretted' the experience. 

'In 2008 I participated in a hunting safari in Zimbabwe that was licensed and legal but in hindsight highly inappropriate,' McGrath wrote.

'It was an extremely difficult time in my life and looking back I deeply regret being involved'.

The 'difficult time' McGrath referred to in the statement is understood to be a reference to the death of his wife Jane McGrath, who died of Breast Cancer in June 2008.

She died at the age of 42, eleven years after she was diagnosed, after co-founding the McGrath Foundation with her husband.  

When the images emerged, the photograph of a beaming McGrath sitting in front of a dead elephant in Zimbabwe with a gun in his lap was considered particularly distressful amongst Twitter users. 

African elephants are classified as 'vulnerable' by animal welfare groups.

Twitter users continue to express their disgust for the photos, with many also saying they would boycott the cancer charity.

'Glenn McGrath game hunter. Yes, that's a dead elephant he's grinning about. Won't give any more $ to his foundation,' Kerry Glover wrote on the platform.

However, another Twitter user pointed out that the cancer patients would suffer greatly if charity was targeted. 

'We need to look at the foundation and Glenn McGrath as two separate identities... don't kill Jane's dream,' tweeted Vivienne. 

'Boycotting The McGrath Foundation and the women it helps is pathetic. Get a grip,' tweeted another.

User Sandy Lanceley wrote: 'Just lost an enormous amount of respect for @glennmcgrath11, hunting in Africa? Hang your head'.

The photos, which were originally posted to the Zimbabwean canned hunting group Chipitani Safari's website, have since been removed.

The Planet Ark ambassador has openly expressed his passion for hunting in the past during an interview with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia. 

'I'm keen to get into trophy hunting, no animal in particular, but a big safari in Africa would be great,' he said.

'I'd prefer to do the safari on foot, like they did in the old days and just take the camp with you, not driving around in 4WDs.'

Now a cricket commentator and president of the McGrath Foundation, McGrath met his current wife Sara Leonardi during a trip to Cape Town in South Africa in 2009.

Planet Ark denied any association with the ex-cricketer today. 

'We have only been made aware of these activities today. We are deeply saddened by the deaths of these animals and in no way endorse or support this activity. Planet Ark does not have an ongoing association with Glenn McGrath.'
