It may come with a staggeringly high cost that only the super-rich can afford, but this once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage delivers priceless memories for the most serious of art lovers.

For the princely sum of £71,000, the exclusive six-country tour whisks couples to 12 stunning sites that inspired masterpieces by some of the world’s most celebrated artists.

Billed as the 'ultimate art lover’s trip', the epic cultural journey traces the footsteps of Cézanne, Monet, Gaugain, Renoir, Hockney and Seurat – from the streets of the UK capital to the beaches of Tahiti.

From there, the tour heads north to Yorkshire to discover Garrowby Hill, the inspiration for David Hockney’s bold and vibrant painting of the same name.
