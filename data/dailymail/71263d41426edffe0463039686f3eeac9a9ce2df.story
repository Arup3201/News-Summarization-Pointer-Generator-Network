Stores have been accused of fooling shoppers by selling copycat versions of big-brand favourites to boost profits.

Several products, from breakfast cereals to biscuits and beauty creams, bearing an uncanny resemblance to famous names, have been identified.

The tactic has been condemned by consumer champion Which?.

It found packs with similar names, shapes, colours and designs that mimic popular products, which manufacturers have spent millions of pounds to develop.

The examples include Boots anti-dandruff shampoo, where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to Head & Shoulders.

Similarly, Boots’ vibrant pink bottle for its Fruit Essence shampoo is remarkably like the one for  Clairol’s popular Herbal Essences.

Tesco’s tubes of Chipz look very much like the market leaders Pringles, and the pickled onion Beasty Bites from Asda appear to owe much to the look of packs of Monster Munch.

The ruse appears to be designed to either fool busy shoppers into picking up the wrong product or piggy-backing on the reputation for quality of mainstream brands.

Research among Which? members found one in five had accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well-known brand.

Of these, 38 per cent said they were annoyed by this and 30 per cent felt misled.

McVitie’s seems to be a particular target for the copycats. Its well-known Penguin chocolate biscuits found an imitator in the Puffin brand sold by Asda.

And the pack design of its Milk Chocolate Digestives has apparently been copied by Tower Gate digestives sold by Lidl.

The British Brands Group fights to protect the designs of mainstream products.

Director John Noble said: ‘Brands survive by being distinctive and standing out, and retailers are free-riding on brands’ reputations.’

All the shops identified by  Which? insisted they were confident that consumers were not being misled and could tell the difference between branded and own-label products.

Stores such as Boots and Aldi said certain colours were synonymous with particular products or active ingredients, helping shoppers find what they are looking for.

A Which? spokesman said: ‘Retailers should make sure that people are under no illusions about what they are buying.’
