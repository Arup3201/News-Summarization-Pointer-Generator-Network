A wardrobe that held the body of Benito Mussolini for 11 years in an Italian monastery has gone on sale on eBay with a starting price of £3,000.

The wardrobe itself is worthless but, having been the hiding place for the dictator’s corpse between 1946 and 1957, it has ghoulish value for collectors of fascist memorabilia.

eBay specialists Lovendoperte, who bought the relic from a family in Lombardy, advertised the piece as a ‘unique fascist collectors' item’.

Up for grabs: The wardrobe, right, which was the secret resting place of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, left, for 11 years has gone up for sale on auction site eBay with a reserve price of £3,000

Under the notes from the owner it says
 it is an 'original and authenticated wardrobe that was the secret 
hiding place of the remains of Benito Mussolini at the monastery of the 
Cappuchin Brothers of Cerro Maggiore between 1946 and 1957.'

They have yet to receive an offer.

During
 the last days of the war in Italy, Il Duce (the leader) - as Mussolini 
was known - was captured by partisans who executed him by firing squad.

His corpse was mutilated and strung up by the feet alongside that of his mistress, Clara Petacci, at an Esso station in Milan.

The
 Allies ordered the bodies to be placed in an unmarked grave north of 
the city, to avoid the burial place becoming a place of pilgrimage.

But
 on Easter Sunday 1946, his body was exhumed by a group of fascists led 
by Domenico Leccisi, who left a message on the grave: 'Finally, O Duce, 
you are with us. We will cover you with roses, but the smell of your 
virtue will overpower the smell of those roses.'

Somehow during the venture, they lost one of the dictator’s legs.

Executed: The bodies of Mussolini, centre, his mistress, Clara Petacci, right, and Achille Starace, secretary of the Fascist Party, hang by their heels in Milan after they were shot dead near the city by Italian partisans

Four months later the body was traced by the police, hidden in a small trunk at Franciscan monastery near Milan.

To keep the whereabouts of the body secret from the public it was then taken to a Capuchin monastery, 15 miles northwest of Milan, and kept there in a cupboard.

The monks held the remains for eleven years, before the authorities allowed the family to reinter the dictator’s body at Predappio, Mussolini's birthplace.

Today, the town draws 100,000 pilgrims a year to the tomb.
