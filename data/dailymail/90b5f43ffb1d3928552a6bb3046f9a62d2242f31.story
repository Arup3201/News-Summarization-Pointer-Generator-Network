Poised: George Osborne is set to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government's controversial spending target

George Osborne is poised to approve a £1billion increase in foreign aid to meet the Government’s controversial spending target.

The Chancellor has cheered Tory backbenchers in recent years by repeatedly cutting the foreign aid budget to ensure it does not exceed David Cameron’s pledge to devote 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income to the issue.

But better than expected growth figures mean that when he makes his Autumn Statement on the economy on Thursday, Mr Osborne is facing the prospect of having to increase foreign aid in order to hit the spending threshold.

The money involved is expected to total around £1billion over the next five years, although the Chancellor is understood to have avoided the need to provide extra cash in this financial year.

The move will fuel criticism that the ‘arbitrary’ aid target is more about political posturing than saving lives.

In August it emerged that Nigeria, which will receive £1.14billion in foreign aid from Britain over the five years of the Coalition, is spending millions to put a man in space. 

The oil-rich country is also mired in corruption. Estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians.

Britain is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another country with its own space programme.

Last night Tory MP Peter Bone described the increase as ‘absurd’.

He said: ‘The aid budget is going to go up, not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world, but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense. This is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake.

'We are still borrowing billions a month but, because growth has gone up, we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away.

Pledge: David Cameron, left, pledged to hit the aid target as part of a pre-election strategy to 'decontaminate' his party's uncaring image, while Tory MP Peter Bone, right, has described the increase in aid as 'absurd'

‘It is a bizarre and stupid approach – to be honest it’s the sort of thing you would expect from a socialist government.’

Mr
Cameron’s pledge to hit the aid target was part of a pre-election 
strategy to ‘decontaminate’ the Tories’ uncaring image, but he has come 
under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis.

In March, Mr Osborne said the aid budget would hit £11.2billion this year – more than the Home Office budget.

Aid was cut in the Budget, when the growth forecast for this year was reduced from 1.2 per cent to 0.6 per cent.

Experts believe the forecast is likely to be upgraded to 1.4 per cent this week, requiring the Chancellor to at least reverse the March cuts, which amounted to £1billion over five years.

The Treasury declined to comment, but confirmed that the 0.7 per cent aid target will be met. The Department for International Development also declined to comment.

One of the biggest recipients of British aid money was last night accused of covering up allegations of corruption.

The Swiss-based Global Fund, which is set to receive £1 billion from Britain over the next three years, is said to have watered down a report into corruption in one of its projects in Cambodia.

The publication of investigations into alleged fraud totalling more than £16.5 million in parts of Africa is said to have been delayed for more than a year.

The Global Fund’s backers include Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and celebrities such as U2 singer Bono and supermodel Carla Bruni, wife of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

It is one of the world’s biggest aid organisations, with a focus on tackling malaria, tuberculosis and Aids in the developing world. It has spent £13.5 billion over the last decade and claims to have saved millions of lives.

An investigation by the BBC’s Panorama programme last night made disturbing new claims about the organisation’s attitude to fraud.

The Global Fund said it had a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to corruption. It defended its investigation into the Cambodia project, saying: ‘Only evidence that is confirmed as fact can be included in the final version of a report.’ 

A Department for International Development source said the Panorama programme related to ‘historic’ allegations, and that ministers had confidence in the Global Fund.
