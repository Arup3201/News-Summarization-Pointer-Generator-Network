Leonard Nimoy's widow was surrounded and comforted by friends just hours the Star Trek actor was laid to rest during an intimate service on Sunday.

Actress Susan Bay was seen outside of the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills following the 83-year-old star's funeral near their home in Bel Air. 

The 71-year-old was hugged by a close companion as they remembered her husband of 26 years, who passed away on Friday morning following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - or COPD.

Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock in the sci-fi franchise for 47 years, was reportedly buried at the Hillside Memorial Cemetery and Mortuary in Los Angeles, surrounded by close family and friends.

A controversial absence was longtime co-star and William Shatner who was not able to make it back in time from a charity event in Florida.

Support: Susan Bay, Leonard Nimoy's widow is surrounded by friends outside the Bouchon Bistro in Beverly Hills after her husband was laid to rest during a private service 

Embrace: The 71-year-old was hugged by a companion two days after the iconic actor, who played Mr Spock, died in their home in Bel Air 

Relationship: The couple were married for 26 years. The actress and Mr Nimoy's son Adam announced his death on Friday 

However the Canadian actor, who played Captain Kirk, was the target of a barrage of abuse over the weekend by Twitter users condemning his decision not to attend and stay at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. 

According to reports the service was restricted to a small number of guests, including the couple's children Adam and Julie, and the star's stepson Aaron Bay Schuck.

Afterwards, his family wrote a statement on Facebook saying: 'Thank you for all the love and kind words to Leonard. We lost a wonderful, talented, sweet man, a great father, husband, grandpa, and friend.

'Again thank you for all the love and good wishes. R.I.P and LLAP.' 

It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours of their passing. But, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, Nimoy was buried on Sunday. 

Although fans were barred from attending, they found their own ways to pay their respects.

A moment of silence was held at the the Long Beach Comic Expo, a two-day comic book convention in California, with many attendees also dressed as Spock.

Meanwhile, the actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was adorned with flowers, photographs and tribute messages. 

Mr Shanter revealed on Saturday that he would not be able to make it back for the service. 

The 83-year-old was seen landing at LAX at 11:30am, two hours after family and friends gathered to pay their respects. 

Speaking to TMZ outside the terminal building, he said the charity event went 'very well' but would not comment on the funeral. 

He led the tributes to the late actor following his death on Friday, saying he loved him like a 'brother'. 

Despite defending his claims and insisting his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth would be there, he received a wave of shocking abuse online.

Statement: His family thanked supporters for their love on Facebook after the funeral and urged followers to 'Live Long and Prosper'

Shatner was spotted on Sunday wearing the same clothes he had been wearing on Friday, as he touched down in Florida just hours after the actor who he described as a 'brother' passed away

Tributes: Shatner tweeted tributes to Nimoy (together, left, in 2009) as he attended an event with his wife (right) Elizabeth for the 58th International Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach

'Lame excuse': A Twitter user condemned the decision by Mr Shatner. Others questioned why he didn't pay for a flight back from the event 

When he revealed he was in Florida attending the Red Cross Ball and couldn't make it back in time, one of his followers said: 'Lame excuse. Man up.'  

Social media users demanded to know why Shatner did not pay $30,000 to fly back from Palm Beach to LA immediately after the Red Cross event on Saturday night.

'Priceline? Do Red Cross event and then private jet to LA,' wrote Todd Schnitt, a host of a morning talk show on WOR AM 710. 

Another said: 'Why not fly back right after?'

Shatner responded to the trolls with memories of Nimoy.   

Family and close friends of the iconic actor who played Mr Spock gathered at 9am on Sunday to pay their respects after he passed away at his Bel Air, Los Angeles, home on Friday.

Shatner was pictured catching an early flight on Sunday with his wife Elizabeth from Palm Beach to Los Angeles. He landed at LAX at 11.30am and so would have been in air during the service.  

Defence: Shatner responded to comments condemning his decision, saying he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago, adding that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth will be there

Bond: The pair (pictured during a scene of the 1982 film Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan) became friends during filming and remained close until Nimoy's tragic passing

Shatner was pictured early on Sunday morning at the airport in Palm Beach. He was wearing the same clothes as when he had jetted in on Friday.

The actor had earlier responded to comments condemning his no show decision at his old friend's funeral, explaining that he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago. 

Answering one post addressed at him, he said: 'Walking out on a major fundraiser wouldn't have you calling me a jerk for leaving a charity high & dry? Hmm?'

In response to people who expressed anger toward him for not flying to Los Angeles, the actor wrote: 'One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long.'

He then used the social media platform to share his memories of Nimoy and answer questions from his followers about the late actor using the hashtag '#leonardnimoy.'

'I do want to thank everyone for coming here and sharing their memories and celebrating the life of LLAP! MBB,' he tweeted.

After the charity event at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Shatner spoke to Local 10, but did not mention the funeral.

He said: 'He [Nimoy] had a good, long life. He did a lot of things. He inspired a lot of people. He was loved by a lot of people and he loved a lot of people.

'It's sad that you have to be reminded that life is that short.' 

Shatner, posted a distraught message on Twitter on Sunday, the morning after he touched down at a Florida airport following his best friend's death.

In the post, the 83-year-old Canadian actor wrote: 'I am currently in FL [Florida] as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight. Leonard's funeral is tomorrow. I can't make it back in time.

'I feel really awful. Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.'
