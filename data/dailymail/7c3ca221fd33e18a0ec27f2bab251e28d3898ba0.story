Louis van Gaal has warned Manchester United fans not to expect too much after the club’s £150million summer spending spree.

The arrival of Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo has lifted spirits around Old Trafford after United’s decline under David Moyes and difficult start with Van Gaal.

But the Dutchman believes it will take time for all the new players to gel. He said: ‘What the fans are expecting and what I expect are different, I believe. The fans will expect a new start of course and with these kind of players a victory.

Louis van Gaal speaks to Radamel Falcao after hinting he would like to sign the Monaco striker on a permanent deal

‘But I know as a coach that when you let go 14 players and buy six new ones you have 20 different relationships in the dressing-room. The hierarchy has gone. Now we have to build up a new one and that always needs time.

‘It depends on the personalities of the players. We have a lot of Spanish players who don’t speak English so well so that’s always a difficult part. Okay, you can say that you know in advance also but you want to buy always the best players for the positions that you need.

‘What we have done in the transfer period is very good in spite of the fact we don’t play in the Champions League. The players are coming to United and that’s a big plus. We have to produce results and that starts against Sunday against QPR.’

Multi-talented: Daley Blind can play in a variety of positions across defence and midfield, although a central holding role is his preferred position

Asked how he will fit all his players into the team, Van Gaal replied: ‘I never have said that. We shall see who is playing tomorrow.

‘For a coach it is always easy because he can decide and he decides what he sees – at least I do. I observe and then decide. I don’t have any worries about that. I’ve done that for more than 25 years.’

Van Gaal was more comfortable with the top-three target set out by United chief Ed Woodward when he addressed the club’s investors in midweek.

‘We have spoken about the target when we had the meetings together,’ said Van Gaal. ‘A club like Manchester United needs to put targets. I also put targets. I don’t think it’s an unreasonable target. Whether it’s difficult is another question. A club like United must always put a target. Within the three is logical because United always want to be in the Champions League.’
