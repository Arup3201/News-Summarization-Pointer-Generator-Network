Scientists believe a gene involved in the regulation of the 'happy hormone' serotonin may predict a happy marriage

Some say the secret to a happy marriage is compromise, or to never go to bed on an argument.  

But American psychologists now declared that the key to wedded bliss may actually be in our DNA.

They believe a gene involved in 
the regulation of the 'happy hormone' serotonin can predict how much our emotions affect our
relationships.

The study, from the University of California, Berkeley, and Northwestern University, may be the first to link 
genetics, emotions, and marital satisfaction, the researchers say.

Senior author of the study, UC Berkeley psychologist Robert W Levenson, said:  'An enduring mystery is, what makes one spouse so attuned to the emotional climate in a marriage, and another so oblivious?'

'With these new genetic findings, we now understand much more about what determines just how important emotions are for different people.'

Specifically, researchers found a link between relationship fulfillment and a gene variant, or 'allele', known as 5-HTTLPR. All humans inherit a copy of this gene variant from each parent.

Study participants with two short 5-HTTLPR alleles were found to be most unhappy in their marriages when there was a lot of negative emotion, such as anger and contempt, and most happy when there was positive emotion, such as humour and affection.

By contrast, those with one or two long alleles were far less bothered by the emotional tenor of their marriages.

'We are always trying to understand the recipe for a good relationship, and emotion keeps coming up as an important ingredient,' said Levenson, who heads up a study that has tracked over 150 married couples for more than 20 years.

The new findings don't mean that couples with different variations of 5-HTTLPR are incompatible, the researchers note.

Instead, it suggests that those with two short alleles are likelier to thrive in a good relationship and suffer in a bad one. 

The results of the study, which looked at
the genotypes of more than 100 spouses and observed how they interacted
with their partners over time, bore this out, they said.

'Individuals with two short alleles of 
the gene variant may be like hothouse flowers, blossoming in a marriage 
when the emotional climate is good and withering when it is bad,' said 
Claudia M. Haase of Northwestern University and lead author of the 
study.

The researchers found a link between relationship fulfilment and gene variant called 5-HTTLPR. Couples who both had a short 5-HTTLPR had the most unhappy marriages - whereas those with one or two long variants were less bothered by the emotional ups and downs of their marriages

'Conversely, people with one or two long alleles are less sensitive to the emotional climate.'

'Neither of these genetic variants is inherently good or bad,' she added. 'Each has its advantages and disadvantages.'

Participants in the study belong to a group of 156 middle-aged and older couples whose relationships Levenson and fellow researchers have followed since 1989. 

For this study, participants provided DNA samples, and researchers matched their genotypes with their levels of marital satisfaction and the emotional tenor of their interactions in the lab setting.

For spouses with two short 5-HTTLPR alleles, who made up 17 percent of the spouses studied, researchers found a strong correlation between the emotional tone of their conversations and how they felt about their marriage.

For the 83 percent of spouses with one or two long alleles, on the other hand, the emotional quality of their discussions bore little or no relation to their marital satisfaction over the next decade.

The study is published online in the journal Emotion.
