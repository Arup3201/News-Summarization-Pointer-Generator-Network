Germany faces a wave of crime and disorder because of large-scale immigration from Romania and Bulgaria, according to a leaked government document.

In what could serve as a warning to Britain, the report describes overcrowded slum conditions, public health threats and disruption on the streets as a result of the influx from the two countries.

The German statistics office estimates that 437,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have travelled to the country over the past three years alone, with numbers rising to 176,000 last year.

The leaked report from Germany’s 
interior ministry – the equivalent of the UK’s Home Office – says that 
migration from Romania and Bulgaria poses a risk to ‘social peace’ in 
major cities.

It says schools are under pressure 
because of the arrival of high numbers of non-German speaking pupils who
 hold back progress for local children.

It follows a series of alarms from 
German local government organisations which have detailed the spread of 
prostitution and robbery, organised gangs of child criminals and poor 
living conditions that have come with immigrants.

The new assessment from Berlin comes as Britain prepares to open its labour market to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.

Limits imposed on the rights of 
people from the two countries to take jobs in Britain are lifted at the 
end of the year, seven years after they joined the EU.

But the respected think tank 
Migration Watch believes the opening of the jobs market may add 50,000 a
 year to British immigration.

German labour laws allows Romanian 
and Bulgarian citizens to remain in the country longer than three months
 if they have a trade and a job, and the welfare system allows families 
to claim child benefits – which in some cases can bring in up to £500 a 
week. But wider limitations on the right to work are still in force 
until January, as in Britain and the rest of the EU.

Surveys in Romania and Bulgaria have 
suggested that many people already want to leave – even ahead of the 
easing of EU restrictions – and Germany is the nearest major country 
they can go to.It can, therefore, supply a model of what other nations such as Britain and France may expect from January.

The interior ministry document says 
that crime – particularly prostitution – is on the increase in the areas
 where the newcomers have settled.

The report describes ‘extreme 
occupancy of dilapidated, uninhabitable properties with illegal 
dormitories’, adding that overcrowding could mean 20 people sleeping in 
one room. It speaks of ‘dirty patios, overfilled rubbish bins’ and 
‘noisy crowds into the small hours’.

It names the cities that have been 
worst affected by the impact of immigration, among them Frankfurt, 
Offenbach, Mannheim, Munich, Hanover, Berlin, Dortmund and Duisburg.

The newspaper that acquired the 
leaked report, Bild, said: ‘The document explicitly warns of the 
consequences for the social peace.’

Earlier this year, local leaders in 
Duisburg demanded help to meet growing problems brought by Romanian and 
Bulgarian immigration.

They said the city had seen an 
increase in prostitution and robberies and high piles of rubbish strewn 
over its streets since the migrants began to arrive last year.

Soeren Link, its left-wing mayor, 
said it was costing almost £15million a year to house, feed and police 
the new arrivals. ‘We are massively affected,’ said Mr Link. ‘It is 
costing us millions and will cost us more by next year.’

He said anyone who thought the 
problem was going to go away was ‘misty-eyed’, adding: ‘We didn’t ask 
for this problem and we can’t handle it alone.’

In February a report by the German 
Association of Cities said taxpayers now face ‘significant costs as a 
result of this poverty migration’.
