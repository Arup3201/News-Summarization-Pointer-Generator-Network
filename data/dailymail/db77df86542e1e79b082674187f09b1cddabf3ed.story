Hundreds of Pakistani Muslims drew blood as they whipped themselves with chains today to honour the grandson of Prophet Mohammed, killed in martyrdom in 681AD. 

Shia men gathered in Rawalpindi for the religious ceremony known as Arbaeen, where they removed their shirts to flagellate themselves in respect for Imam Hussein. 

According to the faith, Hussein, the grandson of the Holy Prophet, died in battle for the leadership of the Muslim world in Karbala. 

His death is commemorated every year by millions of Shia Muslims across the Middle East, with the largest celebrations taking place in the Iraqi from which the battle takes its name. 

The religious observance, which has attracted a pilgrimage of more than 15million people to Karbala over the past month, was banned under the rule of Saddam Hussein for more than 20 years. 

Today, on the last of 40 days of mourning, security in Karbala was heightened amid fears of an attack at the hands of Islamic State militants.

The terrorist organisation, which has taken credit for the beheadings of several American and British journalists and aid workers, is thought to consider Shi'ite Muslims as heretics.
