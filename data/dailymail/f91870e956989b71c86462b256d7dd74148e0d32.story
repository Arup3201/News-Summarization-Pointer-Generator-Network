This is the moment that two women were struck by a falling scaffolding pole in a London street - leaving them both with serious head injuries.

In the 59 second clip the victims, aged 53 and 72, were left lying motionless on the ground after being felled by the pole in the heart of London's financial district.

One women crashed onto her side and the other onto her front as they were hit by the piece of metal.

As passers-by went to help the pair they were seen pointing up at the building where the pole had fallen from. 

The women were taken to hospital after the incident at noon yesterday and are still being treated for head injuries.

Police arrested a 31-year-old man after the incident, which happened on the other side of the street from a scaffolding-clad building in the City of London. He has been released on police bail pending further inquires. 

One witness, city trader Michael Jarman, 28, said: 'I was taking a stroll along Liverpool Street to pick up some superglue from Maplins listening to my Will Smith music when I saw it.

'There were two women lying on the floor. One wasn't moving and the other had blood all over her face and was screaming. 

'I jumped to the conclusion that the scaffolding had come apart and hit them, but they were on the other side of the road to where the scaffolding was on the building.

'It looked to me like there were a few poles from the scaffolding. It was terrible. Emergency workers were treating them - I hope they are OK.'

Medics at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, were continuing to treat their head injuries.

A jeweller reported passers-by rushing to the women's aid and pointing at the sky in the moments after the incident.

Peter Robinson, who was working at the Jewel Shop next to where the women were hit, said: 'I think the pole slipped out of the hands of a worker from the building site across the road.

One women was left sprawled on her side and the other crashed over onto her front

Passers-by raced to help the stricken pair and appeared as they lay injured on the pavement

Passers-by pointed up at the sky as they appeared to try and explain to each other where the pole had come from

'It flew across the street and smashed a window on one of the floors above us, then it fell to the street and hit these poor old ladies.

'I rushed outside and saw a lot of blood on the ground. One was lying on her side, another was crouched against the wall. I called the ambulance straight away and they were here very quickly.

'It really shook me up. I'm usually out there at exactly that time sweeping the road. It could very easily have been me, it could have been anyone.

Investigation: A witness said the women were on the opposite side of the street to this building

'My sister came to see me just ten minutes later and it really shook me up thinking that it could have easily been her.

'I don't know much about who these two women were. They were dressed like ladies enjoying a day out, they didn't look as though they worked in the City.

'I just hope they're all right. I was amazed to see they were still breathing, it looked like such a horrific accident.' 

Aftermath: Workers at the building site across the street from where the women were hit in central London

The road was closed until around 3pm yesterday while police investigated. 

A police investigation on suspicion of grievous bodily harm is unusual for an accident, which would more usually trigger an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive instead.

A City of London police spokesman said: 'We are appealing for anyone who saw a metal scaffold pole fall from a building on Eldon Street in the Square Mile yesterday lunchtime  to get in contact.

A witness said: 'It really shook me up. I'm usually out there at exactly that time sweeping the road'

'Two women, aged 72 and 53, suffered serious head injuries as a result of the incident – reported to police at around 11.45am - and are currently being treated in hospital.

'A 31-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of Grievous Bodily Harm and was taken into custody, but has since been released on bail.

'Work was being conducted at the time of the incident on the scaffolding, which has since been inspected by the Health and Safety Executive and deemed to be in a satisfactory condition.

'The City of London Police are now assisting the Health and Safety Executive in gathering material to establish how this incident happened.'

Investigation: A man is being held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm at a London police station
