All the trimmings: Cash-strapped families can have a Christmas turkey dinner for as little as £2.51 per person

Austerity-hit families can deliver a turkey dinner with all the trimmings for as little as £2.51 per person, according to a high street study.

The figure is lower than the £3 a head charged in 2009 and follows a move by supermarkets to introduce new cheaper value lines to attract struggling customers.

The prices come from a study by the Good Housekeeping Institute which claims it is possible to feed eight people on the big day for a total of just £20.12.

Many families will spend more than that on a turkey, while the figure is also less than the price of a bottle of champagne such as Moet et Chandon.

The Institute has taste tested the cheap festive meal, which includes mince pies, brandy butter and an 85p Christmas pudding, and insists it is a perfectly acceptable and tasty option.

Researchers surveyed prices across seven major food retailers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Asda and Lidl.

Putting together the cheapest menu involves shopping around, with the budget stores Aldi and Lidl, together with Morrisons providing most of the items.

While Morrisons came out as the cheapest single source of all the ingredients for those who want to do all their festive shopping in a single outlet.

Lidl provided the cheapest turkey a 4.8kg Glenfell frozen bird at just £9.99, while it is also selling a 2.5kg bag of Maris Piper potatoes for £1.79.

Aldi was the best option for sprouts and parsnips which were both 78p a kilo.

The Morrisons ‘M Saver’ range was the cheapest for carrots at 55p a kilo, brandy butter at £1 for 200g, and cranberry sauce at 50p for 185g.

It also offered the cheapest Christmas pudding at just 85p for the 454g centrepiece.

Asda’s Smartprice Christmas cake is on the menu at just £1.05 for 454g, while Sainsbury’s provides the Basic puff pastry mince pies at 63p for eight.

The Tesco contribution to the meal is its Everyday Value sage and onion stuffing mix at 15p for an 85g packet. Budget products from Sainsbury’s and Morrisons were the same price.

Consumer director at the institute’s Good Housekeeping magazine, Caroline Bloor said: ‘We cooked up Christmas dinner from our budget basket of groceries and can report that the items taste as good as they are cheap.’

The total price of the budget feast has come down for three years in a row according to the organisation’s annual survey.

She said: ‘The supermarkets are focusing hard on keeping down the cost of Christmas essentials but they’ll need to make the profits up somewhere. So people need to keep an eye on the kind of luxury items that we like to fill our baskets up with at this time of year.’

The Institute’s research cannot compare food products that are identical, rather it looks at the cheapest possible product from each outlet.

Buying all the ingredients from Morrisons came in at £21.10, with Tesco proving to be second cheapest at £28.97. At the other end of the scale, the cheapest menu for eight at Marks & Spencer was £54.33, while Waitrose was the most expensive at £56.23.

Significantly, the study does not include the all-important, and very expensive, drink from the Bucks Fizz for breakfast to the sherry, wine and spirits enjoyed during the rest of the day.
