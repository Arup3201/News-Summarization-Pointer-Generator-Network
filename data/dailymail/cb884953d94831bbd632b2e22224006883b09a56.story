Authorities called in said Otero Aguilar was shot in the head, Proceso reported.

'I heard a gunshot, and then I heard somebody screaming and realized somebody had been hurt. I called the police straight away and when they arrived they found that he was still alive,' neighbor Manfredo Paez Paez said, according to the Daily Mirror.

Otero Aguilar was dead at the scene and an autopsy is scheduled, according to Excelsior.

The Ministry of Public Security told Proceso that Otero Aguilar's death appeared to be an accident.

The selfie was meant to go on Facebook, the Ministry said. 

One of Aguilar's friends, Omar Abner Campos Vives, was arrested; pal 'El Paco' went on the run,  Proceso said.

Previous Facebook photographs show Otero Aguilar lounging next to alcoholic beverages and sitting in or standing next to several different types of cars.
