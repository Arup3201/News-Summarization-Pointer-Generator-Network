The 33-year-old McLaren driver was taken from the track by ambulance after suffering concussion during the high-speed accident.

The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test in Barcelona.

McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'.

After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four at the Circuit de Catalunya.

Team director Eric Boullier said: 'Fernando's accident was just one of those things that happens in testing.

'Fortunately, he's fine, but was concussed during the accident, which therefore required an overnight stay in hospital as a precaution. That's normal practice after a concussion.' 

The Spaniard crashed after completing 20 laps. The accident occurred at turn three, when Alonso went off course and the right-hand side of his car hit the wall.

Neither the team nor track officials have reported the cause of the crash. Mr Boullier said the car was not badly damaged. 

A Circuit de Catalunya spokesman said all driving on the course - which is located in Montmeló, in the north of the city - was stopped until 2pm local time (1pm GMT).

The spokesman had said: 'We hope that everything's alright and all ends with just a shock.'

McLaren has been plagued by technical problems after switching to Honda engines ahead of the upcoming season.

A McLaren spokesman said: 'Fernando Alonso's McLaren-Honda car left the track at Turn Three, causing the right-hand side of his car to strike the wall. 

'Fernando was driven to the circuit's Medical Centre where the circuit's doctors gave him first aid. He was conscious and spoke with the doctors.

'However, as per usual procedure in such circumstances, he was then airlifted to hospital where he is undergoing precautionary checks.'

Ferrari, the two-time champion's former team, tweeted: 'All the best Fernando.'

It was unclear whether the crash was a result of a driver error or a malfunction with the car.

Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. 

Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.
