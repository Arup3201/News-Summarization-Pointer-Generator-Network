UKIP faces a fresh sexism row after the party's treasurer claimed women are failing to progress in the boardroom because they are 'absolutely nowhere' when it comes to competitive sports such as chess.

Stuart Wheeler was accused of being sexist after suggesting in a debate that having more women was not necessarily an advantage.

The UKIP donor and treasurer said: ‘I would just like to challenge the idea that it is necessarily right to have a lot of women or a particular number on a board.'

Controversy: Betting tycoon Stuart Wheeler, the UKIP treasurer, suggested women were not cut out for business because they lacked a sporting competitive streak

The betting tycoon went on: ‘Business is very, very competitive and you should take the performance of women at another competitive area, which is sport where they have no strength advantage.

'Chess, bridge, poker - women come absolutely nowhere, and I think that just has to be borne in mind.’

The former Tory donor who switched to UKIP was challenged by one of the panellists Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, who said: ‘I think that is such a disingenuous, sexist comment.’

She said her mother, who is 83, was a chess champion in Malta for several years.

Mr Wheeler, 78, father of Burberry model Jacquetta Wheeler, added after the debate that he was not claiming women were less intelligent because they 'come out of the universities doing at least as well as men if not better'.

But he told the Mail: 'Yet when it comes to the highest levels of those competitive sports where all that matters is intellectual ability, and determination and perhaps stamina for some reason - and I don't know what the reason is - they are nowhere.

‘I don’t accept it is sexist, it simply rings true. It may be that women are not as competitive as men, although women do well in law, they are quite successful barristers....I was just saying it’s interesting and I don’t have an explanation.’ 

Women make up 17 per cent of boards of FTSE 100 firms, and several of the top 100 companies do not have a single female board director. Just three per cent of chief executive are women.

One of the panelists at the debate at the Institute of Economic Affairs, was UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom who caused a storm last week by claiming Britain’s foreign aid goes to ‘bongo bongo land’.

He said quotas for women in companies would come in Britain as a result of pressure from the European Union and said: ‘We have to fight this tooth and nail’, saying the idea was ‘totally patronising and archaic.’

Outspoken: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, who railed against foreign aid being sent to 'Bongo Bongo land', vowed to fight plans for women on company boards 'tooth and nail'

UKIP blundered further when they launched a website in Wales calling themselves the 'Black Independence party'.

When trying to translate the party's name into Welsh they came up with 'Plaid Annibyniaeth y Du.' DU is the abbreviation for the UK in Welsh but 'du' means black.

A spokesman said: 'It's a screw up, we have now rectified it' and said it was not a re-branding of the party.

Its MEP Godfrey Bloom has been under fire for saying Britain sends foreign aid to 'bongo bongo land' - which he denied was racist or intended to be a derogatory reference to Africa.

UKIP says it wants an end to 'mass, uncontrolled immigration' including a five-year freeze on permanent settlement, and any future migration strictly limited to those who can 'clearly be shown to benefit the British people as a whole and our economy'.

They would not allow immigrants to apply for public housing or benefits until they had paid tax for five years. 

In order to achieve these goals they say Britain would have to leave the EU because there are no restrictions on other EU citizens moving to the UK while it remains a member.

Mr Bloom claimed if anyone suffered 
prejudice it was actually men – saying in many walks of life women are 
promoted ‘beyond their abilities’.

He
 said: ‘If you worked certainly in the public sector or a reasonably 
large company who can smell which way the wind is blowing, you are far 
more likely to be advanced by being a woman in your quest for promotion 
than disadvantaged.

‘Nigel 
[Farage] and I can give you personal stories about how that's worked in 
the [European] Commission where very, very highly qualified men have 
been jumped over to get a woman into a more senior position with nowhere
 near the qualifications.’

He also claimed that when he was in the army, before becoming a City pension fund manager, women were allowed to pass courses because examiners ‘didn't have the bottle’ to fail them.

Mr Bloom has previously courted controversy by claiming that ‘no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age’.

And he claimed many women do not want to be on the boards of companies as they make ‘wiser’ choices about their careers.

Those who want quotas, he said, ‘sadly have no great confidence in their sisters and think women need special help.’ 

He has had several successful female bosses during his career, he said, saying: ‘My ultimate boss of course was her Majesty. I go home and I work for another one – Mrs Bloom. I go up to my secretary’s office and she tells me exactly what to do.’

Mr Bloom also joked that he and Nigel Farage, the UKIP leader, had been trying and failing to be invited to one of Italian President Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous ‘bunga bunga’ parties ‘for years’.

He said: ‘We still hope that he somehow manages another term and he remembers us’.

Dr Gerada and fellow panelists including Jo Fairley, a former magazine editor and the founder of Green and Black’s chocolate, argued that quotas were not the answer but the root causes of under-representation of women – such as flexible working hours, childcare costs and low aspirations among girls at school – could be tackled.
