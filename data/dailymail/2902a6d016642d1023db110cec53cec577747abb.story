Adam Lallana's shot was parried by Alex McCarthy in Queens Park Rangers's goal and the ball fell invitingly to Mario Balotelli with an open goal in front of him.

The Liverpool striker was left with a simple tap-in, went to side-foot the ball into the net but it instead flew miles over the bar.

That wasn't the first open goal he has missed this season.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers barks instructions at striker Mario Balotelli during the eventual win away at Queens Park Rangers

Balotelli - pictured sat on the turf with his head slumped - endured a difficult afternoon in front of goal at Loftus Road on Sunday

Midfielder Adam Lallana has words with the Italian front man during the last-gasp 3-2 win away at the Premier League's bottom club 

Balotelli blazed over the bar from eight yards and did nothing to suggest he was going to make amends after the shocking miss 

It looked far easier to score from this angle while the scores were still level just after the hour-mark in the capital 

Scored just one goal in his last 22 Premier League appearances, despite attempting 73 shots (incl. blocked) in these games.

Has now had 30 shots this season in the Premier League (incl. blocks). Only two players (Aguero 36, Pelle 32) have had more.

Has attempted more shots (30, incl. blocked) without actually scoring than any other player in the top five European leagues this season.

As if a flavour of things to come, in Balotelli's debut against Tottenham he did the same, albeit from further out.

Hugo Lloris rushed from his line but spooned his clearance straight to the Liverpool player, who took a touch, steadied himself, then, 25 yards from goal, horribly skewed an effort wide.

Brendan Rodgers clapped on the White Hart Lane touchline with a huge grin on his face.

Balotelli has no goals in six league games and just a single goal against Bulgarian side Ludogorets - the joke is beginning to wear thin.

That £16million price-tag is increasing in weight with every missed chance. This is a player who in 2010 only rated Lionel Messi above him, then in 2013 was gracious enough to add Cristiano Ronaldo to that list.

'When I score, I don't celebrate because I'm only doing my job. When a postman delivers letters, does he celebrate?' Balotelli asked in 2012. 

Loic Remy - who eventually left QPR for Chelsea - was available at half the price Liverpool ended up paying for Balotelli 

Lallana talks to the 24-year-old on Sunday (left), but Balotelli cut a frustrated figure all afternoon for Rodgers' side 

The striker was easily brushed aside by QPR defender Richard Dunne and failed to assert himself on proceedings throughout 

Balotelli likened himself to a postman back in 2012, but Pat (pictured above) would fancy himself to deliver more regularly than Mario

But postmen nearly always manage to get their deliveries through the letterbox. Surely if Pat spent two months wildly throwing letters at doors, leaving the streets strewn with unopened envelopes, before finally getting one in, he wouldn't hold back with at least a slight fist-pump.

No player in Europe's top five leagues has had more shots without scoring than Balotelli's 30 this season.

He added another seven against QPR on Sunday to reach that total and there is only one other Premier League game this season where a player has had more shots on goal without putting the ball in the back of the net. And that player was Balotelli. Against Everton, where he had 10 without reward in the Merseyside derby.

Loic Remy was available for around £8m in the summer, mysteriously failing a medical at Liverpool which he then passed at Chelsea. 

He is languishing on the Stamford Bridge bench, while Balotelli is afforded plenty of minutes by Rodgers with little to show for it.

With Daniel Sturridge ruled out for possibly another four weeks, Liverpool need a goal-scorer, a skill Remy has proved he has in the Premier League.

Danny Welbeck was also available for the same price as Balotelli, but moved to Arsenal instead. In fact, plenty of forwards were up for grabs in the summer. 

Alexis Sanchez, Radamel Falcao and Samuel Eto'o all switched clubs, while Edinson Cavani was open to ending his difficult time at Paris Saint-Germain.

Liverpool instead opted for Balotelli, but the transfer smacked of desperation. 'I can categorically tell you Mario Balotelli will not be at Liverpool,' Rodgers said ahead of their pre-season friendly against Manchester United in Miami at the beginning of August.

Exactly three weeks later, with no replacement found for Luis Suarez, they had bought the player from AC Milan. It was a 'no-brainer,' Rodgers said.

Balotelli got away with his misses against QPR. Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker both scored in their own net for Liverpool to win 3-2.

Rodgers defended him, yet again, afterwards: 'The guy is doing his best and working really hard and it is not dropping for him. I'd say he would have finished that if Caulker had not put it in.'

Unfortunately for Balotelli, Caulker did put it in and along with Dunne the QPR defenders have now scored more Premier League goals for Liverpool than him so far this campaign.

Liverpool legend Jimmy Case gave a more brutal assessment: 'Mario Balotelli is a waste of space at the minute.'

It is hard to disagree, at the minute.
