Get running even if you hate it: Ruth Field offers a no-nonsense approach to exercise (posed by model)

If your New Year's resolution is to get fit, eat healthily and lose weight, it's time to stop making excuses and start getting tough on yourself according to author Ruth Field.

The criminal barrister from North London believes running is the answer for anyone who wants to get in shape.

In her book, Run Fat B!tch Run, she offers a no nonsense approach to getting moving in the guise of her 'inner b***h' The Grit Doctor.

She writes: 'Really I am just naming that voice we all have inside our heads. Yours may be lying dormant or suffocating under all that excess weight but it is there. It's that nagging little voice which makes you feel just a tad uncomfortable about helping yourself to another biscuit.'

Ruth said people have to tap into this nagging voice and use it to motivate themselves to get off the sofa. And not by going to low intensity exercises or by joining a gym (then never going) but by running.  

The 38-year-old mother of twins took up running herself in her mid twenties after agreeing to do a marathon. And while she's now a convert to the sport, she's not always evangelical about it.

She told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't say I enjoy running but I enjoy the benefits that running brings such as getting outdoors and feeling healthier. I certainly didn't enjoy it when I first started. I can honestly say I hated every single one of those early runs as they were incredibly difficult and I was out of breath within minutes feeling like I was on the verge of a heart attack.'

As she's loathe to call running 'fun', Ruth will not take anyone complaining that they 'hate running' as an excuse for not giving it a go.

'Everyone hates it until they have practised it religiously for sometime,' she admits.

She also has a comeback for the other excuses people peddle out for not being active, such as 'I don't have time' ('Everyone has the same 24 hours a day, President Obama finds the time and I guarantee he has more to get done in a given day than you do in an entire week') and 'I don't have the right build for running' ('There's no such thing as the right build. It's an excuse often used by large breasted ladies but I once ran with a double E cup friend who wore two sports bras.').

Despite the title of the book, Ruth has never been obese in her life but admits there have been times when she has needed to lose a few pounds. And she's learnt the best way to tackle weightloss is not through faddy diets.

She again points to running being the answer here as runners tend to crave less sugary treats because of the feel-good factor they can get from running and tend to seek healthy foods as fuel to help them run.

Toughen up: Ruth, left, had to embrace her 'inner b***h' The Grit Doctor in order to run a marathon and reveals how you can do the same in her book

For those who haven't reached this stage yet and are failing to lose weight despite taking up running, The Grit Doctor has some tough but honest advice: 'If you are consuming fizzy drinks, crisps and takeaways as part of your daily diet, this is the reason you are not losing as much weight as you would expect from running alone. Frankly, as an adult you should be ashamed of yourself if you are still buying sweets and fizzy drinks on a weekly basis. Stop it now.'

Ruth said her tips are just common sense - move more and eat less junk food - but believes many people need to stop deluding themselves in order to achieve it.

Thus she has no time for people who say they are overweight because they are 'big-boned' ('You may be big-boned but you may also be fat. Being big-boned is no excuse for being overweight') or 'have a slow metabolism' ('Bulls***. You are overweight because you eat too much of the wrong food.')

Stop kidding yourself: The book takes a common sense approach to weightloss and advises against making excuses over food indulgences

Run Fat Bitch Run contains recipes to help readers stay on track and advice on the right foods to eat to help them run better.

The book was first published in 2012 but has been re-released this month to include a marathon training plan and is also now available as an eBook.

It's through her own marathon training - for London and then New York - that Ruth finally discovered she could enjoy running - or at least enjoy the sense of achievement and lifestyle changes it brings.

'The real joy of the marathon is that you have done it and having done it is going to become a metaphor for you and the rest of your life. A metaphor that says you can achieve anything that you set your mind to provided you put in the effort,' she said.

Ruth intends to tackle another marathon to celebrate her 40th birthday but in the meantime is happier running shorter distances.

Persevere: Ruth admits she hated running at first but it does get easier and the benefits are multiple (posed by model)

For anyone who does take up running this January, she advises not trying to go too fast too soon and not just entering a marathon.

She said: 'Many people decide to go out for a run and then go sprinting off down the street at a pace they are only able to maintain for a minute. They then give up and go home because they can't keep it up. It's much better to start at a slow pace, not much quicker than walking, and then speed up as you get fitter.'

On entering a marathon she added: 'Having the marathon as your goal will certainly motivate you - it worked for me. But there are plenty of other races of other distances that you can target. The most important thing is just to get started and then make running become a habit.'

A new and updated version of Run Fat B!tch Run is now available as a paperback and Ebook via Amazon, published by Sphere

Despite the best intentions, many people may take up running this week and give up by mid January due to lack of motivation and support. But it doesn't have to be that way thanks to Jantastic - a free running challenge for all abilities that's being launched on Monday.   

Jantastic.me is a new socially integrated website where runners around the world can link up to share advice and keep one another going.

The challenge has been developed by the founders of the podcast Marathon Talk and is supported by England Athletics and Adidas.

Participants sign up as individuals or as part of a team, then set themselves goals to strive for in January, February and March. Miles run can be logged as you go along and experiences shared with other users so you don't feel alone when you're pounding the pavements.  

Martin Yelling, founder of Jantastic and host of Marathon Talk explains: 'Jantastic is all 
about getting people active, keeping them motivated and supporting them 
through the tough winter months when it's harder to head outside and go 
for a run. 

'Through the new Jantastic website we will create an
 online community to allow people to share their experiences, get 
support and motivation, to help them reach their running targets.'
