Dominique Strauss-Kahn slept with the mother of a woman who claims the former IMF boss tried to rape her, it emerged yesterday.

Anne Mansouret admitted that  she had sex with Mr Strauss-Kahn in 2000, saying her fellow socialist ‘took me with the vulgarity of a soldier’  while they were both supposed to  be working.

Miss Mansouret, 65, is the mother of 32-year-old writer Tristane Banon, who has alleged that Strauss-Kahn assaulted her in 2003 as she tried to interview him.

'Tryst': Dominique Strauss-Kahn 'had brutal sex' with former colleague Anne Mansouret, the mother of attempted-rape claimant Tristane Banon

The latest revelation in one of the most squalid cases in French political history emerged in the country’s press.

The alleged sexual encounter happened
 in the offices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, where Strauss-Kahn, now 64, was working as a special 
adviser.

Miss Mansouret’s claims were made to 
police last week when she was interviewed as a witness in her daughter’s
 allegations of attempted rape against Strauss-Kahn.

'Rutting chimpanzee': Tristane Banon claims Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her

She is said to have told officers that she and Strauss-Kahn had ‘consensual but brutal’ sex.

Miss Mansouret, a radical feminist 
with three marriages and scores of lovers in her past, has admitted that
 she was happy to have sex with a man known in France as the ‘Great 
Seducer’.

However, she admitted, she ‘never wanted to repeat the experience’.

She told police: ‘He doesn’t try to please women, but simply to possess them.’

Miss Mansouret, a socialist party 
regional official, is said to have kept the encounter secret until her 
daughter told her in February 2003 that Strauss-Kahn had tried to rape 
her when she went to interview him for a book she was writing.

Miss Mansouret said she was so 
‘incensed’ that she went to see  Strauss-Kahn’s former wife Brigitte  
Guillemette, who later challenged him over the attack.

Strauss-Kahn is then said to have 
admitted: ‘I don’t know what came over me. I slept with the mother, I 
lost it when I saw the daughter.’

According to Miss Mansouret, 
Strauss-Kahn then met her for a glass of wine in a bistro, and he 
apologised for trying to attack her daughter.

Attempted rape carries a sentence of 
up to 15 years in France – more if there are aggravating circumstances 
such as the use of violence. In a 2007 TV programme which is still 
accessible on the internet, Miss Banon gives a graphic account of the 
alleged attack in which she compared Strauss-Kahn to a ‘rutting 
chimpanzee’ and claimed he tried to unfasten her clothes.

She said that she was dissuaded from 
filing charges at the time by her mother, who is still a regional 
councillor in Strauss-Kahn’s Socialist party.

The violent but consensual sex 
between her mother and Strauss-Kahn is now being put forward as the 
reason why Miss Banon took eight years to go to the police about the 
alleged attack on her, claimed L’Express magazine. It also emerged 
yesterday that Strauss-Kahn’s daughter Camille has been questioned by 
police over the alleged attempted rape of Miss Banon.

The 26-year-old student, who is a friend of Miss Banon’s, was questioned on Monday.

Arrested: Strauss-Kahn appeared in court earlier this year after a maid at a hotel in New York claimed that she had been sexually-assaulted by him

In response to Miss Banon’s claims, Strauss-Kahn has denied the attack and begun legal action against her for libel.

His Paris lawyer Henri Leclerc said: ‘Her claims are imaginary. It never happened.’

Strauss-Kahn, the disgraced former 
head of the International Monetary Fund and once a possible presidential
 candidate in France, is currently awaiting trial in New York, accused 
of raping a hotel maid.

That case has been adjourned until 
next month and looks likely to be dropped because of his victim’s 
alleged links with criminals.

But Strauss-Kahn faces an investigation 
for the attempted rape of Miss Banon as soon as he returns home to 
France.

All of the women involved in the 
French allegations are well known to Anne Sinclair, Strauss-Kahn’s 
current wife who, despite his non-stop philandering, is standing by 
him.

The French Socialist Party has been 
torn apart by the latest revelations, but some senior figures are still 
arguing that Strauss-Kahn should be allowed to run for  president next 
year against Nicolas Sarkozy.

In another dramatic development 
yesterday it emerged that Francois Hollande, the current frontrunner to 
stand as Socialist presidential candidate next year, is set to be 
questioned by police about allegations that he knew about the alleged 
attempted rape of Miss Banon as far back as 2003, but did nothing about 
it.

Mr Hollande denied that he had acted 
improperly, saying: ‘I’ve nothing to hide and nothing to feel uneasy 
about but I will not allow this case to be exploited politically.’
