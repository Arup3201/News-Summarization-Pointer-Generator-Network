A glittering new Bunny Girl outfit has been unveiled to celebrate the launch of a new bar at London's Playboy club.

Norwegian womenswear designer Nina Naustdal created the one-off Swarovski Bunny outfit in collaboration with the Playboy Club to coincide with the opening of Baroque, a bar masterminded by the entrepreneur behind the Hoxton Pony.

Featuring a black satin corset encrusted with 500 clear, white and yellow Swarovski crystals, gem-studded Bunny ears and crystal cuffs, the outfit comes in at an eye-watering £10,000.

Nina Naustdal joins the ranks of 
designer's such as Marchesa and Roberto Cavalli who have had the 
privilege of reworking the original Bunny costume - the design of which must be approved by Mr Hugh Hefner himself.

While
she won't be working in the new Baroque lounge, the UK's top bunny and 
brand ambassador who greets all celebrities and VIPs will be the only 
one to wear the costume.

With a celebrity client list including Tulisa, Emma Rigby, Amal Fashanu and Elen Rivas, Naustdal is no stranger to designing with glamour and pop culture in mind, meaning that this collaboration was the perfect match.

'I am very honoured to have worked 
with the Playboy Club London and Mr Hugh Hefner on this special costume,' Naustdal said of the partnership.

'The design is inspired by old baroque wallpaper in honour of Playboy's 
new nightclub launch by Mr Gerry Calabrese,' said 
Naustdal.

HOW TO BE A BUNNY

While the glamorous waitresses make being a Bunny Girl it look easy, being a Bunny takes a lot of work.

The original values and requirements dating back 50 years still stand today.

Bunnies are carefully chosen at auditions and embark on strict cocktail-making and behaviour training, on which they are tested.

The pose they must master in front of all clientele is called the 'Bunny Stance,' which involves standing with legs together, back arched and hips 
tucked under.

If taking a short rest, bunnies must do so elegantly in the 'Bunny Perch,' sit on the back of a 
seat or railing without being too close to a patron.

The famous 'Bunny Dip' is a manoeuvre where the 
Bunny elegantly leans backwards while bending her knees, lifting her 
left knee and tucking the right leg behind, allowing her to serve drinks while keeping her modesty fully intact.

Custom made and fitted to each girl by the in house seamstress, the costumes are altered when required.

Playboy's director of promotions Victor Lownes first conceived the Bunny girl costume which was later refined by Hugh Hefner. There was no bow tie, collar or cuffs and the ears were much taller to begin with.

The uniform was formally debuted in February 1960, at
the opening of the first Playboy Club in Chicago. Constructed on a 
classic merry widow corset and made from fine rayon-satin, a rosette name-tag was attached on the hip of each one.

Pointed ears, fluffy cotton tails, 
collars with bow ties, cuffs, black tights and 
high-heels completed the look.

The
costumes were made of two halves in different shapes and sizes - the 
front and back - which were selected to custom fit each individual Bunny best, then sewn 
together.

There was even a full time seamstress on duty to make sure the costumes were always immaculate.
