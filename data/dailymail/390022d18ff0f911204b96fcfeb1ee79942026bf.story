While millions of us may dream of a few days in the Mediterranean heat, the reality is that we like our weather a little more on the mild side.

Researchers have found that the average Briton's ideal summer temperature is a moderately warm 23.5C (74F) – so today's weather should keep most of us happy.

Forecasters say the mercury could hit 24C (75F) in the South, making it the hottest day of the year so far.

And the sunny, dry conditions are predicted to last well into the weekend.

Summer's here at last: People make the most of the hot weather at Portishead Open Air Pool in Somerset as temperatures continue to soar across the UK

Boiling: Students Harriet Milnes, 18, and Amy Smith, 17, sunbathe. Despite the warm weather today, temperatures are set to get even higher by the weekend

Forecaster Lindsay Mears said: 'It's going to be lovely and warm for the next five days and will get even hotter by Friday.

'The beginning of Summer starts on Saturday and weather-wise this seems to be tying in nicely.

'It's only the first week of Summer and luckily the weather is looking up with high temperatures across the weekend.

'Lunchtime today we're seeing temperatures ranging from 18C in the South East to a slightly cooler 15C in the North.

'It reached a high of 20.2C in Derbyshire yesterday, but London is going to top that this afternoon with 24C.

The
 rest of the week we'll see more sunshine across the UK with highs of 
24C and we'll be ending the week on a pleasant temperature of 25C on 
Friday.

'Tomorrow looks like the hottest day this week in Hampshire with 25C weather.

'The
 weekend is looking equally as nice, with widespread sunshine and the 
same high temperatures of 24/25C on both Saturday and Sunday.'

The
 balmy temperatures over the next five days look as though they will 
continue into the start of next week, but the sizzling sunshine could be
 replaced by more unsettled weather.

Ms
 Mears said: 'Although temperatures will remain high going into next 
week, the sunshine could be replaced by more unsettled weather like we 
saw last month.'

The new study found that, when it comes to gender differences, 
men prefer a slightly warmer temperature of 25C, while women were 
happiest with a cooler 22.8C.

Hotting up: With the temperature liekly to reach 25C this weekend, it may disappoint some Britons, who would prefer it to be cooler. This owl was captured at the Surrey Wildlife Centre by head keeper and photographer Matt Binstead

In flight: New research has discovered that Britons are most content 
when the temperature is 23.5. This owl took the opportunity to enjoy the
 good weather in the bluebells at the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey

According to the poll of 340 adults, 
Londoners had the highest heat threshold with the average Londoner being
 content with a temperature of 24.7C.

A
 spokesman for online discount shopping site PromotionalCodes.org.uk, which 
commissioned the poll, said: 'One of our favourite pastimes as a nation 
is to moan about the weather no matter how hot or cold it is.

'For many, it is either too wet or too dry so it was interesting to find a temperature which everyone would be happy with.

'It seems most people are content with a temperature of 74 F (23 degrees C), it's by no means cold but it is not stifling hot either.'

One male respondent said: 'For me, it isn't summer unless it's baking hot, well over 86 degrees F (30 degrees C). It's a pity we rarely see that in the UK.'

A woman respondent added: 'I think a temperature in the mid-twenties is just right, not too hot and not too cold. It is just a shame we hardly get to see it between the constant spells of rain.

'It can be really awful when the weather is too hot. It gets to the point where you can't do anything.'

As Britain bathes in the mini heatwave, it's not just humans that are having a hoot.

These owls and even a hedgehog took the opportunity to enjoy the good weather in the bluebells.

The pictures of the tawny and long-eared owls were taken at the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey.

Head keeper and photographer Matt Binstead said: 'I just happened to be there at the right time for these ones.

'After the miserable spring we've had, you can sense that even the birds and animals appreciate a bit of good weather.'

From owl chicks and fox cubs to rare 
wildcat kittens, the British Wildlife Centre has helped to rear some of 
Britains's most iconic and shy species.

The BWC is Britain's only native 
wildlife centre, housing more than 50 species of British animal from 
adders and field mice to red squirrels, weasels and wildcats.

Mr Binstead said: 'As far as I am aware we are the only centre in the country that has 100 per cent British wildlife.

'The Centre mainly consists of large very natural enclosures with only what you would find for the animals in the wild.

'We currently have more than 50 
species of British animals here and what we do have is one of every 
British owl including the long-eared and short-eared owls, both of which
 are extremely rare in captivity.'

Set up in 1997 by former dairy farmer
 David Mills, the Centre in Lingfield, Surrey currently covers 20 acres,
 with work underway on another 10 acre extension.

The Centre is privately owned and most of the profits are ploughed back into its expansion and facilities.
