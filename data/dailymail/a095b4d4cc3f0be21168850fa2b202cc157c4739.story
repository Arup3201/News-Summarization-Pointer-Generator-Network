A Philadelphia woman gave birth to her daughter Wednesday on the way to hospital in the aftermath of a snow storm.

But little Bella Sophia Bonanni wasn't born in a car or an ambulance like you'd think - she was born on a sled in the front yard of the family's Roxborough neighborhood home.

'I woke up with contractions, they were about 10 minutes apart. So we thought we had plenty of time to go to the hospital,' new mom Shirley Bonanni said.

By the time she showered and was ready to go, the contractions were too quick and too strong for her to walk, she told told WPVI-TV.

Her husband couldn't drive up their steep, hilly street, so Fabian Bonnani put his wife in their toddler's plastic sled and began pulling her to the car.

But the baby wouldn't wait.

With the help of neighbors and a 911 dispatcher providing instructions for Fabian Bonnani, 7 lb. 9 oz. Bella was born on the roadside.

'I was on the phone with 911, talking him through it, and he certainly delivered his own baby, right there, on the side of the road,' neighbor George Leader said.

Fabian Bonanni took the baby, wrapped in blankets, back up to their house.

His parents, who just had witnessed their granddaughter's birth, helped Leader and his roommate carry Shirley Bonanni, still on the sled, inside to keep warm.

An ambulance made it up the snowy hill and transported mother and baby to the hospital.

Both are doing fine and are expected to go home in a couple of days.
