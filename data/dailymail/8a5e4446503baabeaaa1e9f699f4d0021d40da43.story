The first
British strawberries of spring left a nursery today with 2012 set to be a
record year for growers.

This nursery
in Chichester, West Sussex, was packed to the rafters with rows of strawberries
as far as the eye can see.

And workers
will be busy in the next few weeks, harvesting the fruit to go out to Tesco -
the UK's biggest seller of strawberries.

The
supermarket believes demand will hit a record high this year as the nation stocks up
for events including the Diamond Jubilee, Wimbledon, Euro 2012 and the
Olympics.

Early
predictions have shown that sales could be up by 10 per cent - 5,000 tonnes more
than last year.

In total, a
staggering 55,000 tonnes are expected to be sold and, luckily for UK growers,
this season has already produced a bumper crop.

Many are now
reporting record numbers of the most popular varieties - including Sweet Eve,
Eve's Delight and Capri.

Mouthwatering: Tesco says that this year's crop will be sweeter, juicier and more flavoursome than ever before

And Tesco is
set to receive its first delivery today.

Paul Jones,
strawberry buyer for the chain, said: 'Last year's perfect growing conditions
resulted in a fantastic year for strawberry sales with shoppers creating a
record demand.

'Traditionally
when we have a summer of major sporting events, sales tend to soar because of
the increase in parties and BBQs.

'We think
that the Queen's Diamond Jubilee we will see even higher demand this summer.

'With this in
mind, we have been working with growers to increase production of the UK's most
popular varieties, including Sweet Eve, Eve's Delight and Capri.

'By talking to
customers and looking at recent sales, we know these are the ones that shoppers
love the best.

'They are
sweeter, juicier and more flavoursome. And this year we will have far more of
them.'

Tesco is also
predicting that sales will receive an extra boost from the huge influx of
tourists this year. As many as 30 million are expected to visit the UK.

Mr Jones
added: 'British strawberries are renowned for being the best in the world and
we know that visitors to Britain will want to try them, which will further
boost demand.'

Many of Britain's major strawberry suppliers use hydroponics systems to ensure the biggest and sweetest fruit.

Hydroponics is often mistakenly believed to be a modern growing method, but it's actually a technique dating back over 2,500 years to the Babylonian civilisation, where it's thought to have nurtured the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

Hydroponics, which comes from the Greek for hydro, meaning water and ponos, meaning work, involves the plants being fed everything they need through enriched water, with methyl bromide deployed to take care of pests.
