Published: Texas vet Dr Melba Ketchum has finally published the results of her study she claims to conclusively prove Bigfoot's existence

A Texas-based vet who claimed to have found DNA evidence of Bigfoot has finally published her findings - in a journal she set up.

Melba Ketchum hopes her 'proof' of the existence of the elusive hominids will be the first step towards recognising them as an undiscovered Native American group.

Although she first announced her claims in November, the publication of her full results was delayed because no peer-reviewed scientific journal would accept her study.

Instead, Dr Ketchum, from Nacogdoches, Texas, apparently finally self-published her findings on Saturday in the so-called DeNovo Scientific Journal.

She is selling the study - entitled Novel North American Hominins, Next Generation Sequencing of Three Whole Genomes and Associated Studies - for $30 through the journal's website.

Her rejection by mainstream journals and choice to self publish has, inevitably, raised eyebrows.

Dr Ketchum, a veterinarian-researcher claims to have discovered genetic proof which shows Bigfoot is in fact a human hybrid, descended from human women who mated with men of 'an unknown hominin species.'

She has said that mitochondrial DNA in her samples, apparently obtained from leftover blueberry bagels eaten by a family of 10 bigfoot's who live in Michigan, show clear evidence of genetic mixing.

'Genetically, the Sasquatch are a human hybrid with unambiguously modern human maternal ancestry,' she said in a statement published last November.

'Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a "license" to hunt, trap, or kill them.'

The findings are apparently the result
 of five years of work by Dr Ketchum's firm DNA Diagnostics. The study 
concludes that Bigfoot is a missing link that arose approximately 15,000
 years ago.

It is the first 
study which claims to have offered any kind of DNA analysis of the 
legendary mountain men, also known as Sasquatches.

But Dr Ketchum's decision to self-publish her findings, and charge for them, has raised suspicions in the eyes of many observers.

Robert Gonzales wrote on science website i09: 'The site claims to be "open access", but charges 30 bucks to access the Bigfoot genome paper.

'It bears mentioning that the Bigfoot genome paper, at the time of this posting, is also the only paper in Vol. 1, Issue 1 of the new journal.

'Seeing as "open access" clearly does not mean what these researchers think it means, youâ€™ll forgive us if we remain skeptical when they say their data "conclusively proves that the Sasquatch exist as an extant hominin".'

According to Fox News, scientists have already issued 'universally scathing reviews' of the paper.

The U.S. network said that it appears that Dr Ketchum 'apparently views herself as less of a Bigfoot researcher than a valiant protector of a peaceful, vulnerable, and undiscovered native people'.

It points to another of Dr Ketchum's sites, The Sasquatch Genome Project, where it is claimed that '[t]he Sasquatch people are more like us than they are different.'

The site goes on: 'The Sasquatch people have their own language, traditions, and rituals. They live in family units, they order their lives according to the laws of their people, and they bury their dead.

'Yet the Sasquatch people are captivating because of their physical, genetic, and cultural differences.

'Sadly, these special traits also make them uniquely vulnerable to those who would see in their unusual lifestyle or appearance a justification to harass, trap, or even kill them.

'Your compassion and understanding will be vital to protect the Sasquatch people.'
