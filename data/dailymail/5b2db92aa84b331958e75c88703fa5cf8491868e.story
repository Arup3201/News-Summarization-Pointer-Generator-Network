The cold case of a Houston nurse who was found dead in her pool last year has now been reopened as a murder investigation.

Edith Sax, 50, was found face down in the pool of her West University Place home in April 2014, still wearing her scrubs from work.

The death was believed to be accidental, however new leads have investigators pursuing it as a homicide.

There were injuries that Sax suffered which suggested she had been held under the water, and she also had a multi-million dollar will, the exact beneficiaries of which remain unknown.

Murdered: Edith Sax, 50, a Hosuton nurse whose body was found in her backyard pool in 2014, didn't accidentally drown but was likely murdered, investigators have revealed

Scene: Sax was found floating face down in her pool on April 25, 2014, still wearing her scrubs from work

Spouse: The victim's husband, Steve Sax, a radiologist, has been cleared as a suspect, police say. She had four children and he had three, and they married nine years ago

'It is clear that the person or persons involved in a relationship with Edith Sax that they knew intricacies in the house and her schedule,' Detective Vashawnda McLean told Click2Houston.

A $30,000 reward was offered for information that leads to an arrest in the death.

Mrs Sax husband, Steve Sax, whom she married nine years ago, is not a suspect in the murder, police say.

Investigators do believe however the killer stand to gain from the substantial inheritance the mother-of-four left. 

'I cannot write a huge check into a trust for someone who killed my wife,' Steve Sax told ABC News.

Mrs Sax's children are from a previous marriage, while Mr Sax has three children of his own.

He said the families quickly blended.  

'Edie was the most fierce defender of her children,' he said.

'She loved them utterly.'

Overwhelmed: At a press conference in Houston this week, her family, who until recently believed Mrs Sax's death was accidental, appealed for information from the public

Appeal: Mrs Sax's eldest daughter, Natasha Rafiq (left), and her husband, Steve Sax (right), both spoke at the press conference. A $30,000 reward is on offer

Investigation: Detective Myron Dillingham revealed at the press conference that Mrs Sax had injuries on her body that suggested she had been held under the water in the pool

Members of Mrs Sax's family appeared at a press conference in Houston this week to plead for help from the public.

For months they believed she died accidentally.

Two men were said to have been seen leaving the house the day Mrs Sax was found, police now say.

'She didn't deserve this, and we didn't deserve this in the family,' Natasha Rafiq, Sax's oldest daughter, said.

'We're lost and we are seeking justice for our mother.'

'I would implore anyone who had any information regarding my mother's murder to come forward and help us have a little bit of peace.'

Sax was a nurse practitioner who started her own business, Vanguard Geriatrics, which provided home care to elderly in Texas.
