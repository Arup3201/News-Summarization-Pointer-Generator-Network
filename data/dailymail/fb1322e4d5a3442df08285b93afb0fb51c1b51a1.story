Michael Clarke's much-anticipated Australia return was put on hold by torrential rain as his side's World Cup clash against Bangladesh was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Brisbane.

The Queensland coast has been battered by two cyclones over the past couple of days and the rain drifted far enough south to ensure Australia and Bangladesh were forced to share a point each.

The result is bad news for England, who are without a win after their opening two games, as they slipped behind the Tigers in Pool A.

Clarke was due to return for the first time since undergoing hamstring surgery after proving his fitness to Cricket Australia.

The 33-year-old has not played since the first Test against India and he may now be thrust into the heat of Australia's crunch clash with New Zealand in Auckland next weekend with no competitive cricket for almost three months.

The winner of that match is likely to claim top place in the group, which should ensure an easier quarter-final against the lowest-ranked qualifier from Pool B.
