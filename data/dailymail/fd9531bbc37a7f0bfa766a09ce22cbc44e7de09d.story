Federal police in Brazil are threatening to go on a nationwide strike during the World Cup in a row over pay and working conditions.

Officers staged a protest rally yesterday outside the Rio de Janeiro concert hall where national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was announcing his squad for the tournament.

They carried an inflatable white elephant to complain about the high costs that hosting the World Cup, set to begin on June 12, has brought to Brazil, which already has a struggling economy.

President of the federal police union, Andre Vaz de Mello said: ‘We gave all possible deadlines.

‘If we don't see a government response to change things, we will stop working during the World Cup.’

At Copacabana Beach, others on strike lined up footballs with red crosses on the sand, showing photos of victims who have been killed or injured in gunfights in the city's supposedly ‘pacified’ slums.

Protests are also said to have taken place in Brasilia and Fortaleza among other cities.

The latest 24 hour strike takes place just a month after federal troops were forced to restore order on the streets in the north-eastern state of Bahia, when police staged a walk out.

The opening game of the 2014 tournament will take place in Sao Paulo, where impoverished Brazilians are living illegally on land near the stadium, blaming the arena's construction for rent increases that have drove them out of their homes.

Approximately 5,000 people who invaded the private land say rising rents are a result of World Cup real-estate fever in the neighbourhood around the stadium.

‘We are not against the World Cup,’ insisted Rita de Cassia, a 35-year-old nurse who says her landlord doubled the rent on her one-bedroom house nearby, driving her family out of their home.

‘We are against how they are trying to belittle us. They are giving priority to soccer and forgetting about the families, about the Brazilian people.’

She joined the thousands of others in a group called the Homeless Workers Movement, which has been helping the families set up the tents.

Robson Goncalves, one of the movement's leaders overseeing the occupation dubbed ‘The People's Cup,’ says he doesn't know who owns the land that measures about 37 acres (150,000 square metres).

The city of Sao Paulo is said to have a housing deficit of 230,000 homes, with many waiting for a government funded property

He said it has been abandoned for two decades, and noted that no one has claimed it since the families began squatting on it last weekend.

‘Ever since they started building that stadium, property owners started overselling. This area is really becoming affordable only to the upper class,’ Mr Goncalves said.

Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad has told local media he's studying how to register the land so the families could move there legally.

But critics say other people are already waiting for a government funded house or apartment in Sao Paulo, which has a housing deficit of 230,000 homes.
