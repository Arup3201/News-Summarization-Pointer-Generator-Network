As executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt clearly likes computers - in fact, he likes them so much that he even takes photos of them, as was evident on a recent trip to North Korea.Â 

The businessman felt compelled to photograph the machines while visiting a university library in the region.

During the tour of Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, Schmidt watched students browsing the internet - even using his company's own search engine.

Powerful: Schmidt has been responsible for overseeing Google's expansion into a global internet giant

Why Schmidt is making a trip to the communist country remains a mystery.

According to one member of the US travelling party, Schmidt is 'interested in some of the economic issues 
there, the social media aspects'.

Computer use in North Korea, however, remains an anomaly, with the authoritarian regime keen to limit internet access and computers a rarity.

The trip has been described as a 'private, humanitarian' mission in an attempt to calm fears in Washington about its timing.

The US is currently seeking to punish North Korea for launching a long-range missile in December.

Schmidt's decision to visit North Korea, becoming the highest-ranking US executive to visit the country, has attracted criticism.

Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain, reportedly called the travelling group 'useful idiots'.

Schmidt has been joined in North Korea by former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, his daughter Sophie and Jared Cohen, director of the Google Ideas think tank.

North Korea, now under the control of Kim Jong Un, is currently holding US citizen Kenneth Bae, who is accused of committing 'hostile' acts against the state and faces 10 years in prison.

Richardson, who has travelled to the country several times to try to negotiate the release of prisoners, says he plans to speak to officials about the detention and plans to visit the detainee.

Schmidt and Google colleague Cohen talked with 
students working on HP desktop computers at an 'e-library' at the 
university named after North Korea founder Kim Il Sung.

One student 
showed Schmidt how he accesses reading materials from Cornell University
online on a computer with a red tag denoting it as a gift from Kim Jong
Il.

Conversation: The US delegation has been criticised for the visit given the sensitive nature of relations between America and North Korea at present

'He's actually going to a Cornell site,' Schmidt told Richardson after peering at the URL.

Cohen asked a student how he searches 
for information online, before the student clicked on Google.

'That's where I 
work,' Cohen said. He asked to be able to type in his own search, writing 'New York City' and clicking on a Wikipedia page for the city.

He pointed to a photo and told the student: 'That's where I live.'

Kim Su Hyang, a librarian, said 
students at Kim Il Sung University have had Internet access since the 
laboratory opened in April 2010. School officials said the library is 
open from 8am to midnight.

While university students at Kim Chaek
University of Science and Technology and the Pyongyang University of 
Science and Technology also have carefully monitored Internet access - 
and are under strict instructions to access only educational materials -
most North Koreans have never surfed the Web.

Computers at Pyongyang's main library 
at the Grand People's Study House are linked to a domestic
service that allows them to read only state-run media online and access a 
trove of reading materials approved by North Korean officials.

North 
Koreans with computers at home can also sign up for the Intranet 
service.

After arriving in Pyongyang on Monday evening, the group met Tuesday with officials at North Korea's Foreign Ministry.

Schmidt, who oversaw Google's 
expansion into a global Internet giant, speaks frequently about the 
importance of providing people around the world with Internet access and
technology.

Google now has offices in more than 40 countries, including
all three of North Korea's neighbors: Russia, South Korea and China, 
another country criticized for systematic Internet censorship.

Using science and technology to build 
North Korea's beleaguered economy was the highlight of a New Year's Day 
speech by leader Kim Jong Un.
