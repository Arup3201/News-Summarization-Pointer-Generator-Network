The world’s largest safety inquiry into GM crops and linked pesticides has been announced.

The $25million - £15.6m - project will involve feeding trials with 6,000 rats at laboratories in Western Europe and Russia.

The research, which is being run under the banner of Factor GMO, involves a collaboration between European, American and Russian scientists.

It is being organised by the Russian National Association for Genetic Safety, which describes itself as a non-governmental, non-profit organisation, and will be overseen by a board of neutral scientists.

The largest safety inquiry into GM crops and linked pesticides is to held, using 6,000 rats to test the products

To date, most of the safety research on GM crops and farming systems has been conducted or funded by the biotech companies, such as Monsanto, or critics of the technology.

Factor GMO says its research will be independent of vested interests and will finally give an answer to questions about the safety of GM crops and the associated weedkiller glyphosate.

Some rat feeding trials have linked the two to an increased risk of cancer, however these have been dismissed by the industry and the European Food Safety Authority.

Most GM crops, such as soya and maize, have been genetically engineered to withstand spraying with glyphosate, which is the active ingredient in the weedkiller sold as the brand Roundup. 

This allows farmers’ fields to be blanket sprayed with the chemical, which kills off the weeds but allows the crops to thrive.

The scientific review board overseeing the research includes Dr Bruce Blumberg, the Professor of Developmental and Cell Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of California.

 

He said: ‘The Factor GMO study has the potential to provide invaluable information on the health effects of a commercialised, herbicide-resistant GM food and its associated herbicide.

‘The cultivation of herbicide resistant crops is widespread in the US, and the use of the herbicides to which these crops are resistant has increased many-fold in the decades since they were introduced. 

‘There is a notable lack of published, peer-reviewed data on their safety, as well as data on the safety of the increased use of herbicides with which they are grown. The Factor GMO study could be very useful in reducing the uncertainty about the safety of these products.’

Elena Sharoykina of Factor GMO said: ‘Food is the main source of energy for all living beings, and its safety is the key to their health and well-being, as well as to sustainable development. In order to prevent irreversible consequences, humankind must ensure the total safety of GM crops and their associated pesticides before they are planted even more widely.’

It is hoped the study will answer questions about how safe GM crops and linked pesticides are for humans 

She said: ‘Comprehensive scientific safety studies on GM organisms and their related pesticides are long overdue.

‘All previous studies caused controversy for various reasons: choice of animal, insufficient statistics, duration of tests, research parameters, and researchers’ connections to the anti-GM movement or the biotech industry.

‘Factor GMO is intended to remedy the situation. The project organisers have considered all of the points of disagreement and distrust surrounding this subject. Factor GMO has in its arsenal a scientific protocol drawn up with all the necessary standards, an international scientific team of leading professionals with a neutral background, independent funding, and perhaps most importantly, full transparency.’

Dr Oxana Sinitsyna, who works in  Russia’s Sysin Research Institute of Human Ecology and Environmental Health and will sit of the governing board, said most rat feeding trials with GM food have been limited to 90 days and looked at two generations.

This project will follow five generations of rats as part of a comprehensive study lasting two to three years. It will look at any changes to cancer rates or any birth abnormalities.

Elena Sharoykina is part of Factor GMO and said the study was long  overdue and will be transparent, with independent scientists on board

She said: ‘There has never been comprehensive research investigating the effects of a GM food on reproductive function.’

Dr Fiorella Belpoggi, who is director and chief of pathology of the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Centre of the Ramazzini Institute, in Bentivoglio, Italy, said: ‘The concern over GM crops is largely due to the fact that plant breeders can construct synthetic DNA sequences and insert these into crop genomes, effectively adding new traits to the plant.

‘This raises enormous possibilities for developing benign products, but equally it has the potential to create products with unwanted traits and side-effects.

‘The long-term study design will reveal any effects that take time to show up. It could provide the detailed data needed for a scientific evidenced-based risk assessment of possible human health hazards from the GM crop and its associated pesticide.’

Funding for the research is to come from private donors, rather than the industry or campaigners. A list will be published.

Biotech companies insist that many studies have already proved that GM crops and food and safe.

Dr Julian Little, chairman of the industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, said: ‘The plant biotechnology industry takes product safety regarding biotech food and feed very seriously and is committed to the highest standards of testing for its products.

‘The Factor GMO study is far from the biggest ever study on the safety of GM, despite claims from its sponsors.

‘It falls a long way short of the European Commission’s report in 2011 when they released research from over 130 research projects, involving 500 independent research groups, over the period of 25 years, at a cost of €300m, which concluded that ‘there is, as of today, no scientific evidence associating GMOs with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms.’
