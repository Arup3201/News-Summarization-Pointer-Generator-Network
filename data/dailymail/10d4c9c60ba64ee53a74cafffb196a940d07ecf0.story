An aspiring wildlife photographer has put together an astonishing collection of photographs which reveal the close similarities between humans and primates.

Joshua Arlington, 22, took the pictures on a visit to his local zoo in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Joshua, who was born in Germany, began the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism, the tendency to find human traits in animals. But after spending the last year in such close proximity to the animals, he has forged some close friendships.

Twenty-two-year-old Joshua Arlington, an aspiring wildlife photographer, captured the animals at his local zoo in Erie, Pennsylvania

The former psychology student said he started the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism in which animals display human traits such as emotion

Two of the animals with which he has developed strong bonds are 28-year-old orangutan Joe and his two-year-old son, Ollie.

'It's amazing really,' said Joshua.

'I started this project to see how people attribute their own personality in these animals, only to find they are sometimes better at expressing their emotions than we are.

'That, I think, is what has been the most fascinating part of this whole experience - really coming to understand these animals do in fact have individual personalities and traits.

'Their body language and reactions to various stimuli, if paid attention to, really defines each one as a unique individual.'

However, despite their growing connection, the photographer is all-too-aware that the gap between him and the animals can never be fully overcome.

'I am absolutely fascinated with my growing relationship with each individual, but I also realise that there will always be a barrier between us, and one not made of reinforced glass and metal bars,' Joshua added.

'I would give anything to have a conversation with them, to truly understand how they think and feel and cope with a life so estranged from nature.'

After spending significant amounts of time with the animals however Joshua began to develop strong bonds, like with Ollie, the two-year-old orangutan

'They are sometimes better at expressing emotions than we are' said Joshue upon reflection of the project which he has been working on over the past year

Two of the animals with which Joshua bonded were orangutans, two-year-old Ollie, pictured here resting, and his 28-year-old father Joe

After being diagnosed with chronic cluster headaches, Joshua gave up his psychology course at the Rochester Institute of Technology to purse his passion for photography.

Born in Bitburg, Germany, where his father was stationed in the U.S. Air Force, he has dreams of becoming a wildlife photographer.

'Living in the city in America, I'm not exactly close to any rainforests, my wildlife experience is usually limited to the unlucky deer on the side of the road,' he said.

'The zoo is a place where I can escape for a few hours and, if only for a moment, live my dream'.

Joshua is hopeful his images of captive primates will help animal conservation efforts.

'The
palm oil industry is wiping their habitat off the face of the earth, 
and it hurts me to think that in a generation or two, someone with a 
dream similar to mine will have no choice but to photograph these 
amazing animals behind glass and brick,' said the photographer.

'I
would give anything to be able to photograph them in the wild someday, 
and it scares me that I may never have that opportunity.'

Joshua is grateful for the local zoo which allows him a rare glimpse into animals' emotions as, living in the city, he cannot see them in their natural habitat
