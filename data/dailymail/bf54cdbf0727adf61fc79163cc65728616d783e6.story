Currency trader Alex Hope, 25, is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scheme 

A currency trader nicknamed ‘King Popper’ after he spent £32,000 spraying himself with champagne is facing jail for a £5.5million Ponzi scam.

Alex Hope, 25, boasted that he was a financial wizard as he swindled investors to fund his playboy lifestyle of exclusive nightclubs and gambling.

He blew vast sums in exclusive casinos and in nightclubs around the world in a £2million binge.

A jury of five men and six women unanimously found Hope guilty of fraud after just three hours and 57 minutes of deliberation. 

The court heard the former Wembley stadium catering manager reinvented himself as a currency markets expert after teaching himself economics.

He eventually landed an office job with City-based training school Forex Academy, then met his ‘mentor’ Raj Von Badlo, 56, while working as an independent trader at Zone Invest.

By the end of 2011, investors were pouring cash into the trading scheme and huge sums were appearing in Hope’s bank account.

Hope pocketed an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5million in just 13 months, between March 2011 and April 2012 - which he used as a ‘personal piggy bank’ to fund his extravagant lifestyle.

He spent £32,000 in one evening at a Champagne Spray event in the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’.

Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘This was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other.

Hope can be seen in a video of the event wearing a drenched blue t-shirt as hundreds of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around a packed room.

Another night partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool was so excessive Hope hit the headlines for his spending.

‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke.

‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night.’

The nightclub lover blew a whopping £65,113 in a single night at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair which boasts Buckingham Palace and the Ritz as its neighbours.

The court heard part of that night's tab included a bottle of Cristal bought for singer Rihanna.

Jurors heard that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after she performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London’s Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800.

He then treated the 26-year-old singer to a Jeroboam bottle of Cristal following her set at the exclusive venue on February 26, 2012. 

Hope also spent £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’.

He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table at the lavish venue he visited more than 81 times.

But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced.

Ms Clarke said it was ‘quite clear’ that Hope’s money ‘must have belonged to confirmed investors’ in his trading scheme.

‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ she asked.

Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his wild spending, including a taste for Christian Louboutin trainers and expensive watches.

Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, blowing nearly £64,000 on ‘upper class’ travel to Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Dubai.

He blew £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 in one night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai.

A video filmed at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York shows Hope pan around the luxurious suite and ends with a shot of his bed, strewn with money and designer clothes.

‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s.

‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’

Videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before cutting out.

Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud.

‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out.

‘As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’

Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, lost £50,000 after investing in the fraudulent scheme.

The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed the cash to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months.

Retired teacher Christopher Millard ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s fraud which saw him lose £15,000.

In one email to Mr Millard, he wrote: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’

Hope and Von Badlo used extensive PR to lure investors into the scam and spent £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media.

In one ‘spectacularly successful’ promotional push, Hope and Von Badlo held a seminar at the four-star Copthorne Hotel in Slough on 10 March 2012.

Glossy folders informed potential investors about the ‘Alex Hope Private Fund’ and the crowd heard Hope needed £5m to start his ‘dream’ hedge fund.

He was presented as a financial whizz-kid, capable of making huge profits for his investors at the same time as sustaining trading losses of £500,000 and capital liabilities of more than £3,500,000.

A second promotional stunt saw Von Badlo interview Hope outside the Old Trafford football stadium in September 2011 for a video intended to impress potential investors.

In it Hope boasts: ‘It is very easy to make quite a lot of money.’

Hope was using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion.

After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. 

Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’.

‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke.

He admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit.

Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denied one charge of fraud.

He pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA.

Von Badlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial.

Judge Deborah Taylor told Hope: ‘I am adjourning this case for sentencing until next Friday at this court, in the meantime you are remanded in custody.’ 

The pair will return to Southwark Crown Court on 16 January to be sentenced.
