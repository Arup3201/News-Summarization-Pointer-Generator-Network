Comedian Stephen Colbert spent the weekend bowling, handing out ham-and-cheese biscuits and hosting high-dollar fundraisers all on behalf of his sister, a Democrat who is running for Congress in South Carolina's heavily Republican 1st District. 

Elizabeth Colbert Busch is running for the House seat that former Rep. Tim Scott, R-S.C., left vacant when he joined the Senate this year.  A special election is scheduled for May 7 and the primaries will be held next month. 

Her weekend of campaigning with her comedian younger brother began in New York with a $5,200-a-plate dinner and fundraiser on the Upper West Side.

The pair then flew down to South Carolina for a bowling party and then another $5,200-a-plate dinner at the private home of a supporter. 

General admission for the bowling party cost $250, but people could also pay $1,000 for a private reception.

The invitation for the fundraiser came with a note from Colbert.

'Lulu and I have been through a lot together, and I know she is a bright, competent, caring woman who will work hard on behalf of all the citizens of South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District,' Colbert says in the e-mail invitation. 'There are three Democrats and sixteen Republicans running in the Primary, including former Governor and renowned hike-lover Mark Sanford. Our chances look good.'

Colbert, of course, was referring to Sanford's infamous cover-up for his six-day disappearance in  2009 while he was governor of South Carolina. Sanford told his staff he was hiking the Appalachian trail, before he eventually came clean about the fact that he had been with his mistress in Argentina.

Despite his affair, Sanford, a Republican, is still considered the favorite to win the 1st District House seat.

The heavily Republican district gave President Obama only 40 percent of the vote in 2012 and more than a dozen Republicans are vying for the seat.

So even if Colbert Busch wins the Democratic nomination, she will face a steep uphill climb to win the special election.

Colbert, who plays a faux Republican newscaster on 'The Colbert Report,' said he is campaigning for his sister despite her Democratic loyalties because he owed her a debt from when they were little. 

'When I tried to attack my brother Jay with a ball-peen hammer, she took my side,' he told voters at a 'meet-'n'-greet' breakfast Sunday morning where the brother-and-sister pair handed out ham-and-cheese biscuits.

On a more serious note, Colbert previously told fellow television host Jimmy Fallon on that he's supporting his sister because she is an 'incredible person.'

'She raised three kids by herself on a salary of like $14,000 a year, then she went to college, made something of herself and now she’s going to be the Democratic nominee from South Carolina,' he said. 'Isn’t that incredible?'

Colbert has jokingly flirted with runs for political office in the past and said he hoped that his stunts wouldn't 'sully' her character.

'I don't actually have anything to offer people in a public office,' he said. 'It's natural for her to run because she has skills and something to offer society. I am professionally ridiculous. So I just hope that what I do for a living doesn't sully her good character.'#

Addressing their choice to hold a fundraiser in a bowling alley, he explained, 'We're going to raise money in a bowling alley because we're of the people. You know, you've got to go to a bowling alley because that's where the people are.'

And besides, he added, bowling is 'one of the few sports that come with a bar.'

Colbert Busch is currently the director of business development at Clemson University's Restoration Institute, where she is responsible for finding corporate investors for the university's green energy research.
