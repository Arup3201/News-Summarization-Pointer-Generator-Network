FA chairman Greg Dyke has described as ‘pretty scary’ the increase in disciplinary cases brought against players surrounding referees to try to influence decisions.

Dyke was speaking out a week after Chelsea’s Champions League defeat by Paris Saint-Germain during which nine Chelsea players crowded around the Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers following Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s challenge on Oscar which resulted in the Swedish talisman being sent off.

The FA clampdown on such incidents has seen an increase in clubs in the top five divisions – from the Premier League to the Conference - charged with 'surrounding match officials' (three or more players from one club approach a match official in a confrontational manner) from six last season to 16 with another three months of the campaign still to go.

Warnings or reminders are also up from 23 last campaign to 29 during 2014-2015.

Dyke said: 'We have seen a pretty scary increase this season in the number of clubs charged with their players surrounding referees. As a result we have written to the clubs in the top five divisions reminding them of the rules and their responsibilities.

'I believe it is particularly important for professional cubs to set an example so that this kind of conduct is not replicated at grassroots and youth level. The whole game needs to ensure it is addressing this issue.’

The rapid increase in FA charges follows not only the December letter sent to 116 teams but also visits to clubs last summer when this issue was raised directly with players who were told that it would not be tolerated.

The FA will now look at heavier fines than the current sliding scale of costs from £20,000-£500 or other options to address the worrying upward curve in harassing the match officials.

Referees could also start to be more proactive themselves by showing yellow cards to the players surrounding them, which is within their powers.

Ironically, considering that the Chelsea players' distasteful conduct brought this issue to the fore, UEFA do not have a similar charge in their rulebook.

Chelsea captain John Terry admitted after the PSG match that the willingness to surround referees ‘doesn’t look good’.

But Terry was adamant they would continue to do so if they believe opponents - such as PSG – are attempting to exert their own influence on the match officials.

Terry said: 'For me, if I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn’t look great, but when you’re standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref... for me, I think I support my team-mates. 'And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn’t look good at all, but that’s part of the game.'
