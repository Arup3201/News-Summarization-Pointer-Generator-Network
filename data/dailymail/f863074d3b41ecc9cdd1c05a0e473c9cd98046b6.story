It's a tradition going back a quarter of a century, but really not one where you want to spill the red wine.

Thousands of foodies dressed from head to toe in sparkling white converged on Paris last night to quaff champagne and eat fine foods together as the annual Diner en Blanc celebrated its 25th birthday.

Diners, who had signed up for the event were kept in the dark as to the location of the giant dinner party right up until the last minute, but were told to make their way to either the Trocadéro or the grounds of the Louvre via email earlier in the evening.

Diner en Blanc: People, all dressed up in white, have a dinner on the Trocadero square in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris

All white: Diners also gathered at the Louvre to celebrate the 25th birthday of the Diner en Blanc tradition that has now spread worldwide

Celebration: Diners have to dress head to toe in white and bring a picnic table and white table cloth to the event

Come dine with us: More than 15,000 people were expected to attended for dinner but only invited guests are allowed a seat

Within the hour, row upon row of picnic tables - complete with white table cloths - were set up, wine was uncorked and revellers began sharing food at the spectacular event.

Guests enjoyed their dinner against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower and the city's most iconic museum until midnight, when they pack up their rubbish and leave.

The tradition began in 1988 when a group of ten friends decided they wanted to eat at a forbidden spot in the French capital.

But they ended up dining as a 200 strong flash mob at the Jardins de Bagatelle, a favourite spot of French royalty including Marie Antoinette.

Al fresco dining: Diners were only told the venue of the 'flashmob' dinner by email shortly before dinner started and within an hour, thousands had descended within their tables

Eat to the beat: A band entertains diners who ate al fresco in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower last night

Fine dining: Guests wore all their finest white clothes, brought china plates and bottles of champagne to toast Diner en Blanc's birthday

Packed in: Tables were arranged in rows with men supposed to sit on one side and women seated on the other and guests can only be seated once everyone in their row has set up their table

Since then the event has gone global with versions of the dinner taking place in European cities such as Milan and Barcelona and much further afield in more than a dozen locations in the US, Canada, Singapore and even Rwanda and the Ivory Coast.

The craze finally made the short journey from its Paris home across the Channel to London only last September when thousands of diners converged on the South Piazza of Covent Garden.

But the Paris version remains the tradition's definitive one. Each year the guest list exceeds 15,000 say organisers and past dinners have taken place at such illustrious settings as the Pont des Arts, the grounds of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles.

Be our guest: The grounds of the Louvre have hosted the Diner en Blanc event in the past, which started when a group of friends wanted to dine in a forbidden area in 1988

Opulent: The square at the centre of Paris's most famous museum provided a magnificent backdrop for those who arrived to eat at this year's dinner

Trendsetter: One woman bucks the trend by accessorising her white outfit with a bright pink hat as guests decide where to set

Invite only: Guests at both venues would have either had to have attended the last Paris event or been invited by someone who did

Those on the guest list will have either attended the previous year's event or been invited by someone who did.

Everyone who is invited must bring a guest and arrive by public transport.

Guests must bring a picnic table, a picnic basket, foldable cheers and a table cloth - all in white of course.

Men and women sit on opposite sides of the table to one another and guests are forbidden to sit down until their entire row have set up their table.

And if you are invited, don't let a double booking or inclement weather put you off - if you fail to turn up or don't abide by the events rules then you won't be invited back.

No excuses: Diner enjoyed good weather for the event, but shouldn't be deterred by inclement weather - if you fail to turn up and are on the guest list then you are blacklisted from future events
