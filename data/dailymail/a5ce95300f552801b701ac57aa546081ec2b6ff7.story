Robbie Keane has reacted after being demoted to the bench for the first time in 13 years as the Republic of Ireland fell to a 1-0 defeat by Scotland in Euro 2016 qualifying.

The last time Ireland's all-time leading goalscorer started on the bench for his country was a World Cup qualifier against Estonia in June 2001, which the Green Army won 2-0.

However, manager Martin O'Neill decided to use a lone striker  and preferred to start with Southampton's Shane Long at Celtic Park before seeing his side undone by Shaun Maloney's 74th minute winner.

Robbie Keane started on the bench for the first time since 2001 in Ireland's 1-0 defeat to Scotland on Friday 

As Ireland looked for an equaliser Keane was brought on for Jeff Hendrick in the 78th minute at Celtic Park 

The LA Galaxy striker has 65 goals in all competitions for his country but  in-form Shane Long was preferred

Speaking to Dublin radio station 98FM, the frustrated LA Galaxy striker offered his opinion on the manager's change of tactics.

'Listen, if the manger wants to play one up front I'm not f*****g Niall Quinn or Shane Long - they're better than that than I am,' he said. 

'If they want to play two up front and score goals then that's my game. I'd prefer to speak about the team rather than make a big deal over who started the game.

'The manager has made a decision and you have to respect that. Playing one up front doesn't suit me. It's fairly obvious, I'm 5ft 10in so it it's not my game.

The 34-year-old reflected what had been a scrappy game by claiming it mirrored typical Old Firm derbies he had played in as a Celtic player. 

'The game was exactly like an Old Firm derby when I played up here; no quality, just people trying to kick each other,' he said. 

'It was a scrappy affair and we knew that whoever scored the first goal was probably going to win the game.'

Manager Martin O'Neill said that Long's pace was the deciding factor in his decision to bench Keane

Despite missing the opportunity to take control of Group D - Ireland dropped to fourth place and are level on points with Scotland and Germany - Keane insists that all is not lost in qualifying for France.

'Listen, by know means is this over, we can't get too down on ourselves. We're disappointed tonight but overall if we look at the bigger picture and the points we have.

'Although, when you go away to Germany and get a point you probably expect to get something out of the game here, but we didn't, he added.

Keane was eventually brought on in the 78th minute by O'Neill as Ireland searched in vain for an equaliser against the Scots.

Before the game the Ireland manager was full of praise for Keane: 'Robbie's been splendid for us, absolutely splendid. 

'He scored a hat-trick (against Gibraltar) and he's a goalscorer,' he added.

'Shane (Long) of course scored a couple of goals at the weekend. He's in good form and looking forward to it.

'He has a little bit of pace up there and I think he can stretch them so he gets the nod.

'I'm sure that Robbie will be champing at the bit to get on the field.'
