Nick Gordon was 'jealous' of Bobbi Kristina's fame and 'couldn't understand why Whitney's daughter was offered more money than him for a reality TV deal,' according to reports.

The only daughter of Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, remains comatose at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta over a week after being found face down in the bathtub at her home - in a scene that echoed the untimely death of her mother in 2012.

It has now been claimed that the couple's fights were almost always triggered by 'Nick's jealousy over Bobbi Kristina's fame'.

Bobbi Kristina and partner Nick Gordon allegedly had a violent relationship according to sources - and he was 'jealous of her fame'. She has been in hospital for over a week after being found comatose in the bath

While Bobbi Kristina and Gordon's violent relationship was well known among their friends, it was fueled by his jealousy of her fame, a source told TMZ.

Gordon felt he was also Whitney Houston's child and so could not understand why people focused more on Bobbi, the source claimed.

Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up as brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death the duo announced they were in a relationship.

Whitney Houston raised him as her own son at her home outside Atlanta but never legally adopted him.

Now sources claim he is jealous of his partner and cited a recent incident in which the couple were trying to get their own reality TV show, but Gordon wasn't offered the same deal as Bobbi Kristina so they turned it down. 

Gordon has been summoned to appear in court today to answer charges of reckless driving.

A warrant for his immediate arrest will be issued if he does not turn up at Fulton County State Court in Atlanta at 9am.  

Gordon, 25, was caught driving at over twice the speed limit along a suburban road in November 2012.

Suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved, according to TMZ.

Reports have suggested Gordon will also be the focus of a police investigation into how Bobbi Kristina ended up in hospital.

Singing legend Whitney was found dead in the bath tub of her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11 2012.

Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in Whitney's suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned.

Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances last Saturday.

While police said they had found drugs in the house, it is not clear how Bobbi came to lose consciousness. 

Her cousin Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye.

Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Gordon and her friend Max Lomas at her home.

Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported.

When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said.

It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for up to 15 minutes before she was discovered.

She was rushed to hospital and her family have remained tight-lipped about her condition. 

Her father Bobby Brown spoke out last week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon.

Last January the couple had announced that were married and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media.

But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father said: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.'

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.'

Relations between Gordon and other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston. 

Bobbi's parents' 15-year marriage was dogged by rumors of drug-fueled domestic violence.
