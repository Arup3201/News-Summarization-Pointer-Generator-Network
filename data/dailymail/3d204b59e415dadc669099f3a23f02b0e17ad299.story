Custom-made 128 years ago, this 30ft caravan is more like a palace on wheels.

Commissioned by Scotsman Dr William Stables, The Wanderer  was the first caravan to be made purely for the pleasure of travel.

Made from mahogany and maple wood, and painted black and gold, former naval officer Dr Stables wanted the life of a gypsy while traveling in style - spawning the nickname 'Gentleman Gypsy'.

So well did he emulate the travellers who inspired him, he was once pelted with stones by unwelcoming villagers.

Although it can be pulled by car, in Dr Stables' day the work was done by two horses, Captain Corn-flower and Polly Pea-blossom.

An extraordinary sight in its day, he had to employ a valet to cycle ahead and clear the roads, warning road users it was coming.

Now, thanks to a donation by Dr Stables’ descendents, the Edwardian single-berth van, which went on its first tour in 1885 and was last used in 1960, has finally come to rest at the Cotswolds Caravan Club.

The mobile home was an extraordinary sight at the time, so much so that a valet was employed to cycle ahead, clearing the way and warning other road users.

The Wanderer has clocked up tens of thousands of miles and was inspired by traditional horse-drawn Romany wagons. It boasts a bookcase, china cabinet and even musical instruments to entertain campers when it rained outside.

But the world's first caravan has been gathering dust for years and was only wheeled out on special occasions.

Beverley
Larion, of the Caravan Club, said: 'We would prefer to keep it at the 
Caravan Club rather than in a storage facility so our members can enjoy 
it.'It’s the most beautiful display of craftsmanship internally and the upholstery is all original.'

The Wanderer  was restored over ten years leading up to The Caravan Club’s centenary in 2007 
when it took centre stage at Buckingham Palace as it was pulled through the gates of 
Buckingham Palace by horses.
