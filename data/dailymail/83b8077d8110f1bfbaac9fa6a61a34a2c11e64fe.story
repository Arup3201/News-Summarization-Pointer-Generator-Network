A schoolgirl was killed on her first ever ride on a motorbike when her neighbour crashed after just 20 yards.

Caitlin Edwards, 13, was still in her pyjamas when newly-qualified Adrian Hope, 41, offered to take her for a spin on his powerful new bike.

But Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, in Wales, heard excited Caitlin was only on the back of the bike for seconds when it crashed into a car and she was thrown into a wall.

'Princess' Caitlin Edwards, 13, was still in her pyjamas when she died during a ride on the motorbike of newly qualified Adrian Hope, 41

Hope, from Merthyr Tydfi, was jailed for 18 months after admitting death by dangerous driving

Caitlin, described as a 'beautiful princess' by her parents, was not wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries.

She died a week later when her life support machine was turned off.

The court heard Hope had only passed his test eight weeks earlier and was struggling to cope with the 1200cc Suzuki motorbike.

Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Hope pulled up on the bike outside Caitlin's home and she asked for a ride on the back.

'Her mother was there - she heard the request and thought nothing of it. Caitlin who was dressed in pyjama bottoms and a vest top climbed onto the bike.

The motorbike bike was driven just 20 metres and was doing 29mph when it crashed. Caitlin, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, suffered multiple injuries

'She laughed when Hope, who intended to drive the bike just three doors down, stalled it.

'But as he restarted it, he opened the throttle in such a way that the bike shot forward.'

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Hope planned to drive to a house just three doors down from Caitlin's home.

Investigations revealed the motorbike was driven just 20 metres and was doing 29mph when it crashed.

Hope broke his neck in the accident and Caitlin, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, suffered multiple injuries.

Mr Edwards said the family does not blame Hope 'solely for the tragic incident which resulted in the death.'

Council labourer Hope, of Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil, sobbed as he was jailed for 18 months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.

Aled Watkins, defending, said: 'This case is tragic in every sense, it has affected two families significantly.

'He is deeply ashamed for what he has done and does not like the thought of showing his face in public.'

Hope was also disqualified from driving for four years and will have to pass an extended driving test.Â
