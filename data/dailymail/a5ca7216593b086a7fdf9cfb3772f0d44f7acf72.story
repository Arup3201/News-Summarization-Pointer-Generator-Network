Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has wished Fernando Torres well after the Spaniard's loan move to Atletico was confirmed on Monday.

Torres, 30, has agreed to return to his boyhood club from AC Milan until the end of the 2015-16 season.

His first match back in the shirt of Atletico Madrid could be against city rivals Real in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on January 7 - although the La Liga champions do play Levante on January 3.
