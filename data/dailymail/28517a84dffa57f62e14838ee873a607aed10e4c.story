Kim shocked the world as she stepped out in Paris today debuting a new platinum blonde hair do, the star had gone to great pains to keep it under wraps before 

On arriving in the French capital, Kim had gone to lengths to disguise her new platinum style, keeping it wrapped under a woollen hat as she entered her hotel.

But as she left the Le Royal Monceau for the Balmain fashion show today she was clearly ready for the big reveal as she stepped proudly out in front of the paparazzi.

This certainly isn't the first time that Kim has changed her hair colour - but it does seem to be her most extreme look yet. 

In the past she's mostly had dark locks but she has tried out numerous different styles including giant curls and a blunt fringe and she even once gave cornrows a go.

The star recently revealed that she only washes her hair one every five days. She told Into The Gloss: 'For my hair, I don't wash it every day. 

'We start out with a blowout on day one, then we go into a messier vibe the next day, and then we flat iron it and do a really sleek look on day three since that requires a little oil in the hair.'

'Day four could be a slicked-back ponytail. On the fifth day is when you wash it. That's a little excessive, maybe.'

She also recently revealed that she has her hairline lasered after realising that she has an incredibly hairy forehead.
