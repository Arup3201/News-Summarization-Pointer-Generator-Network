Jose Mourinho will make a late decision on whether striker Diego Costa will be fit to feature for Chelsea on Saturday's Premier League resumption against Swansea.

Costa, the £32million signing from Atletico Madrid, has scored four times in his first three games for Chelsea, but withdrew from the Spain squad during the international break with a hamstring problem.

'Diego came back injured, but that was last Saturday,' Mourinho said.

'He had one week to work hard with the medical department. He has a chance to play tomorrow (Saturday).

'We have a training session now (on Friday afternoon) to confirm his condition and to make the final decision.'

Mourinho had little doubt Costa would adapt swiftly to the Premier League.

'When we bought him we were very optimistic,' the Portuguese added.

Jose Mourinho admits the signing of Loic Remy was a reaction to the loss of Fernando Torres (above)

'His profile as a player, his profile also as a person. A player (who) is also part of a team and we knew that the team was going in a certain direction and was waiting for a person like him to be there.

'His start was good. Three matches, three victories and four goals.'

Loic Remy, who signed from QPR for a reported fee of £10.5million after Fernando Torres left for AC Milan on a two-year loan, is in contention to make his debut against the Swans, who like Chelsea have begun the season with three wins from three games.
