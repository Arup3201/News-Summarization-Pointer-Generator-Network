Millie Mackintosh is the golden girl of 
Made in Chelsea and is almost as famous for her dewy glow and good looks as 
she is for her relationship with Professor Green.

And as she prepares to embark on a festival tour across the UK following her rapper beau, she has exclusively shared her tips for getting festival ready with MailOnline.

As
a fully trained make-up artist and beauty blogger, the 23-year-old has 
plenty of tricks up her sleeve when it comes to getting ready.

Festival chic: Millie Mackintosh is likely to be following Professor Green on part of his festival tour this summer so she has shared her tips for looking glam on the go

While most mere mortals spend their time glamming up in a tent or porta-loo before the night's festivities, Millie is lucky enough to be treated to a cushy VIP area, but she still has to pack her favourite beauty essentials into her rucksack.

To keep her prized, flawless skin in tip-top condition, Millie swears by Manuka Doctor hydrating cleanser and their blemish cream.

Speaking about the product, she said: 'I pop this in my handbag 
and dab it on to instantly zap zits – it keeps my skin clear all 
weekend.'

To keep her visage refreshed, she swears by Eau Thermale Avene Water Spray and moisturises with STEAMCREAM, which she uses to keep her legs hydrated and silky smooth whilst wearing her famous denim shorts.

And when it comes to festival fashion, the starlet, who is famed on the show for having a great sense of style, is keen to snap up a certain pair of wellies.

Speaking about the festival staple, she said: 'I have my eye on a Matthew Williamson pair with a gorgeous colourful print.'

And as for the rest of her festival fashion accessories, she said: 'I like to wear my most eccentric sunglasses.

'It might be some bright Ray-Bans this year and a luxury hat – probably a felt Fedora.

'I will be taking an Accessorize boho rucksack with an ethnic print this year and a Barbour.

'They
have some really cool jackets this year – I will be getting a 
camouflage one. It is a great cover up option for if it pours with 
rain.'

Favourite Fedora: Millie will be packing plenty of hats as she hits the campsite this summer

And the star, who is notorious for showing off her endless legs in tiny shorts, added: 'And I will be packing denim hot pants – no festival is complete without these!'

Professor Green will be performing at the likes of Glastonbury and Ibiza Rocks, so Millie's summer looks set to be one big party as the circuit's most glamorous groupie.
