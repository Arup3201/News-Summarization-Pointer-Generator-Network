Louis van Gaal has poked fun at Manchester United's official Twitter feed after they mistakenly reported last week that Daley Blind would be sidelined for six months with a knee injury.

Giving his press conference ahead of Saturday's home match with Hull City, Van Gaal joked that after being 'misinterpreted' last time he had asked his medical advisor to provide him with a list of the current injuries at the club.

After Blind damaged knee ligaments in Holland's European Championship qualifying win over Latvia, United's Twitter feed said he would be on the sidelines for six months.

Louis van Gaal made a joke at the expense of Manchester United's Twitter feed after they mistakenly reported last week that midfielder Daley Blind would be out injured for six months

In reality, as Van Gaal confirmed on Friday, Blind will return to the club on Monday and should be back in action in a couple of weeks.

The Dutch manager said: 'Last time I have said something and it was not so good interpreted. So, I have asked my medical advisor. Maybe Manchester United Twitter account can pay attention to it.'

To the sounds of laughter from the journalists in the room, Van Gaal then produces a pair of glasses and begins reading slowly from a piece of paper.

'So, Luke [Shaw] sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications and he will be out for the next few weeks because of this.'

One reporter shouts: 'Not six months then' in reference to the Blind tweet.

United's injury problems do seem to be easing ahead of Saturday's match at Old Trafford as they bid to stay in the Barclays Premier League top four.

Van Gaal confirmed that striker Radamel Falcao and defender Marcos Rojo will both return to the squad for the Hull match.

The Colombia striker, who has scored just once since joining United on loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day, has not played for five weeks because of a calf injury.

Rojo dislocated his shoulder in the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City at the start of this month and may be involved.

‘We have to wait and see in the last training session,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I live day by day at this moment.

'It’s always difficult to say but we have good news. Maybe Falcao and Rojo come back in the 18, that’s it I think. The rest were already fit.’

He confirmed that Shaw will be absent for between four and six weeks with the ankle ligament injury sustained in United's 2-1 win at Arsenal last Saturday.

Van Gaal also confirmed that he has given Blind a holiday after the midfielder suffered his injury in Holland's 6-0 win at the Amsterdam ArenA.

The United boss said: ‘I gave Daley Blind a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise. He didn’t have so much holiday because of the World Cup. You may remember the Netherlands were there until the end.

‘He will come back on Monday. Then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player.’
