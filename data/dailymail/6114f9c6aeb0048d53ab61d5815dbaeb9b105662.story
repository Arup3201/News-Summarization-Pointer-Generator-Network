As part of one of their latest promotions, supermarket giant Woolworths has been handing out Disney Pixar domino packs with each $20 spent.

But the toys have garnered somewhat of a cult following online, with parents willing to splash hundreds of dollars to secure particular ones missing from their collections, or an entire set.

A quick look on ebay revealed thousands of listings, with some sets receiving dozens of bids over the $100 mark.

People are selling full sets of Wooloworths' Disney Pixar dominos for hundreds of dollars

Full sets of the promotional collectables have parents bidding over $100 for them on ebay

One particular person could soon make $117.50 off a full set of the collectables, as there have already been more than 23 bids on the item.

Others have taken to posting ads selling dozens of 'unopened' packets, in their hundreds. 

Parents are also harnessing the power of social media in an attempt to acquire the missing pieces to complete their children's sets.

Those looking for specific dominoes have taken to Twitter and Facebook in an attempt to swap, sell or buy particular numbers. 

'Does anyone have a bullseye, eve &flik spare Woolworths dominos?' one tweeter wrote.
