Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis refused to apologize on Monday for a controversial ad her campaign released last week that targets her wheelchair-bound, Republican opponent Greg Abbott. 

The Davis ad uses an empty wheelchair to criticize Abbott, the Lone Star state's partially paralyzed attorney general, for his handling of other victims' legal claims as a government official.

The spot has been widely cast as the most negative political ad of the election cycle, and Davis has been skewered by conservatives for preying on Abbott's disability. 

David stood by the ad today at a news conference, telling reporters 'this ad is about one thing and one thing only: It is about Greg Abbott's hypocrisy.'

Flanked at the press conference by disabled supporters in wheelchairs, Davis said Abbott 'deserved justice for the terrible tragedy he endured.'

'But then he turned around and built his career working to deny the very same justice he received to his fellow Texans rightly seeking it for themselves,' she charged.

The two pols are locked in a bitter struggle to succeed Gov. Rick Perry.

Abbott, 56, has been a paraplegic since age 26 when he was paralyzed by a falling tree during a run. The Davis ad uses an empty wheelchair to symbolize her disapproval of his policies.

'A tree fell on Greg Abbott. He sued and got millions,' the ad's narrator says. 'Since then, he's spent his career working against other victims.'

'Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb,' the ad alleges. 'He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a background check on a sexual predator. He sided with a hospital that failed to stop a dangerous surgeon who paralyzed patients.'

Abbott's campaign fired at Davis, a state senator, with both barrels after the ad went viral for all the wrong reasons.

'It is challenging to find language strong enough to condemn Sen. Davis' disgusting television ad, which represents a historic low for someone seeking to represent Texans,' the campaign's deputy communications director, Amelia Chasse, said in a statement.

'Sen. Davis' ad shows a disturbing lack of judgment from a desperate politician,' she said, 'and completely disqualifies her from seeking higher office in Texas.'

In an interview on Fox News on Monday evening Abbott said it is Davis' 'prerogative' to 'attack a guy in a wheelchair.'

'As for me, I’m running a different type of campaign. I am running a campaign that’s focused on solving the problems of Texans,' he told Fox host Sean Hannity.

Abbott said the 'irony' of Davis' ad is that 'all of those things' she claimed 'are equally false because there’s no one who has a stronger track record for protecting victims of rape as I do.

'I created an entire new unit at the Office of the Attorney General where I have arrested more than 4,500 sex offenders and put them behind bars,' he said, according to Politico.

The three most recent published polls show Abbott leading the race by an average of 11.3 percentage points, according to Real Clear Politics.

Davis stepped away from a backbench in the Texas legislature in 2013 when she spent 13 hours filibustering a law written to limit the number of clinics in the state that could perform abortions.

After she successfully ran out the clock on the legislative session, Gov. Perry called lawmakers back for a special session to pass the bill anyway.

The pink sneakers she wore during the marathon as supporters flooded the capitol rotunda became a rallying cry for the state's liberal minority, and she was quickly urged to run for governor.

A right-wing pundit labeled her 'Abortion Barbie' weeks later. That epithet has stuck.

It appeared on 20 posters that showed up in Hollywood, California, in May when Davis traveled there to raise money.

A Republican donor paid for the posters, designed by street artist Sabo – the same anonymous man who created posters mocking Barack Obama and actress Gwyneth Paltrow this week when the president spoke a a fundraiser she hosted at her expansive Los Angeles home.

The wheelchair ad has attracted slings and arrows from both the right and left. 

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski called it 'ridiculous.'

Fox News Channel co-host Bob Beckel, a liberal voice who managed the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, offered some of the harshest words.

'This isn't a Hail Mary,' he said during a broadcast of 'The Five.'

'This is a Hail Mary to lose. This is like running the other way with the ball.' 

'This is the kind of thing that you never, ever do, is take advantage of some of your opponents physical or mental ... conditions,' Beckel said. 'It's almost certain to backfire in every direction you could possibly imagine.'
