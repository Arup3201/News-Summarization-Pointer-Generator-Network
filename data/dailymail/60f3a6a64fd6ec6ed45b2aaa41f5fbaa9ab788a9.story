Some see penalty shoot-outs as a lottery - a cruel way to decide any match, let alone a World Cup semi-final.

But Argentina's win over Holland on Wednesday night in Sao Paulo wasn't just down to the luck of the spot-kick. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero guessed correctly for two of Holland's penalties in the 4-2 shootout win after a nervy 0-0 draw... or did he?

The Sampdoria stopper was seen with crib notes between each penalty, saving from Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder of Galatasaray.

The 27-year-old put the notes back down his shorts as he prepared to 'guess' the correct way and become Argentina's hero.

Romero, who clearly studied each taker before the showdown, knowing there was a good possibility the game could go all the way, saw his homework pay off to put Argentina into their first World Cup final in 24 years.

Holland manager Louis van Gaal revealed two players had refused to take the first penalty after their shootout defeat.

Argentina scored all four penalties to secure a place in the World Cup final against Germany in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday.

Van Gaal wasn't able to send specialist goalkeeper Tim Krul on in goal for the penalties as he did last week as he had already used three substitutes.

To add to his pain, Argentina goalkeeper Romero once played for him at AZ Alkmaar.

'We didn't lose against them, but the penalties are down to luck,' he added.

'I taught Romero how to stop penalties, so that hurts.'

It's not the first time crib notes have been used in a major tournament, and Argentina were on the receiving end of some extra homework in 2006.

Germany and then-Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann revealed he had notes while saving two of Argentina's four spot-kicks in the quarter-final win at the World Cup in 2006 in Berlin.

Lehmann guessed correctly for the other two penalties, also, and was unlucky not to save all four, but the stopper attributed the win to the studies of the Argentina players' penalty habits.

For Argentina's second penalty-taker, Roberto Ayala, the note said: 'Ayala - look at shooting foot, left low.' Predictably, Lehmann saved Ayala's penalty to give Germany the advantage before blocking Esteban Cambiasso's deciding kick.

Lehmann's note sold in a charity auction for $1.3million months later.
