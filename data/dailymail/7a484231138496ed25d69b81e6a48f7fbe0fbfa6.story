The 5:2 diet claims to not only help people lose weight, but also guard against diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's.

Created by scientist Michael Mosley, it involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, and men to 600 calories. The rest of the time, they can eat normally.

Now a new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a 'feast and famine' diet, eating far more than they would one day and fasting another.

Intermittent fasting is an umbrella term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and eating normally. 

Perhaps the most famous is the 5:2 diet which involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, and men to 600 calories. The rest of the time, they can eat normally.

Previous animal studies suggest that intermittent fasting can guard against  diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's.

Scientists believe it provides these benefits by allowing the body to respond better to stress that might otherwise damage it.

For instance, fasting could reduce inflammation, or improve the removal of damaged molecules, as well as starve tumors, according to previous research.

But the health benefits of the diet only appear if people don't increase their intake of antioxidants, which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries, as well as vitamin C and vitamin E supplements.

During a three-week period, 24 participants alternated one day of eating 25 per cent of their daily caloric intake with one day of eating 175 per cent of their daily caloric intake.

The study by the University of Florida measured the participants' changes in weight, blood pressure, heart rate and glucose levels over 10 weeks.

They also looked at cholesterol, markers of inflammation and genes involved in protective cell responses.

'We found that intermittent fasting caused a slight increase to SIRT 3, a well-known gene that promotes longevity and is involved in protective cell responses,' said Michael Guo, a co-author at Harvard Medical School.

The SIRT3 gene encodes a protein also called SIRT3.

The protein SIRT3 belongs to a class of proteins called sirtuins which, if increased in mice, can extend their lifespans.

Researchers think proteins such as SIRT3 are activated by oxidative stress, which is triggered when there are more free radicals produced in the body than it can neutralise with antioxidants. 

However, small levels of free radicals can be beneficial: When the body undergoes stress - which happens during fasting - small levels of oxidative stress can trigger protective pathways, Guo said.

'The hypothesis is that if the body is intermittently exposed to low levels of oxidative stress, it can build a better response to it,' Wegman said.

The researchers found that the intermittent fasting decreased insulin levels in the participants, which means the diet could have an anti-diabetic effect as well.

To test antioxidant supplements, the participants repeated the diet but also included vitamin C and vitamin E.

At the end of the three weeks, the researchers tested the same health parameters. They found that the beneficial sirtuin proteins such as SIRT 3 and another, SIRT1, tended to increase as a result of the diet.

However, when antioxidants were supplemented on top of the diet, some of these increases disappeared.

A new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a 'feast and famine' diet, eating far more than they would one day and fasting another. But only if people don't increase their intake of antioxidants, which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries (pictured)

This is in line with some research that indicates flooding the system with antioxidants may counteract the effects of fasting or exercise, said Dr Christiaan Leeuwenburgh who was involved in the research.

'You need some pain, some inflammation, some oxidative stress for some regeneration or repair,' Dr Leeuwenburgh said.

'These young investigators were intrigued by the question of whether some antioxidants could blunt the healthy effects of normal fasting.'

On the study participants' fasting days, they ate foods such as roast beef and gravy, mashed potatoes, Oreo cookies and orange sherbet - but they ate only one meal.

On the feasting days, the participants ate bagels with cream cheese, oatmeal sweetened with honey and raisins, turkey sandwiches, apple sauce, spaghetti with chicken, yogurt and soda - and lemon pound cake, Snickers bars and vanilla ice cream.

'Most of the participants found that fasting was easier than the feasting day, which was a little bit surprising to me,' Dr Guo said. 'On the feasting days, we had some trouble giving them enough calories.'

Dr Leeuwenburgh said future studies should examine a larger group of participants and should include studying a larger number of genes in the participants as well as examining muscle and fat tissue.
