Sentenced: Police constable Sarah Greaves has been spared an immediate prison sentence for offering to supply cocaine

A policewoman who cheated on her husband with a drug dealer has been spared an immediate prison sentence for offering to supply cocaine.

Police constable Sarah Greaves began an affair with mephedrone supplier Adam Dickinson who was involved in a multi-million pound drug-trafficking ring, a court heard.

When he was arrested, police examined Dickinson’s mobile phone records and found hundreds of texts between himself and the female officer.

Greaves, 29, who had worked as an officer in South Yorkshire since 2003, was still living with her husband at the time she began seeing Dickinson.

Anthony Dunne, prosecuting, said hundreds of intimate texts found on Dickinson’s phone showed a 'familiarity with the use of cocaine' and efforts by the police officer to obtain cocaine from her boyfriend.

She even boasted how she had cheated on drug tests at work when Dickinson, 31, had to take a test for a new job, the court was told.

Mr Dunne said: 'It seems both defendants have experience of being able to cheat such drug tests.'

Greaves sent a text saying: 'I passed one just two days after I had some before' and later asked Dickinson if he had used another person's urine to pass the test, Mr Dunne added.

Another text showed how Dickinson could obtain cocaine at a reduce priced and Greaves replied: 'I appreciate the discount.'

She said in another message: 'Just tell me where to meet so I can jack up.'

When a deal was arranged she replied: 'Thank you, next time it won’t be a business transaction.'

Greaves later asked Dickinson to pick up 'two bags' for her and a friend, named only as Vix, telling him to get the friend '£100 of decent stuff'.

When Dickinson revealed he had got her some 'mint' stuff she replied: 'Wish I had ordered some for me now.'

Greaves later said she was feeling upset and sent Dickinson a message which read: 'I’m tempted to stick both those Gs (grammes) up my nose but I won’t.'

Both defendants were arrested in February, 2013 and Greaves told police she not believe Dickinson was dealing in drugs and her texts were an attempt to 'test' whether he could supply drugs. She claimed she had never arranged to sell drugs to anyone.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that Dickinson played a minor role supplying and receiving mephedrone, also known as Mcat or Meow Meow, in a major South Yorkshire-based drug gang whose members were jailed for a total of 121 years last year over a cocaine conspiracy.

Dickinson contacted members of the gang in September, 2011 and featured in their 'sophisticated' accounts as DJ - he was a disc jockey at the time - and was named as the source of some Mcat.

'He was a minor figure in the large group but we are still talking of kilos of Class B drugs and thousands of pounds,' said Mr Dunne.

Greaves admitted offering to supply cocaine between August 15, 2012 and February 6, 2013.

Dickinson, of Worksop, Nottinghamshire admitted the same charge and conspiracy to supply mephedrone. He has previous convictions for possessing small amounts of cocaine and amphetamines.

Hearing: Sheffield Crown Court was told hundreds of intimate texts found on Dickinson's phone showed a 'familiarity with the use of cocaine' and efforts by the police officer to obtain cocaine from her boyfriend

Greaves, from Doncaster, quit South Yorkshire Police on November 13 last year.

Kath Goddard, for Greaves, said: 'She finds her humiliation utterly complete.'

She had only discussed the supply of cocaine on three or four occasions with Dickinson out of 'four months worth of intimate texts.'

Tests after her arrest showed she was not a regular drug user 'however there was occasional exposure to cocaine.'

She had continued her work as a police officer until her suspension in June, 2013 and she appeared to have 'lost her sense of direction and sense of identity' during 'sensitive' work undertaken for South Yorkshire Police.

'Her actions are totally at odds with the values of South Yorkshire Police. She is now a criminal.'

South Yorkshire Police Detective Chief Constable Andy Holt

'She never used or abused her position as a police officer to commit these offences,' said Miss Goddard.

The court heard her marriage had broken down and she was suffering from issues dating back to her childhood. She had received counselling at work as her physical and mental health deteriorated.

'But she does not blame Dickinson in any way, shape or form for her offending,' said Miss Goddard.

'It may well be her relationship was symptomatic of the problems she faced and she was keeping repressed so she could continue with her job.'

Miss Goddard continued: 'The only thing that she wanted to do with her life was to become a police officer. It is her abiding shame she has now brought discredit to the organisation she was proud to represent.'

Nawaz Hussain, for Dickinson, said he was not a street dealer and it reflected 'social activity'.

He said: 'He got into a relationship and he was eager to impress her.'

Judge Paul Watson said Greaves was involved in trying to pass cocaine onto a third party but it was a 'lesser role' and she had not compromised her job as a police officer.

He said: 'I have read a number of testaments which say that you were an exemplary officer. One describes you as outstanding and a police inspector says you were one of the best officers he had.'

He gave her a 12-month jail term suspended for two years and ordered her to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

The judge said he was not imposing an immediate jail term and said: 'I may be criticised by some but I take the view that it is the right decision'.

Dickinson was jailed for a total of 18 months.

After the hearing, Detective Chief Constable Andy Holt said: 'Greaves was a former officer who betrayed the trust of the public and her hardworking colleagues.

'Her actions are totally at odds with the values of South Yorkshire Police. She is now a criminal.'
