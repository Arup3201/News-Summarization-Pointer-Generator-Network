Next time someone winks at you, they may not be flirting - instead they could be controlling a tiny PC fitted inside their ear that is tracking their facial movements.

The device, called Earclip-type Wearable PC, was built at Hiroshima University, weighs 17g, and is fitted with GPS, a compass, gyro-sensor, speaker and microphone.

It uses infrared sensors that monitor tiny movements inside the ear and can recognise every time a wearer's eyes and mouth move.

The device, called Earclip-type Wearable PC, was built at Hiroshima University, weighs 17g, and is fitted with GPS, compass, gyro-sensor, speaker and microphone.

It uses infrared sensors that monitor tiny movements inside the ear and can track every time a wearer's eyes and mouth move.

It can be connected to any Bluetooth-enabled device and can be programmed to register certain movements.

For
 example, a wearer could scroll through menus by winking, or open a 
programme by sticking out their tongue or clenching their teeth.

The clip was created by engineer Kazuhiro Taniguchi from the university, and its design was inspired simplicity by Ikebana Japanese flower arrangements, also known as kado or ‘way of flowers.’

The technology is reminiscent of the in-ear computer worn by Joaquin Phoenix in the 2013 film Her.

In the film, Phoenix's character Theodore Twombly falls in love with an operating system with a female voice

Taniguchi calls his device ‘a third hand’ that could be used by rockclimbers, hikers, cyclists and other athletes, as well as people with disabilities.

‘Supposing I climb a mountain, look at the sky at night and see a bright star up there, it could tell me what it is,’ Taniguchi told AFP.

‘As it knows what altitude I'm at, 
which direction I'm looking and at what angle, it could tell me, 'The 
bright star you are seeing now is Sirius.’”

An engineer from Japanese machinery maker NS West holds a prototype Earclip-type Wearable PC connected to a smartphone. The clip is fitted with a pulse meter and thermometer and future versions of the device could be used to monitor the wearer's health, for example

The clip is battery-powered and comes with
 built-in storage, meaning users can upload software, apps and files to 
their ear-worn chip.

It is also fitted with a pulse monitor and 
thermometer, which Taniguchi claims makes the device perfect for keeping an eye - or ear - on your health.

For example, future versions could be used as a hearing aid, could log changes in pulse and temperature, track how often the wearer eats by monitoring mouth movements, or even how often they sneeze.

This information could then be sent to a doctor or relative. Equally, the built-in accelerometer can tell if a person has fallen over.

If they don’t get back up within a certain time, Taniguchi’s device could be programmed to automatically alert a neighbour or relative, or call an ambulance. They would be able to locate the clip and wearer using GPS data. 

‘We have made this with the basic idea that people will wear it in the same way they wear earrings,’ continued Taniguchi.

Tests are currently being carried out in Hiroshima. Developers hope the device will be ready to go on sale to select people by Christmas 2015 and general sale from April 2016.
