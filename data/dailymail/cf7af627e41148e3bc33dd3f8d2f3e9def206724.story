Australian cricket captain has placed one of his Sydney pads back on the market after it failed to sell in August.

Michael Clarke has listed his waterfront Lilli Pilli property in the city's south with an asking price of $2.4 million, $470,000 below what he originally purchased for in 2006.

The move to sell comes after the Aussie skipper and his model wife Kyly bought a luxurious $8.5 million mansion in Vaucluse in the eastern suburbs in March this year.

Up for sale by McGrath Real Estate, the five bedroom, four bathroom pad on the banks of Gannon's Bay offers a vast open plan main living area with high vaulted ceiling and picturesque water views. 

Sitting on a sizeable 1,667 square metre of block, the idyllic hideaway has been completed with modern finishings and features large windows that bath the interiors with natural light.

It boasts an array of luxuries and creature comforts including a swimming pool and jet spa, personal gym, a boat shed and a number of terraces, including majestic river views to the national park.

In the past Clarke, 33, used the home as somewhat of a retreat to escape from the publicity attracted by his relationship with bikini model Lara Bingle, before their split in 2010.

Luxurious: A spacious kitchen complete with stone-top benches is elevated above a living and dining area

Spacious: One of the four bathrooms - the ensuite features a double basin and large bath tub

Open plan: The indoor space flows outside with french doors opening out onto a balcony that overlooks the bay

The luxury pad was the cricketer's first property investment and is one of a number that make up his burgeoning portfolio.

The middle order batsman also owns an apartment in Bondi valued at an estimated $6 million, and purchased a $3.5 million, 93 ha property in the Southern Highlands in 2012. 

He and his wife Kyly, 32, moved into their Vaucluse mansion in June after temporarily living in the Bondi apartment the sportsman once shared with former fiance Lara.

Clarke is currently recovering after suffering a hamstring injury last week but will get further treatment to improve his fitness in time to get back in shape ahead of the upcoming test series against India.

Stone's throw away: The hideaway is located right on the waterfront

Beautiful: It boasts picturesque views over the bay

First purchase: The luxury pad was the cricketer's first property investment and is one of a number that make up his portfolio
