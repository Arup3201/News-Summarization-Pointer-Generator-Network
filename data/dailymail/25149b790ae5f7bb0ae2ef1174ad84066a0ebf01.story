Five years ago I took part in a reality TV cooking show called Marco’s Kitchen Burnout involving several celebrities being judged on their culinary skills by chef Marco Pierre White.

It was already a stressful time for me. My 91-year-old father had been slowly dying for some time so I wasn’t particularly thrilled to be stuck in a kitchen with a celebrity chef known for being difficult. To top it all off, I’d just started my period.

Now, on any other day of the month, I’d say I’m quite a rational person. I don’t let things wind me up. But on one memorable day, Marco was being particularly ‘Marco’ and I was hacked off.

British No 1, Heather Watson (pictured), admitted recently that she had suffered the effects of her period during the Australian Open

At one point, as I stood by a row of sharp kitchen knives, I thought: ‘I’d better move away from these or who knows what I’m capable of,’ and I walked away.

Of course, I’d never do anything remotely violent. But that feeling of being powerless in the grip of my hormones is one that will be familiar to many women.

Certainly it’s something that tennis star Heather Watson recognises. Last week, the British No 1 admitted she’d been playing badly in the Australian Open because of ‘girl things’. During the match the 22-year-old had needed attention from a doctor and said afterwards she had felt light-headed and low on energy.

‘The last couple of days I felt fine. I think it’s just one of these things that I have, girl things. It just happens,’ she said. Cue a massive media storm.

For any woman to admit she even gets periods, let alone that they might affect her, remains taboo. I applaud her for being brave enough to say the unsayable.

It’s great that other sportswomen have pitched in, too. Even former world champion Martina Navratilova has admitted she suffered. ‘It sounds like an excuse but for women it is a reality,’ she told Radio 5 Live. ‘You don’t want to use it as an excuse, but it can affect some players in a big way. I never talked about it but it certainly was there.’

The fact is, women ARE affected by periods. There are more than 100 symptoms of pre-menstrual tension including stomach cramps, headaches, lethargy and bloating. Why shouldn’t we be honest about the reasons we feel below par?

At 53, I’m coming to the end of my monthly cycles, but I’m happy to admit there were some days when I could happily have stayed in bed because of cramps and irritability.

Thanks to the fluctuating hormones oestrogen and progesterone, some women find they are clumsy around their period and that was me.

Looking back, there were times when I shouldn’t have been allowed to drive — I’d often notice that I’d clip the pavement as I parked.

I’d be more prone to arguments. My husband Alex, 48, a restaurateur, and I have been married for 23 years and had only a handful of rows. But on my period, I could look at him and think: ‘You are so annoying!’ He’d often look at me with an expression that said: ‘Hmmm, are you on your period?’ I’d want to throttle him.

Yet I’m lucky Alex is so understanding about my ‘time of the month’. Growing up with sisters, he’s never been fazed by popping sanitary products in his shopping trolley. And our daughters Christie, 19, and Jodie, 15, think nothing of asking him to stock up on Tampax.

As a man, he’s in the minority. What struck me most about Heather Watson’s confession was the way her male interviewer handled it. Heather was simply stating the blindingly obvious. Yet you could feel him squirming with embarrassment.

When she mentioned ‘girl things’ he didn’t seem to have a clue what to say. Was he worried she was about to go into gory detail?

It’s astounding that we have programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother where Z-listers cheerfully talk about their sex lives in graphic detail but worry that the mention of periods will cause offence. I see this time and time again in my meetings for Diary Doll, the company I’ve set up with my friend, former tennis player Annabel Croft. We’re making feminine, pretty and waterproof ‘period pants’ to help minimise embarrassing ‘accidents’ when girls start menstruating.

During these meetings I’m always wary of saying anything too graphic.

Even so, most men start squirming in their seats and steer the conversation to facts and figures. Only a few — usually fathers of girls — feel relaxed enough to ask questions.

My husband didn’t realise the extent of the problem until he joined the company last year. One or two of his male friends refuse to discuss it — they’re just not comfortable with ‘women’s issues’.

But we can’t lay the entire blame on men. If we want men to change, we have to change, too. We have to start talking openly and frankly and, most of all, without embarrassment.

Martina Navratilova has admitted she also suffered. ‘It sounds like an excuse but for women it is a reality,’ she told Radio 5 Live. ‘You don’t want to use it as an excuse, but it can affect some players in a big way. I never talked about it but it certainly was there.’

Like many women of my generation I grew up thinking periods were shameful or dirty. I vividly remember, aged eight, visiting department store loos with my mother and innocently asking about the ‘special towels’ in the vending machine on the wall.

My mild-mannered mum marched me out and refused to discuss it.

Mercifully, I learnt the truth just before I started my periods at 12. But it was older schoolfriends enlightened me. Not Mum.

My girls were both 13 when they started their periods. I’d stocked up on products beforehand and told them where they were. I explained that if they just wanted to help themselves that was fine, but if they wanted to talk to me that was also fine. And I’ve always been frank with our 17-year-old son, Robbie. If one of his sisters was on her period and didn’t want to come swimming, I’d tell him why.

Yet many women still act as though periods are somehow shameful. It’s almost as though we have been conditioned to protect men from the nitty-gritty. I’ve seen women apologise to my husband in business meetings for going into too much detail.

Another problem is that we are still so determined to prove we are as good as the boys, we don’t want to admit any weakness.

I know businesswomen who feel obliged to sit through interminable meetings worried about having an accident because they feel they can’t ask for a loo break.

If we want our daughters to grow up in a world where periods are seen as normal, not shameful and embarrassing, then we need to talk openly.

I’m not suggesting we go overboard — like the obstetrician who suggested we give women ‘menstrual leave’.

Although I empathise with women who suffer so badly they pass out, most of us are not ill when having our period. We’re just not at the top of our game.

And like Heather Watson, we need to be more honest about it. Period.
