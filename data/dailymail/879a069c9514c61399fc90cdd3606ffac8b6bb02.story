It was a kiss described as 'chewy' by talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, but Ryan and Shanna assure viewers they have been practicing their lip-locking skills since their first and nauseatingly sloppy attempt.

The Christian couple's first-ever smooch was captured on the TLC series, Virgin Diaries, last year after they vowed not to have sex, or even kiss, before their wedding day.

Now in the show's second installment, premiering Wednesday July 18, Ryan and Shanna return to reveal how they feel about that famous first kiss, admitting they have definitely 'been practicing'.

First kiss: The Christian couple's first-ever smooch was captured on the TLC series, Virgin Diaries, last year after they vowed not to have sex, or even kiss, before their wedding day

In a sneak peek of tonight's episode, Ryan discusses that awkward first kiss.

He says: 'I had never kissed a girl before I married Shanna and you know I wasn't really planning ahead, or thinking about what to do.'

Shanna echoed his thoughts, revealing: 'It was kinda hard for me because I hadn't really kissed anybody, so I didn't really know what I was doing. So when I went to first kiss him, I just went full force because I was, like, excited.'

In the new episodes, Ryan and Shanna join two other virgins who struggle with their circumstances.

TLC executive Timothy Kuryak explained: 'Losing one’s virginity is a big life decision. It seemed like one of 
those seminal life moments that’s interesting to follow for TLC.

'A lot of stories about later in life 
virgins talk about it like a problem. We want to show that this is 
something that can be celebrated.'

The new show also follows Skippy, a 34-year-old virgin who lives in his parents' basement and takes his mother with him when he goes to pick up girls at bars.

Although those reasons alone would 
present plenty of explanation for his temporary celibacy, the Utah 
native is in fact waiting to lose his virginity until he meets the girl 
he wants to marry.

Which is why the horny Mormon is hoping, with the help of his 'wing mom', to find that girl soon.

Printing gimmicky t-shirts with slogans about his lack of experience is just one of his tactics.

While he wears tops that read 'Nice 
Guy' and 'Make the World a Better Place...Put a Kiss on Skippy's Face' 
his ageing mother sports her 'Wing-Mom' tee as they prowl local dances 
for girls that look suitable.

And
though he seems to be able to entertain his female contemporaries with 
his cheeky, confident persona, none of them are keen to go much further 
than a peck on the lips.

Lindsey,
a 32-year-old from California and somewhat less eccentric character, is
far closer to the prospect of having sex than Skippy.

Firmly
believing in God's will that she wait until she is married, the petite 
brunette says her sexual desire is positively boiling over.

Her boyfriend, Jon, while remaining patient, is also dying to consummate their relationship but knows that for such a thing to happen, he needs to put a ring on Lindsey's finger.

'It is really hard for me to remain a
virgin, almost at all times,' she sighs. 'I am so aroused. He doesn't 
even need to be around and I'm thinking about him and wanting to have 
sex with him.'

With her
33rd birthday on the horizon Lindsey is hoping that Jon might pop the 
question and solve the issue but Jon has been married once before and 
having lost his wife to cancer, feels pressured by the momentous 
decision.

Virgin Diaries returns to TLC on July 18 and airs at 10pm EST.
