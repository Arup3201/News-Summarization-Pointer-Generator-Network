Aaron Hill admitted uploading explicit pictures of his former girlfriend, received while he was in jail

A man posted explicit photographs of his former girlfriend, which she had sent to him while he was in prison, after their relationship came to an end.  

Aaron Hill, of Hall Green, Birmingham, uploaded revenge porn of his former partner on Facebook - tagging her and several friends in naked pictures -  after their three-and-a-half year relationship came to an end in April last year.

Hill  received the pictures  from his former partner when he was in prison last year for being part of a group that attacked a shopkeeper with pepper spray, while wearing a babygrow over his face, in a bungled robbery.

The 26-year-old was jailed for two years and eight months for the robbery and was released from prison in September. 

At a hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to uploading the naked pictures and avoided being returned to prison. 

The court heard that Hill's actions left his former partner feeling 'humiliated and violated'.

Warren Stanier, prosecuting, said Hill had first posted an explicit video on Facebook showing his former partner. It was removed after she reported it to the police.

But six days later he placed indecent pictures of her on the site with 16 of her friends 'tagged' in the images.

Mr Stanier said on August 8 Hill's former partner received a number of messages from friends telling her to look on her account. 

He said: 'She logged on to her Facebook account using her usual username and saw posted on her wall were six images of her posing naked.

'She recognised those images as images she sent to Mr Hill whilst he was in prison.'

Mr Stainer added: 'She feels both humiliated and violated by this intrusion into her privacy.

'She states that the photographs were taken when they were in a loving relationship and she was appalled they were published for her friends and strangers to see.

'She also comments that she was very upset and embarrassed by what these images display.'

At an earlier hearing magistrates gave Hill credit for his early guilty plea to sending an electronic communication of a shocking and grossly offensive nature.

They sentenced him to a 12-month community order with 200 hours' unpaid work. Hill was also ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge and £180 costs.

Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard that Hill had pleaded guilty to posting the explicit pictures and video

In October 2012 Hill was jailed for robbery after he was part of a gang of three who burst into a store, with their faces covered, and attacked shopkeeper Festus Williams. Mr Williams was sprayed with what appeared to be pepper spray. His wife managed to pull the babygrow off Hill's face and was then struck. 

Hill was tracked down by DNA he had left on the babygrow and the court heard he had a £1,000 drug debt due to a cocaine and cannabis addiction.

In defence the court was told that Hill had only been recruited to grab cigarettes from the store.  

He was released on licence from prison on September 23 last year and has found work.
