Romain Grosjean will continue driving for Lotus in Formula One next year, the team confirmed on Wednesday.

The 28-year-old Frenchman has been with Lotus since 2011. His best season was last year, when he secured four podium finishes in the last six races of the campaign.

This season has proved very difficult. Grosjean has a best finish of eighth place, and has retired from six races.
