When Boston bombing survivor Rebekah DiMartino awoke this morning to see part of her left leg had been amputated, she was ecstatic.

'There is not an ounce of sadness anywhere in my heart,' the 27-year-old wrote on Facebook. 'What has been anticipated and stressed about since April 2013 is over and I am moving on to the next chapter.'

The married mother-of-one had the lower part of her left leg amputated at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital near Houston, Texas on Monday after doctors struggled to save it for 18 months.

After the successful operation, she shared a selfie of her grinning beside her son Noah, seven.

On Tuesday, she shared her excitement with her supporters on her Facebook page.

'Last night I didn't sleep a wink but it wasn't because of nerves,' she wrote. 'Instead it was from the excitement of thinking about all the goals I have for myself going forward.

'Life has never promised to be easy but guess what? That's ok. Because when we find that silver lining in the toughest of places, it always seems to be worth it.

'And sometimes that may mean making tough decisions to get rid of what is holding us back. But I'm here to tell you that when that happens...the possibilities are endless.'

She was also upbeat before the surgery, hosting a 'left leg last supper' on Sunday and bidding the troublesome limb a farewell with a lengthy farewell message.   

DiMartino was with her son  and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring  270.

All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg.

In a bid to save the limb, she underwent 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, but she also suffered a serious bone infection.

Although she has been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. 

Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'.

'The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,' DiMartino told NBC. 'If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here.'

She said her seven-year-old son has long been upset about her potentially losing her leg, but last week, after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed.

'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted 'that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!'' she wrote on her Facebook page.

Her doctors say they are hopeful that she could be taking her first steps in three months.

'I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,' Dr. Bill McGarvey said. 'If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful.'

Rebekah is now hoping to compete in next year's Boston Marathon and to complete a triathlon, she told NBC.

'I've never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons,' she said. 'I still have a lot of living left to do.'

She is also now starting to do motivational speaking and has moved to Richmond, Texas with her son and new husband. 

'Monday is the day that my new life begins,' she wrote. 'And I am SO excited to see what it holds.'
