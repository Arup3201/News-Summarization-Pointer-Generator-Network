A frantic search is underway for a mother and her two young daughters who have not been seen in more than five days ago.

Aneta Marsek, 33, was last seen leaving her parents' home in Wauconda, in Lake County Illinois, with daughters Chevelle, 2, and Macenzie, four months, at around 7pm Saturday night.

She was reported missing by her estranged husband Dan Marsek. Family members have been trying to call Aneta's cell phone for days but there has been no response.

Yesterday police cordoned off the family home in the nearby village of Volo. A CSI van was parked in the driveway and investigators were seen moving in and out of the house with equipment.

Family friend Kelly Lizzo told Chicago's WGNTV: 'We're worried about her. We're worried about the kids. 

'We don't know what happened. We don't know where she is, and of course, not knowing, anything and everything is going through your head.'
