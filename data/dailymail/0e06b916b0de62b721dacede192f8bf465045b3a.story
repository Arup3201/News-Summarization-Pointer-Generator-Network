Pay row: Lady Stowell arrives at Downing Street in London yesterday

David Cameron was last night accused of a ‘constitutional outrage’ after he demoted the woman chosen to be new leader of the House of Lords.

The upper house was united in anger after it emerged Baroness Stowell would not be a full member of the Cabinet – unlike her predecessor.

The appointment was already controversial after it emerged she would be paid £22,000 less than Lord Hill of Oareford, who is moving on to be the UK’s next EU commissioner.

Downing Street officials were left red-faced when it was revealed she would receive less for doing the same job as a man in a reshuffle supposed to promote women.

They hurriedly announced her pay would be topped up by the Conservative Party.

But this too has provoked outrage in the upper house. Yesterday Lords demanded to know how she could represent the whole house – as her role demands – when she is part paid by a political party.

They pointed to House of Lords standing orders – the rules of the chamber – which demand the leader of the house should be a full member of the Cabinet.

The new arrangement will see her attend meetings but not have Cabinet status,  breaking, it was claimed, a precedent dating back 112 years.

Yesterday Labour referred the appointment to a powerful constitutional committee and it was condemned by peers from all parties amid near riotous scenes in the Lords.

Mr Cameron defended the arrangement at Prime Ministers’s Questions, saying: ‘I’m happy to confirm that she will do the same job as her predecessor, will sit in the same place around the table as her predecessor, and will receive the same money.’

Labour leader in the Lords Baroness Royall said Lady Stowell’s lack of full Cabinet status showed contempt for the house. She described the salary top-up as ‘improper and unethical’.

Are rejects Fox and Paterson cooking up trouble for PM?

She added: ‘When I heard about this yesterday, I simply did not believe it could be true, but when it was then confirmed later in the day, I was deeply dismayed that the Prime Minister could treat this house with such contempt.’

Former Labour attorney general Baroness Scotland called on Mr Cameron to reconsider.

She told Lady Stowell: ‘Will you convey to him in the strongest possible way that it is this house’s view that he has committed what amounts to a constitutional outrage that this house does not accept.’

The debate was prompted by an urgent question from former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth, who said it was vital the leader of the Lords was a full member of the Cabinet.

He said: ‘What sort of signal does that send to the civil service and others about the authority of this place in its important duty in revising legislation?’

On Tuesday, Downing Street confirmed that Lady Stowell would be paid the Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with £101,038 for her predecessor.

The fall was due to a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts and the reshuffle meant there were not enough seats to go around.
