BBC broadcaster Evan Davis has sparked a debate on Twitter after appealing to his 124,000 followers to help find a job for a Latvian man he met at a barbecue. 

The Radio 4 Today presenter posted a photo of the man this morning with the words 'Can anyone give this lovely guy I met at a bbq yesterday a job? Hospitality perhaps? Or he has to return to Latvia.' 

But the post has resulted in people taking to Twitter to discuss whether the broadcaster should be using his position as a high-profile broadcaster to help someone into employment.

Broadcaster Evan Davis has called on his Twitter followers to help find this man a job

One Twitter user called SGA wrote: 'Why not get him a job in radio?' 

While another called Melindi Scott said: 'Why hospitality perhaps? Did you not investigate his entire skill set?'

However, others have praised the broadcaster's act of kindness. Davie Kelly wrote: 'No-one will trump the small act of kindness behind the initial tweet.' 

Davis was also one of a number of journalists involved in a BBC1 Panaroma special called Breaking into Britain

While another Twitter user called Josh said: 'dude, foreign workers have a better work attitude than most British people!'

Davis also presents Dragons Den and the business conversation programme the Bottom Line. 

In
2011 he presented Made in Britain, a three-part BBC2 series with an 
accompanying book on how the country pays its way in the world. 

Davis
was also one of a number of journalists involved in a BBC1 Panaroma 
special called Breaking into Britain, an account of the journeys 
migrants take to get into Europe and the UK.

For the six and a half years prior to working on the Today programme he was the Economics Editor for the BBC.

A BBC spokesman said: 'As Evan is tweeting from a person account we would not comment on this.'
