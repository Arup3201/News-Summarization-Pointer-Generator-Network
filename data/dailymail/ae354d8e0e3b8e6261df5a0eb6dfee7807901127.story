Their brother hit the headlines in the wrong way, spending four months in prison for his part in a student riot.

But it seems the other children of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour are ready to make their names by a far gentler route – ITV’s costume drama Downton Abbey.

Gilmour’s son Gabriel, 16, and daughter Romany, 11, have been cast as extras in the fourth series of the ratings hit. The pair, dressed in 1920s costume, were spotted filming alongside the rest of the cast in Bampton, Oxfordshire, watched by Gilmour, 67, and their mother, Polly Samson.

In one scene Gabriel, who bears a striking resemblance to his disgraced older brother Charlie, wheeled a bicycle while Romany chased after him.

Charlie, now 22 and a Cambridge graduate, was jailed after he was pictured swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph in London during the violent 2010 anti-tuition fees protest.

While Downton’s fourth series is still being filmed, one of its stars has revealed that there will be more. Michelle Dockery, who plays Lady Mary Crawley, told reporters in Hollywood that many of the cast have already signed up for a fifth series.

‘As far as we know, we’re all doing season five next year. Beyond that, we really don’t know,’ she said.

Downton’s executive producer Gareth Neame added: ‘I think the show has got a lot further to go. If people around the world love the show, we want to make it.’

Miss Dockery and co-stars Laura Carmichael (Lady Edith Crawley), Joanne Froggatt (Mrs Bates) and Sophie McShera (Daisy Mason) were in the US to promote the show as they are not currently needed for filming the new series, to be broadcast on ITV in the autumn.
