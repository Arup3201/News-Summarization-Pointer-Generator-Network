Dominic Grieve says clashes over EU Human Rights led to his downfall

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve yesterday claimed his sacking was ‘driven by Ukip’, as the backlash over David Cameron’s brutal reshuffle grew.

The Prime Minister sacked 15 ministers last week in the biggest Cabinet clear-out for years.

Although some were handed knighthoods to go quietly, others yesterday indicated they will make trouble for Mr Cameron on the backbenches.

Signs were emerging of a Right-wing axis involving sacked Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, who rejected an offer of a junior post.

Employment Minister Esther McVey is also reported to have had a  stand-off with Mr Cameron after he initially offered her a job that lacked Cabinet status.

Mr Grieve served as Britain’s top law officer for four years before his sacking. He infuriated Tory High Command by repeatedly warning of the danger of withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mr Cameron is keen to put the pledge in the next manifesto in a bid to persuade voters who have defected to Ukip that he is serious about standing up to Europe over controversial human rights rulings, such as the demand that prisoners be given the right to vote.

Mr Grieve yesterday told Sky News it was ‘certainly possible’ this was why he had been sacked. But he said this would not remove the legal and diplomatic problems associated with pulling out of the Strasbourg court – and suggested the Tories’ proposed pledge may be unachievable.

Mr Grieve, who said he was ‘actually a Eurosceptic’, said he disagreed with some of the Strasbourg Court’s judgments.

But he warned that withdrawing would cause ‘reputational damage’ – and could leave Britain open to legal challenge from the EU. Mr Paterson was among the Cabinet casualties despite attempts by senior Right-wingers and the National Farmers’ Union to keep him in post.

Yesterday he published a stinging attack on the green lobby – dubbed the ‘Green Blob’ – who called for his removal because of his scepticism about the impact of climate change.

He is reported to have had a 20-minute row with Mr Cameron, in which he warned his sacking would alienate traditional Tory voters and be a ‘smash in the teeth’ for 12million people in the countryside.

Mr Paterson is said to have asked him: ‘Do you actually want to win the election?’ He is now expected to lead a Eurosceptic alliance with Dr Fox that will harry the Prime Minister over Europe.

Sources had suggested Dr Fox was due to make a dramatic return to Cabinet three years after he quit because of links to an unofficial adviser. Mr Cameron offered him the number three job at the Foreign Office.

Although this came with a seat at the National Security Council, Dr Fox rejected it as an insult. He is said to have told the Prime Minister: ‘You must be bloody joking. I assume the ambassadorship to the moon is taken?’

Miss McVey was also tipped for promotion to the Cabinet. But in the end she remained as Employment Minister, albeit with permission to attend the Cabinet.

She is said to have rejected an initial job offer and refused to leave Number 10 until she got the Cabinet concession, but a Government source last night dismissed reports she had clashed with Mr Cameron as ‘absolute rubbish’.
