A schoolboy who says he was so overweight and unfit he looked 'like a tomato' after  PE lessons decided to put himself on a diet - and shed almost three stone.

Owen Clarke, 12, weighed 10st 8lb (67kg) last summer and says he was embarrassed by his size, and because he got so red and sweaty after exercise. 

He begged his mother to let him join her on a diet so he was fit enough to play football with his friends.

And after swapping chocolate bars for low-fat yogurts, the 5'4" schoolboy is now a healthy 8st (50kg).

Owen lost weight by giving up biscuits, chocolate bars and sausage rolls and instead snacking on yogurts, homemade scotch eggs, cucumber and carrot sticks

His efforts inspired his mother, Michelle Hatfield, to re-evaluate the food she was feeding her family, as she didn't realise her son was overweight in the first place.

The 33-year-old has now swapped  convenience foods ans takeaways for meals made from scratch, crediting the change on her son's desire to be healthier.

Owen, from Leicester, said: 'I was a bit lazy before losing weight and didn't enjoy sport that much.

BEFORE

Breakfast: One large bowl of coco pops

Lunch: Two sandwiches with cheese, one full fat yogurt, one bag of crisps, one chocolate bar.

Dinner: Pizza, chips and full-fat barbecue sauce.

Snacks: Biscuits, chocolate bars and sausage rolls.

AFTER 

Breakfast: 38g of puffed wheat with sweetener.

Lunch: Two wholemeal bread ham sandwiches, one packet of crisps, an apple

Dinner: Homemade spaghetti bolognese.

Snacks: Muller yogurts, homemade scotch eggs, cucumber and carrot sticks. 

'I remember hating it because I'd get really tired and I'd look like a tomato after PE but that's all changed now.

'Nobody really said anything bad to me about my weight but I couldn't play football with all my friends and I wanted to change.

'Now I absolutely love football and I play for at least an hour every day.

'I never used to enjoy PE and felt a bit left out but now that's all changed.

'I feel like I can compete and enjoy myself without getting embarrassed.' 

When he started losing weight in January 2014, Owen was 5"1 tall.

His weight meant he was technically classed as obese, as he had Body Mass Index (BMI) in the 99th centile of the BMI chart.

After losing more than two stone in five months, he now has a healthy BMI.

Owen's efforts made Ms Hatfield realise it was the food she fed him that made him pile on the pounds.

She said: 'It all started when I decided I wanted to lose some weight on a slimming world plan and went home to tell the family that I was going to change my diet.

'It didn't take long for Owen to ask if he could join me.

'We always ate convenience food because it's so much cheaper. I'd been brought up that way and I've never known anything different.

'One afternoon, Owen came over to me and asked if he could change his diet too.' 

Before he lost weight, Owen's BMI meant he was obese. After losing weight (pictured left and right), he has a BMI in the healthy range

Owen swapped chocolate and sausage rolls for low fat yoghurts and cucumber and carrot sticks. He is now able to play football with his friends, and plays for up to an hour a day

Ms Hatfield, who dropped from 13st 8lbs (86kg) to 11st 1lbs (70kg) at the same time as Owen said she never saw her son as being overweight.

She said: 'When he first asked me if he could do it too, it made me feel awful.

'I'd never looked at him and thought he was fat or overweight. He's my son and you just don't look at your children like that.

'I'd obviously noticed but until he came to ask me that, I'd always dismissed his weight as nothing more than puppy fat.

'It took me a while to get my head around it because I couldn't get over the fact that it was my fault.

'I'm his mother and it's always been my responsibility to feed him.

Ms Hatfield said: 'Owen made me realise how irresponsible I'd been with the food I was buying'

'That moment when he asked if he could join me at Slimming World finally made me realise how irresponsible I'd been with the food I was buying in.

'I'm really proud of Owen because he did this all on his own back and it's inspired me to think differently about the food I put on the table.

'He wasn't pushed to lose weight at any stage, he's just got his head down and done it.

'Even though I was initially pretty ashamed of myself, I couldn't be any more proud of Owen.

'His transformation has been amazing and I feel like a better mother too.

'He's been so determined from the very start and he's had the discipline to maintain the weight loss.

'Now when I take him to the supermarket, he's out looking for Muller Light rather than chocolate trifles!'

Owen added: 'My attitude towards food has completely changed too. I've actually started to see the grease on takeaways and it puts me off.

'I'm really proud of how much weight I've lost and my friends at school have noticed too.

'My friends have all said congratulations and are really impressed with how much I've managed to lose.'

Owen's dad, Lee Clarke, has also noticed his son's remarkable transformation when he cares for him at weekends.

Mr Clarke, who works at Dunelm Mill, said: 'It really is amazing. I'm so proud of him.

'It's done wonders for his confidence and it's just great to see.'  

One in five children now leaves primary school obese, official figures show 

More than three quarters of parents refuse to admit their child is overweight, as official figures show one in five  children now leaves primary school obese.

Researchers at Imperial College London found 77 per cent of parents claimed their overweight child was ‘normal’.

Among those who did accept their child was too fat, many claimed it was just ‘puppy fat’ or their genes.

Others said their child was just ‘solid’ or that they had a ‘big build’. 

The study came as official figures found the number of obese 11-year-olds has increased since previous years. 

Experts warned that lifestyle habits are ingrained by the time a child is 11.

Mr Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, warned: 'Those 11-year-olds are probably going to end up as obese adults.’

Other experts say the problem of childhood obesity is compounded by the fact parents often don’t realise, or refuse to admit, that their child is fat.
