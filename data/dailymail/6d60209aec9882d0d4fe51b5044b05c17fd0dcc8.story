At least eight tornadoes touched down in Colorado yesterday afternoon, including one that dropped down near a junior golf tournament injuring one person.

A tornado touched down near the Blackstone Country Club, southeast of Denver, causing one minor injury after high winds blew a golf cart on top of a caddy walking nearby.

Paul Cleveland, 16, who was playing in the tournament, said he and two other people were riding a golf cart when they saw a funnel cloud heading in their direction, swirling debris.

'I ducked down, protected my head and waited for the worst,' he said.

Moments later, Cleveland said, the twister lifted the cart and threw it on top of a caddy walking nearby.

The caddy, a man in his 50s, was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, said Capt. Diane Lord with the Aurora Fire Department.

The strong winds also flipped over an empty trailer, with no other injuries reported.

Six of the tornadoes struck in northeast Colorado, while two others hit in Park County in the center of the state, the National Weather Service said on its website. At least three of them caused damage.

The severe weather was moving toward central Nebraska and western Kansas overnight before heading into Arkansas and Missouri, Weather Service meteorologist Frank Cooper said.

In Colorado, a funnel cloud touched down near Fairplay about 65 miles southwest of Denver at about 11 a.m., damaging the roof of a home, Park County spokeswoman Linda Balough said.

'This is amazingly unusual at 10,000 feet, very unusual for it to happen up here,' she said.

A tornado was also spotted near Fairplay, Park County (pictured). A spokeswoman for the county said it was 'amazingly unusual' for twisters to form at that altitude

Another tornado was reported a short time later, about 40 miles away near Lake George, and caused 'substantial' damage at an RV park, Balough said, although nobody was injured.

Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin said a trough of low pressure created a 'large extensive line' of severe weather along the Front Range from southern Colorado to the Wyoming border.

A twister also touched down in a sparsely
 populated area of southeast Wyoming, but there were no immediate 
reports of injuries or major damage.

A tornado watch for all of eastern Colorado extends to 8 p.m. Sunday as the band of severe weather heads to the Plains states.

The storm will hover over eastern Colorado on Monday, bringing heavy rain in Burlington, before a fine night on Monday and a dry morning for most of the state on Tuesday.

There will be scattered showers throughout Tuesday afternoon which will give way to widespread rain on Wednesday, with the possibility of snow showers in some central areas.

The most damaging storm ever to hit 
Colorado came in July 1990 as hail and strong winds caused more than 
$1billion (Â£60million) worth of damage, according to the Rocky Mountain 
Insurance Information Association.

That storm only featured two weak tornadoes, with most of the damage being caused by golf ball sized hailstones battering homes and cars.

The costliest bad weather season came five years ago when more hail and wind caused $1.4billion worth of damage across the state.

Colorado's hail season runs from mid-April to mid-August. The state is home to 'Hail Alley,' which receives the highest frequency of large hail in North America and most of the world

Monday evening will be clear after earlier showers in the east as the storm passes out of the state

Tuesday will be largely clear until about 5pm when there will be light showers across central areas

Wednesday will be clear in the morning, but by early afternoon rain will arrive for most of the state, though there are no signs of the storms returning
