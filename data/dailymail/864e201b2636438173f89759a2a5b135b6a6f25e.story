A former racial equality chief who was once invited to Downing Street by Tony Blair has been found guilty of stealing the identity of a severely autistic man 20 years ago.

During the deceit David Onamade, 52, was made chief executive of Somerset's Racial Equality Council, meeting MPs, chief constables and even meeting with the then Prime Minister. 

Onamade, who also claimed to be a prominent humans rights lawyer and poet, was only rumbled when the Racial Equalities Committee was disbanded, and he tried to apply for benefits.

Authorities soon discovered that the national insurance number used on his application was the same as that of an autistic man living in London.

Taunton Crown Court, in Somerset, heard Onamade's deception began in 1991 when he acquired the birth certificate of the real David Onamade.

It is not known how he came across the certificate, only that it was bought in Nigeria, it was said. 

Despite maintaining he was the 'real' man, Onamade was found guilty of five counts of fraud.

The jury convicted him of three charges of fraudulently trying to claim benefits, and two of possessing documents - a birth certificate and a driving licence - for use in the fraud.

Sentencing him to nine months behind bars, Judge Jeffrey Mercer said his status in the UK was 'uncertain'.

He said: 'You have used copies of the birth certificate belonging to another person.

'Your future in this country has to be uncertain but that is not a matter for this court. Your status here is not part of my remit.'

He was handed nine months behind bars for his crimes, but because he had served 13 on remand, was allowed to walk free from court.

The severely autistic man lives in London where he is looked after by his mother.

During the week-long trial, Helen Everett, the mother of Onamade's children, told the court the pair had met in a Bristol nightclub in the early 1990s.

There he introduced himself as Steven Douglas.

When he moved in with her in 1992 Helen found a birth certificate in a different name - David Onamade.

She told the court he said this was his family name, which he never used because his father tried to control him and he wanted to live independently.

The pair lived together in the West Country for 10 years before they split.

In 2003 Onamade was made chief executive of Somerset Racial Equality Council.

He held the privileged position until the group was disbanded in 2012.

It was then that Onamade, from Wells, Somerset, attempted to claim Jobseeker's Allowance, sparking an investigation by authorities.

After his arrest, on October 17 last year, Onamade told police his parents, both Nigerian, had given birth to him in London on December 12 1961.

He said he grew up in Greenwich before moving to Nigeria with his parents between the ages of 3 and 8.

He told the investigator: 'I am not very clear about dates - my memory is not the best.'

He could not say where he went to school but said he had two degrees - a masters in literature and a second degree in creative writing - and that he trained to be a lawyer but did not complete his internship.

When he returned to Britain with his parents they 'moved on' to the USA or Nigeria, but he said, he did not go with them and ran away from home.

Around the age of 18 he began using the name Stephen Douglas.

But the court heard Onamade firmly believed he was the real man, it was said, and refused to acknowledge anything different.

'I never thought it was anyone else, other than me. It's my birth certificate and my driving licence - I am David Onamade.'

He denied withholding any information, as that could be checked.

He also denied being given or buying an identity in Nigeria or England and that he had been living a lie.

He told the court: 'It would be easier for me to put my hand up, but that would not be telling the truth.'

The court heard other people in Nigeria are also believed to be using the identity, with one or two applying for passports.

Patrick Mason, defending, said: 'There may be six David Onamades we know of.

'In many respects he's done nothing wrong. He absolutely, 100 per cent believed he was the person he said he was.'
