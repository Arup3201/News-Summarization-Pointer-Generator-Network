Over 4,000 Manchester United fans were left celebrating after a computer glitch meant they got the new strip at less than half price on the club website.

This season's shirt, which features the name of the club's new strip sponsor, Chevrolet, went on sale earlier this summer priced £55.

But a website error meant the shirt appeared for sale for just £22 and an entire kit, which should have been £92, came to just £37.

Error: Manchester United's new home shirts were accidentally sold at half price this week

The Sun reported today that around 4,000 fans snapped up the replica shirts, shorts and socks - costing the club an estimated £200,000 in lost revenue.

Many fans who had visited the website intending to buy the shirt at its full price went on Twitter to tell of their glee after saving more than £20.

Ricky Sidhu wrote: 'Buzzing if the Man U store honours the glitch yday, would mean I got the united away kit for £32'

US fan Kevin 'The FutHub' added: 'Man U messed up the pricing on their website I just bought a $90 kit for $43'

And another supporter, Muhammad Rabi, boasted: 'Just got the new Man U home kit for 1/2 price!'

Outing: Ander Herrera shows off the new shirt in United's 7-0 win over LA Galaxy

It came as the team showed off the new red and white home strip in a 7-0 demolition of American side LA Galaxy in Louis Van Gaal's first game in charge.

In a show of good will to its supporters, the club confirmed in a statement that it would be honouring the accidentally cut-price shirt sales.

It stated: 'United Direct, the club's official online megastore, which is run by our e-commerce partner Kitbag, sent out communications which contained details of an erroneous discount code to our fans around the globe - this offer has now ended.

'United Direct will honour all consumer orders placed using this discount code, an approach which is fully endorsed by the club.'
