Their tour has been dogged by rumors of marital discord.

But Beyoncé, 32, and Jay Z, 44, plan to go ahead with their very final dates in Paris, which will be recorded for an HBO special next month, the network has today confirmed.

Their relationship is said to be in so much trouble that bigwigs from HBO, concert promoters Live Nation and lawyers were called into a crisis meeting on Thursday - prompting fears the billion-dollar couple could pull out of their dates in the City of Love on September 12 and 13.

However, a spokesman for HBO confirmed to MailOnline the network will shoot the dates in France and air the concert on September 20.

Happy families? Beyonce and Jay-Z took to the stage in Los Angeles on Sunday night amid claims their marriage is breaking down

Turning her back on it? It's been claimed the power couple are staying in different hotels for the duration of their On The Run joint tour

The tour is set to net the power couple up to $120million - and they will take to the stage for their final US date at San Francisco's AT&T Park.

But as Page Six reported, there was scepticism about whether Beyoncé and 
Jay-Z would come through with their last few performances. A source told Page Six: 'This may not make it to San Francisco. I’m definitely not sure that they’ll make it to Paris.’

And it was reported that Beyoncé, Jay-Z, concert promoter Live Nation, HBO, and at 
least four lawyers convened in an emergency meeting on Thursday to 
address the crumbling marriage.

Execs
 allegedly wished to release a statement, which Beyoncé and Jay-Z are 
said to have opposed, disagreeing upon what it should say.

‘There
 are lawyers that have now joined the tour, and they’re not here just to
 see them perform. They are here to help hash things out,’ the source 
said.

Live
 Nation CEO Michael Rapino and HBO chief Richard Plepler reportedly called for the 
meeting before ‘this becomes a public-relations nightmare,’ the insider 
added.

‘Rapino is pissed that everything is so out in the open and things are so heated.’

Alongside this, the Page Six source revealed the couple are staying in separate hotels and arrive separately to each show.

On Sunday night, stars ranging from David and Victoria Beckham - and their teenage son Brookyn - to Salma Hayek, Jessica Alba and Natalie Portman turned out to see them perform.

Meanwhile, Beyoncé got some support from her mother Tina Knowles, who was in the starry crowd at the Rose Bowl in California on Saturday night.

Bad news: Beyoncé, 32, and Jay-Z, 44 - pictured performing in Texas on July 22 - are staying in separate hotels and arriving separately to each show while on their On The Run world tour, according to a source

It's not the first time the 60-year-old has been in the crowd at the On The Run tour, she attended the joint show in New Orleans, Louisiana, last month with boyfriend Richard Lawson.

Tina previously conceded it was time to 'let go' of Beyonce and their family traditions when she began creating memories of her own with Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy.

She said: 'It's going to be different, but it'll be good. They're getting their own tradition - so we have to let go.'

Following their final US date tomorrow night, sources told MailOnline the rapper is desperate to save his marriage 
and plans to whisk his superstar wife away on a five-week 'make or 
break' vacation before Paris.

The
 source said: 'He adores his daughter Blue Ivy and he wants a sibling 
for her, but Beyoncé isn't sure what she wants to do - their marriage is
 in flux, that's the truth. Jay just wants them to spend some time alone
 together to try and work it out.

'And it's not just throwing away a marriage - it's throwing away a brand. But it may be that Bey has just had enough. She has some trust issues with Jay.'

Beyoncé has most definitely, however, been concentrating on work - and has been posting video clips on her Instagram account to promote the HBO special, which will surely net the cople a further fortune.

It is not clear just how long the cameras may in fact have been rolling as one video clip proclaims: '10 Weeks, 10 songs, 10 exclusive videos.'

Beyoncé has also been busy keeping up appearances - posting an image of her 
husband snuggling her on stage in Seattle on Wednesday.

On
 Tuesday, the Crazy In Love hitmaker shared a photo of Jay-Z and their 
two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, with the caption, 'My favorite hue is 
JayZ Blue.'

Meanwhile, Beyoncé dropped the remixed version of her song Flawless, featuring Nicki Minaj, on Saturday night - making reference to her younger sister Solange's now infamous elevator attack on Jay Z following the Met Ball in May.

And
 it is the warbler rather than the rapper who lands the most telling 
verbal blow of the tune, singing in the first verse: 'Of course 
sometimes s*** go down when it's a billion dollars on the elevator.'
