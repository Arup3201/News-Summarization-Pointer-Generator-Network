A Latvian model plunged to her death from a hotel apartment after her ex-boyfriend told her family she was working as an escort girl, an inquest heard. 

Laura Pahomova, 23, sent a final text to her father, who believed she was studying at university, saying: 'You deserve a better daughter' before climbing over a balcony at the Light Boutique Aparthotel in Manchester city centre. 

Her family back home had been told of her activities by a one-time client and on-off ex-boyfriend, Martin Riley, Manchester Coroner's Court heard.

Inside the apartment where she had been staying she had written on mirrors, walls and furniture in lipstick and ink, blaming Mr Riley and apologising to her family, the inquest heard.

She had also sent a series of heartbreaking text messages to each member of her family which read: 'Please forgive me, I love you very much... I lost my mind.

'At the moment you can't do anything, I made too many mistakes but you are going to be OK I promise you. 

'I was afraid but I'm not anymore. It's only my fault. Nothing can save my soul or my body. Take care of yourselves and I will take care of you. ' 

After sending the group text, her father immediately replied offering to pay for her flights to come back home, but she replied: 'No, I have a ticket. I'm thinking about the family. You deserve a better daughter.' 

Miss Pahomova, who described Mr Riley as a 'stalker', had threatened suicide if her family found out what she was doing. 

Miss Pahomova first came to the UK in 2008, where she began working in a factory in Blackburn and also working as a part-time model

But Mr Riley told police he informed her loved ones to help her, evidence the court heard was 'contradictory.'

'Please forgive me, I love you very much. You are all going to be ok. I will watch your souls living a good life. For me it's too late. Please forgive me, you are my world. I lost my mind. Please wear a lot of pink. I always love that. At the moment you can't do anything, I made too many mistakes but you are going to be OK I promise you.'

'I was afraid but I'm not anymore. It's only my fault. Nothing can save my soul or my body. I'm very sorry. I'm worth nothing. Take care of yourselves and I will take care of you.'

After her father replied offering to pay for her flights to come home, she replied: 'No, I have a ticket. I'm thinking about the family. You deserve a better daughter.'

Mr Riley was initially arrested as a suspect after Miss Pahomova's death but no charges were brought against him as there was 'insufficient evidence' for a prosecution.

But the court heard he had been convicted of harassment before when in 'completely similar circumstances' he again met an escort girl, began a relationship, then threatened, and did, contact her family telling them what she was doing.

Nigel Meadows, coroner for Manchester, had issued a summons for Mr Riley to attend the inquest.

But despite employing private investigators to track him down the coroner has been unable to serve the summons - and the inquest went ahead without him present.  

His mother, Janet Riley, when visited at the family home on Cobble Bank, Blackley, Manchester, was 'very reluctant' to discuss his whereabouts other than to say he was out of the country, the court heard.

Miss Pahomova first came to the UK in 2008, working in a factory in Blackburn where she lived for a time and also working as a part-time model. In 2011 she met Mr Riley as an escort and they began an 'on-off' relationship.

After a trip home she returned to the UK on September 24, 2012, six days before her death, telling family she was returning to her studies.

The next day Mr Riley arranged through an escort website to meet Miss Pahomova - but used a false name and when they met she was 'shocked and distressed' and told him to leave.

Two days later she went into the aparthotel, specified she wanted an 'elevated position' and booked into a room.

The same day her family received an email from Mr Riley telling them she was not a student but working as an escort - and providing website details of 'how her services could be obtained'.

Her father Janis Vienters, who followed proceedings in court through a translator, was left 'very shocked and surprised' and wanted to bring her home.  

Two days later, the day before Miss Pahomova died, her family received a second email from Mr Riley, saying that she now knew they were aware of her lifestyle.

They then received the text messages from their daughter. 

Around 11.30am the next day Miss Pahomova climbed over the balcony on her apartment. No drugs or alcohol were present in her body. 

Mr Vienters had tried to contact his daughter and said he would buy her tickets to get her home after receiving the text messages.

But the next information he received was that she had been found dead.  

Although Mr Riley had visited the apartment, she was alone at the time of her death. 

Her friend, Vera Novikova, told the inquest she was aware Miss Pahomova was working as a 'posh prostitute' or escort and she had described Mr Riley as a 'stalker'.

Det Sgt Cheryll Morrell, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said Mr Riley told police Miss Pahomova was 'fragile' and he was worried about what she might do so he told the family about her life so they could support her and get her to return home to Latvia.

Mr Meadows said it was a 'little contradictory' asking the officer: 'He knew she was threatening suicide if they found out? But nevertheless, he told them?'

Det Sgt Morrell replied: 'Yes. Yes, it did not ring true.'

Mr Meadows ruled Miss Pahomova took her own life.

He added: 'For reasons only Mr Riley will know and understand he decided to contact Mr Vienters and the family to make disclosures about Laura's lifestyle, when she clearly had not wished him to do that. She was obviously distressed and upset.

'It seems from what Mr Riley told police she was in a very distressed and fragile state and threatened to kill herself.

'Despite that, Mr Riley did not contact anyone to raise concerns about Laura's welfare.

'The court does not deal with moral responsibility, those have to remain within the consciences of those involved.'
