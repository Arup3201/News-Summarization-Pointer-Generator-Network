A 28-year-old mother-of-four who claims to be the 'Queen of Frugal' is determined to show people they don't need to spend big to enjoy life.

Jordan Page from Draper, Utah, was plunged into financial hardship after a housing project she was working on with her unemployed entrepreneurial husband, Bubba, fell through.

With $15,000 in credit card debt and little income, Jordan forced herself to cut back on everything - stocking up on coupons, cheap make-up and even taking leftovers from neighbors.

Queen of Frugal: Jordan Page from Draper, Utah,  is determined to show people they don't need to spend big to enjoy life

Now, three-and-a-half years later, the stay-at-home mother has cleared her dues and has started speaking out about her penny-pinching antics  in a bid to help others.

In one of her YouTube videos, Jordan shows how to apply fake eyelashes and curl hair instead of going to a pricey salon.

She also notes that her secret weapon to looking good is an eyebrow pencil which she picked up for just 99 cents at a drugstore. 

'I'm a busy mom, I don't have time for complicated makeup! This is my NO-FAIL routine that I use every day...and it uses mostly drugstore products!' she tells viewers.

On the food front, she says she waters down expensive fruit juice to make it last longer.

'My family has never noticed . . . it's pretty strong anyway,' Jordan says. 

On her blog, Fun Cheap or Free, Jordan says it's essential to make financial plans for the year ahead.

For 2015, she recommends plotting out birthdays and anniversaries to save for presents in advance.

She also notes the importance of thinking about vacations so that friends might be contacted for free accommodation and cheaper flights can be sourced.

Despite their improved finances, Jordan and her husband - who currently runs a tech start-up - continue their frugal lifestyle. 

They have a giant haul of free and bargain items in their $1 million house - which they claim as their biggest bargain after buying it for a cut-price $400,000.

In an effort to further reduce the house price they even sold the basement to Jordan's parents to use as a holiday home. 

Jordan now plans to write about her thriftiness after signing a book deal.

Bulk buying: Food shopping must be difficult for Jordan as a wife and mother-of-four

She said: 'Being frugal is not about giving up everything you love but learning to get everything you love the smart way.     

'We cut back on our spending but by being so extremely frugal we didn't have to lose out on much in life.

'We found ways to eat out for free or cheap, enjoyed discounted movies, free events, we won contests and got free stuff, we learned we could live on very little. 

'I love proving my sprawling fashionable wardrobe, the good food we eat, the beautiful home we live in and fun things we do as a family are because of how frugal we are, not in spite of it.' 

Jordan, who appeared on TLC's Extreme Cheapskates last year, admits she has always been frugal - thanks to her mother who taught her to get excited about finding a deal.

As a child she would even go door-to-door picking flowers from neighbors' yards and selling the bouquets back to them.

Dressed to impress: Jordan says the greatest compliment is when she goes to a business event or a blogging conference and people ask if she's a fashion blogger

She added: 'Buying something on sale, the joy of finding second-hand items and stretching money - mum taught me everything.

'I was considered the cheap one of my friends in college because I'd pack food rather than buy lunch every day.

'But it wasn't until our financial disaster I learned what it really meant to be frugal.'

Jordan acknowledges many people turn their noses up at her perceived 'cheap' methods of living.

But she is able to enjoy everything other people do albeit with a slight twist.

She said: 'The greatest compliment is when I go to a business event or a blogging conference and people ask if I'm a fashion blogger.

'When I reply 'no, I'm a frugal living blogger' the stunned look on their face is priceless.'
