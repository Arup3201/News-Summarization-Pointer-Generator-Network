An angry row has erupted after a historic chapel used to honour the dead from elite Guards regiments was taken over by mercenaries.

More than 200 employees of Aegis, a private military contractor founded by Colonel Tim Spicer, gathered at the Guards Chapel, at Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace, to pay tribute to 32 colleagues killed in Iraq.

Afterwards they attended a lunch in the Household Division’s Sergeants’ Mess.

Ten years ago, Aegis was heavily criticised by John Kerry, now the US Secretary  of State, after the firm won a £160million contract from the American Government to  co-ordinate security in Iraq.

He claimed Colonel Spicer  had a ‘history of supporting excessive use of force against  a civilian population’.

Colonel Spicer came to prominence in 1997 after his intervention in Papua New Guinea saw him arrested when the army launched a coup. He was also mentioned in a 1999 report into the flouting of a UN arms embargo on Sierra Leone.

One senior Guardsman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘The chapel should be reserved for honouring those who have sacrificed their lives for Queen and Country.

'They have been remembered at the chapel for centuries, and the Guards regiments are the most historic in the British Army.

‘Guardsmen have died in the line of duty and for a fraction of the sums paid to employees of private military companies such as Aegis. So for this event to take place at the chapel... is a smack in the mouth to us.’

Built in 1838, the chapel is the spiritual home of the seven regiments of the Household Division – the Life Guards, the Blues and Royals, and the Grenadier, Coldstream, Irish, Welsh and Scots Guards.

According to the Army’s website, it is the only remaining military chapel in London.

An Aegis spokesman declined to say whether Colonel Spicer had attended the event. ‘The service was held on March 30,’ she added. ‘It was a poignant memorial service led by a senior serving military chaplain of the Guards Chapel.’
