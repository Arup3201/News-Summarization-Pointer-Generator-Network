Stevan Jovetic has vowed to make an impact at Manchester City this season and silence the critics who claim his £22million move from Fiorentina last summer was a waste of money.

Jovetic, 24, made only two Premier League starts due to a succession of niggling injuries that frustrated his new club and manager Manuel Pellegrini.

There were even suggestions the gifted Montenegro forward’s issues might be psychological rather than physical or that he was suffering from homesickness.

But after playing his second game on tour and scoring twice in City’s 5-1 demolition of AC Milan in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jovetic insisted that was not the case and promised to repay Pellegrini’s faith.

‘No it wasn’t mental,’ he said. ‘Mentally I don’t know where I was, but the most important thing in football is the head. There are so many good players but your head has to be right.

‘In that moment, people were saying “Jovetic is not good and they paid £20m” but I was quiet, I kept working and I knew I would show what I was capable of. If you want a good player you have to pay for them.

‘I wasn’t happy, that was obvious. I didn’t play. But I never said it was better to leave England. I know I’m good, I know I can play there. It was difficult but in that moment you just have to believe in yourself.

‘I spoke with the manager a bit about that when we came back. I have his confidence and I’m going to do everything I can to repay that and show I deserve to play.’

Despite a lack of match action last season, Jovetic still demonstrated his potential by scoring six goals in 18 appearances in all competitions.

With Alvaro Negredo ruled out for up to 
two months with a broken bone in his foot and Sergio Aguero struggling 
for fitness after the World Cup, City will be relying on Jovetic for 
goals when they kick off the new campaign against Arsenal in the 
Community Shield a week on Sunday.

The former Partizan Belgrade star is ready for the challenge this time, blaming last season’s setbacks on the fact that his protracted move to England meant that he did not have a proper pre-season.

‘The problem was that the club had finished with the first part of pre-season in South Africa and I was waiting to sign,’ said Jovetic, who is set to face Liverpool at Yankee Stadium tomorrow (wed). ‘I was working alone but it’s not the same.

‘When I arrived they were starting to play matches and I was always behind the rest of the squad. Then I had one injury after another.

‘In the last few months of the season, when I was fit, I played well every game. I came on for 30 or 45 minutes, some games I started. This year hopefully when I have a good preparation with the team it’s going to be a different story and they will see the real Stevan Jovetic.’
