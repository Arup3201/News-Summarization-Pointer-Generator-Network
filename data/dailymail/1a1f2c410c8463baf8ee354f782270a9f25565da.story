A large family of little people are happy to answer questions about their daily lives, take pride in what makes them unique and are determined to correct misconceptions about dwarfism.

'We are pretty much like everybody else... If you have a question, just ask,' says Amy Morris, 33.

Amy is the oldest daughter of the Tucson household, which includes parents Linda and Brian, brothers Josh and Zach, sister Andrea and her daughter Alicia.

Linda, 60, and Brian, 69, are both achondroplasia dwarfs (see below) who met and married in Michigan. As reported by the Arizona Daily Star, Linda is from Tucson, while Brian was born in England.

While living in the Detroit suburb of Northville, the couple had their first children, Amy and Josh, both also little people.

Soon after these new arrivals, their parents to decided to adopt two more children, so Zach and Andrea joined the family.

While they did have the choice of adopting average-sized kids, Linda and Brian told the Arizona Daily Star that they decided on little people.

'Because our birth children had been 
dwarfs, we chose to adopt fellow dwarfs,' Linda said. 'Had we had an 
average-sized child, we definitely would have considered it.

'It is nice to have someone who is like you in the family,' she added.

Linda explains that she was raised just like her three older siblings. 'I remember the first time I saw another little person at Randolph Park, not knowing I was like him,' she remembers.

So Linda and Brian have done the same with their four children. 'We live pretty regular lives,' says Amy. 'Sometimes people are surprised to hear that.'

According to the Arizona Daily Star, Brian is a certified public accountant 
while Linda has a degree in nutrition and dietetics, and was a 
dietitian at hospitals in Tucson and North Carolina.

Josh works as a story editor for television shows like Jersey Shore in Los Angeles.

Zach is a touring member of Mini Kiss, the Kiss tribute band made up entirely of little people with a form of dwarfism.

Andrea was adopted from Mumbai, India, when she was seven. She now has a daughter of her own, Alicia Shanklin. They live with Linda, Brian and Amy in a four-bedroom house in Tucson.

But no one in the family is taller than five feet, so they are used to questions about their lifestyle.

'We've heard them all,' says Amy. The answers to the most common questions are easy.

Amy drives a standard
2004 Honda Civic, with extensions to help her reach the pedals. They 
get their furniture from places like IKEA and store important household 
items within easy reach or use footstools to get things at a higher 
level. And they get clothing altered to fit.

Except for Zach the rest of the members of the family have achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. Zach has hypochondroplasia, a less severe form.

But while they are proud of their 
ordinary lives, the family are 
highly active in the little people community.

Brian helped launch the Dwarf Athletic Association of America, which organizes athletics for little people, in the mid-1980s.

This group now hosts the World Dwarf Games, which brings people of short stature to East Lansing, Michigan, every four years.

'It almost brings tears to my eyes,' Linda told the Daily Star. 'When you go now, there are so many people involved. It has grown so much.'

Amy
is the president of the local chapter of Little People of America, 
called the Tucson Roadrunners, which is growing every year. This family are always open to queries.

Achondroplasia is the most common type of short-limbed dwarfism. The condition occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns.

The word achondroplasia literally means 'without 
cartilage formation'. However, the problem is not in forming cartilage 
but in converting it to bone, particularly in the long bones of the arms
and legs.

All people 
with achondroplasia have short stature. The average height of an adult 
male with achondroplasia is four feet, four inches, and the average 
height for adult females is four feet, one inch.

Characteristic
features of achondroplasia include an average-size trunk, short arms 
and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs, limited range of
motion at the elbows, and an enlarged head with a prominent forehead.

Of the Morris family, only Zach has hypochondroplasia, which is similar to called achondroplasia, but the features tend to be milder.

The incidence of hypochondroplasia is unknown, but researchers believe that it may be about as common as achondroplasia.

People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood.
