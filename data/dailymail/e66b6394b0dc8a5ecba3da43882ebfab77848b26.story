A healthy seven-year-old girl died suddenly just hours after developing chickenpox.

Nicole Murphy's heartbroken parents are now warning others to be aware of the danger of the common illness.

Nicole's lifeless body was found by her distraught father Aaron, 29, just 24 hours after she broke out in spots on December 27 last year.

Nicole Murphy, seven, died after developing chickenpox. It is thought the illness might have triggered a fit

An inquest heard he had checked on his 
daughter several times during the night but found her unresponsive and 
not breathing in her bed at about 3am.

She was rushed from her home in Stourport, Worcestershire, to Worcestershire Royal Hospital by ambulance where she tragically died.

Stourport Coroners' Court heard yesterday how her death may have been triggered by a fit brought on by the chickenpox.

But Worcestershire deputy coroner Marguerite Elcock concluded Nicole died of unknown natural causes.

A pathologist was unable to provide an exact cause of death.

After the hearing, Mr Murphy and his partner, Clare Rush, 29, spoke of their loss and told how they wanted to raise awareness of the complications that can be caused by the virus.

A coroner recorded a verdict of death by unknown natural causes

Mr Murphy said: ‘We need more awareness that chickenpox is not just a harmless childhood illness.

‘I had no idea it could cause the shut-down of organs, I thought the worst thing was it'll scar if you scratch them.

‘I just can’t comprehend how my daughter could have died of something that doctors describe as a simple illness.

‘Nicole had been suffering quite badly and over the night, I kept hearing heavy breathing on the monitor and checking she was okay.

‘She seemed to be just sleeping, but on the last time I came back to check I found she wasn't breathing. We did what we could.

‘We came here looking for answers but we still don't really know for sure how she had died.

‘My son is missing her massively. The children have become clingy, they try and cheer me up over it, but it's so hard for all of us.’

Ms Rush, a carer, added: ‘I've heard of parents deliberately holding chickenpox parties where they bring their children into others who have the virus because they say it is better to get it as a child than an adult.

‘But I hope this might urge others to think twice about these sort of things.

‘She only broke out in spots the day before and we gave her Calpol like the doctors told us to do. But within 24 hours she was dead.

‘We are absolutely heartbroken that we have lost our little girl but we don't want other mums and dads to go through the same.’

The inquest heard how Nicole had been developed chickenpox, along with her sister Jenna, two, and five-year-old brother, Preston.

In 2008 Fabio Alves-Nunes, five, died after suffering from a severe bout of chickenpox

But unlike her siblings, Nicole 
suffered a severe bout of the illness and was heard to have heavy 
breathing by her father who checked on her through the night.

Paediatric
 pathologist Dr Nikola Ostojic said he could not confirm the cause of 
Nicole's death but did say there was some evidence of pneumonia and a 
cyst in her brain.

Mr Murphy sobbed during the hearing as the coroner told him he had done everything he could to help her.

She said: ‘Things came to a head when she stopped breathing and you had to call an ambulance.

Fabio died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning

‘That happened quickly - from being a generally poorly child with chickenpox to stopping breathing.

‘You
 did absolutely everything you could to get some help, but 
unfortunately, having been taken to hospital, Nicole could not be saved.

‘It may be that Nicole was very poorly with chickenpox and as a result she may have had an epileptic fit.’

Nicole was not the first child to die after developing chickenpox.

In 2008, five-year-old Fabio Alves-Nunes died after suffering from the illness.

He developed the illness very severely and died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock, a type of blood poisoning.

Chickenpox is usually a mild but infectious disease.

It takes seven to 21 days for the symptoms to show after infection and people are infectious from two days before the rash appears until roughly five days after.

Around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16, and for most it's a mild illness leading to itching, blisters and sometimes a high temperature

After having chickenpox the body usually develops an immunity, which stops people getting it again.

Most doctors recommend rest and lotion to soothe itchy spots.
