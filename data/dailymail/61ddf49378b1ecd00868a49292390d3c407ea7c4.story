He was knocked to the ground for just £5 by a mugger who thought he was a ‘soft touch’.

But 93-year-old former amateur boxer Stanley Evans came out fighting yesterday – saying he wished he had given his attacker a right hook.

The frail pensioner said he would have fought back if only the robber had launched the assault on his ‘good side’.

Mr Evans, who was attacked in the lobby of his block of flats as he returned from a shopping trip, said: ‘He went straight for me and pushed me against the wall.

‘He got me on the left hand side, which is not my good side. If it was, I would’ve given him a punch with my good arm.’

The OAP spoke as convicted robber Soloman Bygraves, 29, appeared in court over the ‘callous and sickening’ attack. 

He had offered to carry the frail pensioner’s shopping bags before knocking him to the floor as he lunged for his wallet.

Mr Evans, a retired film cameraman, suffered injuries to his arm and shoulder and was left lying on the floor of his London tower block before raising the alarm.

He said: ‘He was quite friendly and sympathetic and offered to carry my shopping for me. 

'When I got to the door, I fumbled with my keys and felt him slip in behind me.

‘He said he knew someone on the second floor. I knew he was lying but I wasn’t going to oppose him. 

'He got in the lift and then he attacked me. I was just lying there. I felt like a seal out of water, just flapping about, but eventually I got up and called the police.’

The former assistant cameraman, who once worked with Richard Attenborough, Liz Taylor and Diana Dors, said he had previously lent Bygraves £10 when he said he needed money.

But the robber returned to the Soho building and mugged Mr Evans on January 31 this year, rifling through his pockets after knocking him to the ground.

Bachelor Mr Evans, who is originally from Cardigan, Wales, said he could not forgive Bygraves for the attack. 

‘He was probably waiting for someone like me to come along,’ he said. ‘I was an easy touch. 

'He was so friendly at the beginning but he changed all of a sudden and became aggressive.

‘The world’s full of evil people using other people to help themselves. 

'He deserves to go to prison as it could have been worse. I could have slipped and knocked my head.’

He said members of the public had already donated money and another mugging victim had set up an online fundraising campaign. 

Yesterday, homeless Bygraves admitted robbery at Southwark Crown Court via video link from prison.

John Causer, defending, said his client had a lengthy criminal record – including three convictions for robbery – and had a background of ‘mental health and drug’ issues.

Bygraves was remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing on April 13. 

Bygraves entered his guilty plea has been remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing next month
