Two members of staff at a private nursery have been sacked for looking at a child porn film while at work.

The nursery, in Finsbury, North London, was closed down for two days after the shock discovery so an investigation could be carried out. 

It has now been allowed to reopen after education watchdog Ofsted temporarily suspended the nursery's registration.

Investigation: Monkey Puzzle in Finsbury has been allowed to re-open after it was shut for two days

Owners of the Monkey Puzzle Nursery say the incident was not connected to any of the children who attend.

The branch is part of a nationwide network of 29 nurseries run by the same company.

Staff said two nursery workers caught receiving and viewing the video with indecent images of children were first suspended and then dismissed.

Police officers from a child abuse investigation team were called in when the incident was reported on February 27.

A police spokesman said: 'We are investigating an incident but no arrests have been made.'

Rebecca Crosby, operations manager for the Monkey Puzzle group in Hertfordshire, said: 'The safety of our children is our main priority.

'At all times, we adhered to our safeguarding procedures, immediately suspended the members of staff concerned and at no time was the safety of the children compromised. 

'The images in this viral video were in no way connected to the nursery.'

The staff members claim the video was unsolicited, while nursery bosses say police have received more than 10,000 complaints about an identical clip from people who were sent it without requesting it.

Ms Crosby added: 'When we reported the incident, the police already knew of the clip's contents and informed us that it had originated outside the UK and that a large investigation is already underway.'

An Ofsted spokesman said: 'Parents should be assured that when we were made aware of the concerns at the Monkey Puzzle Nursery we made an unannounced visit to check the appropriate safeguarding provisions for the children were in place.'

The Monkey Puzzle Nursery company was founded in Cambridgeshire in 1978.

The nationwide chain caters for children aged between three months and five years old. 

A message on its website says: 'The group is soon to expand to over 30 settings and is among the top ten childcare providers in the UK.

'We pride ourselves in the knowledge that we offer our children a secure caring environment that is second to none.'
