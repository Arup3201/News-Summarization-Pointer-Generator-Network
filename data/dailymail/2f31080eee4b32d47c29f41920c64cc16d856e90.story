David Cameron has 'serious questions to answer' about whether he abandoned crunch talks in Northern Ireland to prepare for a rave-style party for his wife Samantha, Labour has claimed.

The Prime Minister has been forced to deny pulling the plug on negotiations in Belfast last Friday so that he could fly home to supervise preparations for the lavish party at Chequers.

Politicians on both sides of Northern Ireland’s divide were said to be surprised and dismayed when Mr Cameron abruptly announced that he was flying home from talks to find a solution to the Province’s budget crisis which is threatening to bring down the power-sharing administration.

David Cameron has faced questions about whether he left talks in Belfast with Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny early last week to prepare for a rave at Chequers

At the time, Downing Street said that Mr Cameron and the Irish Taoiseach had concluded that no further progress could be made after 10 hours of talks.

But yesterday the Mail revealed that Mr Cameron also had a pressing need to return home to host a belated 40th birthday party for Samantha at his country retreat Chequers.

No 10 yesterday insisted there was no link between the two.

But the Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis last night said the revelations raised questions about whether Mr Cameron had been ‘less than truthful.’

Mr Lewis said: ‘I have no problem with David Cameron attending a family celebration.

‘However, his unwillingness to remain in Northern Ireland for a longer period in order to broker progress, caused serious concern at the time.

‘This is an incredibly fragile time for political stability in Northern Ireland and the prime minister had a duty to either stay the course or visit at a time when he could give the situation his fullest attention.

‘He now has serious questions to answer about whether he was less than truthful about his reasons for an abrupt departure, which made an already fraught situation worse.’

The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman yesterday denied Mr Cameron had flown early for the party.

He told reporters: ‘You know the reason why the Prime Minister and Taoiseach, who were jointly at these talks, made the statement they did jointly about why agreement wouldn’t be possible.’

The political talks in Belfast are aimed at resolving outstanding disputes over flags, parades, the legacy of the Troubles and the Province’s budget crisis

Experts warned last week that the power-sharing coalition could come ‘crashing down’ unless a deal is struck by Christmas.

Speaking in the Commons on Monday, two former Northern Ireland secretaries raised questions about why Mr Cameron pulled out of the talks early.

Peter Hain said: ‘I was both troubled and astonished that the Prime Minister left the summit prematurely in the way that he did. My experience is that a prime minister has to coax and progress the discussions and negotiations, and there is a chemistry about those and a momentum that it is possible to develop.

‘Walking away as he did leaves a kind of political paralysis which I suspect and fear may continue. That is extremely damaging and I am extremely worried about the situation.’

Fellow Northern Ireland veteran Paul Murphy said: ‘How on earth can the Prime Minister come to the conclusion after 24 hours that there is no realistic way of reaching a consensus?’

Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Cameron had paid for the Chequers party from his own money.

The 200 guests included celebrities such as comedian Harry Enfield, designer Karen Millen, actress Helena Bonham-Carter and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

Club DJ Sarah HB was selected to run a rave-style disco at the stately home, and the Prime Minister was reportedly seen ‘throwing shapes in an open-necked collar and jeans.’
