More than 2,000 people descended on a picturesque beauty spot for an illegal rave which police were not able to stop because there were too few officers on duty, it has emerged.

Revellers turned out in their droves to Devil's Dyke in the South Downs, near Brighton, East Sussex, yesterday and set up camp in the National Park before the illegal party got underway.

More than 400 cars and at least seven sound systems were spotted at the unlicensed gathering – which attracted people from as far away as Swindon after word spread on social media.

Illegal: Ravers descended on a picturesque beauty spot for a rave, which police were not yet able to stop because there were too few officers on duty

Big event: Ravers came from all over the country to take part in the party at the beauty spot near Brighton

The rave, which was still going strong more than 24 hours after it started, finally ended at 7am this morning.

Frustrated nearby residents called police complaining of the noise and ‘serious distress’ caused by the party, which broke out on open land near to the park’s golf course in the early hours of Sunday.

However, despite sending officers to the scene, Sussex Police said it was unable to disperse revellers and was powerless to do so.

A spokesman said: ‘Overnight it was assessed that due to the darkness, rain, and numbers present, it was not appropriate or practical to attempt to close the gathering safely.

‘With daylight, officers have been re-assuring local residents that action is being taken to contain the gathering, to limit further attendance, and to seek to minimise the impact on them.

‘Officers have been on the site and the gathering is good humoured though very noisy.

‘Although there are powers available to the police to close down illegal gatherings such as this, before exercising these powers an assessment has to be undertaken to determine whether or not such a gathering can be closed down safely and effectively.

‘At present the assessment is that it would not be possible or safe to close the event down, given the number of police officers available.

‘However a presence at the location will be maintained and active measures are being taken to seek to prevent it escalating further.’

Raves are unlicensed, illegal parties which are often held on land which is not owned by the organisers. They can cause a huge amount of disruption to local residents and damage to the land.

A police spokesman added: ‘Where we can we will attend a report of a rave at the earliest opportunity to try to bring it to a safe conclusion.

‘When a large number of people are already at the site it is not always possible for us shut down the rave with the police resources available at that time.

Officers from Sussex Police have not yet been able to stop the gathering because there have not been enough officers on duty. Residents living near the usually peaceful South Downs (pictured) have made noise complaints

‘However we will always take action to contain the event, to reassure local residents, and work with partners such as the National Trust and Council to minimise the impact.

‘We are also investigating to see what offences organisers may have committed and will pursue all offences that are identified.'
