A former perfume-company advertising director is suing her manager for relentlessly verbally harassing her about her looks and weight - even comparing her to frumpy singer Susan Boyle - which nearly killed her.

Laura Ziv claimed her boss at fragrance giant Firmenich, Herve Pierini, constantly berated her and called her a 'fatty' in 
front of other employees at the company’s Madison Avenue office.

In her $6 million lawsuit against Firmenich and Pierini, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Oxford University graduate said the stressful abuse led her to suffer a near-fatal brain hemorrhage.

The former creative marketing 
director claims Pierini targeted her after she refused to build a 
competing fragrance brand with him - on company time - in 2010.

'In
January 2010, Pierini taunted Ziv at a party given by an executive of 
the [company’s] biggest client at her home by repeatedly referring to 
Ziv as ‘Susan Boyle,’ a Scottish singer who is often taunted in the 
media as being old, fat and ugly,' the suit stated, according to New York Post.

Susan Boyle
became an unlikely international star after performing a beautiful 
rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' from 'Les Misérables' on reality TV 
show 'Britain's Got Talent' in 2009.

Ziv, who joined the company in 2001, said the taunts got worse after the Boyle comparison.

'On one occasion when a fellow employee 
did not take the time for lunch, Pierini remarked to Ziv, in the 
presence of other employees and for them to hear, ‘Not like you, fatty,’ ' according to legal papers.

Despite Pierini’s alleged harassment, Ziv was put in charge of Firmenich’s biggest account - which allegedly only made Pierini more volatile, according to NY Daily News.

The married mother of two young children also claimed the constant abuse caused her to suffer a brain hemorrhage in 2011 that doctors attributed to a spike in blood pressure.

But when the New Jersey resident returned to work, Pierini allegedly grew more aggressive. 

'Pierini intended that his degrading, humiliating and vicious and brutal treatment of Ziv would cause Ziv’s blood pressure to rise to a dangerous level and would thus damage Ziv’s health, perhaps to the degree of causing her death,' the suit contends.

Ziv took medical leave in June, after which her lawyer wrote a letter to the CEO of Firmenich, complaining of Pierini’s behavior.

Ziv said the company has cut off her salary and medical benefits.

According to a profile on the Fashion Institute of Technology website, Pierini joined Firmenich in 1999 as an assistant fragrance development manager in the U.K. before being promoted to senior account manager eight years later.

He is a graduate of the Master of Professional Studies program in Cosmetics and Fragrance Marketing and Management and holds a master’s degree in chemistry from the University of Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, France.
