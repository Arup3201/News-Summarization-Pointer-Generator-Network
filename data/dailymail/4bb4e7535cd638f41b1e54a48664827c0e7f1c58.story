She has never taken a spelling test before, not even one set by her parents.

But with a name like Agnieszka 
Runa-Ann Kolaczynska, and living in a Welsh village called 
Llidiartywaun, perhaps it's no wonder she's a spelling champion.

In the World Education Games spelling 
championships – a live online event in which more than 1.5million pupils
competed from 200 countries – the nine-year-old won first place for 
Wales.

Agnieszka also came seventh in the UK 
and 31st in the world – even though she is educated at home and has 
never been tested against other children.

She put her success down to her love 
of reading and writing, plus plenty of practice spelling her long Polish
family name and her address in Wales.

'If you can spell my name you can spell just about anything,'

Agnieszka said. 'After learning to spell Polish names and Welsh places, English is a doddle.

'I don't have lessons like children 
do at school, and I've never compared myself to anyone before. So we 
were a bit shocked as I had no idea that I was good at spelling.

'I had to spell correctly as many 
words as I could and as fast as I could in one hour. But I do type very 
fast, because I have learned to touch type.'

Agnieszka's favourite writers are Michael Morpurgo and Malachy Doyle and her parents take her to the library every week

Agnieszka is taught by her mother 
Anita, a teacher, and doctor father Alex, along with her sisters 
Isabella, 17, and Magdalena, six, who has Down's Syndrome.

She sometimes reads three books a day and has to be told to take a rest by her parents.

Agnieszka has a smattering of Polish 
from her paternal grandmother and has learned some Welsh living in 
Llidiartywaun, near Llanidloes, Powys.

Mrs Kolaczynska, 45, said: 'She 
entered the spelling games because it looked fun to compete live against
children from all over the world.

'She went on the computer on her own 
and just got on with it. We were amazed to see her name appear on the 
leaderboard.

'Agnieszka is determined and 
self-motivated and we are very proud of her. Let's face it, she has to 
check her spellings with a name like hers and living here.'

The computer-based spelling contest, 
held in March, took an hour and had to be done within a 48-hour period.

It was against the clock and Agnieszka had to go through five levels of 
difficulty.

Her mother said: 'I would never have been able to do it myself at that speed.'

Agnieszka's favourite writers are 
Michael Morpurgo and Malachy Doyle and her parents take her to the 
library every week to restock on books.

Her mother added: 'I provide the 
children with a lot of stimulation and a nourishing environment, then 
support them by accessing people who know about the things they want to 
learn.'

She said she will be happy for 
Agnieszka to go to school and university later on but for the moment she
feels she can give her a better education at home.

'We have a TV but only watch it when 
there is a specific programme we want to see,' she said. 'They don't 
have screens to distract them – if they go on the computer they have to 
think about it first.'
