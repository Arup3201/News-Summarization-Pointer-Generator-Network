Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, the 17th Century saying goes. 

And one wife, hell-bent on revenge for her husband's philandering, has proved it is as true today as when first coined more than 300 years ago. 

Furious with her cheating husband, Delores Cureton used a gun and a hammer to smash up his Lincoln Town Car as it sat in the driveway of their home in York County, South Carolina. 

A scorned wife used a gun and a hammer to smash her philandering husband's car after finding out he had been cheating on her in York County, South Carolina

The 61-year-old woman pulled up to the house in her own vehicle before getting into her husband's to smash the windows and taillights

The 61-year-old's partner, John Cureton, was inside the house with another woman at the time, police were told. 

She was arrested for criminal domestic violence despite her husband's decision not to press charges. 

According to kvs12.com, Mrs Cureton pulled up outside the house in her own vehicle in a violent rage. 

She then got into her husband's car where he stored a gun in the glovebox. Afraid of being shot, Mr Cureton stood back as his wife tried to load the weapon, he said. 

Mrs Cureton then fetched a hammer from her own truck to begin smashing the taillights and windows of her husband's car before passing out. 

When police arrived the woman was clutching a blood-soaked towel.  

She was taken to Piedmont Medical Center and later charged with criminal domestic violence after admitting most of her husband's claims were true. 

It was never established whether or not another woman was inside the house during the incident.
