The Queen revealed a surprisingly fresh face this morning at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of the National theatre, having got to bed late last night.

The 87-year-old monarch was seen leaving The Cavalry and Guards Club at 10.40pm on Monday evening where she had been dining with husband Prince Phillip.

But despite her late night the great-great-grandmother still looked radiant this morning as she toured the National Theatre to mark the anniversary.

Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were out until almost 11pm on Monday evening as they dined, dressed to the nines, at the exclusive Cavalry and Guards club in Mayfair

The Queen wore a dark, floral patterned dress, while Prince Philip looked dashing in a Tuxedo as they were seen leaving their late night meal

Her Majesty wore a colourful hot pink ensemble with a matching feathered hat as she greeted well-wishers outside the theatre.

Joined by an equally sprightly looking Prince Phillip, the Queen toured the venue and helped unveil a commemorative plaque.

Her Majesty seemed taken by the mechanics of the back-stage production as 
she looked around, visiting the prop-making workshop within the theatre. 

She
 admired the horse from the production of ‘War Horse’ and received 
flowers from a child actor before chatting animatedly with Lady Olivier,
 widow of the great actor Sir Laurence Olivier.

The
 Royals then watched with enthusiasm a dress-rehearsal performance of a 
song from the musical ‘Guys and Dolls’, before meeting more theatre 
staff.

Certainly no one would have guessed that the octogenarian and Prince Phillip, 92, had been out late last night.

No one could have guessed the Queen had had a late night when she appeared today

The paired dined at the ancient Cavalry and Guards Club in Mayfair, not emerging until well after 10.30.

The Queen looked elegant in a floor length dark dress with a shimmering floral motif, teamed with her trademark string of pearls, while Prince Phillip kept it classic in a black tuxedo.

It is not known who the couple dined with, but the Queen’s cousin, Prince Edward The Duke of Kent is president of the prestigious members club, which has a strong military affiliation.

Anyone out in London’s Mayfair last night may have been shocked to see Queen Elizabeth emerging from the Grade 1 listed stone building and being whisked away in a car so close to midnight.

The Cavalry and Guards Club is situated at the Hyde Park end of Piccadilly, in the heart of Mayfair, with stunning views over Green Park.

Founded in 1810, the club offers accommodation for members as well as banqueting facilities and dining for parties of two.

Head Chef, Paul Farmer uses predominantly locally sourced and seasonal ingredients in the English menu, which cites French influences.
