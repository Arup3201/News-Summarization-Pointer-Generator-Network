A German photographer exasperated by the inequalities of the American penal system became fascinated by a late night bus that transports the families of inmates to remote prison facilities to visit their loved ones for just a few hours.

'I was struck by the fact I have lived in the city for 10 years and yet I’d never seen a bus or heard about them,' said photographer Jacobia Dahm who is responsible for the moving series called 'In Transit.'

Since November, Dahm has been posting pics from her series to her Instagram account. Now the photos and a short film can be viewed on her website.

Dahm, a mother of two,  learned that mostly wives and children of inmates ride the bus and she became determined to capture that in a portrait.

'I thought, ‘I have to find that image,' she said.

From February to May, Dahm took six trips on the prison bus and paid $65 per trip and travels to six different prisons.

According to the artist's website, 2.7 million American children have a parent in prison and more than 80,000 people are incarcerated in New York State.

'This journey sets out from the bustling hubs of New York yet it is invisible to most outsiders. The overnight bus ride to the different prisons hundreds of miles north of the city is a long and difficult one marked by anxiety, sadness, and exhaustion,' she said.

Destination: Attica is a maximum security prison located in upstate New York and one of the bus stops 

The farthest is 20 miles from the Canadian border and 300 miles from New York City.

The trip can last as long as 24 hours and space is very limited.

Some passengers choose to book their ticket on Monday morning to leave on Friday and Saturday nights from Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.

'The bus is almost like a secondary imprisonment,' Dahm told The New York Times.

'You won’t be riding it forever, but you will be for a long time,' she added.

A large portion of the passengers are children for whom a ticket costs $30.

The bus is privately owned and operated by the driver.

The city once offered a shuttle for prison visitors but the practice stopped in 2011.

'Prisons could care less how people get up there,' said Dahm.

Arrived: After an 8-10 hour bus ride people get dropped off at the visitor center of the prison and usually wait an hour or two of time before the actual visit

Families of the prisoners take the long journey because they must in order to be reconnected with loved ones.

Despite the cold nature of the bus and the strict guidelines from prisons, visitors celebrate being able to see their missed family members.

'Even after all the unpleasant things they had to go through, there was a celebratory sense on the bus,' she said.

'It’s amazing to see people trying to keep family life and intimacy going against all odds,' she added.

'At least half the people they visit are in prison for a ridiculous amount of time,' she said.

'No one is being helped, and a lot of people are being hurt.'

Dahm herself is a mother of two and felt especially for the children forced to take the journey.

'The first or second time, it is difficult for them, ‘she said.

'After that, it becomes a routine. They know they are going to see Dad or Mom. This is just what you have to do to get there,' she concluded.
