A council member in Pomfret, New York has worn a colander on his head as he was sworn into office.

Christopher Schaeffer opted for the unique head wear, which signals his allegiance to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, at the ceremony on Thursday afternoon.

His church, which was founded by an atheist in 2005 to protest against the teaching of creationism in school and to poke fun at religion, uses the spaghetti strainer as its symbol.

'It's just a statement about religious freedom,' Schaeffer told the Observer after he was sworn in. 'It's a religion without any dogma.'

The organization's website insists Pastafarianism is a real religion. Adherents believe that pirates were the original Pastafarians and 'were peaceful explorers and it was due to Christian misinformation that they have an image of outcast criminals today', it explains.

'Some claim that the church is purely a thought experiment, satire, illustrating that Intelligent Design is not science, but rather a pseudoscience manufactured by Christians to push Creationism (the doctrine that God created the universe) into public schools,' it writes. 'These people are mistaken.'

'The Church of FSM is real, totally legit, and backed by hard science. Anything that comes across as humour or satire is purely coincidental.'

The church opposes the teaching of creationism, and its website explains that followers are fond of beer and treat every Friday as a holiday.

Bobby Henderson, the founder of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, blogged about the ceremony on Monday, calling Schaeffer 'the first openly Pastafarian sworn into office'.

'Some people will see it as obnoxious or a sign that heâ€™s not taking the oath of office seriously,' Henderson said. 'But I am completely confident that Schaeffer will distinguish himself as a Council member of the highest caliber.'

Schaeffer said that although his appearance may have looked bizarre to some, he is fully committed to working for Pomfret's residents.

'Mostly, I'm just looking forward to making sure that the town is run smoothly and we meet the needs of all of our citizens,' he said.
