A lonely collie dog is desperate to find a new home after living in a rescue centre for 11 years thanks to his irrational fear of cars.

Toby arrived at Hilbrae Pets Hotel as a ten-month-old stray in May 2003 and was expected to find a new home within weeks.

But the 12-year-old is so frightened of vehicles that whoever adopts him will have to walk him home and keep him away from cars.

Claudia Churchill works at the pets home where Toby has lived since 2003. She still hopes to find him a home for his old age

Toby has not been adopted because his fear of cars stops him from being taken away from the centre

It is thought Toby could be the longest serving dogs’ home resident in Britain - at Battersea Dogs Home, pets stay an average of just 29 days before being adopted.

Toby now has his own Twitter account - @hilbraetoby - which has more than 3,000 followers who keep up tabs on his search for a home.

However, no one has been able to adopt the animal, who will need to live in a home with no young children.

Claudia Churchill, who has worked as a supervisor at the centre in Telford, Shropshire, for 22 years, is hoping someone will come forward and give him a retirement home.

Staff have been unable to help Toby get over his fear of cars so he can finally leave the centre

Staff at Hilbrae Pets Hotel have cared for Toby since he arrived in 2003 as a 10-month-old stray

She said: 'He came into us as a ten-month-old and had a few issues. He was quite naughty.

'We don’t know how he was abandoned and we don’t know why he is scared of cars. People love him but he gets overlooked because of his fear.

'We don’t know if he was thrown from a car when he was abandoned, but he is terrified of them.

Hilbrae supervisor Claudia Churchill said she would 'love nothing more' than for him to go to a new home

'On one occasion he had a home but when the people went to open the boot for him he ran back to the kennels.

'He is a dear soul, he loves a walk, loves to chase a ball and is still fit.

'I’d love nothing more than for him to go to a new home, but he just won’t get into a car. The best thing would be if someone could somehow walk him home.'
