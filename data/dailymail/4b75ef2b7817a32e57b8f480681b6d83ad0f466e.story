Sneaky: Roger Moore, who attempted to fake CCTV images to avoid a speeding fine, has to now pay £2,000

A driver who faked CCTV images to avoid a speeding fine but was caught after police examined the shadows in his forged footage has narrowly avoided jail.

Roger Moore, 44, was snapped doing 51mph in a 40mph zone as he returned a courtesy car to a garage in Plymouth, Devon, at 12pm on February, 22, 2011.

But in July 2011 as legal proceedings against him were underway he produced CCTV of his own car outside his house - apparently taken at 10.37am on the day of the offence.

He then claimed the film proved he had already taken the Peugeot 206 loan car back when it was filmed speeding - and said a garage worker must have been the guilty driver.

Father-of-three Moore submitted the false footage on a DVD to a court and an investigating police officer in a bid to clear his name.

But police who were suspicious of the footage then waited and revisited Moore’s house a year to the date of the offence in February 2012.

They took their own images of how his house would have looked at the time of year - and then went back again and got more footage in July 2012.

Their photos showed the shadows on Moore’s CCTV were in the wrong place meaning his film was actually shot in summer 2011 and not February 2011 as he claimed.

They also found a log which suggested the date stamp had been altered.

Prosecuting, David Gittins said police experts spent time analysing CCTV footage from Moore’s home, submitted by the defendant at court. But the experts found inconsistencies.

Mr Gittins told Plymouth Crown Court the shadows on Moore’s footage were far too long to be February, suggesting the CCTV was actually from later in the year.

The experts also recreated their own mocked-up footage in an effort to show how it was possible to change the date imprinted in the corner of the film.

The prosecutor added: '(Moore) said one of the garage staff "must have been pinning it (the speeding offence)" on him because he had previously made a complaint about their work.'

But defence counsel Ali Rafati said Moore was the sole earner in his family, taking home £325 a week.

He said Moore, who pleaded guilty to 
perverting the course of justice a few days before he was due to stand 
trial, was a family man of no previous convictions, adding: 'He got 
himself in an act which snowballed out of control.

'He simply couldn’t face up to that so he buried his head in the sand and let the months roll by.'

Moore, of Plymstock, Devon, was given a sixteen week jail term suspended for two years and ordered to pay £2,000 at Plymouth Crown Court.

Judge
Paul Darlow told him: 'You went to extraordinary lengths to try and lie
and cheat your way out of a speeding conviction which would have 
followed a light fine.

'You were happy to allege against others who were simply doing their job.

'I read their witness statements and understand what it is like for them thinking they would have to have a court appearance where they would be challenged as liars and cheats but all the way along it was you.'

The judge also suggested he sell his personalised number plate in order to raise the £2,000 fine.

Speaking outside the court, a Safety Camera Partnership spokeswoman expressed disappointment at the sentence.

She said: 'I think that Mr Moore ought to consider himself extremely fortunate to not be spending tonight (in jail) at the beginning of a custodial sentence.'
