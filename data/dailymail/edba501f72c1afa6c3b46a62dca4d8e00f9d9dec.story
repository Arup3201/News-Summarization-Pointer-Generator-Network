A Missouri man who provided key testimony in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing trial walked into a downtown Kansas City federal building setting off a bomb scare that closed several blocks after he asked if he's on a government terrorist watch list.

Officers closed off several blocks of traffic near the Richard Bolling Federal Building following the incident on Friday said to have been a misunderstanding that sent a bomb-sniffing dog and robot to search the man's car, originally unbeknownst to him.

The more than four-hour search turned up nothing threatening, according to the FBI, except for a bit of upset from the man, an Egyptian-born American citizen, who claimed to have been their target.

Wrong man: Wahed Moharam said he was investigated by FBI officers over a possible terrorist threat after questioning federal officers on why he's listed as a potential terrorist

'I love this country more than any place on the face of this earth, I would give my life for this country,' Wahed Moharam told KCTV on Friday night. ‘I never went to the building and said I have a bomb. If I said I had a bomb I wouldn’t be talking to you now,’ he defended over initial accusing reports.

Mr Moharam had relocated to the suburb of Grain Valley after providing crucial testimony in the World Trade Center attack in 1993. It consequently helped lock away two major terrorists, one, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was called the most important man to call jihad against the U.S. by the late Osama bin Laden, according to The Kansas City Star.

'I should be honoured for what I did, not treated like this. It's very unfair,' he told the Associated Press.

Law enforcement didn't identify the man themselves but Mr Moharam confirmed his car was the one searched during the incident.

He said he wasn't in any trouble and was never detained. He said he was inquiring about being on the list after a recent traffic stop swarmed his car with officers, revealing his name as flagged.

'The FBI treated me very well and they even took me home to make sure I am safe,' said Moharam. 'Whoever said, “I have a bomb and this,” is untrue. I never said, “I have a bomb” or anything whatsoever in that manner.'

FBI special agent Michael Kaste said 
earlier on Friday that the large-scale response was based on the 
'initial limited information' police had from witnesses, adding: 'The 
primary concern was for the public's safety, which made the actions 
today necessary.'

Mr Moharam said he had walked into the building and asked to speak to someone with Homeland Security to get more information following the traffic stop a day earlier.

He said he'd been pulled over by a Jackson County sheriff's deputy, who told him his name had been flagged, and was later surrounded by five sheriff's vehicles but wasn't cited for anything.

Mr Moharam said he was polite at the federal building, and that the individuals to whom he spoke were polite.

He said an officer asked on Friday if 
authorities could search his car, and he answered yes, gave them his 
car’s key and offered to take them to the vehicle, but they declined. He
said he waited in the building with the officials, and that they bought
him a Starbucks coffee.

Local news helicopters would later broadcast his parked vehicle being searched by a remote controlled robot and investigators in bomb squad gear.

'I had no clue what was going on outside. I gave them the key. I didn't mean to cause any problem,' said Moharam, who said he moved to the U.S. 35 years ago from Egypt. 'I have nothing to hide. I have no intention of doing any harm.'

FBI officials are prohibited from discussing whether someone is on a national security watch list, but Kaste said the man walked into the building 'to clarify whether he was under investigation by a federal agency.'

The source said no explosives were found on the man or in his car, but police did find a gun in the vehicle. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

Asked about the gun, Mr Moharam said it was a toy gun, 'like you buy for $10, like you see at Toys R Us.'

He also said the search dogs may have 
picked up the scent of his business’ cleaning supplies in his car, and 
had told authorities the chemicals were there because he operates a 
cleaning business in nearby Blue Springs.

Neighbours of Mr Moharam defended him to KCTV saying he's a good man who uses his cleaning business to hire those recently out of a job.

The searched car was parked near the Fletcher Daniels State Office building and the towering Bolling building, which houses numerous government agencies including the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers.

Donna Kerr, a benefits analyzer for SSA, said workers had 'absolutely no information from official sources, other than to stay away from the windows.' Workers were told to go home early.

Mr Moharam insisted he wasn't trying to make trouble, saying he simply hopes to support his children and grandchildren. He wasn't told why his name had been flagged.

'I love this country. This is my country. Two-thirds of my life I've been here,' Mr Moharam said.

Helmet Head: Mr Moharam is known by locals for his love of painting his face and head at Kansas City Chiefs football games though he had his tickets revoked while being in the witness protection programme

An expressed proud American, before Friday's incident Mr Moharam was already familiar to many Kansas City residents being the once-ardent fan dubbed 'Helmet Man' for the face paint and other gear he wore to Kansas City Chiefs football games.

The Chiefs revoked his season tickets out of safety concerns in 2003 after the team learned he had been in the federal witness protection program for testifying while living in New Jersey for government prosecutors in the first World Trade Center bombing.

At the time of his participation in the programme his name had been changed to another.

The Chiefs confirmed his placement with federal authorities, and believing Moharam could still be a target because of the case, offered to rotate his tickets to different spots in the stadium and asked him to stop dressing in full 'Helmet Man' regalia.

When he refused, they said, they had no choice but to revoke his tickets.
