A former high-flying City lawyer who was jailed after being found guilty of fraud has admitted she's glad she was convicted as prison 'saved' her from her corrupt career.

Kate Johns said she was originally in denial over the £6.7million fraud she committed while working at one of the world's richest banks. But her time behind bars has made her realise the 'moral and ethical' mistakes she had made after becoming an 'arrogant lawyer.'

Johns denied the charges against her when she faced a jury at Southwark Crown Court in 2009 and attempted suicide when she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

But now she has been released after serving half her sentence in HMP Holloway and  then the private Bronzefield prison, she has admitted she's seen the error of her ways.

The 43-year-old told today's Independent that if she hadn't been convicted, she may never have left her corrupt career in the City where she felt driven by greed thanks to her toxic working environment.

'The more one gets caught up in it, the 
harder it gets to walk away. If my conviction hadn't come about, I'm not
sure to this day whether I'd have ever walked away,' she confessed.

Driven by greed: The former City lawyer said she is glad she was caught so she can now move on from the corrupt career she had at a London bank

Johns was jailed for tricking her employers at Japanese
bank Tokyo-Mitsubishi into falsely approving huge sums of credit for a 
friend's struggling airline.

For her role, the 43-year-old received kickbacks worth £1.95million 
which she used to pay off the £1.1million 
mortgage on her Georgian townhouse in Camden, North London.

She also spent her 'ill-gotten gains' on daily manicures, 
designer dresses, breast surgery and extravagant shopping trips, 
including blowing £40,000 on a pair of diamond earrings.

She admitted she had 'wanted for nothing'. 'I'd enjoyed a very good career, and I'd become a very confident, maybe arrogant, lawyer in the process,' she added.

'There were moral and ethical issues in my background that were 
troubling, which I had to face before moving on'

The fraud behind her lavish lifestyle was exposed when the airline finally went bust in 2008 and her illegal money transfers were investigated.

After she was jailed, she said it took months for her to accept her sentence but she finally had 'an epiphany' thanks to the help of a probation officer.

'I realised 
there were moral and ethical issues in my background that were 
troubling, which I had to face and identify before moving on,' she said.

The former Oxford and King's College London student is now using her legal know-how to help people by working for Hibiscus, a charity for women affected by the criminal justice system.

She has also written a book about her experiences in which she reveals how the City can turn employees into 'corporate scapegoats' and how she's glad her life of corruption and crime is now behind her.
