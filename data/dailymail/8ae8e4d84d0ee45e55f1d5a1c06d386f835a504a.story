The Liberal Democrats are a 'bunch of nutters and cockroaches', the party's president Tim Farron has claimed in an astonishingly frank interview about their future prospects.

Mr Farron admitted the Lib Dems are in a 'critical state' but he was trying to 'breed and train a bunch of nutters' willing to work tirelessly to defy the opinion polls and win elections.

Despite being rocked by sex and court scandals, he claimed the party had the resilience and ability to survive of 'cockroaches' but warned: 'One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful.

Nutter: Lib Dem president Tim Farron warned the party was in a 'critical state' and future survival could not be guaranteed

As the Lib Dems prepare for their spring conference in Brighton, starting tonight, Mr Farron warned the party faithful that they cannot take their future survival for granted.

It comes as a new poll shows fewer than a third of Liberal Democrat voters at the last election plan to back the party again, a major poll reveals today.

A survey commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggests there is little room for complacency for Nick Clegg despite the by-election victory in Eastleigh last week.

Mr Farron told parliamentary journal The House: 'We are a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war, just a bit less smelly, we are made of sterner stuff.

Survival: Mr Farron said the party's resilience is 'a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war, just a bit less smelly'

'The party is in a critical state. We may well be cockroach-ish, but we shouldn't take that for granted. One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful. We shouldn't assume our survival is guaranteed.'

He said the party could not depend on safe seats, so anyone who chose to stand for election needed to be a 'nutter.

'Essentially we are trying to breed and train a bunch of nutters, absolutely dedicated and who have the skill set and understanding that what it takes is not just doing a good hustings, it’s not just about being able to do a nice TV interview, it’s actually about having the immense fighting spirit.'

In recent weeks the party 
has been rocked by groping allegations  - strongly denied by Lord Rennard - that women activists were sexually harassed by the former chief exeuctive.

Mr Farron - who previously appeared to make life difficult for the Deputy Prime Minister by suggesting the party had 'screwed up' - said the Lib Dems 'certainly appear to have let people down' but insisted it was crucial that they did not now go into 'institutional self-defence mode'.

He added: 'I think 99 per cent of the people out there just don't care, it's not been raised. I've done a lot of door knocking both in Eastleigh and in my patch this last week. It was mentioned to me once, and that was in sympathy.'

However, the Lord Ashcroft poll reveals the Lib Dems have a real fight for survival.

While
many left-leaning former Lib Dem voters want the party to be more vocal
in opposing the Tories, such a move would put off more moderate, 
Conservative-leaning voters who might otherwise stay with the party or 
even switch to it.

Lord Ashcroft’s research, based on a poll of more than 20,000 voters, finds that only 29 per cent of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 say they would do so again tomorrow – just 5 per cent of the electorate.

The other 71 per cent say they would vote for another party, or don’t know.

However, nearly a quarter of those who say they would vote Lib Dem in an election tomorrow did not vote for the party in 2010 – indicating the party has picked up significant support since entering government.

The party's reputation for scandal 
has also been bolstered by both the Rennard scandal and the resignation of Cabinet minister Chris 
Huhne, who now faces jail after admitting perverting the course of 
justice over his wife Vicky Pryce taking his speeding points.

Today Sir Menzies Campbell, the 
former Lib Dem leader said: 'Obviously we’d have much preferred that 
neither of these things should have arisen.'

But he told BBC Radio 4: 'Rumours of our death are grossly exaggerated.'

According to the Ashcroft poll, some 
29 per cent of Lib Dem voters in 2010 now say they would vote Labour or 
Green – with many angry that the party joined the Coalition. Another 8 
per cent of 2010 Lib Dem voters would now vote Conservative, with 7 per 
cent backing UKIP.

More than a fifth – 22 per cent – of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 do not know how they would vote tomorrow. Though many have lost confidence in the Lib Dems, they are resistant to Labour and do not know who to trust on the economy.

The Lib Dems’ flagship economic policy – raising the income tax threshold to £10,000 – is backed by an overwhelming 85 per cent of voters, but four in ten think it was a Tory proposal. The most recognisable Lib Dem policy is an amnesty for illegal migrants, which only 25 per cent of voters support and has not been implemented in government.

Lord Ashcroft, who is now a leading pollster, said: ‘After the Eastleigh by-election Lib Dem activists will be relieved to think that despite the polls, strong local government and an invincible leaflet-dropping network will see most of their MPs safely back to Westminster.

‘But that is not the whole story. Localness matters, but a general election decides who walks up Downing Street. Clegg must have something to say about the Liberal Democrats and government.’

Lord Ashcroft warned the Tories would learn the ‘wrong lessons’ from the Eastleigh by-election if they chased the UKIP vote as this would leave moderate and centre-right voters ‘wide open to the Lib Dems’.
