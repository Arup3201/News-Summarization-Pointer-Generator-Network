A 'graveyard of comets' has been found by astronomers in the
asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

And, to the surprise of astronomers, a number of comets in this graveyard have come back to life after being dormant for what could have been thousands or even
millions of years. 

The findings, by a Colombian team, contradict the
long-standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged.

A number of comets in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter have come back to life after being dormant. The findings contradict the long-standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged

Over the past ten years researchers have found 12 active comets in the asteroid belt.

The mystery of the reactivated comets led the Colombian team to investigate their origin.

Their findings suggests that these comets came back to life after moving closer to the sun.

The astronomers believe other inactive comets in the region
may flare up when a stray gravitational force from Jupiter nudges them.

‘Imagine all these asteroids going around the sun for aeons,
with no hint of activity,’ said Professor Ferrin of the University of
Anitoquia, Medellin, Colombia.

The top image shows the conventional model for the asteroid belt. The middle image shows the proposed model, with a small number of active comets. The lower diagram shows how the asteroid belt might have looked in the early solar system

‘We have found that some of these are not dead rocks after
all, but are dormant comets that may yet come back to life.’

Surprisingly, this can happen fairly easily. If nudged by
the gravitational force of Jupiter, the shape of comet orbits can change,
leading to a decrease in the minimum distance between the comet and the sun.

The little extra energy they receive from the sun is then
sufficient to revive them from the graveyard.

‘These objects are the 'Lazarus comets', returning to life
after being dormant for thousands or even millions of years,’ said Professor
Ferrin.

‘Potentially any one of the many thousands of their quiet
neighbours could do the same thing.’

The new work looked at a distinct region of the
solar system, the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter.

This volume of space contains more than 1 million objects
ranging in size from 1 m to 800 km.

Comets are amongst the smallest objects in the solar system,
typically a few km across and composed of a mixture of rock and ice.

If they come close to the sun, then some of the ice turns to
gas, before being swept back by the light of the sun and the solar wind to form
a characteristic tail of gas and dust.

Most observed comets have highly elliptical orbits, meaning
that they only rarely approach the sun.

Some of these so-called long period comets take thousands of
years to complete each orbit around our nearest star.

There is also a population of about 500 short period comets,
created when long period comets pass near Jupiter and are deflected in orbits
that last anything between three and 200 years.

Although uncommon events, comets also collide with the Earth
from time to time and may have helped bring water to our planet.

In June, astronomers in the Netherlands observed, for the first time, what they described as a 'comet factory' around a young star.They noticed how particles around the young star grow by clumping together, solving a long-standing mystery about how dust particles in discs form comets or planets.The ‘dust trap’ was found by Nienke van der Marel, a PhD student at Leiden Observatory using the new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA).‘It’s likely that we are looking at a kind of comet factory because the particles can grow in this dust trap up to cometary sizes of a few kilometres,’ said Marel.

Scientists believe that they have discovered a region of formerly dead comets in the asteroid belt lying between Mars and Jupiter

It is thought that Jupiter's gravitational pull brings dormant comets closer to the sun, which in turn reignites them and brings them 'back to life'
