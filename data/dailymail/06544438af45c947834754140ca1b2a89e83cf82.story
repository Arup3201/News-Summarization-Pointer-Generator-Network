A revitalised Marouane Fellaini owes his eventful Premier League career to a stand-out performance at Anfield – the ground he returns to on Sunday carrying the Champions League hopes of Manchester United on his broad shoulders.

Fellaini was a 20-year-old with Standard Liege when his outstanding display against Steven Gerrard in a 2008 Champions League qualifier persuaded Everton to buy him 19 days later for a club record £15million.

He became a cult hero at Goodison Park for the next five years before signing for Manchester United in 2013. Now in his second season at Old Trafford and used mainly as a striker by Louis van Gaal, he is in the best form of his United career and scored and made an assist in last weekend's 3-0 victory against Tottenham.

Steve Round, assistant-manager to David Moyes at Everton and Manchester United and who worked with Fellaini at both clubs, recounts how it all began.

'Marouane had been on Everton's radar for a while. His ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club didn't have the money to pay big fees on several players,' explains Round.

'David asked me to go and watch him play Liverpool at Anfield and he was very impressive. A lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like Steven Gerrard in his own stadium but Marouane competed and gave as good as he got. He wasn't overawed and you could see he had ability.

'When David asked my opinion, it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time.'

Fellaini became one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in the English game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame.

He became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the Belgian has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to England.

Having worked closely with Fellaini, Round says there is far more to his game than the 27-year-old is given credit for.

'He is technically very good, he may not have the same range of passing as Gerrard but he rarely gives the ball away. And his chest control is as good as anyone I've seen in the game. He can play three positions well; holding midfield, number 10 or up top, where we used him with Tim Cahill in the season we reached the FA Cup final. I think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities.

'Marouane can hold the ball up and bring others into play and I can see why Wayne Rooney enjoyed playing with him, in a similar way that Michael Owen benefitted from Emile Heskey's physical presence for England.'

A protracted transfer from Everton to United was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for £27million after Moyes and Round had been appointed at Old Trafford to begin the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.

'I remember Ryan Giggs warning us that Manchester United can take some getting used to for new signings. He sited the example of Patrice Evra who turned out to be a great player for the club. Ryan said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against Manchester City because it was such a culture shock.

'Marouane is a humorous guy, always able to take fun out of himself. I like him. But I guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at Everton. But that's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful.'

After a nightmare first season in which United finisehd seventh, Moyes was sacked and Round left too. Fellaini stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun. Round is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around.

'I always thought he would show people what he could do at United. It's like Ryan said, it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable. He has always worked hard in training, he doesn't hide when things aren't going well. That has helped him.

'It's hard to say what will happen at United next. The pressure is always on to win matches and you don't know what the manager will do in the summer. But Marouane has shown this season he is an asset to Manchester United.'

And at lunchtime on Sunday, he will hope to show that at Anfield, the ground where it all started for him. The only thing he'd like to change is the result – seven years ago, Liverpool edged Liege 1-0 with an injury-time winner from Dirk Kuyt.
