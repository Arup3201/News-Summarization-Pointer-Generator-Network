Thousands of Los Angeles school children gathered on a local beach to spell out a powerful message from the ocean to the world.

Nearly 4,000 students took part in a clean-up day at Dockweiler State Beach on Thursday, the culmination of a yearlong program to teach children about the environment.

At the end of the 21st annual Kids Ocean Day, the children gathered to spell out ‘Clean me up :)’ in a speech bubble, as if requested by the sea itself.

Powerful message: Nearly 4,000 students took part in the annual clean-up day at Dockweiler State Beach and made up the human speech bubble

The Kids Ocean day event and its 
program have been led by the Malibu Foundation for Environmental 
Education for over two decades.

The
 aim is to connect children with nature in a bid to get them to see the 
results of their actions when littering and to encourage them to reduce 
waste.

‘That is the picture that we present to the kids; that there is an impact to you dropping trash ten miles away,' Michael Klubock, executive director of the foundation told Westsidetoday.com.

'‘It really is about connecting the kids to the beach and ocean, increasing their awareness of the impact of their actions.’

All for one: The Kids Ocean day event and its year-long environmental program have been led by the Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education for 21 years

Children
 from 33 schools in the area gathered to clean the beach and spell out 
the giant speech bubble, which was then photographed from the air.

Mr
 Klubock explained that ten per cent of the children who took part in 
Kids Ocean Day at Dockweiler State Beach had never visited it, despite 
living just a few miles away.

'The big part of the program after their education is getting them down to the beach so they are engaged,' Klubock said.

'It is getting their voice participating in a huge art piece so that their voice is heard.'

The
 project is sponsored by the City of Los Angeles Stormwater Program and 
its Board of Public Works, as well as the California Coastal Commission.
