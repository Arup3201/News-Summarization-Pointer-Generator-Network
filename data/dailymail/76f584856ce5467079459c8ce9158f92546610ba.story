Few people expect Manchester City to go to Barcelona and overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg and reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. But here's 10 good reasons Manuel Pellegrini's men should travel in hope...

1 - CHELSEA PROVED MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN

Chelsea were 2-1 down on aggregate to Barcelona and down to only 10 men in their second leg at the Nou Camp in 2012 – and still went through.

Goals from Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta put Barca in control even before John Terry was sent off. Then, incredibly, Ramires scored on the stroke of half-time and after surviving immense pressure, Fernando Torres scored to book Chelsea's place in the final, which they went on to win.

2 - PELLEGRINI CAN TAP INTO MALAGA

Barcelona lost their last game at the Nou Camp on February 21 to Malaga, the team that Manuel Pellegrini managed between 2010 and 2013.

Pellegrini will be able to get all the inside info on how they did it and also used to work with the winning goalscorer, Juanmi. If Juanmi can slay Barcelona, there's not reason why Sergio Aguero can't follow suit.

3 - NO REASON TO FEAR

City captain Vincent Kompany knows what it feels like to score at the Nou Camp, Joe Hart saved a penalty from Lionel Messi three weeks ago and Yaya Toure won the Champions League with Barca alongside the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique.

While the rest of the world regard Barca's players as demi-gods, City have been up against them before and shown they are human, or played with them.

4 - EL CLASICO AWAITS

Coach Luis Enrique won't be thanking La Liga for the way they've worked out their fixture list because an even bigger match lies in store on Sunday when Barca meet Real Madrid in a potential title decider.

The temptation not to play at 100 per cent against City will be there particularly as they already hold a 2-1 advantage from the first leg. It will be up to Pellegrini's side to take advantage if the Barca players have half an eye on the weekend.

5 - CITY BEST IN ADVERSITY

If there is one thing Manchester City have proved in recent times it's that they should never be written off. They were eight points behind Manchester United with six games to play in 2012 – and won the title. In 2014, they were three points behind Liverpool with three to play, and again came out on top.

Most significantly, they have shown 'bouncebackability' in Europe too. They qualified from the group stages despite taking two points from their opening four matches and trailing 2-1 against Bayern Munich in their fifth match.

6 - PROLIFIC AGUERO

Aguero has scored six goals in six Champions League ties this season, at a ratio of a goal every 76 minutes. If he scores again in the Nou Camp, City will be halfway there to overturning the first-leg deficit.

Pellegrini believes Aguero has the ability to be considered the third-best player in the world behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. A match-winning performance to rank alongside his hat-trick against Bayern earlier in the tournament would go a long way to making that come true.

7 - HISTORY ON THE SIDE OF ENGLISH CLUBS

It's not impossible for English clubs not to be represented in the last eight of the Champions League – but history shows it's very rare. Only once since 1996 have the quarter-finals taken place without a Premier League team.

With Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal gone, all hopes rest on City now. They haven't always been the most popular team since Sheik Mansour's takeover but the club might thrive on the need to restore some national pride.

8 - ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME

Manuel Pellegrini has been criticised for rigidly sticking to 4-4-2 in Europe and being outplayed in midfield, as he was against Barca in the first leg. But when Aguero was injured for the critical final group game away to Roma, he played Edin Dzeko as a lone striker and City comfortably won 2-0.

If Pellegrini repeats the tactics – but with Aguero replacing Dzeko – and City crowd Barca in the middle of the park, there's no reason they shouldn't threaten the Catalans with the talent they've got in the team like David Silva.

9 - MANAGERIAL MIS-MATCH

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is a Champions League novice as a manager – this is his first campaign in the tournament and he's never experienced a knockout second leg.

In contrast Pellegrini has guided Villarreal to the semi-final, Malaga to the quarters and took City the Nou Camp last season where they lost 2-1 with 10 men. The Chilean knows what to expect – Enrique doesn't.

10 - YAYA MOTIVATION

Yaya Toure is available for Manchester City are serving a three-match European ban and couldn't be more motivated.

For all the stealth of Barcelona's midfield with Ivan Rakitic, Busquets and Andres Iniesta, they haven't got the power to live with Toure if he is allowed to run at them. The Ivory Coast international has proved he's a big-match player – remember his incredible goal at Wembley in last season's Capital One Cup final – and this could be his defining match in a City shirt.
