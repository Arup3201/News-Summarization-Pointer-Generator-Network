Clear message: Backpacks emblazoned with 'FR Strong' have been sent to students at Franklin Regional High School, near Pittsburgh

Thoughtful: The car dealership that distributed the backpacks described them as a small gesture

Injured: Victim Brett Hurt, center, who suffered a bruised lung in the attack, was on the verge of tears as he used a wheelchair to navigate the hallways

Back: Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville re-opened to students on April 15 for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes

The car dealership described the backpacks as a small gesture, according to CBS Pittsburg.

The horrific attack at the school on April 9 left 20 students and a security guard stabbed or slashed.

One student almost died after one of the knives narrowly missed his heart. Two of the wounded students remain hospitalized.

Suspect
 Alex Hribal, 16, is being held in a juvenile facility but is charged as
 an adult with aggravated assault and attempted homicide.

Police have said he took the knives and attacked students at random as they arrived at school.

Classes resumed on April 16 with some students 
gathering beforehand on the football field to pray and to support one 
another.

After that, as day 
broke and other students drove to school - or were driven on buses or by
 their parents - they were greeted by well-wishers from a nearby church 
who were holding signs of support saying things like ‘Courage’ and ‘It's
 a new day’.

Warning signs: Suspect Alex Hribal, 16, is led from his arraignment after he was charged with four counts of attempted murder as an adult. Authorities believe he threatened two students before carrying out the attack on April 16

No motive has yet been provided by authorities in the April 6 attack that allegedly saw Hribal run through the school wielding two eight-inch kitchen knives

Terror: Twenty one students were injured in April 16's blood bath, as well as a security guard. The two students Hribald allegedly threatened were not injured

Evacuation: Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing.

Karen Ingersoll said she has two children who graduated from the school and two daughters still attend it.

‘I think they were ready to go back,’ Ms Ingersoll said at the time, though she acknowledged there's more healing to come.

‘My
 youngest can't sleep alone yet, she's still sleeping with her sister - 
she was a witness to some of the attacks’, she said.

On April 14, teachers met with a crisis intervention specialist 
before spending the day at the school before the students returned.

The following
 day parents and students were invited to an open house where 
they were able to tour the building, which had to be cleaned after the 
bloody attack. Members of the community gathered at a park on the 
Tuesday night for a prayer service.

Students
 at the middle and elementary schools, which share a campus with the 
high school, returned to classes a day after the attack.

Some returning students were nervous about reliving the frantic experience.

Michael Spila, who was stabbed in the back, said he was concerned he might have flashbacks.

'Mentally, I'm still shocked from what happened,' he told WPXI.

'I
 was kind of nervous because I was afraid I might start freaking out or 
something because you don't know what would happen if you walked in and 
had flashbacks. And luckily nothing happened.'

Gracey
 Evans, watched in horror as Hribal allegedly plunged a knife into the 
back of her friend Brett Hurt while he bravely shielded her during the 
stabbing spree.

'It was 
different — but a good different,' the 17-year-old junior told NBC News 
of returning to the scene of the attack.

Ms Evans
 and friends gathered around Mr Hurt and linked arms for a photograph. The 
students waited for the 16-year-old, who suffered a bruised lung in the 
attack, to arrive so they could go in together, showing him their 
support.

Evans said Mr Hurt was on the verge of tears and had to use a wheelchair to navigate the halls.

The students spoke with several teachers who were there when the early morning stabbing unfolded.

They told the teens they were sorry about what happened and provided tissues and candles in all classrooms.

'It's hard for them,' Ms Evans said of the teachers, 'but harder for us.'

Counselors and therapy dogs were on campus to help students through the day.

Hribal is revealed to have written a note saying he couldn't wait to 
see the 'helpless looks' on students' faces when they realise 'their 
precious lives are going to be taken' and that he fought off students 
who tried to stop him.

'No, I
 am not dropping them (knives), my work is not done I have more people 
to kill,' Hribal was overheard saying by Vice Principal Samuel King, 
according to an affidavit.

Police
 say the note was found in Hribal's locker. They say it was dated 
April 6, three days before the rampage at the school near Pittsburgh.

Details
 about the note are contained in the criminal complaint filed against 
Hribal that increases the number of attempted homicide charges he faces 
to 21, up from four.

'I 
can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the 
students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realise their 
precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that is a
 plebeian,' the note said.

Investigators
 also confirmed they believe Hribal was targeting specific students and
 even called one the night before the stabbing spree and said he would 
'f**k them up.'

No motive 
has yet been provided by authorities in the April 6 attack that 
reportedly saw Hribal run through the school wielding two eight-inch 
kitchen knives.

The boy's family is just as puzzled as police about what triggered the attack, Hribal's attorney Patrick Thomassey has said. No evidence has surfaced that he was being bullied.

Hribal's trial starts on June 4.
