Police have confirmed that the body found in a national park yesterday is that of missing Chief Inspector Tim Frohwein who disappeared last weekend after setting off on a hill walk.

Derbyshire Police said the body discovered on moorland in the Goyt Valley in the Peak District National Park was that of their colleague.

The 48-year-old father had been missing since setting out for a walk from his home in Buxton, and was last seen at about 2pm on Sunday, November 17.

Officers, supported by local Mountain Rescue volunteers, had been searching for Mr Frohwein since he was first reported missing from his home.

His body was found by a friend, who had joined the widespread search for the police officer.

In a statement, Derbyshire Police said: 'We would like to recognise the efforts of the immediate members of Tim's family, particularly his sons who organised and co-ordinated searches.

'They organised family and friends to search parts of the Goyt Valley that had not yet been formally searched by Derbyshire Police and mountain rescue teams as part of the structured search process.

'Tim was found by friends of the family who had volunteered to help search for him.

'They found him on the Grouse Moor and the two men immediately notified officers who were nearby.

'Derbyshire Constabulary would like to offer sincere condolences to his family.'

Mr Frohwein was based at Chesterfield, looking after Amber Valley and Chesterfield, and was previously head of road policing.

Colleagues became increasingly concerned for the well-being of Mr Frohwein, who had recently undergone knee surgery, describing his disappearance as 'totally out of character'.

Police do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

Last week, as mountain rescue teams were stood down from their search in the rugged hills near Mr Frohwein's home, his younger son Joel, who will be 19 tomorrow, wrote on Twitter that he wished he could turn the clock back to before his father went missing.

Joel Frohwein wrote: 'The things I would do to take time back to Saturday.'

A spokesman for Derby Mountain Rescue team said rescue workers had worked from 4pm on Sunday looking for the missing policeman.

Kevin Corcoran said: 'Five mountain 
rescue teams joined forces with four search dogs and one specialist 
trailing dog from Wales to look for Mr Frohwein in the rugged terrain 
that is very close to the town of Buxton.

'We searched hills and woodland but did not find him and so were stood down on Monday evening.'

Mr Frohwein joined the police force in 1987 aged 22 and worked for 
the Kent, Cheshire and Derbyshire police forces in roles as uniform, 
sergeant and inspector.

He was also a trained hostage negotiator, and spent five years working as 
international development director for MxM, an NGO with offices in the 
US, UK, Cyprus and the Middle East.

Mr Frohwein, who studied physical education and economic geography at 
University College, Chester after attending Kingham Hill boarding school
in Oxfordshire, was married to Susan, 54, and has sons Christian, 21, and Joel, 19.
