Ask any Welshman and they will tell you theirs is a fiercely proud country with a rich cultural heritage.

But it seems that BT call centre staff may not have got the message, after a 'proud Welshwoman' called her local office only to be told by a call handler in India: 'Wales? - never heard of it.'

Eve Butler, 76, had called the communications giant with a query about her bill and asked to be put through to the company's Welsh Language Bureau two miles from her home.

Instead Mrs Butler, from Bangor, North Wales, was put through to a call centre 5,500 miles away in India only to be asked by a call centre advisor: 'What's Welsh?'

Then, when the grandmother tried to explain it was the language spoken by herself and around 300,000 other people in Wales, the advisor said: 'I can't put you through because I don't know what Wales is.'

The call ended shortly afterwards.

Mrs Butler, a retired council worker, said: 'I just find it incredible that I live in Wales and want to be put through to a Welsh speaking service - yet I'm put thought to someone employed thousands of miles away in India who's never even heard of my home country - or the language.

'I speak fluent Welsh, I'm very proud to be Welsh and I'm very proud of Wales along with many hundreds of thousands of people who speak the language.

'Yet I find it unbelievable British Telecom workers not only don't have a clue where Wales they don't know what it is.'

The incident occured after Mrs Butler called BT to set up a direct debit to pay her phone bill after she accidentally missed a payment.

The firm's Welsh Language Bureau allows customers to BT in their native Welsh but an operator who initally fielded the call said she had not heard of it and promised another advisor would ring Mrs Butler back

A BT spokesman said it would like to apologise to Mrs Butler if the 'level of service she experienced fell below her expectations'

The firm's Welsh Language Bureau allows customers to speak to BT in their native Welsh but an operator who initially fielded the call said she had not heard of it and promised another advisor would ring Mrs Butler back.

Mrs Butler said: 'This isn't what I wanted at all. I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh. BT offer a Welsh service and I wanted to make use of it.

'It was so odd. I had rung through and asked for a Welsh speaker but without success. I was called back and I asked if the caller was from the Welsh Language Bureau.

'He then said: "What's Welsh?" and I replied: "It's the language spoken in Wales."

'He then said: "Where's Wales?" So I told him it was a proud country in the UK with its own history and culture.

Mrs Butler said she is passionate about promoting and preserving the Welsh language, and added 'I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh'

'He then told me he couldn't put the call through because he didn't know what Wales was. It was unbelievable. I found it so frustrating but so funny at the same time.

'He told me he was talking to me from India. I live so close to the BT call centre in Bangor. All I wanted to do was speak to someone in my native language. Instead I was told that there was no such place as Wales.'

Mrs Butler married an Englishman but her two daughters and two granddaughters all speak Welsh.

She said that she is passionate about promoting and preserving the Welsh language, and added 'I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh.

'The Welsh language service is important in many aspects. It provides an important service for the Welsh people but if no one uses it, perhaps because they don't know its there, or if advisors elsewhere don't know of it, then it would not be unreasonable for BT to conclude it isn't needed and close it down.

'That would have serious consequences for both the language and the people who work for the service.'

A BT spokesman said: 'BT would like to apologise to Mrs Butler if our level of service fell below her expectations. She should have been advised of the correct number for the Welsh language Bureau in Bangor and we are sorry this didn't happen on this occasion.

'The Bureau is open Monday to Saturday from 8am to 6pm and can be contacted on 0800 800 288. The bureau can handle many customer issues including billing, faults, new product orders and rental packages.

'The bureau has now been in touch with Mrs Butler and has resolved the issue she had.'

Last year a report by the Welsh Language Board said the number of fluent Welsh speakers is falling by around 3,000 people a year.

It said around 6,500 Welsh speakers die annually and 5,200 move away from Wales - out-pacing adult learners and children learning or raised in Welsh.

In 2011,Â  BT was forced to apologise to Viv Tomkins after they claimed Indian call centre staff could not understand her Birmingham accent.

The 59 year old had been told via letter that call centre staff had 'difficulty in resolving your inquiries whenever the advisers you have been speaking to are having problems understanding you.'
