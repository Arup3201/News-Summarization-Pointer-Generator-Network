The White House has announced that the President and First Lady will be traveling to South Africa next week to pay respects to Nelson Mandela.

Mr Obama and his wife Michelle will be attending memorial events for the fallen South African leader but the specific details of when they will arrive or what events they will be attending have not been disclosed.

The South African government announced that the formal state funeral will take place on December 15, capping off a 10-day mourning period.

The Obamas are just two of a long list of international dignitaries who are expected to attend the memorial services.

Emotional: President Obama was one of the first heads of state to pay tribute to the fallen leader and now the White House confirmed that he and Michelle would be traveling to South Africa for the memorial

Paying respects: Mr Obama ordered the flags of government buildings, including the White House pictured here Friday, to half mast through Monday

Last visit: Though the Obamas were in South Africa this summer, Mandela was too ill for visitors so the last time Michelle met the man was in June 2011 when she went to Africa with her daughters and without Barack

On Friday afternoon, former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura announced that they will be traveling to South Africa for the memorial.

Former President Clinton, who was in office at the same time as Mandela, was very close to the leader and is going to the memorial alongside his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary. 

'One of the things that sometimes gets lost... is that he was a very very good president. I think he was an extremely effective president of South Africa,' Mr Clinton said in an interview with CNN on Friday evening.

'He managed to be an inclusive figure while still managing to take a stand.'

Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that he will be attending the funeral and Prince Charles is expected to join him.

Connection: Obama only met Mandela once in person but did write a forward to his book

Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service.

Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town, is the clear frontrunner for leading the service.

Mourners have gathered to dance and sing songs of freedom outside his home as the world celebrates the life of the adored statesman who brought peace and equality to his country and died last night aged 95.

He passed away at home in Johannesburg at 8.50pm Thursday and his body was moved to a military hospital in Pretoria Friday morning, where he is under armed guard.

South African president Jacob Zuma announced Friday afternoon that Mandela’s state funeral will be held in Qunu, the village where he grew up, and will cap 10 days of national mourning.

The first major event will be on December 10, where a memorial service will be held at the Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup final, and holds 94,000 people.

Between December 11 and December 13 his embalmed body will lie in state in a glass-fronted coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria , where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994.

On day nine, plans have been made for a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the South African province of Eastern Cape.

His casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, his home village.

In honour: Following the announcement of the death of Mandela, former President Bill Clinton, who is set to attend the state funeral, tweeted this 2007 picture captioned: 'I will never forget my friend Madiba'

Joining: Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, eho met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa  

Later ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil.

On the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people- including world leaders- will gather for the state funeral.

Preparations for funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill.

The
sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure
to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which
will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn 
event.

According to several
sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion 
will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan,
the Thembu.

At some stage 
during days one to four, Thembu elders are expected to gather for a 
first ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in
the mortuary.

Representing Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, seen with Mandela at a photo shoot for his 90th birthday in London, will pay their respects

Long history: Prince Charles, seen here with Mandela during a visit to London in 1996, is expected to accompany Mr Cameron for the memorial service

Lighter note: The two saw one another in Amsterdam in 2002 as well during the Dutch Royal wedding of Queen Beatrix's eldest son

After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria.

No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup.

It is not clear whether Mandela's casket will be taken there. 

On days six to eight, December 11 to 13, the anti-apartheid hero's body is earmarked to lie in state in a glass-topped coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994.

On day nine, plans have been made for
a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the 
South African province of Eastern Cape.

His
casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, 
his home village, where the former leader spent his childhood years.

To
mark the formal passing of responsibility to his family, the South 
African flag that is expected to drape his coffin will be replaced by a 
traditional Xhosa blanket.

Later, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil.

On
the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of 
his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people, including heads of 
state will gather for the state funeral.

Mr Mandela often spoke with great love of his first home where his family members, including his children who predeceased him, rest.

The family plot is located just a few yards from the home he shared with his mother as a child and the one which he built following his release from Victor Verster Prison.

He loved Qunu 'in the unconditional way a child loves his first home' and spent holidays and special occasions here.

Star-studded event: The memorial service is expected to draw many celebrities who had a personal relationship with Mandela, including Oprah Winfrey pictured here in 2002

Friends: U2 front man Bono, with Mandela at his Johannesburg home in 2002, is thought to have been invited

The protocol for the funeral 
preparations was drawn up more than a year ago, around the time when Mr 
Mandela's health took a turn for the worse, and it may be altered in the
coming days.

Mourners 
will be able to share their thoughts about Mandela’s passing in 
condolence books that will be made available in all foreign missions, 
the Nelson Mandela Foundation headquarters and other institutions, 
according to The Guardian, which has obtained a copy of the protocol. 

It
has also been reported that the South African Government is in talks 
with the BBC team that filmed the Royal Wedding in 2011 to get help with
the world wide broadcast of the funeral of a global icon.

Guests at the funeral will include Mr Obama, the first lady and their daughters. Bill and Hillary Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well, are also expected to make an appearance.

The scale and significance of the planned funeral is already being compared to the 2005 service for Pope John Paul II, which was attended by 2million people, among them five kings and 70 presidents.

Days one to four (Today to December 9): According to sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu.

'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in the mortuary.
