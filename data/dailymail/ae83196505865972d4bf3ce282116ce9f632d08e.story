A 19th-century cannonball discovered in the chimney of a family home caused a commotion in Georgetown, Washington D.C. when the military had to be called in after fears it could still explode.

Having lived in their house in the historic neighborhood of the nation's capital for 18 years, the Norregaard family decided that the time had come to have their chimney and fireplace cleaned out professionally.

Until then they had only lit candles in the hearth rather than used logs.

For 18 years the Norregaard family had only lit candles in their fireplace, but when they decided to have it professionally cleaned to burn wood the cleaning crew discovered a 19th-century cannonball in the chimney

To their surprise the cleaning crew discovered a cannonball dating from the Civil War-era.

The cannonball became an object of fascination for the Norregaard family. The children showed their friends, and Mr Norregaard used it as a paperweight

Homeowner Rula Norregaard found the cleaning crew holding the cannonball and was thrilled.

The family treated the heavy piece of lead as an object of fascination and it became a talking point, with the children showing it off to their friends and Rula's husband even keeping it on his desk as a paperweight.

It was only at their Christmas party that a physicist friend pointed out that it could still be active and suggested that they call the authorities.

On Wednesday after the family had returned from vacation, Norregaard did just that, dialing 311 instead of 911.

The 311 operators thought the situation could be very dangerous and soon the police, fire department and bomb squad were at the Georgetown house.

The bomb squad had never dealt with a cannonball before and so called in the military.

Soldiers from the 55th Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Company responded to the unexploded ordnance, and they ordered an evacuation of the block on Wednesday afternoon.

As the bomb squad had never dealt with a cannonball before, the military had to be called in. Their first command was to evacuate the block before they could remove the potentially dangerous explosive device

There was much commotion in the neighborhood and a @gtowncannonball twitter handle was generated.

'It was a Civil War cannon ball,' said Staff Sgt. Dewon Crumpton, the team leader who retrieved the cannon ball from the townhouse.

An Iraq War veteran from Ocala, Florida, Crumpton and his team took the cannon ball to Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. 

Analysis confirmed that the cannonball still had gunpowder inside it and was therefore still live. The army had no choice but to carry out a controlled detonation and destroy it.

The Norregaard family were disappointed, having hoped that it might be deemed safe and returned to them to display in the house, which had once been a girls' school.

The mystery remains as to how it got to be in the chimney in the first place.

Crumpton said the cannon ball was not the most unusual unexploded ordnance call he had received. He previously rendered safe two artillery rounds that were found in a garage in Virginia.

Having found that the Civil War-era cannonball was still live, the 55th EOD Company had no choice but to destroy it. EOD soldiers conducted more than 2,000 such operations around the nation in 2014

The Fort Belvoir, Virginia-based 55th EOD Company is part of the 192nd EOD Battalion, 52nd EOD Group, 20th CBRNE Command (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives), the U.S. Defense Department's only formation that combats chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats around the world. 

Command Sgt. Maj. Harold E. Dunn IV, the senior enlisted leader of the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland-based 20th CBRNE Command, said Army EOD technicians regularly respond to unexploded ordnance calls.

In 2014, EOD Soldiers conducted more than 2,000 explosive mitigation missions around the nation, both on and off military installations.

A seasoned EOD leader from Fredericksburg, Virginia, Dunn said unexploded ordnance (UXO) can be found anywhere.

'You name it,' said Dunn. 'Mantles in homes, basements, scrap yards, trash cans, dumps, offices, garages and on desks.'

'If you find UXO, stay away from it and notify your local authorities,' said Dunn.
