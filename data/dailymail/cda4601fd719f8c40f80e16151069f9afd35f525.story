Sprinkled with flowers and bearing the signs of a violent end, the carcasses of two elephants lie amid the long grass, where they fell after a savage brawl.

Around them stand mourning forestry workers, who had raised the antagonists since they were calves at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, north-east India.

A vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, Kaziranga is a world heritage site and hosts an incredibly wealth of biodiversity.

Brawl: Ron, the female, who killed Gautam, here lies dead. Her trunk is severed and her tail missing

But most visitors come to see the elephants, with huge numbers successful breeding in the hundred-year-old game reserve nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas.

The duelling pair - called Gautam and Ron, a male and female respectively - inflicted mortal wounds on each other in a ferocious clash.

Pictures show Ron's trunk completely severed and a deep gouge where her tail should begin.

Gautam's injuries are less apparent, but they were nevertheless evidently severe enough to seal his fate, too.

Fighting is common among male elephants, but rarely serious. Fights between a male and a female, such as this, are very rare - particularly ones with such a tragic outcome.

However elephants have been known to be aggressive towards humans. In India, male elephants sometimes enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people.

Such attacks have often occurred after elephant culls, a factor that, combined with the animals' remarkable intelligence and self-awareness, has led some to interpret them as vindictive.
