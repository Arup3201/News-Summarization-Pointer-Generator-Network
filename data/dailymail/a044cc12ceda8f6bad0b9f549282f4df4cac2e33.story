A 63-year-old grandmother has told how going to give blood at her local healthcentre saved her life.

Jan Grasham, who lives in the New Forest, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after discovering that she was anaemic when she went to donate blood.

Ms Grasham had no other symptoms and strongly believes that the routine trip saved her life.

Jan Grasham (centre, at the 2010 Race for Life) was diagnosed with bowel cancer after she went to give blood. While donating blood she learned that she was anaemic and was referred to her GP

She told MailOnline: ‘Giving blood turned out to be like an MOT. If I hadn’t gone I might not be here now. I am so thankful I went.’

She added: 'I feel so lucky that giving blood was something that I did regularly.

'I think it would have been quite a while before it was picked up otherwise as I didn't get have any symptoms that would have sent me to the doctor.'

Ms Grasham went to give her 57th blood donation in August 2007 and was told that she was not eligible as her blood iron levels were too low.

She said that initially she was not concerned about her health when nurses told her she was anaemic because she had suffered several episodes in the past.

Ms Grasham (pictured with her  granddaughter, Mia) underwent surgery and chemotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. She believes that giving blood saved her life as she had no symptoms of the cancer

However, the nurses told her that her iron levels were sufficiently low that she should see her GP.

Ms Grasham said: ‘I went to give blood – I was a regular donor and was going to give my 57th pint.

‘I had the pinprick test and it showed up a problem. They sent it away for further tests, but I was not allowed to give blood that day, so I was a bit miffed. I had never been turned away before.’

Her doctor carried out extensive tests and within two months she had been diagnosed with bowel cancer.

She said: 'When I saw the consultant it was quite a shock. My first concern was how I would tell my children.

'It was all a bit surreal.'

Bowel cancer can cause anaemia 
because it can result in bleeding into the bowel which depletes the 
body’s supply of red blood cells.

Other
 symptoms of bowel cancer include blood in the stools, abdominal pain, a
 change in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss.

Ms Grasham underwent surgery and chemotherapy at Southampton General Hospital.

Following the six months treatment she was told that there were no longer any signs of the cancer in her bowel.

Just as Ms Grasham began chemotherapy, her son, 29-year-old Jonathan Grasham (pictured with his daughter, Bella), a Royal Marine Commando, was sent on his second six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan

However,
 Ms Grasham says that it was a hard time as just as she began 
chemotherapy her son, 29-year-old Jonathan Grasham, a Royal Marine 
Commando, was sent on his second six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Ms Grasham said: ‘It was a very hard time for the family, but thankfully he returned home safely.

‘I did not realise how debilitated I had felt until after I had finished the chemo.’

In 2009, just as Ms Grasham thought that everything was returning to normal, her daughter Lucy Coggin, 40, collapsed.

Ms Coggin, who also lives in the New Forest, collapsed after finishing a workout and found that she was unable to speak.

She was rushed to hospital whether she underwent four months of treatment and rehabilitation.

Between Ms Grasham's cancer diagnoses, her daughter Lucy Coggin (pictured with her children, Mia and Lauren) collapsed and was diagnosed with MS. She now has no feeling in the right side of her body

After
 months of tests, the mother of two young children was diagnosed with 
multiple sclerosis – a disease which affects the nerves in the brain and
 spine.

Ms Grasham said: ‘Normally MS comes on gradually so people initially thought that she was just very stressed.

‘She had to learn to speak again and it was very strange because at first she had a Polish accent.

‘She still has no feeling in her right hand side but she can get about using a mobility scooter.’

However, this was still not the end of the family’s difficulties.

Four years after her initial cancer diagnosis, a routine scan picked up a tumour in Ms Grasham’s kidney.

Ms Grasham said: ‘It was another primary tumour so it was a bit like lightening striking twice in the same place.’

This time the tumour was contained within her kidney, so she had surgery but did not require any more chemotherapy.

Ms Grasham has now been signed off by the bowel clinic but still has to have annual scans to check for kidney tumours.

She said that she is now very hopeful about the future.

She told MailOnline: ‘It’s all a bit surreal. Until you talk about it you don’t realise what has happened in such a short amount of time.’

Mrs Grasham is not the only person to have benefited from giving blood.

Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has shown that donating blood reduces a person's risk of heart attacks, and of cancer.

Research carried out by the University of California, in San Diego, also revealed that giving blood burns 650 calories per pint.

It is believed that these benefits all arise from the fact that giving blood temporarily reduces a person's blood iron levels.

Iron affects how thick and sticky the blood is. High iron levels cause the blood to be thicker.

Raised iron levels also accelerate the oxidisation process of cholesterol.

This can affect blood consistency and create increased friction as it travels through blood vessels.

As this increases wear and tear to the lining of arteries it could then contribute to cardiovascular disease.

Because donating blood removes some of its iron content, it may have a protective benefit if done on a consistent basis.  

A study published in the Journal of the National cancer Institute also links iron to an increased cancer risk as it’s believed to increase free-radical damage in the body.

In line with this theory, a four-and-a-half-year study involving 1,200 people found those who made bi-annual blood donations had a lower incidence of cancer and mortality than those who didn’t.

However, these benefits depend on making donations on a regular basis.
