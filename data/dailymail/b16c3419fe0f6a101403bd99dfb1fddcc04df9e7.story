They may have split a year ago, but Prince Harry turned out to support his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas  for the opening night of her latest acting venture.

The fourth-in-line to the throne was spotted in the audience last night for Cressida's return to the stage as female lead Cecily Cardew in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest.

He made a low-key entrance but was seen laughing throughout the comedy of manners at the London Oratory, a Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg's son as a pupil.

Cressida, 26, whose acting career has blossomed since she split from Harry last year, charmed the audience with her portrayal of the excitable and eccentric lead character.

Wearing a flowing white dress and with her long hair in ringlets, her background as a dancer shone through as she gracefully bounded across the stage with infectious energy.

In her tongue-in-cheek profile for the programme she was described as an 'actor, dancer and sky-diving enthusiast who was raised on a marsh by wolves'.

It said: 'Accordingly, she has a vast litter of her own cubs which you may spot romping around the theatre later this evening (do not be alarmed, they're both very friendly and very stupid).

His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate with her career

'However, Cressida herself is a very clever little wolf, leaving audiences howling with laughter in her London stage debut earlier this year (Tallulah Brown's There's a Monster in the Lake).' 

The three-night production is being put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, which boasts Kate Middleton as a patron.

Prince Harry, 30, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved jumper, did not make any attempt to remain incognito as he sat in the circle with a male friend.

He was seen in hysterics at Harry Wright's portrayal of the indomitable Lady Bracknell and Harry Elgood's sophisticated depiction of lead character John Worthing.

This comes days after the revelation that Prince Harry is planning to leave the Army to continue his mother's legacy with a number of charitable projects during his second 'gap year'.

Speaking  about his choice to bring his active military career to an end, he said it was a 'really tough' decision and he was looking forward to starting a new chapter in his life.

Earlier today he joined Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the memorial service of triple Olympic gold equestrian Richard Meade.

In a statement on his website, Prince Harry said: '[Richard] had huge successes in his career as a competitor but his greatest success was not in his achievements on a horse, but in the way he conducted himself – with generosity to others, genuine interest and a real sense of integrity, always standing up for what was morally right.

'He cared deeply about the sport and gave so much to both the eventing and wider horse world. Thank you for all the wonderfully supportive letters and messages and many apologies for only answering a small number of them so far.' 

His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate on her career.

She graduated from the Laban school of dance and made her theatrical debut  in 2014 at Hay Festival in the play There's a Monster in the Lake.

The budding actress has now bagged a bit part in Tulip Fever, the forthcoming Judi Dench movie produced by Harvey Weinstein, who declared her 'a fantastic actress'. 

She also recently  appeared in a sexy dance video for British designer Mulberry.
