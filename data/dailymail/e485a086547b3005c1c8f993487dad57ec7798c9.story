A bright, articulate A-level student jumped to her death after battling an anxiety disorder which her mother fears was triggered by years of bullying.

An inquest heard Lauren Johnson, who wanted to be a clinical psychologist or a vet, masked her symptoms for three years before taking her own life in June in Accrington, Lancashire.

Her mother Dawn said her daughter was 'systematically and horrendously abused' by bullies since the age of 14, but bottled up the devastating emotional consequences.

Tragedy: Lauren Johnson, 17, battled an anxiety disorder for three years before taking her own life

Speaking after the inquest Lauren's mother, who has worked as a mental health nurse for 20 years, said: 'The bullying was a significant factor in Lauren's mental illness - prior to that she had a normal childhood normal upbringing.

'The experts said she was systematically and horrendously abused by bullying but she internalised it. In my view, without the bullying she would not have developed mental health issues and she would not have died.

'The therapist said the bullying was systematic but we could never get to the bottom of it. There was no report from school because they didn't know anything about her troubles because she just absorbed it and took it on the chin rather fire back at anyone.

'She maybe took that torment on herself until the point came when she became really unwell with it. The bullying had stopped by that time but the damage was already done. We tried to talk to her about what happened but it was too painful for her.'

The inquest yesterday heard Lauren, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, began displaying mental health issues in 2011 which were first put down to 'social anxiety'.

Bright: The teenager wanted to go to university and dreamed of being a psychologist or vet

She was later diagnosed with a psychosis-like personality disorder, and eventually told her mother Dawn about her bullying ordeal.

Doctors prescribed medication but the teenager 'didn't want to be reminded that she was unwell', the inquest heard, and developed insecurities about being admitted to a psychiatric unit.

She self-harmed, including on one occasion in a public toilet, and police were called out when she was found standing near railway bridges and viaducts.

Last June Lauren was due to be interviewed as a volunteer on the mental health and children's wards at Burnley General Hospital ahead of applying to university.

Her mother's final words to her were to wish her good luck. 

But instead of attending the hospital, she walked to a car park in nearby Accrington.

PC Graham Walsh spent half an hour trying to talk Lauren down, but she jumped from a ledge. He said: 'She wouldn't let me come to her. It was impossible to try and grab her.'

The teenager, who was studying maths, chemistry, biology and psychology A-levels at Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School, suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at Royal Blackburn Hospital.

A suicide note was found on her laptop.

The inquest heard Lauren had been seen by several psychologists and had been to hospital many times.

Dr Adam Joiner said he saw Lauren six days before she died, adding: 'She was wearing make up and fashionable clothing, and seemed happy.

'She seemed interested in the reform of her diagnosis and we discussed how treatment and recovery were possible.

'She explained she did not enjoy her recent hospital admission in an adult ward and her intention to avoid further admissions.'

But Lauren's mental health worker Carla Nightingale said: 'Lauren had the intelligence to be able to work out what people wanted her to say and project that image.'

Lauren's mother told the inquest: 'I always had a gut feeling that one day she wouldn't be with us. 

'I've waited for that phonecall or knock on the door. I kind of saw it that if she did not get the help she needed, one day that would be inevitable.

Coroner Michael Singleton told the inquest at Accrington Town Hall (pictured): 'Lauren was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady, a young lady who had a personality disorder'

'It is very difficult to cure a mental health problem and Lauren kept a lot to herself and tried to manage it very much herself. Because she tried to manage it herself, she ended up in crisis a lot of time when she wanted to kill herself. Sometimes she lacked insight into how low her mood was.' 

'Lauren was good at masking things and would try and mask her symptoms so people would think she was okay. I did air my concerns and said I found it hard to judge that risk.

'It was really inconsistent. Her behaviour had become erratic. She would try and mask it and put make-up on and present as very cheery.'

Lauren's death has already prompted the launch of a charity in her memory, Lauren's Place, to help young people with mental health issues.

It also prompted a petition and protest march supported by thousands calling for action to make the site where Lauren died 'safe or knock it down'. 

Coroner Michael Singleton told the inquest at Accrington Town Hall: 'Lauren was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady, a young lady who had a personality disorder which seemed to have various diagnosis at various times.

'Clearly Lauren's mother, working in mental health had some insight into problems and appropriate help was sought at an early stage.

'It seems to me that the nature of Lauren's mental health and her intelligence and insight into it always meant it was always going to be a very difficult situation to manage.'

He recorded a verdict of suicide.
