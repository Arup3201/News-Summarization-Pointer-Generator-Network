Experts have called for sugar-laden fizzy drinks to carry warning labels similar to those found on cigarette packets, in a bid to combat the adverse health effects.

New York assemblyman Karim Camara has introduced a bill that will require health warning labels on certain drinks with added sugar.

It comes after the World Health Organisation recommended slashing a person's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day. 

A regular can of Coke contains 35g of sugar, so that alone would exceed this limit.

The size of the warning, said Mr Camara, should be dictated by the size of the drink.

'We can't sit back and pretend that sugary drinks aren't harmful to people,' he said.

'We have a public health crisis, which is a direct result of people consuming too much sugar.

'The research is clear: too much sugar leads to health problems such as obesity and diabetes.

'As a society, we have a moral obligation to educate people so they can make healthier choices.'

The Brooklyn democrat said the labels should read: 'SAFETY WARNING: DRINKING BEVERAGES WITH ADDED SUGAR CONTRIBUTES TO OBESITY, DIABETES AND TOOTH DECAY.'

Mr Camara was joined on the steps of City Hall by representatives from the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Past research has found sugary drinks are a primary contributor to type 2 diabetes, especially in children. 

In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 40 per cent of children born between 2000 and 2011 would develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime.

Experts at the CDC estimate 35 per cent of Americans are obese, and 69 per cent are overweight.

Obesity is known to cause other serious illnesses, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. 

Mr Camara said the aim of introducing warning labels on drinks is to educate the public, and lower the consumption of the drinks.

He likened their goal to that of health campaigners who fought to include warning labels on cigarette packages.

'This is about pragmatic legislation,' he said. 'This is not about an attack on an industry for the sake of the industry.

'This is about doing what's best for children and adults in our society.

'We cannot afford for our children to continue to be overweight, to continue to have learning problems, to have health problems that may lead to difficult lives and at times illnesses that can lead to the loss of life.' 

Mr Camara urged the beverage industry to support the bill after they spent $13million in New York State in 2010 to oppose a proposed penny-per-ounce sugary drink tax, arguing that education is what was really needed.

Assemblyman Jeffrery Dinowitz, consumer affairs and protection chair, said: 'Studies have established a direct link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other major health problems in New York and across the United States, which cause thousands of deaths and cost billions of dollars in health care spending annually.

'We must do everything we can to make the public aware of the serious risks incurred by the over-consumption of sugar. 

'Many years ago, when faced with a similarly devastating public health crisis, we chose to place warning labels on cigarettes and other tobacco products to allow citizens to make more informed choices about what they purchase. 

'Given the scientific evidence of sugar's negative consequences for our society, is not only appropriate, but incumbent, upon us to use similar warning labels with sugar-sweetened beverages.'

Nutrition policy consultant said warning labels are a 'smart way to educate consumers about the negative health impacts' of their favourite fizzy drinks.

She said: 'Right now, the beverage industry bombards our kids with its own messages encouraging constant consumption.

'In 2010, for example, preschoolers viewed an average of 213 ads for sugary drinks and energy drinks, while children and teens watched an average of 277 and 406 ads, respectively.' 

Stephen Habbe, from the American Diabetes Association, said the type 2 epidemic in the U.S. has been 'in part, fuelled by the increased consumption of calorie-dense sugar-sweetened beverages'.

He said nearly 30 million children and adults in the U.S. have diabetes, with more than 1.3million in New York diagnosed with the condition.

The bill comes after the World Health Organisation recently recommended slashing a person's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day

Another 86 million Americans have pre-diabetes, putting them at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

Mr Habbe said: 'Diabetes kills tens of thousands of Americans every year and results in disabling complications for thousands of others. 

Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six.

The guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco.

The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year.

The WHO said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies.

However, low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative.

WHO also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons.

Instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for.

'The American Diabetes Association supports reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages through public information, education, and health policy, and applauds Assemblyman Camara for his interest in warning labels for sugar-sweetened beverages.'

And the American Heart Association echoed Mr Habbe's backing of the bill.

Robin Vitale said: 'There is no doubt that consumption of sugary drinks has increased dramatically in recent decades. 

'It is important for our government leaders to work with the public health community to identify, test and implement effective evidence-based strategies to help reverse this dangerous trend. 

'The American Heart Association supports a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to combatting obesity which is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. 

'We are very interested in the proposed legislation by Assembly Member Camara as part of a broad range of public policy approaches addressing the consumption of sugary drinks.'

The American Beverage Association told the New York Observer, warning labels will not change consumer behaviour.

Spokesman Christopher Grindlesperger, said: 'Obesity is a serious and complex issue, but a misleading warning label on certain beverages will not change behaviors or teach people about healthy lifestyles.

'There's a better way to empower consumers to make the choices that are right for them.

'If we want to get serious about obesity, it starts with education – not laws and regulation.'
