Not everyone is impressed with what they see when they look in the mirror but 25-year-old Millie Mackintosh has no such worries.

The reality star has revealed that she feels 'pretty good' about what she sees in the mirror and says the thought of having cosmetic treatments such as Botox 'terrifies' her.

'[I feel] pretty good,' the star revealed to Closer. 'Two years ago, I felt sluggish and unmotivated but, over the last year, I've taken better care of myself by eating healthier and working out more.'

Confident: Millie says she likes what she sees in the mirror and finds plastic surgery 'terrifying' 

Workouts take the shape of frequent 'hot yoga' classes, as well as regular pilates, ballet-inspired body barre workouts and spinning classes.

Indeed, so committed is Ms Mackintosh to her new regime, she even wears gym gear on days off in a bid to keep herself motivated.

Despite her regular workouts, she did tell Closer magazine that there is one area she isn't entirely happy with - her tummy. 

'Naturally, like most women, my eyes always fall to the body part I like least- my tummy,' she said in an interview with the magazine. 'It's the hardest area to tone.'

Healthy: Ms Mackintosh kicked off her healthy lifestyle two years ago and intensified it ahead of her wedding

Daring: The 25-year-old certainly didn't shy away from flashing the flesh during a spa visit this week

Always slim, Ms Mackintosh embarked on a health kick in 2012 when she was dating her now husband Professor Green.

After resorting to a tough sugar-free diet ahead of their 2013 wedding, she still follows a gluten and dairy free diet due to her intolerances.

But it is fitness that is the budding fashion designer's real passion, and, she says, the reason for her increasing body confidence.

Along with her love of pilates, the star works out with her personal trainer at least five days out of the week.

Variety: Along with a passion for hot yoga, Mille also does regular pilates and barre body sessions 

And her efforts certainly seem to be paying off if her social media accounts are to be believed, with Ms Mackintosh regularly posting snaps of herself that display her newly rock-hard abs to full effect. 

She has also revamped her style, frequently opting for low cut looks.

As a result of her new-found body confidence, Ms Mackintosh says she would never even contemplate plastic surgery, saying: 'It terrifies me'.

'I know people who have had it done and it looks subtle, but the fear of it going wrong or becoming too dependent on having things done is frightening.

'I'm a make-up artist so I prefer natural beauty. I won't be having Botox in my 20s!'
