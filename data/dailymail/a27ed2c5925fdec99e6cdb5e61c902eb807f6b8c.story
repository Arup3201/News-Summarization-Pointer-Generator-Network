Need for 'proportionate scheme': Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson (pictured), has ruled that the law which requires people to disclose all previous convictions to employers breaches human rights

People who have been given police 
cautions for theft will be free to work in care homes, schools and 
hospitals despite their criminal past, under a human rights ruling.

Currently, anybody applying to work with children or vulnerable adults must disclose any convictions or cautions they hold.

The Criminal Records Bureau checks are designed to weed out applicants who could abuse positions of trust.

But in a bombshell ruling yesterday 
the Appeal Court said the system was a breach of Article 8 of Labour’s 
Human Rights Act, the right to privacy. And it applies whether the 
caution was received many years ago as a child or recently as an adult.

Judges found in favour of a woman who 
was blocked from taking a job in a care home eight years after she 
received a police caution for theft from a shop in Sheffield while in 
her early 40s.

The Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, said the decision to bar her from the job had breached her human rights.

He ruled that ‘requiring the 
disclosure of all convictions and cautions relating to recordable 
offences is disproportionate’. Her identity was kept secret.

The judges in the Court of Appeal (above) said the CRB system is a breach of Article 8 of the Hmman Rights Act, the right to privacy

The case was brought to the Court of Appeal after campaign group Liberty intervened in 
the case of 'T', a 21-year-old man who received warnings from Manchester
 Police when he was 11 years old in connection with two stolen bikes.

The
 information was disclosed on two occasions: when he applied for a 
part-time job at a local football club at the age of 17 and later when 
he applied for a university course in sports studies.

Mike
 Pemberton, the solicitor who represented 'T', told Radio 5 Live: 'This 
is a case where human rights equals common sense.

'You can’t argue that 
something you did when you were 11 years old will blight you for the 
rest of your life.'

The ruling means employers could, in 
future, be barred from knowing whether a potential employee has a theft 
conviction.

It raises the prospect of people who have admitted serious 
dishonesty looking after care home residents, some with dementia.

Last year, 38,400 cautions were given out for theft, all of which could now remain secret.

The verdict also included the case of a
 17-year-old who failed to get a job at a sports club because he had to 
disclose a police warning he had received for bicycle theft when he was 
11.

Had the Appeal Court ruled only that 
cautions given for minor crimes to juveniles should no longer be 
included in CRB checks, there would have been little fuss. But because 
the judgment found in favour of an adult it provoked anger at 
Westminster.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This is 
another classic example of judicial legislation under the Human Rights 
Act – stretching human rights, and eroding the ability of those in 
positions of trust to protect the vulnerable. This balance should be 
decided by accountable law-makers.’

A government spokesman said: ‘The 
protection of children and vulnerable groups must not be compromised. We
 are disappointed by this judgment and are seeking leave to appeal to 
the Supreme Court.’

While ruling that the current system 
of CRB checks must be ripped-up, the judges did not specify exactly how 
ministers must change the law to make it human rights compatible.

Lord Dyson said only that a system of ‘filtering’ was required, to allow for irrelevant criminal records to be removed.

It leaves ministers with a big 
headache. One option is to say that all cautions will be excluded from 
enhanced CRB checks. But this could have huge ramifications – 212,000 
criminals were punished in this way last year alone, many for serious 
offences.

The only certain outcome is that, 
because judges have ruled on the specific case of the woman in her 40s, 
it will no longer be lawful to insist a caution for theft must 
automatically be disclosed.

The ruling could mean hundreds of 
thousands of people who have been made to disclose past convictions to 
employers seeking compensation, if they missed out on the job.

Criminal record checks were beefed up 
after the case of Ian Huntley, who was jailed for life in 2003 for the 
murder of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire. He 
had got a job as a school caretaker because his criminal links had not 
been shared by Humberside Police.

The ruling will raise fears that more relaxed checks on previous convictions will allow criminals to work in sensitive jobs such as at care homes.

The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was established under the Police Act 1997 and launched in March 2002 following public concern about the safety of children, young people and vulnerable adults.

It also aimed to reduce the risk of organisations being sued for employing convicted criminals who went on to abuse in the course of their duty.

Vetting was strengthened further with the introduction of the Independent Safegaurding Authority (ISA), which required all people working with vulnerable people and young children be checked.

The ISA came into force in direct response to recommendations by the Bichard Inquiry following the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by Ian Huntley in 2002. 

Huntley had been suspected of a string of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary. 

His only conviction before the murders was for riding an uninsured and unlicensed motorcycle, although a burglary charge had remained on file.

However, there was debate whether he would have been caught if the rules had been in place at the time of his horrific crime.

Last year, the government announced that millions of people who volunteer to help in schools, with sport or at charity events are to be freed from the red tape of criminal record checks.

Ministers are scaling back legislation to exempt more than half of the nine million who have needed to go through Labour’s 'vetting and barring scheme' from the need to be officially checked.

On December 1, 2012, the CRB and the ISA were merged to form the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).
