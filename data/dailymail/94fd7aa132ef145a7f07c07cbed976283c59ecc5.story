City workers who slave away over their lunch break to meet targets and hit bonuses aren't just seeing an increase in their salaries.

According to a new survey, as stress levels rise for desk-bound office workers, so does their waist-line.

A staggering 82 per cent of City workers now eat at their
 desks because they have too much work on and 24 per cent need to feed their flagging energy levels with ‘whatever they can get their hands on’.

Desk-bound: 82 per cent of City workers now eat at their desks because they have too much work on

A shocking 35 per cent reach for chocolate as a midday snack because they have no time to take a lunch break. 

To add to the desk diet conundrum, 44 per cent of office workers now also blame their colleagues for their weight gain. 

The survey, carried out by weight management programme LighterLife, showed that there is always one ‘office feeder’ encouraging bad eating habits.

The office feeder is a new breed of 
colleague bringing in treats and snacks for everyone - further fuelling 
the unhealthy desk diet.

TV’s Doctor Hilary Jones said: 
'Stress plays a huge role in eating habits and the challenges of a busy 
life hugely impact healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle.

'Stress is a major trigger for 
overeating and sustained stress is an unhealthy way to live life and 
also impairs the ability of talented workers to have more balanced 
thinking while also boosting the risk of illness.

Sweet treats: 35 per cent of workers reach for chocolate because they don't have time to get lunch

'While companies and workers might think the desk diet is a productive and efficient approach to managing work load, the lack of a lunch break will not only impact the waist-line but also the workload.

'The survey has again highlighted that a change in mindset is exactly what people need when it comes to mindful and healthy eating. City workers need to stop making excuses and start eating well again.'
