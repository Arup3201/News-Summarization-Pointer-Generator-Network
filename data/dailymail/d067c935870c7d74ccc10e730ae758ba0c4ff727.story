As a prisoner of war, Gerald Imeson had plenty of time on his hands.

But at least as he waited to take part in the Great Escape, the RAF bomber pilot had an elegant timepiece with which to watch the hours tick down.

It was a Rolex Oyster 3525 – and it was delivered to him in the Nazis’ notorious Stalag Luft III camp from the watchmaker’s headquarters in Switzerland after he bought it by mail order in 1942 for £170 – the equivalent of £5,000 today.

Timeless: The Rolex watch worn by British prisoner of war Flight Lieutenant Gerald Imeson as he helped dig tunnels for the famous 'Great Escape' attempt from the Stalag Luft III camp is to go on sale at auction

During preparations for the 
imaginative but ill-fated breakout, Flight Lieutenant Imeson acted as 
one of the ‘penguins’ who dispersed the soil dug from the tunnels 
through enlarged pockets in their trousers as they exercised in the 
compound.

But come the 
actual escape in March 1944 he was number 172 in the queue of PoWs... 
and the Germans had discovered what was going on before he made it into 
one of the three tunnels.

The
story casts light on a surprising marketing enterprise whereby Hans 
Wilsdorf, Rolex’s owner, sold the watches on credit to British PoWs 
during the Second World War, allowing them to pay when the war was over.

He
only made the offer to British officers because they were seen as 
honourable gentlemen. They were invited to write to him on postcards 
explaining their circumstances and whereabouts and which Rolex they 
wanted.

Replacement: Swiss watchmaker Rolex had offered all British officer PoWs one of their timepieces to replace the ones seized by the Germans, on condition they pay for them after the war

Honour: The Rolex deal was only made to British officers as they were seen as honourable gentlemen

Survivor: F/Lt Imeson wore the Rolex Oyster Chronograph watch on the hellish forced marches through Germany to evade the advancing Russians in the winter of 1945

Details of Flt 
Lt Imeson’s case came to light yesterday as his watch emerged for sale. 
The watch is likely to fetch £30,000 when it is auctioned on November 6.

He
was captured after his Wellington bomber was hit by flak, following an 
attack on Cologne, and crashed into the North Sea in 1941.

He
was sent to Stalag Luft III – at Sagan in eastern Germany – the camp 
made famous by the 1963 film The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen, 
which immortalised the audacious bid for freedom by Allied prisoners 
there. Seventy-three of the 76 who did escape were recaptured and 50 of 
them executed.

RAF 
personnel’s military issue watches were often seized by the German 
troops who captured them. But once in the PoW camps, some 3,000 are 
thought to have taken up Mr Wilsdorf’s offer.

Attempt: F/Lt Imeson, fourth from left at Stalag Luft III camp. He was allocated position 172 in the queue of PoWs to escape but never made it into the tunnel as the German guards discovered the break-out

Prized: F/Lt Imeson was made a member of the Goldfish Club, for those who have jumped by parachute from an aircraft into the water, or whose aircraft crashed in the water, in 1943

Artifact: The reverse side of the prized Goldfish card

Flt Lt Imeson, who had married his wife Lesley only two months before he was captured, remained a PoW for the rest of the war.

The
watch survived intact even though he wore it on the forced marches 
without adequate food or protection that PoWs endured as the Nazis 
evaded the advancing Russians. He was eventually liberated from another 
PoW camp in May 1945.

After
the war, Flt Lt Imeson, from Overton, Hampshire, returned to his job as
a civil servant with the Air Ministry. He had four children and nine 
grandchildren.

Treasured: F/Lt Imeson is pictured wearing his treasured timepiece as he relaxes with wife Lesley in the 1980s

Home front: During his time at the camp F/Lt Imeson would have been cheered by the thought of his wife, pictured in 1944, who wrote to him from their home in Kent

He did 
not pay for the watch until a couple of years after the war because of 
British currency restrictions. He treasured it until he died in 2003 
aged 85 and his last wishes were for the timepiece to one day be sold so
his family could benefit.

It is now being auctioned for his grandchildren by Bourne End Auction Rooms in Buckinghamshire.

Martin
Perrin, from the auction house, said: ‘Airmen who were kept in Luft 
camps were treated quite well and there would have been a gentlemen’s 
agreement for the PoWs to order these watches. The model Flt Lt Imeson 
chose was one of the top Rolex made at the time.’

Reworking history: The 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved

In the spring of 1943, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell conceived a plan for a major escape from the German Stalag Luft III Camp near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland.

With the escape planned for the night of March 24, 1944, the PoWs built three 30ft deep tunnels, named Tom, Dick and Harry, so that if one was discovered by the German guards, they would not suspect that work was underway on two more.

Bushell intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels, each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment.

To hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter.

The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as 'penguins' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal.

When the attempt began it was discovered that Harry had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest, the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line, close to a guard tower. Plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour.

In total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom, but the 77th was spotted by a guard. In the hunt for the entrance one guard Charlie Pilz crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help. The prisoners opened the entrance, revealing the location.

Of the escapees 73 were captured, and 50 of them executed.

THE HOLLYWOOD FILM

The 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved.

The film starred Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts, James Garner as Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and was based on a book of the same name by Paul Brickhill.

Contrary to the film no American PoWs were involved in the escape attempt, and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft. 

Hilts' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of McQueen, who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump.
