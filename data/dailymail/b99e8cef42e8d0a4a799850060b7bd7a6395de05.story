Liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be 'scaled up' to deal with the increase in those dying, experts claim

Excessive drinking among the middle classes is fuelling an increase in deaths from liver disease, experts warned yesterday.

They claim alcohol dependence has become a ‘lifestyle choice like Armani jeans’ rather than being recognised as a potentially deadly disease.

Figures show deaths among younger people have gone up 500 per cent in 30 years, while other European countries are seeing their rates tumble.

And current tests for liver damage may be ‘falsely reassuring’ because they cannot show the true extent of scarring caused by alcohol, obesity or viral hepatitis.

The Lancet Commission said liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be ‘scaled up’ to deal with the problem.

They are calling for GPs to have access to simple scanners which would help detect those at risk from a ‘silent killer’.

Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, a member of the commission and former president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘Four out of five case of liver disease are caused by alcohol, while death rates from cirrhosis are tumbling in countries like France.’

He said excess drinking was polarised in the UK, ranging from binge drinkers in their 20s to those in late middle age, and blamed the problem on the low price of alcohol.

‘Alcohol dependence is being treated like a lifestyle choice like Armani jeans rather than as a disease. We sell it for pocket money prices,’ he said.

‘People say we have always been big drinkers. In fact it mirrors price almost exactly.

‘If you go back 20 years most drinking was done in pubs and bars. Eighty per cent of all drinking now is done at home – especially old people behind closed doors.’

Apart from Finland, the UK is the only country in western Europe where the prevalence of liver disease has increased.

Death rates for those under 65 have increased from 2.82 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10.85 in 2010 – claiming 11,000 lives a year in England and Wales alone.

In Finland the death rate is 18.8 per 100,000. The death rate in France is 9.6 – a dramatic fall of two-thirds in recent years.

A pill that cuts brain damage caused by binge drinking is being developed by scientists.

In tests on rats, the drug reduced the number of brain cells killed by alcohol. Cells saved included those vital to navigation and orientation.

The drug, known only as ethane-beta-sultam, also seemed to stop the rats from behaving impulsively.

Mike Page, of the University of Huddersfield, said the drug would be a treatment, not a pill youngsters could take before a night out.

At present, problem drinkers are given a liver function blood test but the results can be ‘falsely reassuring’ because 80 per cent of people with cirrhosis have normal results, Professor Gilmore said.

Instead of relying on outdated testing, GPs should buy or share cheap £30 portable scanners or £70 fixed machines that reveal liver scarring.

Dr Nick Sheron, who runs the liver unit at Southampton General Hospital and is co-founder of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said most drinkers will quit when confronted by hard evidence of liver damage.

‘Three-quarters of liver disease is not being picked up,’ he said. ‘[GPs] are using outdated technology and tests that don’t work – they think they work but they don’t.

‘If you give feedback that their liver is scarring 65 per cent will stop, compared to 30 per cent if you just give advice.’

The report also calls for minimum pricing of at least 50 pence per unit.

Professor Julia Verne, who speaks on liver disease for Public Health England, said: ‘This is a silent killer.

‘A large glass of wine is like three shots of vodka. It is very easy for people to pour a glass and have no idea how much they are drinking.’
