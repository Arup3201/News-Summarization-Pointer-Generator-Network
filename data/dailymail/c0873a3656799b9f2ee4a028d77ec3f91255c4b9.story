A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year.

Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend.

The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12.

'I looked like a Christmas pudding': Carol Bryant, right, said she was was horrified when she saw this picture of herself at a Christmas party last year

Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet

She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.'

Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day.

'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained.

Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason.

'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP.

'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.'

'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack.

'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends.

'I was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear, while I was stuck in frumpy t-shirts and baggy trousers.'

After sticking to the plan for a 
year, Carol has shed 12 stone and gone from a size 28 to a trim
 size 12 in time for Christmas.

'This year there will be no hiding at Christmas parties for me,' said proud Carol.

'I've already picked out a gorgeous, shimmering size-12 dress to show off my trim, new figure. And I feel incredible.'

Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight

Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28

'No role model': Carol quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother to Lois, now six, pictured, but found herself spending a lot of time on the sofa

Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds.

This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12

She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps.

Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28.

Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.'

But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs.

'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.'

Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12.

Instead of having the meal replacements, she's now joined Slimming World so she can sustain her weightloss and said she's never felt more confident.

'This year I can't wait to show off my party dress,' she said. 'I won't be hiding away in the corner, I want to be the centre of attention. I want to party my way through the celebrations, making up for all those lost years.'
