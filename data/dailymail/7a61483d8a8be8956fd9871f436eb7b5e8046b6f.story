A disgraced Florida pharmacist sentenced to 30 months of house arrest for his role in a large-scale pill mill operation has requested to have his sentence cut short saying that at 551lbs, he is already confined to his home.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra on Monday rejected the plea submitted by 70-year-old Steven Goodman, writing in his opinion that the painkiller-pushing pharmacist had been spared prison time only because it would have proven too difficult to care for him in a correctional facility.

Goodman, of Treasure Island, was sentenced in August 2012 for distributing more than a million prescription pain medications like oxycodone to clinics operated by the twins Jeffrey and Christopher George.

Heavy burden: Former Florida pharmacist Steven Goodman, 70, pictured in August 2012 around the time he pleaded guilty in a mill pill case, has asked a judge to reduce his 30-month house arrest sentence saying he is too big to go outside

The siblings are currently serving prison terms of more than a dozen years each for flooding several cities in South Florida with illegal pain drugs.

Judge Marra said during Goodman's sentencing two years ago that the Florida prison system cannot accommodate someone so large, SunSentinel.com reported.

Weighing more than a quarter of a ton, Mr Goodman gets around in a wheelchair, cannot dress himself or bathe without assistance, and there are no beds in penitentiaries that could support his bulk.

Goodman's lawyer, Edward Page, described his client's house arrest as 'both unnecessary and futile' because his weight problem and poor health already confine him to his bedroom.

In his request for a reduced sentence, the attorney argued that the 70-year-old man has a wide array of grave medical issues, including heart disease, an incurable lymph condition and sleep apnea, which would likely end his life in the next six to 12 months.

'Each day may be one of his last,' Page wrote in his 10-page plea.

The lawyer also pointed out that Goodman cannot fit in a car and suffers from an acute fear of falling that effectively confines him to his home.

Since his sentencing, the ailing 550-pound man has remained largely indoors. He did, however, venture outside to attend his own wedding ceremony when he married Judith Bartell.

Edward Page asked Judge Marra to shave the last seven months off his client's sentence so that he could visit friends and family in Ohio to say goodbye.

But the judge seized upon the lawyer's argument, questioning how the largely immobile, morbidly obese man who has a fear of falling and cannot fit into a car would be able to journey from Florida to Cincinnati for a family reunion. 

Steven Goodman was one of about 32 people indicted in 2012 as part of 'Operation Oxy Alley.'

According to prosecutors, the George brothers operated and managed four pain management clinics, which distributed about 20million oxycodone pills over the course of two years to the tune of $40million in profits.

The indictment stated that the twins hired doctors who agreed to write prescriptions for controlled substances without any regard for medical necessity.

In January 2012, Jeffrey George, then 31 years old, was sentenced to 15-and-a-half years in federal prison after pleading guilty to racketeering conspiracy.

His brother, Christopher, also pleaded guilty to racketeering and is now serving a 14-year sentence.
