Following Rory McIlroy's WGC-Cadillac Championship meltdown - where his 3-iron ended up in a lake - a scuba diver took the plunge to retrieve the Nike Vapor club.

The unidentified man was spotted by TV cameras entering the water before triumphantly lifting the iron out of the murky water.

The World No 1 launched his club after putting his ball into the same water at the side of the eighth in Miami and he admitted his emotions got the better of him.

With the club in his grasp, the diver triumphantly heads out of the water which was caught by TV cameras 

He said: 'I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had been any other club I probably wouldn't have. There was a split second like should I or shouldn't I, but I didn't need a 3-iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not? It felt good at the time.

'Looking back at it, it isn't one of my proudest moments. But, you know, walked away with a bogey and regrouped and did okay from then.'

McIlroy is tied for twelfth going into the final day on Sunday, with J.B. Holmes leading by five shots on -11.
