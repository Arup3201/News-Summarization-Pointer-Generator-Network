U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has accused Congress of 'playing with fire' as the deadline for raising the government's borrowing limit looms.

Lew said Congress' failure to increase the debt ceiling to $16.7 trillion before October 17 would be 'dangerous' and 'reckless', and damage the government's credit standing.

He said after the deadline, the government will lose the capacity to borrow because he will have exhausted all the extraordinary measures he has been using since May to free up room for more borrowing. 

Angry: U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it will be 'dangerous' and 'reckless' for Congress to pass an October deadline without raising the government's borrowing limit

'On the 17th we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire if they don't extend the debt limit,' Lew said on CNN’s 'State of the Union' program today.

'We are the strongest, most important economy in the world.. We've already seen that with the government shutdown - the kinds of gridlock and brinksmanship in Washington hurts people, and it hurts the economy.'

Lew said the U.S. reached the debt limit in May and Treasury was running out of options to borrow.

'They've been used so many times that they're not as extraordinary as they used to be,' he said.

'If they don't extend the debt 
limit, we have a very, very short window of time before 
those scenarios start to be played out.'

Action: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has called on House Speaker John Boehner (pictured) to take action, even without majority support from the Republicans

While conservative commentators have accused President Obama of 'digging his feet into the ground' over the issue, Lew said Congress is being inflexible.

'Congress needs to make it possible for us to pay our bills,' Lew said on Fox News Sunday.

'I'm saying the president wants to negotiate. He wants to negotiate in good faith.

'Congress needs to do its job, and we then need to negotiate. The president has taken many steps over the last several years to show his willingness to negotiate.

'He's done it with Democrats saying he's too eager to negotiate. Now, Republicans have not come forward and made comparable movement.'

Lew said that the government will have about $30 billion of cash on hand, but it's not a 'responsible amount of cash to run the government on.'

Lew also said said that House Speaker John Boehner should take action, even without having majority support for it within his party.

'I know John Boehner. We have a good relationship. I've talked to John Boehner. I know he doesn't want to default. He also didn't want to shut the government down,' Lew said.

'And here we are with a government shutdown. There's a majority in Congress that would vote to do the right thing, and the majority needs to be given the chance to work its will."'
