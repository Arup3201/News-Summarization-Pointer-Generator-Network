A jobseeker in danger of losing his house took matters into his own hands by pleading for work with a roadside placard after more than 300 failed applications.

Steve Clarke, 40, was at the end of his tether having spent 11 months on the dole without work amid the deepest recession in generations.

So he sat in front of the Dunscar war memorial in Bolton, Greater Manchester with a placard which read in black capital letters: ‘Willing to work. Job required. Steve 07584420914.’

Wits' end: Unemployed Steve Clarke of sat near his local war memorial at rush hour while holding a placard asking for work

Mr Clarke was made redundant from his 
job as a quality assurance engineer at Run Services in Liverpool, a 
position he had held since 2001, last July.

Since then he has made more than 300 job applications without success and is in danger of losing his home in Bolton.

Mr Clarke said: ‘The response has been really positive.

‘It was really getting me down not having a job and I had had enough, so I decided to do something about it.

‘I’ve been out of work only once in my life and that was 16 years ago.

‘Since I was made redundant last year,
I’ve had five interviews and none of them have been local. The last one
was in York, but I didn’t get it.

‘I would do anything as a job and I’d be prepared to move anywhere.

‘One woman stopped and said she thought what I was doing was fantastic.’

Out
of 30 people who were made redundant with Mr Clarke, only two have 
found jobs and he believes the Government needs to do more to help 
people find work.

He added: ‘I know they’ve all found it hard too.

‘The
problem with being on Jobseeker’s is the Government doesn’t have the 
money for the training courses to make you more employable.’

As
well as sitting outside the memorial, Mr Clarke also stood on St 
Peter’s Way to catch people’s attention and has received lots of support
on social networking website, Facebook.

One
passer-by Suzanne Durham, a senior marketing executive, said: ‘What a 
refreshing sight to see someone think outside the box in their hour of 
need as opposed to wasting away their time on the dole.’

Desperate: Mr Clarke kept detailed written record of the 300 jobs he has applied for but was unsuccessful

According to the latest Office for 
National Statistic figures, the unemployment rate 2.63 million people 
were unemployed people - down 45,000 on the quarter.

That equates to 8.2 per cent of the economically active population - down 0.2 on the quarter.

The latest economic forecasts proves yet more gloomy reading for those out of work.

Some experts have suggested the economic situation in Britain was similar to that faced during the Great Depression, with the added complication of a major banking crisis.

The dire economic situation has also prompted people to take increasingly desperate measures to find a job.

Mr Clarke is one of the latest in a 
band of jobless people willing to shun the traditional job centres and 
recruitment firms and try self-publicity in a bid to secure work.

In 2009, Alex Kearns decided he needed to make his CV stand out. So he unfurled a giant version of it in Trafalgar Square.

The 23-year-old, who graduated with a
French and Italian degree from Swansea University, won an hour's slot 
on the fourth plinth in sculptor Antony Gormley's One & Other 
Project.

And it worked. Soon after his appearance in July he was contacted by a manager at the International Business Development Group.

Success: 
Alex Kearns proved he had some get-up-and-go by bagging a job after 
displaying a giant CV on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square

In 2010, Masters Degree student Matt 
Barber, 25, stood on a busy roundabout in his hometown of Plymstock, 
Devon, clutching a placard which read 'graduate needs job' after not 
getting a single interview despite 100 job applications.

He is so keen to get a job he has offered a £300 reward to anyone giving him a lead to an interview that secures him a job.

Mark Wheeldon, who had been out of work for two years in 2010, landed a job after standing hours in the pouring rain with a 'Please give me a job'.

A passing businessman offered him one 
on the spot after being noticed advertising himself at on one of the 
busiest roundabouts in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs.

Last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced during his Mansion House speech to the City of London, plans for the Government to inject £140million into the UK economy as the country's financial outlook remained grim.

The extraordinary move comes amid rising Government anxiety that the Eurozone crisis could plunge Britain back into a deep recession that could take years to recover from.

Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King said the dire economic outlook was prompting the Bank to take unprecedented measures.

He said the world’s central banks had 
thrown ‘everything bar the kitchen sink’ at solving the economic 
meltdown in the industrialised world, but the crippling problems remain.
