Sunderland owner Ellis Short will decide this week if he needs to sack Gus Poyet to keep the club in the Barclays Premier League.

The Black Cats are one place and one point above the relegation zone following Saturday’s humiliating 4-0 home defeat against Aston Villa, in which fans attempted to storm the dugout and thousands more left before half-time.

Poyet has vowed to fight on despite one win in 12 and no home goal in more than five hours.

However, Sportsmail understands that senior figures at the club, including sporting director Lee Congerton, have told Short that Poyet is the wrong man to take them forward.

There is also concern at Poyet’s touchline behaviour - he was sent off against Hull and faces an FA charge for kicking the drinks bucket. 

Yet only last year he was hailed a hero after masterminding a dramatic relegation survival. Sportsmail looks at the reasons behind the disintegrating relationship.

DUEL AT THE TOP

When Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton set up a deal to bring in Atletico Madrid’s Toby Alderweireld in the summer, Poyet intervened and let the player’s agent know the defender would not figure if he signed.

Poyet also blocked a move for Manchester City’s Micah Richards, another Congerton target.

A source close to the club said: ‘The relationship between Poyet and Congerton is as bad as it can possibly be. Congerton is doing a good job and is respected within the game but fears his own reputation will be damaged if players he signs are then left on the bench by Poyet.’

SLIM PICKINGS

Poyet insists he only chooses the team and that transfers are left to Congerton.

The club hierarchy disagree and point to the arrival of Brighton pair Will Buckley and Liam Bridcutt, Uruguayan Sebastian Coates and Argentine Ricky Alvarez as players recruited on the say-so of the head coach. All four have failed to impress and have each started fewer than 10 league games this season.

Then there is the £3million signing of Poyet addition Ignacio Scocco. The Argentine was one of the highest earners at the club but left after just six substitute appearances at a £1m loss.

MIXED MESSAGES

Poyet does not know his best team or formation. He started with four central midfielders in the 1-1 draw at Hull and strikers Connor Wickham and Steven Fletcher are regularly on the left wing. 

Players were miffed when he suggested publicly they were not good enough to carry out his instructions. He also upset supporters by claiming they were pining for the ‘kick and rush’ days of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn.

Sunderland have drawn 14 matches and the football has been dire, one-paced and unimaginative — they have failed to score in 13 of 29 matches.

SPLIT DRESSING ROOM

Poyet believes he retains the support of the players and the likes of Lee Cattermole speak highly of him, both in public and private.

But several players and members of the backroom team were shocked when, during the FA Cup goalless draw at home to Fulham, first-team coach Charlie Oatway took the team talk.

2 Sunderland have won just two of their past 16 Premier League games at the Stadium of Light — Stoke (3-1) in October and Burnley (2-0) in January. Otherwise it’s seven draws and seven defeats.

4 Gus Poyet’s side have failed to score in four of their past five Premier League home matches.

22 Goals conceded at home this season — more than any other Premier League side.

12 The Black Cats have found the net just 12 times at the Stadium of Light this season — only Aston Villa (11) have scored fewer goals at home.

4 Against Villa, Sunderland conceded four first-half goals at home for the first time in the PL.

204 Shots this season - the fewest in the Premier League. They have also had the most shots (467) against them.

Meanwhile, the arrest of star player Adam Johnson on suspicion of sexual relations with an underage girl has been an untimely distraction.

WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

Academy staff are frustrated that their graduates have played a total of eight first-team minutes this season. 

On Saturday morning the under 21s were told to stop training and put on standby for a senior call-up. No one was added to the squad and they were annoyed that their session was finished early.

BLAME GAME

During last month’s 2-0 defeat at League One Bradford in the FA Cup, 4,000 fans sang: ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault.’ After that game, Poyet claimed that building a ‘China Wall’ to keep out journalists would improve his relations with the fans.

On the evidence of Saturday’s sorry showing, the majority of fans will be trying to scale the wall themselves if Poyet remains in charge.

SUMMER DECISIONS

Poyet will be lucky to see out the season and the chances of him being at the helm at the start of next year are close to zero.

Sportsmail understands a management team of Kevin Ball - currently exiled under Poyet’s regime - and Paul Bracewell could take temporary charge.

Former player Sam Allardyce is their top target and he would be willing to come in the summer with his contract up at West Ham.

Next up for Sunderland? A trip to Upton Park on Saturday before the small matter of a Wear-Tyne derby.
