For more than nine years, she accepted the longueurs of the Commons with admirably dogged patience.

During her career working for David Blunkett, Sadie also had her head patted by such luminaries as Her Majesty the Queen and George W. Bush.

But, sadly, she has now gone to chase squirrels in the sky after losing a battle against a rare illness at the age of 11, 77 in ‘dog years’.

Yesterday Mr Blunkett, the former Home Secretary and former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, told the Mail his beloved companion was put to sleep on Monday.

Sadie, a curly-coated retriever-labrador cross, had been enjoying county life at a foster home in a village in Derbyshire after retiring as his guide dog last November.

But, after a period of illness, she was taken to a veterinary hospital where tests discovered she had a condition which affected her gullet.

It made it difficult for her to swallow or to clear her chest, leading to fluid collecting on her lungs.

‘I’m very, very sad that she only had eight months retirement and was not able to prolong the sniffing time she had in the countryside after leaving Westminster,’ said Mr Blunkett, who visited her last week and had remained in regular contact with the hospital for news of her condition.

‘The last time I saw her she was as pleased to see me as ever and greeted me warmly with a waggy tail.

‘She was looked after wonderfully by the lady who fostered her and had a wonderful time in those eight months she was free from late nights in the House of Commons, free from pollution in London and free from harnesses.

‘Sadie was coming up to 12 years old, and I had hoped she would have a couple of years retirement but it was not to be.

‘She had been ill for two or three weeks and the vet told me it was a deteriorating situation.

'She spent a day in the veterinary hospital where they took tests for everything. I was glad I was able to do that.

‘Then she went back home because she was more comfortable there, but unfortunately she took a sudden turn for the worse.

‘In the end she could not eat or breathe properly so the decision was made to put her to sleep. Her new foster owner consulted with me, of course, about what was best to do.

'Sadie needed the peace that any pet owner would want for their animal in such circumstances.’

Mr Blunkett, the Labour MP for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough, could not be there at the end because of his commitments in the Commons.

Sadie was the fifth guide dog he has had and served alongside three Labour leaders.

Thanks to her dog passport, she accompanied Mr Blunkett on official Cabinet duties abroad – where she was prone to falling asleep during bureaucratic EU meetings.

When she retired, Mr Blunkett wrote a fond tribute letter saying she won hearts wherever she went.

She was succeeded by Cosby, another curly-coated labrador-retriever cross.
