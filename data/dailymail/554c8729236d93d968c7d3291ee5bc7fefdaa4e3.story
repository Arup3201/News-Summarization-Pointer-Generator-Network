Meagen Collins and Tom Williams have quite the enviable lifestyle.

Two years ago, the couple from Brisbane decided to leave their menial jobs behind, withdraw their mortage deposit and pack up their life to travel the world.

Since then they've travelled to 23 countries on a budget of about $AUS29 per person, per day and they have no regrets.

The pair spoke to Daily Mail Australia as they sat on one of the beaches of The Algarve coast, southern Portugal, sharing their memorable moments and some tips for ways to travel cheap.

As they began to approach their 30s, Meagen and Tom - who like to call themselves Megsy and Tommo - began saving for a house in the Gold Coast two years ago, eventually amassing $35,000 for a deposit.

'We had decided to settle down and get a mortgage... then we realised that buying into the debt culture was not going to make us happy,' Mr Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 

'We continued saving and then set out to travel forever and build an online income so we could discover a life of travel freedom.'

Ms Collins was a travel agent and Mr Williams was a wedding singer.

'I used to sit in an office 60 hours a week and was too tired to do much more than sleep afterwards,' Ms Collins said.

'It was all work and no life. I could look back on a year and only remember a few key events. Repetitive routine was essentially robbing me of life memories. I don't have that problem now I have a travel freedom lifestyle.'

The couple also fund their full time travels through their travel blog and postcast '5 Dollar Planet'

The couple are able to fund their travels through their travel blog and podcast '5 Dollar Planet', which aims to teach others how to discover travel freedom for themselves. 

'We also get a lot of tours and products for free as successful bloggers,' Mr Williams said.

'Our podcast 5 Dollar Planet, which is about travel hacking and earning money online, gets sponsorship.'

The pair have had to travel on a tight budget - calculating about $29 per person, per day - using simple methods to save money.

They include house-sitting for free accommodation, travelling off season and steering clear of tourist restaurants by dining at places that are popular among locals.

The couple have also embraced minimalism and carry 12kg of luggage each.

'We have zero regrets leaving our stuff,' Mr Williams said.

'Materialism doesn't make us happy, social interactions, experiences and memories do. I don't remember my toaster, but I will remember crossing the Gobi Desert in Mongolia for the rest of my life. Plus, other people around the world have toasters, I don't need my own.'

If there's one thing they miss, it's the Aussies.

'We have both been on the road in one form or another for so long its hard to associate with having a home anymore,' Mr Williams said.

'Mainly we miss family and friends and the Aussie people. You can't beat an Aussie BBQ on the beach and we are lucky to have met plenty of other Aussie travellers all around the world from Shanghai to Kosovo - we are always guaranteed a fun night when we do.'

While the couple are house-sitting a cottage near the water as they soak up the sunshine in Portugal, next month they will be heading to Morocco.

'You can get a nice apartment for under $300 a month and enjoy the colorful and vibrant culture - and learn some more French!' Mr Williams said.

And they have no intention of settling down back in Australia.

'We want to visit soon, though the cost of living is so high we are unlikely to return permanently,' Mr Williams said.

The couple have also share some of their travel tips in their free book '5 Steps to Kickstarting Your Dream Lifestyle ', which is available online.
