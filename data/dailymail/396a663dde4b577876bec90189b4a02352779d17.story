A dad who said he repeatedly bounced his 10-week-old baby on a blow-up mattress before squeezing the breath out of him in a 'bear hug', has been found guilty of first degree murder. 

Anthony Casanova, 41, showed no change of expression as he was convicted of killing his baby son Tyler at their home in Norton Shores, Michigan, in January 2013.

The father had originally claimed that he had crushed the baby when he tripped over his miniature dachshund, causing him to fall on the child.

But during a long police interview, Casanova said he had 'bounced' the crying baby seven or eight times on an inflated air mattress and squeezed him twice in a 'bear hug'.

Casanova's mother, Darlene Thomas, who testified in his defense earlier in the day, wept in the audience as the verdict was read out, Mlive reported.

According to the paper, Muskegon County Prosecutor D.J. Hilson said: 'We're pleased, obviously, that Tyler got the justice that he so deserved, and I look forward to his killer being sentenced for the rest of his life in prison.'

In Michigan, the mandatory sentence is life in prison without chance of parole for first-degree murder.

Earlier that day, Casanova wept as his mother told the jury that her son was a kind man and a doting father who was good with small children.

She explained that he was prone to be a 'people pleaser' who will tell people what they want to hear when he's under pressure.

Combined with her son's learning disabilities - including attention deficit disorder and reading problems - Ms Thomas said this made him prone to tell people what they want to hear when he's under pressure, even if it is a false confession.

She said her son had been told he could not have biological children and was overjoyed when he learned his girlfriend, Julia Striker, was pregnant with Tyler.

Ms Thomas also said Casanova and his ex-wife adopted twin special-needs children who were two when Tyler died.

Thomas lives in a different state to her son and said she had not seen Casanova after Tyler was born.

But she added that Casanova constantly texted her photographs of Tyler and his adopted children.

Casanova  wiped his eyes repeatedly as his mother testified and sobbed openly at points.

Dr Joyce deJong, Muskegon County medical examiner, also spoke yesterday morning, giving testimony for the prosecution about her examination and autopsy of Tyler on January 5, 2013, the day after he died.

She described extensive injuries, including a skull fracture, bleeding between the skull and the brain, and bruises on Tyler's chin, chest and abdomen. Some of the injuries partially healed, she said.

Dr de Jong said the 25 bruises on the 10-week-old's body were the size of fingertips. She said Tyler also had partially healed fractured ribs, a lacerated liver, bleeding inside his spleen and a bruised heart.

She said that, given the examination and autopsy, her medical conclusion was that the baby's death was a homicide caused by 'multiple injuries intentionally inflicted by another'.

She said the injuries were not consistent with Casanova's original story of accidentally falling on the baby and crushing him.

The doctor said that even if the older, healing injuries were disregarded,  the fatal head injury alone was not consistent with being crushed by another object. 

This is because bleeding inside the skull, she explained, caused by tearing of tiny blood vessels, is consistent only with a 'motion injury,' with the baby striking another object while moving.

She also said the bruises on Tyler's body were not consistent with a panicked, untrained person trying to revive a baby using CPR.

Casanova had claimed he was holding Tyler in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door, when the pet ran between his legs, tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him.

In court, the Norton Shores fire chief, a police officer, a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that Casanova told them the same story about tripping and falling on the baby.

The only difference between the stories was that, while he told most he dropped the 10-week-old and then fell on him, the fire chief remembers Casanova saying the two fell together.

On Wednesday, jurors watched and heard a video and audio recording of Casanova's interview with Detective Tony Nanna. The interview just a few hours after Tyler died.  

According to Mlive, the jury heard persistent persuasion by Nanna, who repeatedly insisted that the dog story wasn't believable, suggesting that an exhausted Casanova had 'snapped'.

He initially said: 'I honestly can't remember what happened,' adding 'nothing was done intentionally' when Nanna suggested he had shaken the baby.

A few minutes later, Casanova added: 'I need help. With my anger and my mood swings... and I feel like I have a split personality,' though still insisting the injuries were an 'accident'.

Casanova went on to say he 'bounced' Tyler seven or eight times on an inflated air mattress.

Later, as he was being handcuffed in preparation for being arrested and taken to jail, Casanova said he had 'squeezed' the 10-week-old twice until Tyler 'lost his breath,' but with the baby resuming breathing both times.

The defense team, led by Muskegon County Public Defender Fred Johnson insisted that the dog story was true in their opening statement and that Casanova told detectives he had shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee.

But, according to Mlive, in his closing argument yesterday, Mr Johnson did not mention the dog story at all.

Casanova said he accidentally fell on his 10-week-old son when his miniature dachshund tripped him

Instead, he appeared to be arguing for a compromise verdict - a conviction not of first-degree felony murder, but something less, such as manslaughter or second-degree murder.

He focused on intent, noting that multiple witnesses testified Casanova loved his children and was good with them.

'The step was made over the line. ... But it wasn't intentional,' Johnson said. 'What father intends to kill his child?'

Tyler's maternal grandmother, Joyce Wagner, the defendant's younger brother Mark Thomas and a day-care provider, Robin Carpenter, all testified they saw nothing abnormal about Tyler when they saw him days before his death.

In his closing arguments, Mr Johnson acknowledged the damage done to the defense by a video of Casanova's interview with a police detective in which he changed his story. 

'That was devastating for the defense,' he. 'You heard it, you saw it... And then you heard the medical examiner this morning, and that too was devastating for the defense. I'm not going to try to pull you away from that.'

But Mr Hilson, prosecuting, insisted that this was not a manslaughter case

'You don't get to kill your kid and say you lost it, he told the jury. 'No way. No way. This man intentionally inflicted these injuries on a defenseless 2-month-old child,'

'Don't compromise. Find him guilty of felony murder.'

The jury took just 45 minutes to decide on a verdict. Sentencing is scheduled for October 27.
