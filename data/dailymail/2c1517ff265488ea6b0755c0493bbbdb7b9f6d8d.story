New reports have revealed that the FBI had suspicions about Adam Lanza eight years before he committed the second-deadliest mass shooting in American history.

The FBI reportedly went to the Newtown, Connecticut home that he shared with his mother Nancy in 2004 and asked about his computer activity but left before even sitting down with the then-12-year-old.

Newsweek reports that FBI agents went to the family's Yogananda Street home because they had tracked Adam online after he hacked through two layers of government security.

Under suspicion: FBI agents went to the Lanza house in 2004 to question then-12-year-old Adam about how he had been able to hack through two layers of a government website's security

Nancy Lanza, who would later be killed at the hands of her son, spoke to the officers and convinced them that there was no need  for further questioning.

'He's a computer whiz,' she told the agents, according to Newsweek.

'Adam was just testing himself.'

The newly released report about the home visit is just one in a growing number of missed clues in the lead up to the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 26 students and his mother dead before he turned the gun on himself.

Author Matthew Lysiak thoroughly researched the December 2012 shooting and wrote a book called 'Newtown: An American Tragedy'.

First part of the murder scene: FBI officials questioned Nancy at her Newtown home in 2004, and that is the same home where Adam shot and killed her eight years later before going to the elementary school

In it, he discusses a previously undiscovered writing of Lanza's where he rails against 'the system' and talks about how he felt students were being brainwashed.

'It goes without saying that an AK-47 and
 enough ammunition could do more good than a thousand ‘teachers,‘ if one
 is truly interested in reforming the system,' Adam wrote a year before 
the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

'In short time the children will be brainwashed, pumped full of Xanax and told to conform, until they have been turned into the oppressors.

'They (the children) are already dead.'

In the weeks after the first anniversary of the shooting, Connecticut state investigators released their findings on the tragedy, showing what warning signs the 20-year-old shooter left behind in his wake before killing himself as emergency responders arrived on the scene.

Covering? Nancy Lanza (left) told the officers that her son (right) was very bright and just challenging himself with the hacking, and the officers apparently found that sufficient enough that they didn't need to talk to him

In fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children.

The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school.

Lanza became obsessed with the 1999 bloodbath at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said. He also kept a spreadsheet ranking mass murders.

The report also said that in 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for others and behaved strangely.
