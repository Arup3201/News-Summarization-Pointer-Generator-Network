Alan Johnson last night ruled out replacing Ed Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would ‘never’ take the job.

The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted.

It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader.

Former home secretary Alan Johnson threw Ed Miliband a lifeline after inisisting he will never stand to be Labour leader

Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago.

The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader.

An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election.

Senior Labour figures have publicly admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party, and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to 'show us your colours'. 

In an article for The Guardian, former Home Secretary Alan Johnson ruled out ever running for Labour leader. He said: 

'Miliband will lead us into an election that I am convinced we can win. It was my decision to walk away from frontline politics, not Ed’s. 

'He knows that while I won’t return, I will do everything I can from the backbenches to put Labour into government, and Ed Miliband into 10 Downing Street.

'The position of Labour leader has been vacated twice during my time as a member of parliament. Both times I chose not to stand. I happen to think that a better person took this onerous role on each occasion.

'I have never stood for the leadership of my party – and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will.'

Yesterday Mr Miliband attempted to brush off the reports, saying he agreed that 'you shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers'. 

Asked if he agreed there was a 'crisis of confidence' in his leadership, he replied curtly: 'No.'

Mr Miliband received a major boost when Mr Johnson gave the clearest statement yet that he would not take the reins.

‘I have never stood for the leadership of my party, and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will,’ he told The Guardian.

His comments are a blow to rebel MPs who want Mr Miliband to go for the sake of the party, as Mr Johnson is viewed as one of the few figures who could unite Labour in the six months before the election.

Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband was ‘entitled to our loyalty’. But he revealed that he had turned down Mr Miliband’s request to take a senior front line role in the election campaign, saying that he would only offer informal help from the backbenches.

Earlier, Mr Miliband attempted to get on the front foot after enduring days of sniping from his own side, by giving a major speech on Europe to the CBI.

But his woes pursued him to the business organisation’s conference in London, where one delegate asked him whether he now wished he had lost the leadership to his elder brother David. ‘Certainly not,’ Mr Miliband snapped back.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna

Senior Labour figures publicly rallied behind Ed Miliband.

But their attempt to shore up Mr Miliband's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother David.

Mr Umunna admitted there were 'noises off' about Mr Miliband's leadership, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It is a small minority of people, who are doing so anonymously and off the record.'

However, in a later interview, Mr Umunna appeared to mix Ed up with brother David, who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership.

The shadow business secretary told Sky News: 'I know, for my constituency, (we have) a united Labour Party in ensuring that we get David, um, that we get Ed Miliband into No 10. I know ultimately that that's what's going to make a difference to their lives.' 

Mr attempted to laugh off the speculation about his position, recalling a conversation with CBI president Sir Michael Rake.

‘I always remember him saying to me, “Ed, you shouldn’t believe everything you read in the newspapers”. It won’t surprise you to know that I rather agree with that just at the moment.’

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper dismissed suggestions that she was preparing for a leadership bid as ‘complete nonsense’.

The new poll showed support for Labour has slipped to 29 per cent – the same level achieved by Gordon Brown in his 2010 election defeat. 

The poll, conducted for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, put the Conservatives on 30 per cent, Labour on 29, Ukip on 16 and the Liberal Democrats on 10. Lord Ashcroft said polling now consistently showed that while David Cameron is an electoral ‘asset’ to the Conservatives, Mr Miliband is a ‘drag’ on Labour’s fortunes.

But two other polls last night gave Labour a narrow lead. A Populus poll put Labour on 36 and the Tories on 34, while an ICM poll put Labour on 32 and the Tories on 31.

However, the ICM poll for the Guardian, found Mr Miliband’s personal ratings had hit a new low. It found that 63 per cent of voters think the Labour leader is doing badly, while just 21 per cent think he is doing well.

The minus 42 rating is three percentage points lower than his previous worst result in June this year and will give fresh ammunition to the rebels.

Labour MP John Mann said Mr Miliband’s personal unpopularity was ‘an issue’ on the doorstep. He added: ‘Any Labour MP who says otherwise simply hasn’t been talking to their electorate.’

But Mr Miliband’s allies are increasingly bullish about his ability to survive. Last night loyalist MPs rallied behind him at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party in Westminster.

Members of the Shadow Cabinet also launched a belated attempt to shore up Mr Miliband. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna admitted there were ‘noises off’ about Mr Miliband’s leadership, but added: ‘It is a small minority of people, who are doing so anonymously and off the record.’

In an apparent slip, he said: ‘I know, for my constituency, (we have) a united Labour Party in ensuring that we get David, um, that we get Ed Miliband into No 10.’
