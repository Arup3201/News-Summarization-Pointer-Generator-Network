Break: Leah Remini, pictured, has released a statement seemingly confirming her break from the church

King of Queens actress Leah Remini threatened to call police on Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige after her 'many... questions' about the whereabouts of his wife, Shelly, who hasn't been seen in public for six years, went 'unanswered.'

Remini was allegedly interrogated for years after daring to ask about Miscavige's wife, and the allegedly harsh treatment has reportedly prompted her to make a dramatic break from the church.

A source told The New York Post: 'Because Leah threatened to call the police to find Shelly, she was put through "Security Checking," her family was put through it, and her friends.'

Last night, Remini released a statement seemingly confirming her break from the institution.

'I
 wish to share my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for the 
overwhelming positive response I have received from the media, my 
colleagues, and fans from around the world,' she said, according to The Post. 'I am truly 
grateful and thankful for all your support.'

Remini was also ostracized, according to the newspaper, for questioning alleged practices including forcing church followers to 'disconnect' from family members branded as 'suppressive persons.'

A source told The Post: 'When you ask a question, like, "Where is Shelly?," you are immediately hauled in... and asked, "Why are you asking, who are you connected to, are you going on the Internet?"'

The insider added that in such sessions, the person being quizzed is shown pictures of the buildings the church built and told that the suppressive persons or 'SPs' are trying to 'get you' because 'the church is winning.'

Questions: Tensions allegedly began when Remini, right, asked questions about the whereabouts of David Miscavige's wife Shelly at Tome Cruise, left, and Katie Holmes' wedding in 2006

The source added that when a church 
member visits an SP website they are 'literally cutting across man's 
ability to go free. You are, in fact, killing mankind.'

The Church of Scientology said in a statement to MailOnline: 'The Church respects the privacy of parishioners and has no further comment.'

Earlier
 this week, it was reported the actress had quit Scientology over claims
 that she was questioned by the church she has been devoted to for 30 
years and donated millions of dollars of donations to.

Remini,
 who starred in the hit sitcom for nine years, is believed to be 
dropping out of the organization as a stand against the policy of 
barring members from questioning Miscavige's authority.

The rift began when Remini allegedly asked about Shelly's absense, a source told the New York Post, at the wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in 2006, where Miscavige was best man.

The question allegedly prompted an immediate backlash from former 
head of the Scientology Celebrity Center Tommy Davis.

Support: Remini said: 'I wish to share my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for the overwhelming positive response I have received from the media, my colleagues, and fans from around the world'

According to a blog by ex-Scientology member Mike Rinder, Davis said: 'You don’t have the [bleeping] rank to ask about Shelly.'

The actress was then subsequently subjected to five years of 'thought modification', according to the Post.

Church friends, many of whom Remini had known for years, allegedly wrote reports on her and had her family investigated. 

According to Mr Rinder's blog, Remini 'will no longer tolerate the squirreling and human rights abuses perpetrated in the church'.

Mr Rinder has yet to respond to a request for comment on his allegations from MailOnline. 

A blog post by
 Village Voice editor Tony Ortega on July 5, suggested Remini remained 
loyal to the Scientology movement after a conversation with Remini's 
husband Angelo Pagán, who was also a member of the church.

Misgivings: Remini reportedly began to question the Scientology movement when she was berated for asking a question about the whereabouts of the wife of leader David Miscavige (left) at the wedding Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes (right)

However,
 Ortega is now reporting that Remini has indeed cut ties with the church.

A lawyer who represented Remini last year has yet to respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

Leah Remini is one of the most recognizable faces of Scientology which boasts a wealth of celebrity members including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and Juliette Lewis.

In the past, Remini, who starred in the movie Old School and had bit parts in Friends and Cheers, has been an avid defender of the religion.

In an interview with CNN, she said of Scientology's critics:
 'If somebody is going to get turned off about something because of what
 they read or heard, then that person's not smart enough to even enter a
 church.

'If you're really against something, then know what you're against.'

Remini promoted the launch of a Hollywood museum backed by Scientology, named the  'Citizens Commission on Human Rights Psychiatry: An Industry of Death'. A key component of the Scientology movement is its stand against psychiatry.

Remini, who was born in Brooklyn, New York, has been involved in the church for around 30 years after her mother joined in the 1970s.

She married her King of Queens co-star Angelo Pagán in 2003 and the couple have a nine-year-old daughter Sofia Bella. The family lives in Los Angeles.
