Andre Schurrle has ruled out a move away from Chelsea despite failing to secure a regular starting place this season.

Schurrle has been troubled by injury and illness since helping his country to the World Cup in July and says he has no intention of leaving the Premier League leaders.

'Nevertheless, in a phase with less operating time, transfer rumours are always coming up. Of course I want to be on the pitch as much as possible and score goals for my club,' added Schurrle ahead of Monday night's Premier League game at Stoke City.

'In a team like Chelsea, with many top players, you have to prove yourself again and again... but this is not an issue for me. I feel comfortable here and would not think of such a thing.'

Schurrle, who joined the Stamford Bridge club from Bayer Leverkusen for £18million in June 2013, scored twice in Germany's 7-1 World Cup semi-final drubbing of hosts Brazil in July.

However, he has started only 10 of Chelsea's 25 games in all competitions this season.
