A woman whose four guinea pigs were brutally murdered believes the attack might be the latest attack from a 'serial pet killer'.

Amanda Milligan returned to her Cairns home at 10.30pm on Friday to find the bodies of four of her guinea pigs on the driveway.

One had had its throat slit, the other had its chest cut open and two others appeared to have suffered blunt force trauma, she believes from being bashed against the driveway.

Two of the guinea pigs, Miss Aurora and Temprance, were Ms Milligan's pets and two Angel and Maisy were rescue guinea pigs.

Maisy, was heavily pregnant with twins.

'I was gutted. I can't comprehend why,' she told MailOnline.

Ms Milligan runs the Guinea Pig Haven Rescue Shelter and is known in the area as someone who takes in unwanted or injured guinea pigs.

The incident happened on Friday and Ms Milligan believes it may the latest attack by a 'serial pet killer'

She believes the assailants came in through the front gate, were confronted by her two dogs, which were then locked in the garage, before proceeding to the front of the house where the guinea pigs were kept in a table-top cage.

'We don't know if they were originally trying to break in or if the guinea pigs were the sole intent of the mission,' she said.

Ms Milligan said one of her dogs and her cat were harmed in the incident and her cat is now terrified to go into the front yard.

She is worried that the attacks might be the work of a serial pet killer.

'I believe there was another dog killed a couple of nights after the [guinea] pigs were killed. Someone is taking pot shots at large birds, not killing them, maiming them. It seems a little too much of a coincidence that it's been happening in the same area,' she said.

Ms Milligan, who has nine other guinea pigs, said she is worried that the assailants might return for the rest of the animals, or worse, her children.

'I have two young children, a five-year-old and a two-year-old, I'm concerned that once [the attackers] get bored of killing animals they'll go to another target â€“ children or the elderly,' she said.

Ms Milligan said the attack had 'traumatised' her two children, aged two and five.

Her older daughter asked her mother if the guinea pigs had 'gone to be with grandpa', Ms Milligan's father, who passed away less than a year ago.

'It's still heartbreaking trying to explain to her that they're not coming back and that they're with grandpa now and he'll look after them,' she said.

Police are investigating the incident and they are today conducting autopsies on the guinea pigs to establish the cause of death.

Senior Constable Andrew Abraham described the incident as a 'very disturbed attack' and said police were looking into whether this incident might be linked to any other crimes in the area.

Ms Milligan has offered a $500 reward, raised from the donations of supporters, to anyone with information about the crime.

'We need someone to pay for what they've done,' she said.

Posters have been put up around the area of the attack in the hope that people might come forward with information
