The 21-year-old woman, later identified as Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, reportedly worked as a sex worker in Anaheim. Prior to her arrival in Orange County, Estepp appeared in web videos examining sex work and street life in Oklahoma, the LA Times reports.

Estepp's death was linked by authorities to three women who went missing in Santa Ana between October and November of last year. They include Kianna Jackson, 20, Josephine Vargas, 34, and Martha Anaya, 28. All three women reportedly had ties to prostitution.

Authorities continue to search for more potential victims, Dunn said.

'There is a possibility there are more victims, and we are and have been working with many jurisdictions throughout California as well as the rest of the United States,' he told the LA Times. 'We need to make sure that our net is wide so we can see if there are any other missing persons that might have ended up in California.'

What happened? Kianna Jackson, pictured, went missing in October 2013

Josephine Vargas, pictured, was last seen in October 2013 as well

Martha Anaya, pictured, was last seen in Santa Ana in November 2013

Cano and Gordon were both registered sex offenders and convicted of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 in 2007 and 1992, respectively, according to the LA Times. Both men were sentenced to three years in prison.

As registered sex offenders, the paper adds that the men were ordered to wear GPS monitors and were reportedly required to check in with authorities every 30 days due to their transient status.

Gordon and Cano reportedly knew each other in April 2012, the paper says, when they cut off their GPS monitors and fled to Nevada. They used the aliases Dexter McCoy and Joseph Madrid before they were arrested. Both men pled guilty for failing to register as sex offenders.

They are currently held in custody at an Orange County jail, according to CBSLA. A press conference is scheduled for Monday.
