Sam Allardyce has warned his West Ham side that their recent impressive form does not protect them from being dropped when key players return from injury.

Mark Noble is set to be available for selection for the weekend trip to Burnley as the influential midfielder recovers from a calf problem.

Skipper Kevin Nolan is still working his way back to full fitness following a dislocated shoulder and club-record signing Andy Carroll is closing in on a return after undergoing ankle surgery in pre-season.

Matt Jarvis and James Collins have also been sidelined with niggling problems but, even in the absence of such talent, the Hammers have impressed in the early stages of the season and sit seventh in the Barclays Premier League table.

Allardyce is ready to welcome the selection headache he will be presented with when he is able to select from a fully-fit squad, as those who have thrived in previous weeks will have to maintain that level to stay in the side.

'I don't know whether it's a given or not,' Allardyce said, when asked if his injured players would come straight back in.

'The sooner you get all your players fit the bigger decisions you have to make as a manager. That puts you in a better position, even though those decisions are big ones, because you are going to start disappointing players on a more regular basis.

'The challenge for me is to make sure I pick the right team and formation in the game and how you are going to play against the opposition.

'When you have a full squad to choose from then you have to make big decisions and you have to disappoint people if they are all fit. That's what they have to accept.

'If we all want to do better - even though you are disappointed if you aren't selected - then you have to accept it and wait for your time to go in and make sure you play at your best so it's very difficult for me to leave you out.'

Despite wins over QPR, Liverpool and Crystal Palace, West Ham are yet to record successive Premier League wins this season and it is consistency that Allardyce is hoping will come in time - starting at Turf Moor against newly-promoted Burnley.

'I just want to see on Saturday if the players have the mentality to show the same consistency as they have and whether they have got the right desire and determination to win back-to-back football matches for the first time this season,' he said.

'That is their first test against a Burnley side that are undoubtedly well-organised and make things very difficult, even if they have not won a game yet.

'Somewhere along the line they are going to win a game very shortly and we have got to make sure it is not against us.'
