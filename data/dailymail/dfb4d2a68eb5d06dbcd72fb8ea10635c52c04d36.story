Riders were left shaken after the  Cyclone at Coney Island got stuck at the top of its track forcing them to climb down to safety on opening day of the amusement park.

The 24 passengers made their way slowly from around 10ft from the top of the the 88-year-old roller coaster after it stopped at about 12pm on Sunday.

The riders were enjoying the first public ride during the opening of Luna Park's summer season before it malfunctioned.

They were able to climb down to safety and there were no reported injuries following the incident.

Riders were left stranded after the legendary Coney Island Cyclone got stuck at the top of its track during its inaugural run. Passengers on the roller coaster had to climb down to safety

The 24 passengers were evacuated by climbing down the walkway lining the 88-year-old rollercoaster after it stopped around 10ft from the top at 12pm on Sunday

Some of the passengers called the experience 'terrifying' after they safely made it to the bottom

After the roller coaster came to a halt, riders were stranded for about ten minutes before they climbed down the small walkway lining the track, according to CBS.

One passenger said the entire experience was scary.

'It was terrifying, because I was up there and everything was spinning,' Gabriella Centeno said once she climbed to the bottom. 'I didn't know what to do.'

A small mechanical glitch was likely the cause of the roller coaster getting stuck, said Luna Park spokeswoman Erica Hoffman.

Angie Morris, the park's brand manager, said a problem like this one had not happened in a long time, and that tests were conducted on the roller coaster during the last month ahead of opening day, according to NBC.

Another rider, who is afraid of heights, said the climb down was made easier with the help of the park's employees.

Ann Dartany said: 'I'm scared of heights. But with their help I made it down. This was insane.'

Prior to the two dozen passengers getting stuck, a group of dignitaries had taken a ride on the Cyclone.

The roller coaster was closed while technicians repaired it and officials said they hoped it would only be shut down for a maximum of two hours.

'The most important part obviously is that everybody was safe,' said Hoffman.

During opening day, the first 100 guests were given a free ride on the Cyclone, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

Some riders waited overnight so that they could be at the front of the line and one of the first to take part in the Cyclone's inaugural run. 

While thrill-seekers flocked to the amusement park in not-so-summery temperatures, it did not stop members of the Coney Island Polar Bear Club from taking a dip in the Atlantic Ocean.

The group, who calls themselves the oldest winter bathing organization in the United States, went for a swim in the chilly water.

And to officially set off the 2015 season with what has become a yearly ritual, Brooklyn Borough president Eric Adams broke a bottle of Egg Cream on the roller coaster.
