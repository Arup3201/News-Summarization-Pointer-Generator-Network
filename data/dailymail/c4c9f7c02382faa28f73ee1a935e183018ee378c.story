A Connecticut homeowner was shocked to discover a naked neighbor performing sexual acts on her 'aggressive' female pit bull in her backyard while raving about ISIS and Ebola.

The disturbing incident took place last Thursday at the Waterbury home of Alice Woodruff, who came to her dog's defense by grabbing her gun and pointing it at the 22-year-old intruder.

But the man, who is believed to be mentally ill, was not impressed by Woodruff's show of force.

Four-legged victim: Layla, a 12-year-old rescue pit bull, has been sexually assaulted in the yard outside her owner's home by a mentally disturbed, naked man 

Harrowing ordeal: Dog owner Alice Woodruff (left and right) tried to scare off the intruder with a gun, but he continued prancing around and screaming that he was a member of ISIS and the anti-Christ 

Instead of beating a quick retreat, the suspect allegedly started prancing around while screaming that he was a member of the Islamist terror group ISIS and that he had Ebola.

At one point, Woodruff told the station WTNH the naked intruder declared himself to be the anti-Christ, spread out his arms and started coming at her.

A police officer eventually responded to the scene and chased off the suspect. He was later captured and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation. 

Speaking to the station, the shaken mother of two said when she first spotted a stranger lying prostrate under her 12-year-old pit bull, her initial thought was that the aggressive rescue dog had killed someone who had wandered into the yard.

But when she came closer to the animal, who is kept tethered to the porch by an 800-pound tow chain, she discovered that a naked man was raping the pooch inside a circle of his discarded clothing.

‘I had a citronella candle and I threw it at him, screaming, ‘Get off my dog, you have to get out of here.’ He said, ‘no! Today is the day we are going to spend the rest of our lives together,”’ Ms Woodruff recalled.

Disturbing: The 22-year-old suspect claimed he had infected Layla with Ebola 

Inapproachable: Woodruff marveled at how the neighbor was able to come near the pit bull, whom she described as very aggressive 

The 22-year-old suspect was described as prancing around the yard in the buff and making incoherent statements.

‘”Today is the day!” and “I am the anti-Christ and you’re going to die with me,”’ Woodruff told the Waterbury Republican American. ‘He kept saying he was with ISIS and he had Ebola, that he gave the dog Ebola.’

Ms Woodruff ran inside the house to grab her gun, which she leveled at the intruder in a bid to scare him off.

‘He kept saying this is the plan, that we were going to die today in a massacre. He didn’t seem to care that I had the gun, and I kept it down,’ she said. ‘Then I gave him a warning and shot the gun to the right into the dirt.’

On the road to recovery: The pet has been giving antibiotics and is said to be doing fine. 

But the gunfire did nothing to deter the crazed neighbor, who proceeded to advance on Woodruff with his arms outstretched, urging her to kill him but warning her that as soon as he was dead, everyone else would follow.

‘Honestly, the whole time I thought there was a bomb or gun and he was going to take it out and do a massacre,’ Woodruff said.

As someone who has worked in the mental health field for many years, Woodruff said she was scared for her life but also filled with compassion for the intruder who clearly needed help.

All the while, an emotional Alice Woodruff said she had one thought running through her mind: 'Lord, don't let me shoot him… Don't let me take somebody's life.'

When a police officer arrived on the scene, he spotted the 22-year-old suspect lurking in the bushes and ordered him to come forward, but the man bolted 'like a gazelle' and took off running barefoot.

He was apprehended after a two-hour search and taken to a hospital. The man now faces charges of animal cruelty, sexual assault and breach of peace.

When police searched the man's discarded belongings, they found bizarre notes that read, 'now, now, now,' police ‘ external’ and ‘internal.’ 

Alice Woodruff said she had never met the man in person until last Thursday, but she knew his family and even cared for one of his relatives at one time.

As far Layla, the plump 12-year-old canine has been given antibiotics as a precaution and is said to be doing fine.
