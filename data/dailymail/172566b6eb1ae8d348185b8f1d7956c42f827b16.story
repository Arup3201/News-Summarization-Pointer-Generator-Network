Hundreds of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Vietnam's capital today to bid a final farewell to legendary war hero General Vo Nguyen Giap.

He is credited with leading his country to victory over the French and then the Americans.

'Long live General Vo Nguyen Giap,' people chanted, many in tears, as his flag-draped coffin passed by on a truck-drawn artillery carriage.

People's champion: General Giap was sidelined by Communist party chiefs and later criticised the regime

Crowds of people, both young and old, lined the route, in places 10 deep, as the procession travelled along a 25-mile route from the national funeral house in Hanoi to the airport.

Military legend: General Vo Nguyen Giap who died aged 102

Giap, who died on October 4th aged 102, was revered in Vietnam only second to his mentor, former President Ho Chi Minh.

Alongside the public outpouring of emotion, the government orchestrated an elaborate two-day state send-off for the general, seeking to use the moment to foster national unity at a time of discontent and economic problems.

His coffin had been lying in state at the National Funeral Hall in Hanoi, draped in the national flag before soldiers in white uniforms removed the flag and carried the red coffin from the hall while other soldiers, bearing a photograph of the general went ahead of them.

The coffin was then placed on a gun carriage, the flag replaced, and a glass canopy lifted on top of it.

Gen Giap's family, wearing black, stood nearby as the procession began.

After the war, Giap was sidelined by the Communist Party, and toward the end of his life emerged as something of a critic, shielded from consequence because of his popularity.

State-controlled media has eulogised him since his death, but neglected to mention that chapter of his life.

'You,
 comrade, have made a great and excellent contribution to the 
revolutionary cause of our party and nation,' Communist Party chief 
Nguyen Phu Trong said at the funeral house.

'Your personality and your great contribution were strongly imprinted in the heart of the people.'

Following the state ceremony, Giap's body was
 flown to his home province of Quang Binh in central Vietnam, with 
hundreds of thousands of people lining the 43-mile route from the 
airport to his burial site.

Many held portraits, saying they wanted to bid the general farewell.

Vietnam
 war veteran and local resident Phan Thanh Cong said local people were 
proud that the general had chosen this location for his final resting 
place.

'It is our greatest happiness to be close to him,' he said.

The ceremony was attended by President Truong Tan Sang and other top officials and broadcast live on state television.

Giap was buried in Quang Binh instead 
of the Mai Dich cemetery in Hanoi, where most high-ranking Vietnamese 
officials are traditionally buried, in accordance with his and his 
family's wishes.

He is best remembered for leading Vietnamese forces to victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954.

His Chinese advisers told him to 
strike elite French forces fast and hard, but Giap changed plans at the 
last minute and ordered his jungle troops, clad in sandals made of old 
car tires, to besiege the French army.

The
 French were defeated after 56 days, and the unlikely victory led not 
only to Vietnam's independence, but hastened the collapse of colonialism
 across Indochina and beyond.

'No words can describe how much love and respect people reserve for Gen. Giap," 71-year-old Nguyen Thi Vi, from the central province of Ha Tinh, said as she waited in the crowd in Hanoi

'I feel like I lost one of my relatives,' she said. 'Gen. Giap will live forever in the heart of Vietnamese people and we may not witness another great man like him. We should set up temples to honor him and where people can go and pay their respect.'
