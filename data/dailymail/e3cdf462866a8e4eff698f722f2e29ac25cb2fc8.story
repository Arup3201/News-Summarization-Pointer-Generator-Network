A New York mother claims her daughter was left partially paralyzed by a marijuana-infused brownie she bought at her high school.

Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold the snack by a classmate at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn on February 27, thinking its ingredients were innocent.

But the teenager started to feel sick soon after and went to the school nurse with a racing heart rate and high blood pressure.

Concern: Danieel Buchanan, 17, was sold a pot brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn. She fell sick soon after and her mother claims she has been partially paralyzed ever since

The school then called her mother Allison at 11am to say they were taking her daughter to the emergency room at Brooklyn Hospital.

After an initial check-up she was released into her parents' care - but her condition started to dramatically deteriorate.

Her mother told PIX 11 she couldn't walk by herself, could barely eat and could only handle a few sips of tea at a time. 

At 3am the next morning, she took the youngster to Beth Israel in Manhattan, but was quickly transferred to nearby Mount Sinai.

Her mother says when Danieel arrived she began convulsing and has been partially-paralyzed ever since.

'She’s not able to walk. She can’t stand. She can’t sit up,' Mrs Buchanan told the station. 'They have never seen anything like this before.'

Blood tests revealed she had marijuana in her system - but no other drugs were present. 

Impact: The teenager is being treated in Mount Sinai hospital in New York. Her mother claims she cannot sit up by herself, walk or eat properly 

Action: The 18-year-old student who sold her the brownie at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn has been suspended and the NYPD are investigating the incident

Mrs Buchanan insists she has never been involved in drugs or alcohol before and doesn't have any underlying health problems. 

'She didn't know it had weed in there, she thought it was just a regular brownie,' Mrs Buchanan said. 

Doctors told her she needed rehabilitative therapy, but her insurance company , Empire Blue Cross, Blue shield, has denied her the coverage. The Daily Mail Online has contacted them for comment.

The 18-year-old student who sold her the brownie has been suspended and the NYPD are investigating the incident.  

History: Allison Buchanan, the girl's mother says her daughter has never been involved in drugs before and has no underlying health problems
