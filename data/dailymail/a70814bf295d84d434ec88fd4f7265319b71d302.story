A woman found hanging naked from a mansion balcony with her wrists and ankles bound committed suicide, her sister said investigators have ruled.

Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found dead more than seven weeks ago on July 13, hanging from a second-floor balcony at the historic mansion in suburban Coronado, California.

Her sister Mary Zahau-Loehner revealed the news but said she found investigators unconvincing when they broke their findings to her.

‘It doesn't add up,’ she said, after 
she was visited on Wednesday at her home in in St Joseph, Missouri, by 
investigators. ‘Nothing adds up.’

The San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department declined to comment, but Sheriff Bill Gore is planning a news
conference on Friday to discuss findings.

Ms Zahau was found dead two days after
a six-year-old boy under her care was seriously injured in a fall down 
the stairs. Max Shacknai later died.

Both were linked to Jonah Shacknai, an Arizona pharmaceuticals magnate who owns the 27-room waterfront mansion.

Ms Zahau was his girlfriend of two years and Max was his son from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008.

Ms Zahau-Loehner said investigators told her they found no suicide note. They did share text messages on her phone from months earlier about ‘issues’ between her and Mr Shacknai's children.

Ms Zahau-Loehner said she spoke with her 
sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she
planned to take her life.

She said she planned to bring Mr 
Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the 
hospital where his son was being treated.

Ms Zahau also told her sister that she would call her parents in the morning on the way to the hospital.

She emailed another sister in Germany to say she would be updating throughout the next day.

‘Too detailed planning for someone who's planning to end their life that night,’ Ms Zahau-Loehner said.

When Max fell down the stairs, Ms Zahau was at home with a 13-year-old girl who was related to her, authorities say.

He was hospitalised after paramedics found the boy wasn't breathing and did not have a pulse.

Two days later, Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, called 911 to report that Ms Zahau appeared to be dead, investigators said.

The brother was staying in a mansion guesthouse. Jonah Shacknai was not at home.

Investigators will also announce their
findings on the boy's death on Friday. They initially said they 
believed the fall was an accident.

'We've obviously had an extraordinarily difficult time. We have undertaken some tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a lifetime'

Jonah Shacknai

The home, known as the Spreckels 
mansion, is one of the more storied properties in Coronado, a small 
suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on the tip of a peninsula across a 
bay from downtown San Diego.

The home has unobstructed beach views 
and sits near Coronado's main street, which is lined with palm trees and
upscale boutiques.

Mr Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million.

The home was built in 1908 and named 
for its original owner, John D. Spreckels, who also owned newspapers the
San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune.

Mr Shacknai founded Medicis 
Pharmaceuticals and has been chairman and chief executive of the 
Scottsdale, Arizona-based company since 1988.

In a divorce filing, he filed a tax return that showed his income in 1998 at $17million.

Medicis makes acne treatments Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a competitor of Botox.

Last year, the company earned $123million on $700million in revenue.

'There are many unanswered questions'

Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina.

He told Medicis investors in August 
that he was planning to resume his daily routine of showing up at the 
office as soon as school resumed for his children in Arizona.

‘We've obviously had an 
extraordinarily difficult time,’ he said. ‘We have undertaken some 
tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a 
lifetime.’

Ms Zahau, a native of Myanmar, was an 
ophthalmic technician at Horizon Eye Specialists & Lasik Center in 
the Phoenix area from April 2008 to December 2010.

Ms Zahau-Loehner urged investigators keep the investigation open and said the family has hired an attorney. ‘There are many unanswered questions,’ she said.
