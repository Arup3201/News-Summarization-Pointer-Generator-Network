Arkansas Razorbacks head coach Bobby Petrino has been suspended after it emerged that he crashed his motorbike while giving a lift to a woman with whom he had an "inappropriate relationship".

Petrino originally claimed he was alone in the Harley Davidson smash in Crosses, KA, that left him with a cracked vertebrae, four bruised ribs and a bruised face.

But after the police report revealed that former Arkansas University volleyball star Jessica Dorrell was with him, Petrino was forced to admit he had been in a "previous" relationship with the 25-year-old.

Not alone: Petrino, left, was left with a cracked vertebrae, four bruised ribs and a bruised face in the smash with Jessica Dorrell, right

He has now been put on administrative leave while team bosses investigate.

"My concern was to protect my family and a previous inappropriate 
relationship from becoming public," the 51-year-old said 
in a statement yesterday.

"I've acknowledged this previous inappropriate relationship with my 
family and those within the athletic department administration.

"I apologize to my wife, Becky, and our four children, Chancellor 
[David] Gearhart, Jeff Long, the Board of Trustees, University 
administration, my coaching staff, student-athletes and the entire state
of Arkansas."

Petrino had previously hired Miss Dorrell as the student-athlete development coordinator for football at the Arkansas team.

Unharmed in the accident, it was her who flagged down a passing car to help the stricken Petrino, police said.

However he repeatedly said he was alone in the wreck.

"When I came out of a ditch, there was a lady there that had flagged down a car," Petrino said to reporters on Tuesday.

In a news conference also yesterday, Athletic Director Jeff Long said the coach would be on paid leave until he had conducted a review into the 
circumstances surrounding Petrino's accident.

"I am disappointed Coach Petrino did not share with me, when he had the 
opportunity to, the full extent of the accident and who was involved," 
he said.

But he added: "I expect to move very expeditiously in my review of this personnel 
matter and hope to have a resolution soon."

He said he 
did not know yet if Miss Dorrell would also be suspended from her position at
the university.

Taver Johnson will act as temporary team head coach while the matter is resolved, he said.
