Vera, the TV detective, has always been good at collaring her man, but not so efficient at finding one for herself.

The first three series of the popular ITV drama have been all about her police work rather than her private life, but as the fourth series gets underway, Brenda Blethyn, who plays her, suggests that may be about to change.

'Watch this space,' she teases. 'My feeling is that Vera had romantic attachments in the past... and she may do again in the future. I know the public would like her to become romantically involved. I get letters from all over the world suggesting it. "Bellissima Vera," they write. "Why she no boyfriend, she lovely!"'

Brenda says that the fourth series of Vera might see a more personal side to the detective

Brenda herself has been with her partner Michael Mayhew, the former head of graphic design at the National Theatre, for three decades and they married in June 2010.

They've obviously cracked it as far as compatibility is concerned, but Brenda isn't about to go all mushy when she reveals their secret to domestic bliss.

'I think it helps that I'm up in Northumberland half the time filming Vera, so long may it continue,' she laughs.

'But seriously, I genuinely think it's about having our own space. We have a place on the coast in my hometown of Ramsgate in Kent, and even when we're there we sit in separate rooms, Michael with his music in one, me with my crossword in another. We have so little in common but the relationship obviously works. Michael makes me laugh like nobody else does, and I think he likes me for my honesty and my kindness.

'Although the honesty can irritate him. I've sometimes come home from auditions and told him I've recommended somebody else for the role rather than me, and that really gets on his nerves. "Why do you always put yourself second Brenda?" he says. "Why do you talk about who else would be good for the part, rather than you? Don't do that!"

'But I can't help it and I don't think it's damaged my career. I couldn't have wanted the part that much if I were recommending somebody else, and if I were thinking about a particular person for the role the chances are the producers were too.

'But I have an urge to be honest, whatever the situation. I'm trying to sell my home in south London at the moment, and I know I'd have to tell any potential buyer all its little flaws, and Michael knows I would too. No wonder the estate agent doesn't want me around while he's showing people the house.'

Brenda, 68, is refreshingly honest about pretty much everything. When she says she never wanted children, for example, you absolutely believe her.

'Once in a blue moon I've wished I had but it's been so fleeting that it's not been a bother to me. The things I wish I had done I've done, wherever possible. I wanted to run a marathon so I did the London one in 2002, 2003 and 2004 and was really pleased with myself, although I thought I might be brought home in a box! But I had to do it even though I was never the quickest. The person next to me on the starting line one year, a gentleman of 93, was quicker than me!

'Now my aim is to learn a foreign language because one of the greatest regrets in my life has been not doing that. I studied French for a movie I did called London River about five years ago. I went on a crash course for three weeks but then I forgot it all, so now I'm taking French lessons again whenever I go down to Ramsgate. I'm determined to crack it.'

Comparisons between Brenda and Vera are not easy to find. The actress is far more glamorous than her alter ego. Slim and glowing, Brenda arrives for our meeting in a black chiffon blouse and a cream trouser suit, topped off with stylishly coiffed copper-coloured hair, while Vera's happy to waddle around in several layers of unflattering clothing and a green fisherman's hat.

When asked at a wedding recently why Vera's so frumpy, Brenda replied, 'Because that's the way she's written in Ann Cleeves' original books. Making her glamorous would be like making Hannibal Lecter a vegetarian.'

It is Brenda's total dedication to a role that led her to two Oscar nominations, for her performances in Secrets & Lies in 1996 and Little Voice two years later. And she takes Vera, which regularly attracts more than 6 million viewers, just as seriously.

Brenda says that her character Vera is so frumpy because that is how she is written in the novel

While she's up in the north-east filming for months on end Brenda immerses herself in local life to give herself a better understanding of Vera's Geordie culture.

'I love it when people feel they own Vera,' she says. 'When they know we're filming in the area they come out of their homes with tables and chairs and watch us, offering us cups of tea and cakes and occasionally glasses of wine. I love the fact that people want to be close to the show and that they like it so much and pay me compliments when they see me around Newcastle.

'And I do whatever I can to make it successful. I made the mistake of losing Vera's distinctive hat a while ago, and although I found it again I made sure there'd never be an occasion where Vera was potentially hatless again. I tracked down the same hat to a fishing shop in Newcastle and bought one, and then I ordered four more like it online.'

'Making Vera glamorous would be like making Hannibal Lecter a vegetarian.'

One of nine children, Brenda - born Brenda Bottle - had a poor but happy upbringing, and remains refreshingly down-to-earth despite being one of our most in-demand actresses.

'To be good at what I do means everything,' she says. 'I'm a working-class girl and I'm really happy when the producers and directors are happy with what I'm doing on Vera. I'd find failing at my job embarrassing and humiliating, and I know Vera would too. She's been known to bend the rules, but she always tries to do the right thing and always knows what the right thing to do is. I'm not sure people necessarily know what the right thing to do is any more, or are even allowed to do it in our society.

'When I was growing up we were all taught you shouldn't answer a policeman back, that there were consequences if you weren't considerate or stole something. Now you get several chances before you even get reprimanded.

'Things started to change when discipline was taken away from parents and teachers. I don't condone corporal punishment and I know laws were brought in because children were being abused. But have the abusers stopped? I doubt it. And parents and teachers who would have disciplined their children aren't allowed to do it any more. Something's gone wrong with society and it needs to change. And probably quite fast.'

Vera, tomorrow, 8pm, ITV.
