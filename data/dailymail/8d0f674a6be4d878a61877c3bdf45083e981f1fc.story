Hull manager Steve Bruce admits his scouts drew a blank when asked to find a chink in Chelsea's armour.

The Barclays Premier League leaders may have surrendered their unbeaten record against Newcastle last week, but even that does not fill Bruce with optimism.

The Blues are fierce hosts at Stamford Bridge and will be even more hungry than usual as they look to atone for dropping points last time out.

The scale of the challenge is not lost on Bruce, who revealed his analysts had not been overly helpful in plotting a way past Jose Mourinho's men.

Hull boss Steve Bruce admits he struggled to find a weakness in Chelsea's side

'It's funny...one of the reports I get from the scouts usually tries to highlight a weakness and this one came back as 'none: they don't have any weakness', which I thought was quite amusing.

'They have marvellous talent. they haven't just got flair players, they're good at set-pieces, they're big and strong, they're powerful, good in attacking areas.

'They're one of the best teams in Europe and they've arguably got the best coach too. He's box office, the fella. What Jose has done is quite remarkable.

'I remember going there with Sunderland a few years ago (2010) and winning 3-0, which always sticks with me, but that doesn't happen very often.'

Defeat at St James' Park quashed growing expectation that Chelsea would match Arsenal's 'Invincibles' this season, but Bruce would not have been surprised to see them repeat that feat.

'They had the look of being unbeatable didn't they?' he added.

'Jose's come back in and does what he does very well.

'You have to go and work against Chelsea because they do. They're a terrific team who everyone thought would be unbeatable. It just shows you what this league is that their eight- or nine-point lead has been taken down to three.

'So if we go with the same mentality as we did to Liverpool and Arsenal, who knows, maybe we can take something from them.'

Bruce knows this is a big time of year for Hull after they slipped into the bottom three

Despite relishing the challenge of taking on the title favourites, Bruce's priorities over the festive period are likely to lie elsewhere.

Swansea, Sunderland and Leicester represent the next three games and it is results against those sides that provide the best route out of the bottom three.

'Now is a big month coming up, we have big games coming up and let's hope we can go and win a couple of them and put us back in mid-table where we all want to be,' he said.

'We're probably four or five points short of where we want to be and we've got a cluster of games coming up over Christmas. If we can put back to back wins together you could find yourself up in the top half of the division.'
