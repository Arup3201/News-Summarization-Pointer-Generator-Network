British cyclist Mark Cavendish narrowly avoided a collision with a cat on the first day of the iconic Ghent Six-Day track event.

A stray cat wondered onto the velodrome track when the 2011 Tour de France Green jersey winner was approaching the final bend of the high speed Het Kuipke arena.

Luckily the cat escaped unharmed and Cavendish clawed his way back into contention to finish second overall with Omega Pharma-Quick Step team-mate Iljo Keisse.

Cavendish has had a torrid season with injuries, having crashed out on the first day of the Tour de France this summer and is considering a return to the track next season.

The sprint cyclist, who won world Madison gold on the track in 2005 and 2008, is following in the footsteps of Sir Bradley Wiggins who won the historic event back in 2003.

On a bespoke velodrome, riders lap at around 11 seconds covering hundreds of laps every night for six hours as the 13 teams of two riders compete over a series of different disciplines including points and elimination races.
