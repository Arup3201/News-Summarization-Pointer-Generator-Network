Taliban suicide bombers have attacked a government building in Afghanistan sparking a six-hour armed battle gun fight with Kabul police, resulting in eight deaths.

Insurgents launched the attack on the police traffic headquarters before dawn in the Afghan capital, by setting off a suicide bomb in a car outside the gates, which killed two Taliban.

Three insurgents then stormed the building sparking the standoff which resulted in the deaths of three police officers and the attackers.

Shooting and explosions could still be 
heard outside the compound shortly after noon, but police insisted the 
situation was under control and that the insurgents were surrounded.

Kabul police officer Mirza Mohammad 
said at least one insurgent blew himself up at the entrance to the 
compound and a number of others wearing suicide vests entered the 
building.

Nine hours after the attack began,Â  the second such Taliban raid in Kabul in five days, police commandos killed the last two insurgents holed up in the headquarters.

Kabul Police chief Mohammad Ayub Salangi said two Taliban died at the gate when their suicide vests exploded, another blew himself up inside the building and two more were killed by security forces before they managed to detonate their explosives.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid 
claimed responsibility for the attack and said the target of the 
insurgents was a police training facility 'run by foreign military 
forces.'

The traffic police headquarters is 
not heavily guarded, and an unlikely target for the insurgents.

However it is also adjacent to the 
Afghan border police headquarters and a police training facility, which may have been the actual target of the attack.

The traffic police facility, usually 
teeming with civilians seeking to get drivers licenses and registrations
 for vehicles, was nearly empty at the time of the attack.

Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said the assault began with a suicide car bombing near the building.

Two insurgents, he said, were then shot and killed by Afghan forces. Four Afghan police commandos have been injured.

Aftermath: The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack which took place in Kabul before dawn today

Mr Sediqi said there were no civilian casualties in the attack.

The area has been surrounded by Afghan security forces, he said, and police commandos are conducting the operation.

He
 said: 'This shows the ability of the Afghan forces, that they are 
leading the operation. There are no foreign forces are involved.'

A unit of NATO special forces that trains and mentors Afghan police was at the scene but not taking part in the operation.

Gul Rahman, who owns a nearby shop, said he heard at least two explosions when the attack started just before dawn.

Eyewitnesses said a number of big explosions were heard in and around the building along with heavy gunfire.

One police officer Abdullah Hamidi said two of the explosions were caused by a man in a suicide vest and another by a car bomb.

Damage: Flames can be seen rising from behind a government building following today's Taliban attack

Last Wednesday, six Taliban suicide bombers attacked the gates of the Afghan intelligence agency in downtown Kabul, killing one guard and wounding dozens.

Security forces killed all the attackers.

The insurgents carried out the attack by driving a minivan loaded with explosives into a gate of the intelligence agency compound in the capital at noon.

The other five attackers wearing suicide vests were in a second minivan that was also loaded with explosives.

They were shot and killed and security forces later defused the bomb in their minivan.

The attacks highlighted ongoing violence in Afghanistan and the determination of the insurgency to continue fighting even as President Hamid Karzai and the U.S. negotiate for a quicker pullout of American forces.

President Barack Obama said after meeting Karzai in Washington earlier this month that the U.S.-led military coalition would hand over the lead for security around the country to Afghan forces this spring - months ahead of schedule.

Obama also said he agreed with Karzai that the Taliban should open a political office in the Gulf state of Qatar to facilitate peace talks.
