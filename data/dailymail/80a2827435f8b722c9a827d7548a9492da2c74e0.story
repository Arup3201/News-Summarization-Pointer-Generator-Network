A rare monkey who was abducted with her baby by gangsters in a planned zoo raid has given birth to healthy twins.

Mamma, a 15-month-old Cotton-top Tamarin, was snatched from Blackpool Zoo with four other animals last April. 

While she and three other monkeys were recovered by police, her offspring was never found.

But more than a year later, the monkey has given birth to healthy twins. 

A Blackpool Zookeeper confirmed the babies were born on August 1 and were doing well. 

'The two new babies, who are yet to be sexed and named, are doing extremely well and we are delighted for them.

'The pair are also vital for the international breeding programme, so it is great news all round,' said Charlotte Pennie, Senior Primate Keeper. 

'Keepers at Blackpool Zoo were devastated earlier this year when five of our monkeys were stolen, as every single animal we have here is considered a member of our zoo family.'

'We worked very closely with Lancashire Police and following huge media interest four of the five were found days later,' she added. 

The monkeys were snatched from their enclosures last April after thieves cut through fencing.  

Mamma was stolen alongside four other monkeys, including her baby, by gangsters last April 

The Cotton-top Tamarin was found three days after being stolen in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire 

Lancashire Police believed they were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets for wealthy buyers, it was claimed.

The cotton-top tamarin is a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg. 

One of the smallest primates, it is easily identified by the long white sagittal crest extending from its forehead to its shoulders. 

Up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976 when they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned.

The wild population is estimated at 6,000 individuals, with 2,000 adults, with the species listed in among the World's 25 Most Endangered Primates in 2012. 

Experts say small monkeys like tamarins and macaques are becoming an increasingly popular pet in the US despite a ban by several states ban on owning a primate.

They were discovered in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire days later, but Mamma's missing baby has never been found. 

Keepers feared Mamma not recover from the shock of losing her offspring after showing signs of sadness.

But tests later showed the rare animal was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time of the traumatic theft. 

After returning to the zoo, the rescued were kept separated from other primates in case they didn't recognise them and attacked them. 

At the time Miss Pennie said: 'That was a serious concern but with the speedy return we got them back in time and managed to reintegrate them well. 

'The female was very quiet when she first came back - that may have been the stress as well as the fact she was missing her baby.

'They had a few marks on them but otherwise they came back healthy. We were all so happy to get them back - to be honest to get any of them back was brilliant.

'But the baby was so dependent on its mother, I think we have come to the conclusion we are not going to see that one again.'

Police who worked with the National Wildlife Crime Unit to trace the monkeys say investigations into the burglary are ongoing. 

The 15-month-old animal hasn't let her new twin offspring out of her sight since welcoming them three weeks ago

Mamma was sad and quiet when she returned to the enclosure after losing her baby last April, keepers said 

Keepers feared she may never recover from the loss. Mamma is pictured running around the Blackpool Zoo Tamarin enclosure with her two new babies on her back 

No arrests have been made in connection with the theft at Blackpool Zoo (pictured) last year say Lancashire Police
