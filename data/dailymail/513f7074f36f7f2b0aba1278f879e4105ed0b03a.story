Lewis Hamilton broached the subject that may yet tarnish the crown of the 2014 world champion —the absurd double points to be awarded at the last race in Abu Dhabi.

If he should lose by that arbitrary and inflated margin it would ‘suck’, he said.

Hamilton’s words were less startling than his attire. He came to the paddock here dressed as a one-man art gallery.

At the end of a chunky gold chain hung an Andy Warhol print of Mercedes 300 SL Coupes.

But back to the points dispute, Hamilton said: ‘The question is what is fair. This is a rule they have brought in for the first time.

‘We have to deal with it and hope for the best, but it would suck if that was the case.

‘I am not going to let any negative energy into this and what will be will be. Everyone will be in the same boat.

‘You never know what is going to happen but I have been there before and I know what it is like to go to the last race and lose the championship.

‘But I don’t feel that is going to happen. The car has been going great and I hope it will be great for the final three (races).’

Hamilton takes a 17-point lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg into Sunday’s race — a more slender margin than it sounds with 100 points on offer between here, Brazil (a week on Sunday) and Abu Dhabi (November 23).

Hamilton, who stopped off for a TV appearance in New York en route to Texas, was in a jaunty mood, pleased with his new jewellery.

‘I designed it,’ he said.

‘I like designing things and I am into art. I saw the Andy Warhol painting come up in an auction but the bidding went too far. So I got it on a smaller scale — and much more cheaply. I can change the art piece and keep the frame.’

Daniel Ricciardo was sporting a new look on Thursday, and says he expects a good result this weekend

Away from the championship battle, 17-year-old Max Verstappen will return to the cockpit in practice for Toro Rosso.

His involvement is a bright spot for a race missing the four cars of Marussia and Caterham, the two teams in administration.

The paddock is still thinking of the stricken Jules Bianchi, the Marussia driver who was injured in the Japanese Grand Prix a month ago.

His family said he remains critical but stable in hospital in Yokkaichi.

‘Jules does indeed continue to fight,’ they added in a statement.

In response, the FIA are expected to trial a new safety procedure in practice — a compulsory slower lap time when accidents occur but a safety car is not deployed.
