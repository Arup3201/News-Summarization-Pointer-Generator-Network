One fisherman got more than he bargained for while on the hunt for Kingfish when he hoisted up a four metre bull shark from the water.

Damon Smith-Horak was out fishing off Sydney harbour last week when he snared the monster shark, which weighed in at 200kg.

It took him over two hours to reel the ten foot shark in, about 500m off Watson’s Bay.

Speaking to Nine news. Mr Smith-Horak said it was one of the biggest sharks he had ever seen. 

‘It’s the biggest bull shark I've ever seen it was about 10 ½ foot long,' he said. 

While Sydney harbour is a haven for sun worshippers, it wasn't the first shark to come across Mr Smith-Horak's path.

The four metre bull shark was the third shark to take the bait from his line, but it was the only one he managed to keep on the end of the hook. 

Mr Smith-Horak caught the whole fishing battle on film and viewers can clearly see the veteran fisherman reeling the massive shark in on a simple fishing rod.

In the video, the man behind the camera seems to be wary of the shark as Mr Smith-Horak reels it in, declaring 'it's going to eat the boat'.

Fortunately for the men, the shark didn't eat the boat and they managed to get the mammoth animal back to shore. 

Mr Smith-Horak told Nine news that he believes the shark's presence in Sydney harbour was a good sign. 

'It’s actually a good sign it just goes to show how much we have cleaned up our harbours,' he said.

The video comes after NSW Premier Mike Baird has promised $100,000 to trial shark-detecting sonar technology, which will undergo rigorous testing at an aquarium before general use.

The trial comes after shocking underwater footage revealed many of the nets which partially cover NSW beaches reportedly 'have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through'.

'The expectation is, as the sonar comes out there is an understating they will pick up the sharks in the beaches and that will be texted back to lifesavers on the ground to take early action, early warning,' Premier Mike Baird said on Sunday.
