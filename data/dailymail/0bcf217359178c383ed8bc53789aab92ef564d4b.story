Sick plans: Former high school librarian Christopher Asch  is being accused of plotting to torture, rape and murder women and children

When federal authorities nabbed an NYPD cop plotting to kill, cook and eat women two years ago, they opened up a dark underground full of men planning to do just the same thing.

Christopher Asch, the 62-year-old former librarian of Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, was arrested in the course of the investigation into 'cannibal cop' Gilberto Valle and is now facing charges of his own.

Prosecutors say Asch and another man, Richard Meltz, offered to help 23-year-old Michael Van Hise rape and murder Van Hise's wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's kids.

In federal court on Wednesday, FBI 
Agent Jason Floyd described some of the evidence they found in a search 
of Asch's Greenwcih Village home - including a 'very extreme' S&M 
pornographic film which they believe Asch watched to prepare for the 
murder.

Federal
 agents initially planned to show screengrabs of 'Pain 35' - a 
pronographic video which Asch had two copies of -  to the jury, but none
 were shown in court on Wednesday.

So
 Floyd described the video, saying it depicts two men torturing women 
who 'appeared to be consenting' with nipple clamps, leg spreaders, a 
riding crop, handcuffs, rope and needles inserted into one of the 
woman's buttocks, breast and genitals.

Manhattan
 federal Judge Paul Gardephe told the jury he watched the video before 
allowing it entered into evidence and described it as 'very disturbing'.

Cannibal cop connections: Authorities found out about Asch's plan while investigating Gilberto Valle, a NYPD officer who had plans of his own to kill and eat up to 100 women. Valle was convicted last year

Jurors cringed as Floyd continued to 
describe the torture, saying the women had clamps with 'small metal 
teeth' attached to their vaginas 'with weights attached to the clamps', 
the New York Post reported.

Asch's
 defense lawyer Brian Waller said the video was just a form of S&M 
festish, and the plot was just a fantasy the librarian never planned to 
carry out in real life.

But Agent Floyd responded that it wasn't any run-of-the-mill fetish video, but 'a very extreme form' of S&M.

Asch and cohort Richard Meltz met Van Hise on festish site Dark Fetish, a favorite of cannibal-cop Valle.

In
 2012 Van Hise, of New Jersey approached Asch and Meltz for help with 
the plot to rape and murder his wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's 
children.

Working together: Prosecutors say Asch worked with Richard Meltz (left) to help Michael Van Hise (right) when the 23-year-old asked the two men with help raping and killing his wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's children

NBC New York reported that the FBI 
came into contact with Asch when he responded to an online ad where 
someone had posted that they wanted help kidnapping, raping and kill his
 wife, sister-in-law and the sister-in-law's children.

The ad was posted in October 2012 and Asch met with undercover FBI agents to discuss a similar plot in recent months.

At
 two of the meetings, he brought items that he reportedly thought would 
be useful including a taser, a black ski mask, handcuffs, a hammer, 
pliers and forceps.

The 
agents set it up so that Asch conducted surveillance on a woman- not 
knowing that she was also a member of the undercover operation.

During one conversation with another meeting with agents, Asch reportedly said the female target 'had to die'.

Asch was the one who brought Meltz into the operation, saying that he wanted to help with the kidnapping of the woman.

'This is a fairly high-risk operation,' Asch said in a recorded conversation with Meltz.

'Trying to snatch somebody off the street, home invasion, I think they're pretty high-risk.

'I mean, there are ways to dismember and dispose.'

If convicted, Asch and Van Hise face life in prison.

Meltz took a plea deal in January.
