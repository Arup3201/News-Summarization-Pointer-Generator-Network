A Reverend who was dumped in a vacant lot when she was a baby has been reunited with the police officer who rescued her more than 50 years on.

Toni DiPina was abandoned by her parents among rusting cars and appliances on a disused patch of ground in St Louis, Missouri, when she was nine months old.

Today, no-one has ever come forward to claim her and, for decades, all she knew of the day that  changed her life forever was a report by officer George Leuckel who was called to collect her.

Now, for the first time, they have enjoyed an emotional reunion to share the unique bond they had carried with them during their very separate lives.

Mr Leuckel, now 79, said he seriously considered adopting her, but felt it would not be possible to take in a black baby in the deeply segregated St Louis of 1963.

'The thought had crossed my mind to take her home, but there was no way you could do that back then,' he told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

Mrs DiPina, now 51, was discovered by two boys in a vacant lot off Bell Avenue on May 26, 1963.

What wasn't mentioned in the official police reports was the immediate connection that was forged when Mr Leuckel first scooped her up.

Detailing the encounter in full for the first time, Mr Leuckel said the baby stared at him quietly without crying and then clutched him when he took her to be assessed at the nearby hospital.

She was later taken to an emergency foster home and they lost contact.

After a troubled upbringing, Mrs DiPina went on to become a nanny with a respectable family in central Massachusetts, going on to gain a college degree and bringing up a family of her own. 

She later became a pastor.

In 2008, she read a report in the St Louis Post-Dispatch of a boy who was abandoned in very similar circumstances.

She came forward to tell her story in the hope it might encourage someone to come forward for the boy and herself, but neither did.

Then, last year, she decided to launch another appeal on Facebook - and called Mr Leuckel for the first time.

They finally met on January 3 at the Oakville condominium Mr Leuckel shares with his wife Barbara and their daughter, named, coincidentally, Toni.
