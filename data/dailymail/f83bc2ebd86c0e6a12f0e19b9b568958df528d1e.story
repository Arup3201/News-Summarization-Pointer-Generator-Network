An internet pirate who set up a music sharing website which cost industry bosses more than £240 million has been jailed.

Kane Robinson, 26, of Wyndham Way, North Shields in North Tyneside founded dancingjesus.com, a website which attracted more than 70 million users and allowed them to listen to almost any song or album before its release date.

The website boasted it was unrivalled in providing unreleased material from artists such as Adele, Kanye West and the Arctic Monkeys.

Despite Robinson's efforts to remain anonymous, a joint enterprise by British Phonographic investigators, City of London police and US authorities - including Homeland security - managed to obtain court orders to find out who had registered the site's domain name.

A court has heard Robinson was also behind a similar music service site called CHOONZM8 which was linked to his Facebook profile page.

The court heard during the 2006 to 2011 existence of dancingjesus.com it contained almost every recording released by the music industry and had a catalogue of more than a quarter of a million tracks.

Newcastle Crown Court was told what little money Robinson made from the illegal enterprise was spent on upkeep of the site and his main motivation was the 'kudos' of releasing music first.

Robinson admitted two offences under the Copyright Act and was jailed for 32 months.

Contributor Richard Graham, 22, of Station Road, Leicester, who shared thousands of illegal songs on the site, admitted similar offences and was jailed for 21 months.

Judge Deborah Sherwin said: 'It is easy to think of activities such as this as victimless crime but I have seen evidence that it is far from being the case.

'The music industry in the UK loses around a billion pounds per annum.This effects the industry's ability to find and promote new artists.

'Existing artists are deprived of royalties and while some may be wealthy and successful, many are not so and struggle to earn a living.'

Industry experts claim the site cost the music industry an estimated £242 million in losses.

Prosecutor David Groome told the court dancingjesus.com was an internet forum where users logged in to share, discuss and request music they wanted to hear.

Users would click on a link where they could get free songs on slow download or pay for fast speed.

Mr Groome said: 'Dancingjesus.com had singles and albums prior to the official release dates and claimed to be unrivalled in that.

'It was perceived by the industry as presenting a real and serious threat to their economic interests.

'In 2010 and 2011, out of the best selling 50 singles worldwide, 46 were leaked first via the dancingjesus.com website.'

Robinson admitted what he had been doing when police raided his home and shut down the site in 2011.

Defence barristers said both men work hard in legitimate jobs and were very young during the illegal internet activities.

The Director of BPI's Copyright Protection Unit, David Wood, said: 'Today's sentencing sends a clear message to the operators and users of illegal music sites that online piracy is a criminal activity that will not be tolerated by law enforcement in the UK or overseas.

'Piracy - particularly pre-release - can make or break an artist's career, and can determine whether a record label is able to invest in that crucial second or third album.

'In this day and age with so many quality digital music services available offering access to millions of tracks through free and premium tiers, there is no good reason to use pirate sites that give nothing back to artists and offer a sub-standard experience for consumers.

'Speaking as a music fan, it just doesn't make sense to help criminals when you can support artists.'

Jeremy Banks, IFPI Director of Anti-Piracy, added: 'This case is an excellent example of law enforcement agencies cooperating to tackle online criminal activity, which has a real impact on record companies and their ability to invest in artists.

'The illegal uploading of pre-release music can have a potentially devastating impact on the commercial success of an artist, making it more difficult for them to maintain a career in music.

'I would like to thank the authorities in the UK and the US for their work in resolving this case.'

Huw Watkins, Head of the Intellectual Property Office Intelligence Hub, said: 'The IPO is committed to supporting rights holders in enforcing IP rights and this sentence shows how seriously the court takes such activity.

'This case demonstrates how successful intelligence and enforcement agencies working in partnership can be in stopping IP infringement.'
