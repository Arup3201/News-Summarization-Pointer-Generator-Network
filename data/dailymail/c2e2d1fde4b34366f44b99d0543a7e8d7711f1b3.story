We may be living in the age of 'social' media, but when it comes to munching, we're doing it alone.

Industry research group NPD has concluded that Americans eat breakfast solo 60per cent of the time, and lunch 55per cent of the time. The only meal we are still enjoying with company is dinner, eating alone around 32per cent of the time.

NPD put the trend down to our hectic schedules, greater tendency to travel, and the rise of single-person households.

Lone munching: NDP research found that many of us are frequently dining alone, perhaps in part because almost a third of all U.S. households are now one-person homes

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost a third of all American households today comprise of a single person, and only 20per cent of all households are now made up of married couples with children. This means more people are living - and thus eating - solo than ever before in history.

And even if we do live together as a family, a vast majority of us report eating a meal together less than five days a week, a recent Harris poll found. Additionally, we are so busy and mobile, according to a separate study conducted by Stanford University, that we eat one in every five meals in our car.

The implications of these habits, especially for children, are profound.

A major study conducted by the National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that children who do not eat dinner with their parents at least five times a week tend to perform less well academically, report being less close with their families, and are more likely to get into trouble with drugs and alcohol than children who do have more family meals.

Additionally, children who eat dinner as with their families less than twice a week are 40per cent more likely to be overweight.

Psychologist Dr Anne Fishel, who wrote a book titled Home for Dinner: Mixing, Food, Fun, and Conversation for a Happier Family and Healthier Kids, believes that eating in company is vital to our emotional health.

'Most American families are starved for 
time to spend together, and dinner may be the only time of the day when 
we can reconnect'

'Most American families are starved for time to spend together, and dinner may be the only time of the day when we can reconnect, leaving behind our individual pursuits like playing video games, emailing and doing homework,' she wrote for The Family Dinner Project.

'Dinner is a time to relax, recharge, laugh, tell stories and catch up on the dayâ€™s ups and downs, while developing a sense of who we are as a family.'

Dr Fishel suggests cooking up large batches of soups or stews over the weekend that can be frozen and then served quickly and easily during the week.
