Stoke City midfielder Steven Nzonzi can be revealed as the Premier League star whose car was involved in a smash with a cyclist now being investigated by police.

The incident has led to an amazing Twitter campaign backed by Sir Chris Hoy to identify the player, who urged his 520,000 followers: 'please find him'.

Nzonzi is alleged to have laughed at the cyclist and told him ‘good luck finding me on foreign plates’ before driving away from the accident in his luxury car last week.

The star was unavailable for comment but MailOnline can confirm he is the player involved.

Greater Manchester Police say they have identified the man and plan to speak to him at an appointment to be arranged next week.

The alleged incident: Rob Lockhart was cycling through Hale in Trafford at the time Nzonzi allegedly hit him

Olympic gold medal cyclist Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the image of the car driving off, and the above altercation between the motorist and Mr Lockhart, and urged the public to help detectives catch him

In question: Stoke midfielder Nzonzi is the Premier League player being hunted in connection with the incident

It is understood the 24-year-old French 
midfielder, who joined Stoke from Blackburn for £3million last summer, 
has been advised by lawyers not to speak out in case it becomes a police
matter.

Rob Lockhart said the driver refused to swap insurance details after the incident last week because 'it didn't apply' when an accident involves a bike and a car

Today it is understood Greater Manchester Police have requested CCTV from a Hale bank so they can view the incident in detail

After hearing of the altercation, Olympic 
legend Hoy retweeted a picture of the car and urged the public to help 
detectives catch him.

Greater Manchester Police said they 
were still trying to track down the man involved but would not confirm his
identity, although he has been named online.

The cyclist, Rob Lockhart, claims the 
player’s matt-black Audi Q7 braked suddenly in Hale, near Manchester, 
last Thursday night and he bruised his face and damaged his bike after 
smashing into the back.

Mr Lockhart said: ‘He pulled away and 
then pulled over sharply to park on double yellow lines outside a cash 
point. It was dangerous.

‘I hit the back window with my head, helmet and face. I had mild concussion for two to three days afterwards.

‘He got out of his car and said, 
“Sorry, I didn’t see you”. Then he just walked to the cashpoint. I 
didn’t feel he had any regard for me and what had just happened. He 
didn’t seem to care. 

‘I was in shock, checking myself,  the
bike and the car to see what was damaged. When he walked back to his 
car I said we need to exchange insurance details and he said “No”. He 
said, “You’re on a bike and I’m in a car, it doesn’t matter”. He was 
really laid back, not angry. He didn’t even check if his car was 
damaged.

‘I tried to get my phone out to take a
picture and he laughed and said, “You won’t trace me because my plates 
are foreign”. He then left the scene.

‘I called the police when I got home. I
don’t know who he was, he had a foreign accent. I don’t follow 
football. I just want all this sorted out.’

Support: Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy backed a Twitter campaign to identify the player

Message: Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the message and the attached pictures to his 529,000 followers

Two witnesses took photos of the car 
and driver, which Lockhart shared on Twitter. Hoy was among thousands to
retweet the pictures and users soon responded by linking Nzonzi.

Hoy retweeted: ‘This chap said “good 
luck finding me on foreign plates” after knocking a cyclist over in 
Hale. Please help find him.’

Stoke have refused to comment about Nzonzi’s involvement in the alleged incident.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester 
Police said: ‘The driver failed to stop at the scene and we are making 
efforts to trace and speak to him.

‘Witnessed have also helped us and we are pursuing these leads. Any  information we receive that may help will be acted upon.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
