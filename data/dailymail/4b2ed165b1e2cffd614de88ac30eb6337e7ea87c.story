Fluid feast: The liquid lunch, above, contains turkey gel, umami-rich gravy, carrot fluid gel, dehydrated Brussels sprouts and potato-infused foam

For most of us, Christmas is a time to ditch the diet. But jockeys have to forego all festive treats to stay light enough for winter races.

So food scientist Dr Rachel Edwards-Stuart and bookmakers William Hill have now created the first ever liquid Christmas lunch – containing just 294 calories – for riders in the William Hill Winter Festival at Kempton Park this weekend.

The high-tech fluid festive feast contains turkey gel, umami-rich gravy, carrot fluid gel, dehydrated Brussels sprouts, potato-infused foam and cranberry 'air'. And it is served with an espresso-style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter – an extra 38 calories. 

Unlike the rest of us, jockeys aren’t able to get stuck into the classic 7,000 plus calorie Christmas dinner. 

The drink is a balanced, high carbohydrate, low glycaemic load meal which provides all the nutrition needed for a jockey to remain light, yet full of energy and sharply focused before a big race.

Jon Ivan-Duke at William Hill said: 'Christmas is a time when we all want to let ourselves go and enjoy all the different foods on offer but the top jockeys can't do that.

'Typically jockeys trying to make weight will eat a restricted calorie diet in the run up to a big race, so the traditional Christmas lunch was most definitely off the menu for those racing at the William Hill Winter Festival.

'The usual festive fare for jockeys riding on Boxing Day would be a slither of turkey, a couple of sprouts and a few water biscuits.

'Even then they will probably spend a couple of hours on race day in the sauna sweating off those last few pounds!'

Champion jockey A P McCoy who will be riding at the William Hill Winter Festival at Kempton Park on Boxing Day added: 'This is a great invention for jockeys who are struggling to make weight for the William Hill King George but still want to feel part of their family's festive celebrations.

'I always used to feel a bit left out when they all started tucking in to their turkey so this year I am looking forward to enjoying the full flavours of Christmas lunch, without having to worry about the calories.'

Treat: The meal is served with an espresso-style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter (pictured) – an extra 38 calories. A traditional Christmas lunch contains more than 7,000 calories

Clever: One jockey said that the liquid feast was a great invention for those who did not want to forego all festive treats. It offers riders the full flavours of Christmas lunch, without all of the extra calories. (File image)
