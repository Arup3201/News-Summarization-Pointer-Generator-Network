Racing legend Lester Piggott has put his bespoke-designed stables - which has sent out 34 winning race horses - on the market for £1.25 million.

The flat-race ex-jockey, who rode almost 4,500 wins, is selling Eve Lodge Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk, which he designed in 1985.

The stables, which covers more than five
 acres of land, includes an indoor arena, paddocks, 95 horse boxes and a
 manager's house, which boasts three bedrooms.

The house and stables owned by flat-race legend Lester Piggott in Newmarket, Suffolk, have been put on the market for £1.25million

At its peak, the stables, which Piggott designed more than 30 years ago, housed 97 horses and sent out 34 winners

The racing yard, part of the plot set over more than five acres of land, is currently leased to trainer James Toler and race horse handler Gill Duffield

Lester Piggott, pictured here after the Cambridgeshire race at Newmarket racecourse in September 1993, is understood to be selling the  Eve Lodge Stables because he and his wife Susan no longer need them

There are also four semi-detached cottages on the site, each with two bedrooms, as well as direct access to 'The Gallops' training 
grounds at Newmarket racecourse.

Piggott, 
78, currently leases the racing yard out to trainer James Toller and 
Arab race horse handler Gill Duffield but has now decided to sell up.

At its peak, the stables, which Piggott designed more than 30 years ago, housed 97 horses and sent out 34 
winners.

But Piggott and his wife, Susan, who no longer live at the 
property, are understood to be selling the site on Hamilton Road as it 
is 'surplus to requirements'.

Gemma Bailey, from Bidwells, the estate 
agents which is marketing the land, said: 'It is not everyday that we 
get to sell the training yard of one of the country's best known and 
most successful jockeys.

'It
 is in immaculate condition and is in one of the leading locations for 
the horse training industry. We hope to see considerable interest in the
 yard.'

The stables were specifically
 designed by Piggott with a jockey's eye for detail.

It is said that Piggott was greatly influenced by a visit to 
Colin Hayes, an Australian champion trainer, and his Lindsay Park 
establishment in Adelaide, when he designed the stables.

Piggott and his wife have two daughters, Maureen, a former eventer, and 
Tracy, a sports presenter for RTE in Ireland.

Piggott is one of the most famous jockeys in British history. In a career spanning 48 years, he was champion
 jockey 11 times and also had 30 Classic wins, including a record nine in The Derby.

He also had 116 successes at Royal Ascot in a total of 4,493 career wins in 
Britain - a record that only Sir Gordon Richards and Pat Eddery have bettered.

He won the Oaks six times and the St Leger eight times. He won the Epsom Derby 
for the first time in 1955 and went on to win the race eight more times.

But
 two years after becoming a trainer, the 11-time champion was convicted 
of tax evasion and sentenced to three years in prison. He spent 366 days behind bar.

On
 his release, one year later, Piggott returned to racing and trained a 
total of 34 winners at Eve Lodge Stables.

The vast stables and racing yard include 95 boxes, an indoor arena, paddocks and a manager's house

It is believed Piggott's inspiration for the site was a visit to see Colin Hayes, an Australian champion trainer, at his Lindsay Park establishment in Adelaide, Australia

A rare part of the property is the indoor arena, which is floodlit with sand base. There are also storage barns at either end which are large enough to house a horsebox

There are also four semi-detached cottages on the site, each of which having two bedrooms, as well as direct access to 'The Gallops' training grounds at Newmarket racecourse
