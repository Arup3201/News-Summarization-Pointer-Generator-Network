The chances of Wayne Rooney and the rest of our boys winning the World Cup this summer are, to be realistic, not particularly high.

Unlike the price of the new replica England shirt unveiled yesterday.

Fans reacted with fury when they learned they must fork out £90 to wear the latest Three Lions design.

Anger: England revealed its new kit with the short alone costing £90 for adults and £40 for children

'Rip-off': There have been calls for a boycott of the shirt ten months after the last one came out

A parent wanting to get the full Nike kit – shirt, shorts and socks – for a 12-year-old would have to pay between £71 and £119.

Hundreds
 of supporters and some players took to Twitter to lambast Nike and the 
Football Association over the prices. QPR's Joey Barton, who has played 
for England, tweeted: '£90 for the new England shirt is taking the 
mickey out of the fans. When will it stop?

'It's
 literally a white sports top with an England badge on. Costs about £2 
to make in some sweatshop in the east. Appalling. Football again allows 
commercialism to eat away at its soul. Something has got to give.'

He
 suggested ordinary fans are being priced out of following the national 
game, adding: 'When will football/brands start to stop pricing them out.
 #workingmanssport.'

Fans on Twitter called the high prices a rip-off and outrageous.

The
 kit – in both a white and a red away version – has been launched just 
ten months after the shirts were last changed in May 2013. This appears 
to be at odds with a long-standing convention to protect the pockets of 
fans by changing the national team kit only every two years.

Red alert: The England away kit for this summer's World Cup features fabric makers Nike says will keep players cool

DIY: There has been huge anger online with fans, including former striker Stan Collymore, passing on tips on how to make your own new shirt using older similar tops

Making a point: In lampooning the new shirt, accounts have shown people how to make something very similar

Nike
 pointed out that as well as the £90 'match' shirt – designed for 
adults, but which many children will want – it is also offering a 
'stadium' version. It has some small differences in design and materials
 and costs £60 for adults and £42 for children, who also pay slightly 
less for shorts and socks.

But
 ex-England player Stan Collymore, now a pundit, tweeted: 'A joke, just 
make one please, £90 is a rip-off.'

The row comes 11 years after the FA,
 sports retailers and clubs were fined more than £16million for 
colluding to inflate the price of shirts.

The
 new £90 shirt is exactly the same as that to be worn by  England at the
 World Cup in Brazil this summer. Nike claims the price is justified 
because of the innovative cooling technology built into the kit to cope 
with high temperatures.

Nike
 took over the lucrative England kit supply deal from Umbro last year 
and is paying £25million a year to the FA which said it has no control 
over the cost of shirts.

An FA spokesman said: 'The FA is a 
not-for-profit organisation that puts £100million back into the game 
every year. It is through relationships with partners such as Nike that 
we are able to maintain that level of investment in football.'

* Pubs and bars will be able to stay open late on the evenings of 
England's matches in Brazil – until 1am for 9pm and 11pm kick-offs, or 
midnight for an 8pm start.

Ministers gave the go-ahead despite fears 
among police, councils and residents' groups that extended hours would 
lead to anti-social behaviour.
