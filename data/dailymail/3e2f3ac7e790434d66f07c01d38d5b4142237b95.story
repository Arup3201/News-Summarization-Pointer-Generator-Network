She was the grandmother battling cancer whose cheeky pictures images sparked a online craze of taking selfies sticking your blue tongue out.

But despite her death more than five months ago, the Instagram account for Betty Jo Simpson is still growing as her family continue to post her trademark upbeat pictures.

Mrs Simpson, a grandmother from Indiana, took the picture sharing site by storm last year after her grandson Zach Belden started posting images and videos to the account called Grandma Betty.

Grandmother Betty Jo Simpson, who Instagram images sparked the online craze of posing for a picture sticking out you tongue blue tongue 

The memorable picture was taken after the 80-year-old had enjoyed a blue coloured sweet and it took Instagram by storm 

And after posting a video of her dancing to Pharrell Williams hit 'Happy' she gained more than half a million followers.

One of the most memorable pictures showed the 80-year-old sticking out her tongue, which had turned blue after she ate a coloured sweet.

And since it was posted to the account last year, it has been copied by countless people on social media, including by model Cara Delevingne, singer Selena Gomez and actress Hayden Panetierre.

It also inspired a T-shirt design featuring the blue tongue logo, which was sold to raise money for the American Cancer Society.

She died in August, eight months after she was diagnosed with lung cancer, with the final post on her account gaining more than 60,000 likes and comments in just nine hours after her death was announced.

Since then her grandson has continued to upload pictures of his grandmother, with her page gaining more and more followers.

Now her grandson Zach has spoke of how he has been amazed by the success of the account.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'The response was phenomenal. I expected a few dozen followers, maybe a couple of hundred at most. But soon she had thousands

'They didn’t just look at her pictures, they left comments and sent messages too. There were people with cancer who told us they’d given up before they saw her story, but she was such an inspiration they were determined to keep going.

The grandmother now has almost 600,000 followers on Instagram, with followers keen to see her upbeat images 

'As we sat there watching the number of followers going up, the smile on her face was so special I can’t describe it.'

Zach began posting the pictures of Betty and her late husband Clarence, shortly after she was told she was suffering from lung cancer.

The schoolboy explained: 'The idea was to start an account for my friends who know Grandma Betty.

'And it turned out to be something everybody started to enjoy.'

After the account went viral, Mrs Simpson said she felt like a celebrity every time she got a new follower, with her granddaughter Hope adding: ''We get joy out of listening to her say everyday, "How many more friends do I have today?"

'This is going to be something we're always going to have and something we're always going to remember and definitely cherish forever.

'I'll always have that. And we'll always have the Instagram, no matter what.'
