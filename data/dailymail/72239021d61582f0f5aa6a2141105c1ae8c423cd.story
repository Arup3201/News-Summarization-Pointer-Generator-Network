Streaming a football match on a smartphone or tablet using mobile data produces the same amount of carbon emissions as driving a petrol car for 10 miles, claims a new study.

However watching the match when connected to Wi-Fi produces eight times less emissions than when the same sporting event is watched on a television set.

According to figures from the Carbon Trust, the most environmentally-friendly way to watch shows, films and events per viewer is by sharing a screen with other people either at home or in the pub.

Streaming a football match on a smartphone or tablet using mobile data produces the same amount of carbon emissions as driving a petrol car for 10 miles. 

Watching the match when connected to 
Wi-Fi produces emissions eight times lower than when the same sporting 
event is watched on a television set.

Watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized LED television.

Whereas a laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer.

Whereas going to see a game live at the stadium produces the most carbon of the lot, particularly for an away game, due to the added impact of transport.

The reports claim watching a match on LED screens is most energy efficient, followed by LCD and then plasma.

It is estimated that this Sunday’s FA Community Shield at Wembley between Manchester United and Wigan will produce 5,160 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

This is the equivalent of the annual energy emissions of around 1,000 homes.

The research found that when watching alone, the lowest carbon way to view football is by using a smartphone or tablet connected to broadband.

Emissions can be as much as eight times lower than watching on television, mostly due to the smaller size of the screen.

In Britain, 27 per cent of smartphone owners and 63 per cent of tablet owners are now using their device to watch live TV.

For the upcoming season both Sky and BT are offering apps that allow football to be watched on personal devices and each device and screen sizes can vary in energy consumption.

However, watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized LED television.

A laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer.

During the 2010-11 season The FA reduced its own carbon footprint by more than seven per cent, compared to 2008-09 and the organisation achieved the Carbon Trust Standard.

Michael Rea, chief operating officer at the Carbon Trust, said: 'Our work helping teams, broadcasters and the telecoms industry to continuously reduce their environmental impact will in turn help to reduce the impacts of fans when they are watching football.'

Roger Maslin, managing director of Wembley Stadium, said: 'We are continuing to find new ways to reduce our environmental impacts.

'Only a small part of the total carbon emissions associated with a game at Wembley are in our direct control, so we are calling on fans to do their bit and help to shrink the carbon bootprint of watching football.'

Both BT and Sky offer apps, pictured, that allow football to be watched on phones or tablets. The lowest carbon way to view football when using a mobile device is over broadband with emissions eight times lower than watching on television, due to the smaller size of the screen
