The 'sexy Ebola containment suit' is on sale online

Websites and bars appear to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers risking their own lives to treat people infected with the deadly disease.

The costume - which is available in a male and female version - has appeared on the brands on sale website. 

A description of the suit says: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.' 

The costume has gone on sale as flyers have been released advertising a 'Saturday Night Ebola Fever' Halloween event in London.

Last night the WHO confirmed the number of people who had been infected with the disease had reached 10,000. 

Almost 5,000 people have so far died of Ebola, most from Africa and the WHO estimates the figure could be higher due to under reporting in Africa. 

The costumes, which are being sold for $59.99 (£37) come complete with a white costume dress, face shield, breathing mask, safety eye goggles and blue gloves. 

The site sells the lace up yellow boots separately for $79.99 (£49). 

The description adds: 'The short dress and chic gas mask will be the talk of Milan, London, Paris, and New York as the world's fashionistas seek global solutions to hazmat couture.' 

It says the male and female outfits are the perfect way for couples to dress up for Halloween parties. On the male version the website adds: 'This will literally be the most "viral" costume of the year.' 

The Scotch of St James, a music venue in Mayfair in London, is due to hold an event called Saturday Night Ebola Fever for Halloween weekend. Flyers and a Facebook invite, complete with a banner with Halloween-themed writing, have been released - drawing criticism from charities attempting to deal with the outbreak.

However organisers say the event is being held to raise awareness of the deadly disease, and they planned to raise £1,500 through discretionary donations for Doctors Without Borders, a charity working in west Africa.

But Tom Dannatt, chief executive and founder of Street Child, a charity running an Ebola crisis appeal, told the Telegraph that anyone trying to make light of the crisis or a profit out of it is 'reprehensible.' 

Organisers at the Scotch said the name of the flyer is a play on words, and that the theme was not Ebola but 1970s Saturday Night Fever.

A spokesman said: 'The organisers of the charity event aim to raise awareness as well as hard funds, in the region of £1500, that would go towards the fight against the spread of Ebola, and victims affected by the disease.'

He said it was a 'great shame' the event was now being viewed negatively. 

He added: 'The voluntary donation has always been stated from the start, as the original intention of the event was always to raise money as much money as possible for a good cause.'

It has been organised by Mom X Dad, a London-based production agency. 

A spokesman for Mom X Dad said they were now not sure if the event would go ahead because of the negative reaction to it. 

He said: 'We knew that during Halloween people spend a lot of money and we wanted to capitalise on that to give something back.

'The theme was never Ebola. It was always Saturday Night Fever, Ebola is the cause we are fighting for.' 

He said they had never intended to 'make light' of the current crisis. 

The Scotch is a music venue for popular and emerging musicians and has seen Sir Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix perform there.

The Ebola crisis has been referred to as 'the most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. (WHO)

The RFA Argus, equipped with hundreds of medics and sailors, is due to arrive in Sierra Leone to help deal with the Ebola crisis after it set sail from Falmouth in south England on October 17 with life saving equipment 

More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola so far, most in west Africa.

Almost 400 medics and marines left the UK on a 'floating hospital' earlier this month bound for Sierra Leone - one of the worst hit areas affected by the crisis.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said more needs to be done to help victims of the crisis. 

Ebola spreads through close contact with a sufferer's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen. 

The Ebola virus  infected more than 10,000 people

It can be incubated for 21 days and symptoms include a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhoea. 

According to the WHO the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease is now 10,141 with 4,922 fatalities. 

The number of suspected cases has increased by 200 over the past four days. 

There has been just one known British case. 

William Pooley, a nurse, was infected with the disease while treating patients in Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the UK by the RAF and treated in an isolation tent and eventually cured of the disease. He has now returned to the country to help more victims.
