Veteran Labour politician Tony Benn has left hospital and is being cared for at home, his family has said.

The former cabinet minister, 88, was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital at the beginning of last month after feeling unwell.

A family spokesman said: ‘Tony Benn has been moved from hospital and is now being cared for at home.

‘The Benn family would like to express its heartfelt thanks to all the NHS staff at Charing Cross Hospital for their outstanding care, and to the many people who have sent kind messages of concern and support.’

Mr Benn entered parliament in November 1950 and served in the cabinet under Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan.

He campaigned against EU membership, oversaw the development of Concorde, narrowly missed out on election as Labour deputy leader in 1981, and was instrumental in the party's 1983 manifesto.

He stepped down from parliament in 2001, but remains a significant figure in the Labour movement - in particular as a staunch opponent of the Iraq War.

Last year Mr Benn revealed he did not
 fear his demise after suffering a stroke, explaining that losing his 
beloved American wife Caroline to cancer 14 years ago had helped him 
cope.

He said: ‘I’m not
 frightened about death. I don’t know why, but I just feel at a certain 
moment your switch is switched off and that’s it. And you can’t do 
anything about it.’

His father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Liberal MP, a Labour Minister and later made a peer.

Born in 1925, Tony Benn entered politics in November 1950 as Labour representative for Bristol South East. He became the youngest MP in parliament.

Mr Benn was born into a political family, with his father and two grandfathers all serving as MPs. Before entering politics, he served in the RAF during World War Two and studied at Oxford University.

Mr Benn’s father, William Wedgwood Benn, accepted a peerage in 1942 and was created Viscount Stansgate.

This meant that when he died in 1960, Tony Benn inherited his father's peerage and was disbarred from the House of Commons.

He campaigned for a change and eventually retook his seat in Bristol South East in 1963.

Mr Benn served as a cabinet minister under the governments of both Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan during his time in parliament.

In the 1970s, he took on who he perceived as the Right-wing of the Labour leadership, campaigning for the party to take up socialist values.

And, in 1983, he was a key component of Labour's election manifesto, dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history', which saw the Tories whitewashed in a battle with Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives. The Tory party remained in power until 1997. 

Mr Benn retired from the Commons in 2001 after 51 years as a Labour MP.

He has remained politically active in recent years, in particular setting himself up as a staunch opponent of the Iraq War.
