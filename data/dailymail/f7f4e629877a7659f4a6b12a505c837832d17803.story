The 12-year-old daughter of accused Utah murderer Dr. Martin MacNeill will take the stand to testify about the night her father is accused of murdering her mother.

Ada MacNeill was just six years old in April 2007 when she discovered her mother dying in the bathtub of their Pleasant Grove, Utah home.

One of Martin and the late Michele’s eight children, Ada’s testimony is the latest in a series of intriguing twists in the case. On Wednesday, a doctor testified the MacNeill offered him $10,000 in an emergency room to keep trying to resuscitate his wife.

Plot thickens: The trial of Dr. Martin MacNeill, a Utah father of eight and Mormon bishop, will heat up Thursday as his children prepare to take the stand against him. First up is Ada MacNeill, who was 6 when she found her mother dying in the bathtub

against her father, Martin MacNeill (right), who is accused of murdering
his wife in 2007 by drugging her and coaxing her into the bathtub

While several of the children are preparing to testify against their father, prosecutors want Ada to go first.

Doomed: Ada MacNeill recalled that her father told her to go check on her mother, pictured, the day she died

‘We want Ada to testify because she has an important story to tell as part of the bigger story here,’ Prosecutor Chad Grunander told reporters. ‘She was the first person to find her mother in the bathtub.’

The defense team, meanwhile, says Ada was too young and unreliable at the time of the incident and that interviewers had to use her older sister Alexis as an intermediary.

‘Alexis was doing the interviewing and investigators saying ask her this ask her that. This is highly improper,’ said defense attorney Susanne Gustin.

Others among the family’s children will likely soon follow Ada.

After
MacNeill’s arrest in August 2012, sisters Alexis Somers and Rachel 
MacNeill told Good Morning America that they knew their father killed 
their mother, even when her death was first ruled to have been from 
natural causes.

‘We know he's guilty. We know he'll harm again. If he's let out he will come after us,' Rachel MacNeill said.

The
women had long fought for police to re-open the case into their 
mother's death, certain their father had murdered after Michele 
MacNeill, 50, was found drowned in the bathtub at their Pleasant Grove 
home in 2007.

'It's 
horrible to be happy about the arrest of your father, but finally he is 
being held accountable for murdering my mother,' Alexis Somers said.

Plotted: Prosecutors say MacNeill convinced his wife to get a facelift then drugged her and coaxed her into the tub, where she drowned

Vindicated? MacNeill's daughters Alexis Somers and Rachel MacNeill will testify against their father, whom they have long believed to be responsible for their mother's death, but prosecutors say Ada is up first

Safe haven: Michele MacNeill was found floating fully clothed in a tub in the family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, in April 2007

Another shocking revelation came Wednesday when an emergency room physician testified that MacNeill offered him money to try to keep his dying wife alive.

‘He offered me $10,000 to continue my resuscitation and not quit,’ Scott Vanwagoner said Wednesday.

Vanwagoner said he was already working furiously to revive Michele MacNeill, and the defendant must have known his wife was already dead.

He called MacNeill's remark ‘off-the-wall’ and the oddest experience of his medical career.

'Off the wall': Emergency room physician Dr. Leo Scott Van Wagonere told the court Wednesday that MacNeill offered him $10,000 to continue resuscitating his wife

Witnesses: Many emergency personnel have testified, including nurse Stephanie Hansen. A police officer also testified that MacNeill was out of control and hysterical as his wife was carted away

‘I'm not sure how to answer that question, or why he would make that offer,’ Vanwagoner told a jury in Provo.

It was the latest testimony about MacNeill's bizarre behavior on the day his wife died.

Police previously testified to MacNeill's erratic behavior that night.

'He was hysterical. He was blurting out things like why did u have to have this surgery? Why were you on so many medications? Why God,' Dan Beckstrom with Pleasant Grove Police Department told the court.

Police and paramedics have testified that he had cursed his 50-year-old wife after they arrived for insisting on getting a face-lift then taking too much medication and falling into a bathtub.

Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying against him on Wednesday. They had an affair for more than a year before the death

Fall from grace: MacNeill, pictured speaking with his defense lawyer Susanne Gustin, moved Willis into his family home as his children's nanny weeks after the death of his wife

Prosecutors claim MacNeill, 57, plotted his wife's death by drugging her and helping her into a bathtub.

The 2007 death shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader. MacNeill has since surrendered his medical license.

Vanwagoner said every measure and drug used by the emergency team to revive Michelle MacNeill ‘had no effect.’

‘It was an unusual death in someone we wouldn't expect to die,’ he said.

MacNeill has said he found his wife slumped head-first into a bathtub when he returned home from an errand in April 2007. Police initially found no suspicion of homicide, and an autopsy suggested she died of a heart attack. But a cause of death was not determined.
