Fran Halsall is optimistic the future is bright for British swimming ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

Britain's swimmers struggled in the pool at the London 2012 Olympics, winning three medals, with only Scotland's Michael Jamieson, with silver in the 200metres breaststroke, and the now-retired Rebecca Adlington, with bronze medals in the 400m and 800m freestyle, reaching the podium.

The Commonwealth Games often sees new stars emerge and Halsall is confident of success for the home nations at Tollcross later this month.

The goggles are on: Halsall will be swimming for England at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games

Eager: The veteran Halsall says 'it's great to be part of the Games and to swim for England'

The 24-year-old from Southport, who will race for England in Glasgow, said: 'After London a lot of things changed, we had people coming in, people leave.

'It was a rebuilding year last year and now everything's quite settled and in place. We've got a great team around us.

'And everyone that's coming through, the younger swimmers, they're swimming really well.

'If we have a good Games here it will create a lot of momentum going into the next Olympics.'

Liam Tancock, the most experienced member of the British team, returned to London's Aquatics Centre for the first time for this week's pre-Commonwealth Games holding camp.

The 29-year-old backstroke swimmer from Exeter, who, like Halsall, is coached by James Gibson at Loughborough, said: 'A lot of people look back at London and see it as a failure.

'There's nothing but fond memories for me. This place is a very special place.

Experience is key: Liam Tancock believes Britain has learned a lot since London 2012

Making a splash: Tancock will also be competing for England at the Commonwealth Games

'As a team we came away with a few medals, but we'd have definitely liked a few more.

'We converted heat swims into semi-final swims, semi-final swims into final swims. It's just that next stage.

'Hopefully in Rio we'll convert more finals swims into podium successes. I think that comes with experience.

'That's what we've been working on over the last few years and we'll continue to work on into Rio.'

End of an era: Rebecca Adlington retired from swimming after winning bronze at the London Olympics

Many expected Halsall to reach the podium at London 2012 after medal success at Commonwealth, European and World Championships, plus a strong world ranking, but despite reaching four finals fifth was her best result, much to her disappointment.

For me 
personally I've re-evaluated everything that happened in London,' added 
Halsall, who will compete in her third Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

At
 first I was really emotional about it but I've tried to think 
logically, take the emotion out of it and just see it as a race that 
happened. I did my best and that was the result I got.

'I want to get better than that, I want to do better than that. I've reassessed how I lead-up to it, what I can do there, the actual race, how I can change there.'

Halsall
 will have five opportunities in Glasgow in the 50m and 100m freestyle, 
50m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley relay.

I did five (events) in Delhi, so I've stuck to that programme,' Halsall added. 'I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do. It's a good marker, the Commonwealth Games, two years out from the Olympic Games.

'The Commonwealth is very strong in sprint freestyle. It's going to be hard, but I like a challenge.

'I
 just want to work on the processes I've been doing in training the last
 couple of years; there's a lot of things in my race that could be a lot
 better.

'If I get those right I know that I'll be there or thereabouts in the race for medals.'
