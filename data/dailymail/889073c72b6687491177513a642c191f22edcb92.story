Jay Carney is stepping down as White House Press Secretary over 'strain' on his family life, he announced today. But the decision to leave the Obama administration came weeks ago, multiple sources including one in the West Wing told MailOnline.

'He first started talking about it in late April,' the White House insider said Friday after the decision was made final. 'But the president had the prerogative to pull the trigger when he decided to.'

That time ended up being Friday, just hours after Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned amid a major scandal involving faked wait-lists and denied medical care in the VA health system.

'To be honest, the move was more about how to deflect attention away from Eric Shinseki's resignation, and less about giving Jay a thoughtful send-off,' the White House official said.

BROMANCE: Obama thanked Carney for his years of service, and announced that deputy Josh Earnest would succeed him

BURNT OUT? Carney lasted 3-1/2 years in the job, building a testy relationship with the proverbial herd of cats he wrangled daily in the White House press room

LEAVING: Carney served VP Joe 'gaffe machine' Biden -- a thankless job -- before graduating to the White House briefing podium in 2011

And a in insider close to Carney 
confirmed to MailOnline that Friday's decision wasn't made hastily.

'There’s no scandal,' the source said. 'He wanted to go for a while.'

The insider also confirmed that he wants to spend the summer months with his wife, ABC News reporter Claire Shipman, and their children – and that he is exhausted.

The source added that Carney is confident he'll be offered work as a TV pundit and cash in financially.

President 
Obama spoke directly to the White House press corps on Friday afternoon –
 his second hastily called appearance in a single day – to announce that
 Carney would be replaced by his deputy, Josh Earnest.

He confirmed that Carney has first approached him a month ago about taking another job.

'In April, Jay came to me in the Oval Office and said that he was thinking of moving on, and I was not thrilled, to say the least,' Obama said. 'But Jay has had to wrestle with this decision for quite some time.'

SPLIT PERSONALITY: Carney played the role of passive boy scout in the briefing room, but showed an aggressive and sometimes vulgar exterior when challenged

HAPPY COUPLE: Carney will be able to spend more time with his wife, ABC News journalist Claire Shipman, and their two children

Carney is a former Washington bureau 
chief for Time magazine and has held the position at the White House 
since February 2011. He was previously Vice President Joe Biden's press secretary.

He gushed for reporters that his job has 'been an amazing experience – just, so fulfilling.'

Rumors had swirled around the White House that Carney was angling for a posting as the U.S. ambassador to Russia, but the former Moscow bureau chief for TIME said it wasn't in the cards since his family had only just now 'won me back.'

Carney has not enjoyed a rosy relationship with White House correspondents, often parrying accusations that he has made the West Wing far less accessible to journalists than it had been under previous presidents.

His 
alternatively glib and cheerful exterior at the briefing podium often 
gave way to more forceful, sometimes vulgar exchanges with reporters 
when open-press events spiraled out of control.

In
 one case, when a reporter with the center-right Daily Caller asked a 
question out of turn during a 2011 Rose Garden press conference and 
sparred with Obama over immigration policy, Carney called the news 
outlet's executive editor – this reporter – and cursed a blue streak, 
threatening to cancel the reporter's press credentials.

Obama 
seemed to paper over such outbursts on Friday, saying that Carney 'has 
good judgment. He has good temperament and he has good heart.'

'Be nice to him on his farewell tour,' the president joked.

CHEAT SHEET: Carney was known for referring often to a briefing binder full of talking points, rather than addressing many tough questions off-the-cuff

Earnest, 39, has been the go-to replacement for Carney on Air Force One and in the press briefing room when his boss was away. But reporters have not yet tested his day-to-day mettle.

'Today the flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation,' Obama said.

This isn't the first such transition in the West Wing. Obama’s first presidential press secretary, Robert Gibbs, moved on to found his own strategic communications firm, The Incite Agency. He also has a contract as an on-air commentator at the liberal cable news network MSNBC.

Carney, 49, said he won't step down right away but will continue to brief reporters until he decides what to do next.

'I haven't made any decisions yet,' he said. 'I'm excited by some of the possibilities. I'm sure you guys will be among the first to know after I've decided what to do.'

The outgoing press flack often made reporters cringe by deflecting tough questions to Obama administration cabinet departments. National Journal assembled a clip reel of examples on Friday, showing his go-to line when he didn't have answers.

His clashes with the press were the stuff of legend, including he full-throated defense of shifting White House policy that saw news photographers excluded from many – if not most – of Obama's daily calendared events.

That change brought condemnation from the powerful White House Correspondents Association, and from some newspapers – chief among them USA Today – that said they would no longer publish the posed and manicured 'official' White House photographs that the administration habitually distributed instead.

It was the president's trip to South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial service that proved to be the final straw, with CNN reporter Brianna Kellar accusing the Obama White House of operating by a different standard of openness.

'I mean, anyone here can tell that there's less access than under the Bush administration,' she said durign a December 12, 2013 briefing,  and yet ... it was President Obama who talked about transparency being a hallmark of his administration.'

'So isn't it sort of the problem is that he has set up a standard himself that he's not meeting, that his White House is not meeting?'

People magazine spilled the beans after Hillary Clinton had a secret lunch Thursday with Obama in the White House, and reporters were steamed to have been left out of the loop

On Thursday Carney faced reporters' anger after news emerged from people magazine that former Secretary of State and likely 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had a secret lunch with the president, an event that was omitted from the daily calendar distributed to reporters.

Ultimately, Carney offered a time-worn explanation for his retreat from government service, saying he wanted to spend more time with his wife and their young children.

'They are never the age they are today again,' he said wistfully.
