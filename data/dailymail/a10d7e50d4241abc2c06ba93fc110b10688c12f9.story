A tiny newborn lemur clings to its big brother’s back as he tentatively explores his home for the first time.

Wide-eyed Raiky, a baby Alaotran gentle lemur, looks like a tiny ball of fluff as older brother Tsingy treats him to a piggy-back ride through the trees.

Raiky and his twin Roa are the latest new arrivals at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, in Surrey.

Cheeky youngster Raiky is one of two new baby lemurs born recently at the zoo, making a total of three Alaotran gentle lemurs born there this year

The cute pair are the latest additions to a happy brood of 12 of the endangered species at the zoo.

Mark Boardman, zoo manager at Chessington, said: 'We are all delighted to welcome Raiky and twin Roa to Chessington.

'It’s been great to see that Raiky and Roa have bonded so well with their older brother. He’s been looking after them and they have really settled into the group.'

With 2,500 lemurs left in the wild, they are a critically endangered species, Mr Boardman added.

'The population of these beautiful creatures is ever decreasing,' he said.

'We are committed to ensuring their prolonged existence and currently run the most successful breeding programme for Alaotran gentle lemurs in the UK. This is something we are really proud of.'

Three gentle lemurs have been born at Chessington so far this year. Lemurs normally give birth once a year.

There are only 2,500 Alaotran gentle lemurs left in the wild

Mothers will carry their babies up to three months of age, but after about six weeks the youngsters will happily explore their surroundings on their own.

Known as the Bandro, the lemurs are found in a small area around Lake Alaotran in Madagascar.

Although widely known as a 'bamboo' lemur, the species lives primarily on grasses and reeds.

The first captive Alaotran gentle lemur was born at Jersey Zoo in 1993.
