Wayne Rooney's 'stupid' red card on Saturday came about because the Manchester United captain doesn't trust his defence, according to Alan Shearer.

The striker kicked out at West Ham's Stewart Downing as the West Ham winger raced downfield during the match at Old Trafford, which United ultimately won 2-1.

Rooney later apologised to his team-mates and said he has no intention of appealing against referee Lee Mason's decision.

Alan Shearer claimed Rooney's foul on Downing was an 'act of desperation'

But ex-striker Shearer claims Rooney wasn't comfortable leaving the shaky United back line to deal with Downing's purposeful run.

Writing in his Sun column, Shearer said: 'Wayne Rooney's stupidity was symptomatic of just where Manchester United are right now. In a bit of a confused mess.

'The problem is, Rooney is trying to do everyone's job to get them out of it. His swing at Stewart Downing was an act of desperation.

'It was not as if Downing was clear through on goal. There were plenty of defenders for him to get past from inside his own half.

 'Yet it was probably down to a lack of trust in them on Rooney's part that he made the challenge.'

Shearer went on to say that Rooney is the only one in the United team who is putting in a decent shift at the moment and his team-mates need to buck up.

United's win over the Hammers was only their second of the season and they find themselves seventh in the table, eight points adrift of early pace-setters Chelsea.
