Lady Butler-Sloss said there had been an Establishment cover-up of child abuse

There was an Establishment cover-up of horrific child abuse because powerful figures looked after themselves, former judge Lady Butler-Sloss warned today.

Senior members of British society in the past did not think child abuse was as serious or important as protecting politicians and other members of the elite, she suggested.

Lady Butler-Sloss was forced to quit as chairman of the wide-ranging inquiry into allegations of a cover-up because her brother was in the Cabinet in the 1980s.

But she insisted if she had stayed in post and been able to run the inquiry she would have 'cut the whole thing open'.

Lady Butler-Sloss's resignation in July came less than a week after David Cameron agreed to an inquiry into allegations that politicians, the police, the judiciary, celebrities, the BBC, the NHS and the Church conspired to cover-up abuse over several decades.

It followed concerns that her brother Michael Havers sat in the Cabinet as attorney general during the 1980s - the period on which claims of a cover-up are focussed. 

Lady Butler Sloss insisted she could have done the job, arguing that 'as a judge with 35 years' experience on the bench, I was quite able to be independent and say that people got it wrong and to be critical of them'.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which she guest edited today, she said abuse over decades was kept from public view.

'I do believe the establishment has in the past looked after itself, partly because people did not really recognise the seriousness of child abuse and they did not think it was so important, and it was important to protect members of the establishment,' she said.

'So I would want to go in with a knife and cut the whole thing open and expose it, as to what happened, bearing in mind, of course, that the views of those people are not the views of people today and that is a difficulty.'

She said she took the job of chairing the inquiry not because she want to do it but it 'needed to be done'.

'It never crossed my mind that my brother would be an impediment.'

In October the second chairman of the inquiry, Fiona Woolf, was forced to resign after failing to declare the extent of her links to Tory peer Leon Brittan, who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse.

An MP battling to expose a suspected Westminster child sex ring has been accused by fellow politicians of ‘peddling conspiracy theories’.

John Mann said he has been vilified for championing those who claim they were abused by paedophiles in positions of power.

But the Labour MP said he will not be deterred from pursuing a full public inquiry into their ordeal. He said time was running out for the authorities to get to the bottom of claims aimed at the heart of the Establishment.

The Government is expected to announce the timescale and terms of reference for an inquiry within weeks. Campaigners are gearing up for a crunch meeting at Parliament in a fortnight as police continue to probe claims three boys were abused and murdered.

Groups representing victims and survivors of abuse warned Home Secretary Theresa May they were losing confidence in the inquiry.

But Lady Butler-Sloss said that effectively giving campaign groups the final decision on who chairs the inquiry 'creates real problems'.

She said: 'I worry that the victims, survivors - for whom I have the most enormous sympathy, and as a judge I tried a great many child abuse cases, I really have huge sympathy for them - but for them to be deciding who should become the person chairing it creates real problems.

'Because if you did not have, in the past, a position of authority, how are you going to be able to run the inquiry?

'You need someone who knows how to run things and if you get someone from an obscure background with no background of establishment, they will find it very difficult and may not be able, actually, to produce the goods.'

She also defended the decision to make Fiona Woolf a Dame in the New Year's Honours List, so soon after her resignation.

She said criticism of the honour was 'very unfair' as it was in recognition of her term as Lord Mayor of London.

Defending the decision to award the honour, she said: 'She was Lord Mayor of London, she is only the second woman ever to be Lord Mayor of London.

'The very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post.

'Unfortunately she had, like myself, a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake, she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman.

'And because she happened to know Leon Brittan, she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down.'

But Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, said the damehood 'seems inappropriate', adding: 'I can think of many more worthy recipients … once again it looks like the Establishment are looking after their own.'

He added: 'The public will be disappointed that people such as Fiona Woolf are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour, people who have done courageous things, or have achieved things for their country.

'I'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off. I suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse.'
