Didier Drogba may be the Ivory Coast's record goalscorer, but the Chelsea striker has revealed that his son Isaac wants to snub the African nation and represent England, should he make the grade as a professional footballer.

The 15-year-old is currently a youth international with the Blues, and would also be eligible to play for France.

But his father, speaking to Sports Illustrated, says Isaac is now so settled in the UK that he wants to play for the Three Lions.

'My son was playing for Chelsea and I asked him which nationality do you want to play for,' father 36-year-old Didier explained.

'He's French, but he said he does not want to play for Ivory Coast or France, he wants to play for England.

'Even when I was in China, I said to them (his children), do you want to come and live with me, but they said that they would come to see me on holidays.'

Drogba celebrated with his son Isaac in the Chelsea dressing room after scoring his first goal since returning to the club in the summer last October.

Drogba also spoke about his leaving Chelsea after the Champions League win, and then returning to the club.

'Together we've achieved so much here,' he added.

'We have been through a lot of good moments and sad moments as well, like the final in Moscow.

'For eight years we have been chasing the Champions League trophy and then we did it and the fans understood that.

'So that understanding between the fans and the players, makes this relationship very special.'
