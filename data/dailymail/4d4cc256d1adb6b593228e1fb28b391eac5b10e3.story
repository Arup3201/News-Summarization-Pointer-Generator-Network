They say that love knows no bounds, and these two dogs are certainly proof of that.

West Highland terrier Joey has cross-bred with a female Rottweiler double his size to father a litter of 11 puppies, which have been given the name 'Wotties'.

The owner of both the dogs, Teresa Patterson, from North Grimston, Yorkshire, was surprised they had mated and was unaware it had taken place until the puppies were born.

While so-called ‘Wotties’ are a rare, possibly unique, cross-breed, it is not uncommon for other breeds of dogs to mate and create attractive and fashionable crosses.

The Poodle is a particularly popular dog to cross breed. Cockapoos, mixed with Cocker Spaniels, Labradoodles, mixed with Labradors, and Maltipoos, mixed with Maltese dogs, are some of the most common cross-breeds.

Poodles also cross with Golden Retrievers and Yorkshire terriers to make Goldendoodles and Yorkipoos respectively.

Other common crosses include the Puggle, a cross between a Pug and a Beagle, and the Goldador, which is a mix of the golden retriever and the Labrador retriever.

After the litter arrived in the summer four-year-old mother Zara lost interest, leaving Joey, one, to take care of them.

Sadly, four of the puppies died and Ms Patterson was forced to step in when Zara refused to feed.

She fed the seven remaining animals Weetabix and scrambled egg to keep them strong, and even gave them Horlicks to help them sleep.

But, with Zara seemingly not interested, the owner was forced to put out an appeal for homes for the 'attention-seeking' youngsters via the charity, Yorkshire Coast Dog Rescue in Scarborough.

Ms Patterson's sons, Jonathan and Matthew, have now taken one each from the litter and the remaining five have found new homes.

Ms Patterson, 50, an administrative 
clerk, said: ‘We got Joey in May and it must have happened straight away
 but we didn't think it would have been possible.

‘Zara didn't know what to do and I just started screaming when the puppies started popping out…

‘I was completely shocked, I didn't think nature would let this happen but at some point it did.

‘The puppies have a lovely temperament like their parents. They are high maintenance as they want attention all the time.

'One of the puppies, Sparkie, which our son is having, follows me everywhere I go.’

She added: ‘But this won't happen again - Joey will be going to the vets soon.’

Ms Patterson has ruled out a repeat incident, saying she will now be taking one-year-old Joey to the vets

Victoria Lowe, from Scarborough, took one of the puppies, now called Lola, when it was ten weeks old.

She said: ‘Everyone we meet is fascinated by Lola and it is all a bit of a mystery as to how big she will grow.

‘She is so full of character and gets up to all kinds of mischief.’

The Kennel Club, which each year registers around 250,000 puppies across 212 breeds, said it had never come across a 'Wottie' cross-breed.

A spokesman said: ‘We can never say it has never happened but this is the first time we've come across it.’
