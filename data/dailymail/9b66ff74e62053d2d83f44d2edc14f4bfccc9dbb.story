Potentially dangerous drugs linked to suicides are being illegally sold online by dealers in Britain.

The medicines watchdog launched an investigation last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered three websites, including eBay, selling drugs such as anti-depressants and Roaccutane, an acne drug.

Roaccutane has been linked with several suicides. It can only be prescribed by consultant dermatologists and dispensed by registered pharmacists.

We found businesses advertising a wide range of drugs, without being legally registered to sell prescription medicines online, and passed their details to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

One website, Urbanpharma, lists a Manchester contact address and says it delivers medicines in 48 hours to UK addresses.

The business is not registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), a requirement to sell prescription medication.

Another website, Aurapharm, was selling prescription-only drugs such as Roaccutane, again despite not being registered with the GPhC.

Medical student Jon Medland committed suicide in 2004. His family said his death was linked to the drug Roaccutane. His father Jonathan Medland described the Mail on Sunday's revelations as 'terrifying'

Jonathan Medland, 57, from Barnstaple, lost his 22-year-old son Jon, who committed suicide three weeks after starting a course of Roaccutane – obtained via a registered pharmacy – in 2004.

He said: ‘It’s terrifying. These companies are just out to make profit without caring about the consequences.’

An MHRA spokesman said: ‘If the websites are found to be breaching the law, we will work to remove them and consider bringing prosecutions.’

Jon Medland's parents Jonathan and Pam Medland and his sister Casey. Jon's family blame his death on the drug that he had begun taking just three weeks before to help cure acne
