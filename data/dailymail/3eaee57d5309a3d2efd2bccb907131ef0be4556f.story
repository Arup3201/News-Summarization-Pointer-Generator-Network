A teenager plotted a Columbine-style massacre on his school using pipe bombs, knives and a crossbow, a court was told today.

Michael Piggin, 18, stored weapons and terrorist manuals in his room as he drew up a ‘hit list’ of pupils and teachers he wanted to attack, jurors heard.

Piggin allegedly planned to target two schools in his area and a mosque, cinema, university and council offices.

Accused: Michael Piggin, 18, is accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre at his Loughborough school

He dubbed his plans for an armed assault on his former school as ‘the new Columbine’, the Old Bailey heard.

The English Defence League supporter allegedly kept a notebook of potential targets and plans for his attack in a notebook covered in swastika flags.

Inspired by Heath Ledger’s portrayal of Batman nemesis the Joker in The Dark Knight, Piggin scrawled the mantra ‘When order fails, violence prevails’ in his diary.

He also wrote, ‘Take down anyone I see, hold out in a classroom and possible take hostages and fight the police until the end’.

The notebook had Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara on the front alongside slogans including ‘EDL: No Surrender’, ‘British and Proud’, and Nazi swastika drawings.

Piggin, who wore a black Arctic Monkeys T-shirt, jeans and glasses, appeared in the dock beside two intermediaries because he has autism.

Prosecutor Max Hill, QC said: ‘This case concerns a young man, 17 years of age when he was arrested, who lives in the Midlands in Loughborough and who despite his Asperger’s Syndrome has extreme views and until his arrest he was serious about putting those views into action against others.

‘That is why he faces terrorism charges in this court, terrorism having a broad definition.

‘There are five charges on the indictment.’

of planning a massacre at his school similar to the Columbine 
killings in Colorado on April 20, 1999 perpetrated by Dylan Klebold 
(right) and his friend Eric Harris

The jury were shown extracts from the teenager’s notebook, allegedly outlining his attack plans.

Piggin had drawn in his notebook a stick figures with arrows showing where knives, a machete, a sawn-off air rifle, ammunition, and pipe bombs would be concealed inside a trench coat, the court heard.

Mr Hill said: ‘Columbine in America was the scene of an infamous mass shooting in 1999 in which staff and students died.

‘It was purported by two students of that school aged 17 and 19.

‘The younger was the same age as Michael Piggin when he was arrested.’

He added: ‘Even making allowances for his age and Asperger’s Syndrome this is a man with extreme views and serious intentions.’

Piggin, the the Old Bailey heard, has a particular hatred of Muslims. He is accused of having the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook in his bedroom, which the prosecution say was for terrorist purposes.

‘There can be no good reason for having a poisons handbook like this’, said Mr Hill.

‘On any view, he has got what can only be called a terrorist possession.

‘We see the way this young man explains and tries to justify himself.

‘He is writing for others to read later to understand what by then he will have done.’

Piggin rants about stopping the spread of Islam in Britain and says he wants to stop Muslims ‘and other social scumbags’ from coming into the country.

‘What he is talking about is if that Islamic invasion of Europe isn’t dealt with soon, it will be too late,’ Mr Hill said.

‘He says if there is one British child born in Luton, there will be four Muslim children born.’

Columbine High School in Colorado was unknown to the world at large until April 20, 1999.

That was the day when two pupils of the school Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went there and murdered 13 pupils and one teacher and injured 24 others before committing suicide in the library where they had killed 10 of their victims.

The pair appeared in school plays and worked on the school’s computer system, maintaining the server. Both were keen gamers but also took a more disturbing interest in violence and posted videos online of themselves experimenting with explosives.

It is believed that although they were subjected to some bullying they were not the social pariahs that they have subsequently been portrayed as.

At 11.19am on April 20, 1999 (Hitler’s birthday) the first shots were fired at the school. Harris and Klebold had already placed two sports bags each containing a 20lb bomb in the school café and they began firing at their classmates. Harris was responsible for eight of the 13 confirmed deaths, including that of a teacher, while Klebold killed the remaining five.

The shooting spree ended at 11.42am and 20 minutes later Harris and Klebold went to the library where at 12.08pm they killed themselves.

In among plans to make bombs out of jerry cans, which could be detonated by mobile phone, Piggin wrote about planning to bomb Loughborough Mosque, the court heard.

He wrote: ‘There’s too many Muslims in the UK and Europe, so we must stop them coming over here and send the ones already over here back home before they take over European governments and put Sharia Law in place.’

In recordings played to the jury Piggin was heard ranting about an ‘Islamic invasion of Europe’ and quoting from the violent Nick Love film Outlaw.

‘The reason I’m about to take this action is to show that even the smallest and least powerful people have the power to hit back against the strong and the powerful,’ he said.

‘They have the power to hit back at the strong and corrupt and hopefully it will cause people to do what I am, to rise up and take power back.

‘I can’t alone change much but hopefully my actions can ensure a revolution against the system.

‘People are living in a world of delusion.

‘Even if I lose or will be known as evil I would rather fight and die than live a long and unhappy life.’

Piggin and his friends filmed themselves making bombs ‘for their own amusement or for other people to view’,’ the jury heard.

He and two other 18-year-old boys who cannot be named for legal reasons, called themselves the Urban Revolutionary Army, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

Piggin, of Beaumont Road, Loughborough, denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before February 19, 2013.

The trial continues.
