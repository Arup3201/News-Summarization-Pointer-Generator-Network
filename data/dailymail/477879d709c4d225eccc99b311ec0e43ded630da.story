With her love of horses and appreciation for tradition, the Queen is an unlikely fan of contemporary dance.

But that didn't stop her from making a visit to the Rambert Contemporary Dance Company's new South Bank home, although she did seem a little bemused during one of the performances.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was wreathed in smiles as she made her way into the state-of-the-art premises ahead of the performance and given a tour of the new building by excited staff.

What's going on? The Queen is stony-faced as she watches one of the contemporary dancers perform

Nonplussed: The Queen looks less than impressed with the contemporary dance performance

Resplendent in a bright pink coat which she teamed with a matching dress and hat, the monarch appeared to be on good form as she greeted onlookers.

Despite recent bouts of ill-health, the Duke of Edinburgh looked in fine fettle and was dapper in a navy suit that complemented the Queen's cheerful ensemble.

Once inside, the couple were treated to a performance from some of the dancers currently on the Rambert's books, although not everything appeared to be to the Queen's liking.

But all that changed when she was introduced to some of the talent at the company, beaming and clearly enjoying the conversation as she greeted dancers who had waited in line to meet her.

One of the UK's oldest dance outfits, The Rambert Contemporary Dance Company was founded in 1926 by Polish émigré Marie Rambert who hoped to pioneer contemporary choreography and support aspiring dancers.

Inspection: The Queen was given a tour of the Rambert's state-of-the-art new HQ on London's South Bank

Offering a combination of classic and modern routines, it is the only British dance company to tour with an orchestra and is famous for its daring routines set to live music.

The Queen's visit to the contemporary dance company is her second musical engagement this week, with the other being the presentation of the Queen's Medal for Music during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

This year's winner of the prestigious award was opera star, Sir Thomas Allen, who enjoyed a lengthy career as a baritone, beginning with a 1971 performance at the Royal Opera House, before a more recent stint as a director.

Sir Thomas, who is thought to have inspired the musical Billy Elliot, is the ninth winner of the award, which in previous years, has recognised such luminaries as Welsh singer Bryn Terfel and soprano Dame Emma Kirkby.
