A wedding photographer is celebrating after this amazing image of the Tokyo skyline landed him the title of landscape photographer of the year.

Kevin Mullins, 40, captured the stunning shot from the top of the city's 2,142ft (653m) high Sky Tree Tower.

And while he normally spends his time taking photos of couples on their big day Mr Mullins showed he's no slouch when it comes to picturing cities.

He entered the picture into The Societies' Landscape Photographer of the Year award and beat thousands to the prize.

Mr Mullins, from Malmesbury, Wiltshire, picked up the award at an awards party attended by 500 people in London.

He said: ‘We went up there in the afternoon, waiting for dusk to get the right light.

‘There was rain and clouds and it was a great opportunity and I managed to get the right shot.

‘I am more of a social photographer, doing weddings and portraits but I thought I would enter into the competition.

‘There were around 13,000 entrants in the various categories and when I was told I was down to the final six or seven I was pleased.

‘I didn't think I had a chance so I was shocked when I won.’

More than 13,000 people took part in The Societies' annual competition, with Kevin picking up a trophy and £1,000 in equipment.

The Societies is the largest professional body of photographers in the UK.
