William Seed, 81, has been spared jail for continuing to harass his neighbours, despite being banned from doing so under an ASBO

A pensioner who was given an ASBO for waging a six-year campaign of 'absolute hell' against his neighbours has been spared jail - despite breaching his order at least five times.

William Seed, 81, from Longridge, Lancashire, became one of the oldest people in the country to be given an ASBO in August last year after carrying out an 'ongoing campaign of harassment' against Carolyn and William Maxwell.

During that hearing, the court heard how Seed would beep his car horn all day and night, make loud animal noises, scrape shovels along the ground to make a racket and slowly drive past the couple while staring at them.

He also repeatedly accused Mrs Maxwell, 43, of having an affair with an ex-policeman and swore at the couple in front of children.

The court heard how dead rats and rabbits, chickens’ feet and a 
mallards head had also appeared in the Maxwells' garden.

But yesterday, the retired lorry driver was again hauled before the courts for continuing to carry out the long-running 'hate' campaign.

The court heard Seed has continued to beep his horn at the 
Maxwells and had also thrown bags over their fence, which contained newspaper cuttings about so-called neighbours from hell.

But, despite there being 'no sign of abatement' to his harassment campaign, magistrates spared Seed jail.

Presiding magistrate Richard Clews said Seed's poor health - and the fact he cared for his elderly wife - meant he should not be sent to prison.

Speaking after the sentence, Mr Maxwell, 48, slammed the decision saying: 'We knew he’d play on the fact he’s 81, but his health doesn’t stop him harassing us.'

The campaign of abuse against the Maxwells began in 2008, shortly after the couple moved into their bungalow and put up a fence on their property.

During last year's hearing, Seed pleaded guilty to harassing his neighbours and was given a community supervision for 12 months.

He was also banned from using foul or abusive language, along with his ASBO.

But during yesterday's case, prosecutor Andy Robinson said there had been five or six separate breaches of the ASBO since March this year.

Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard how, on one occasion, Mr Maxwell saw Mr Seed throwing the bag full of newspaper cuttings over their fence.

Seed also beeped his car horn continuously while the couple were at home on March 24.

In June this year, Seed began 'shouting, swearing and being abusive' towards the couple for playing their radio in their garden - an incident Mr Maxwell caught on video.

In the footage, the pensioner can be seen leaning over the garden fence that separates the two properties, shouting profanities.

He is then filmed smirking into the camera lens, before swearing and shouting at Mr Maxwell, who is filming. He shouts: 'I pity your wife, but actually I don't, because she's a f***ing ugly cow'

He then then grabs a metal garden rake and waves it at Mr Maxwell, while shouting 'I pity your wife, but actually I don't, because she's a f***ing ugly cow.'

Sentencing, Mr Clews said: 'The report makes for a very sorry read. This has been an ongoing campaign of harassment which has been going on for years with no sign of abatement.

'I’m not prepared to accept that your neighbours are in any way to blame. All they would like is to live their lives in peace which is not a great deal to ask.

'Last year, you were made the subject of an ASBO after a long-running dispute with your neighbours and you were given a community order at the same time.

'In March you breached this and it has gone on for far too long. There are only two ways to bring this to an end.

'He is so hateful towards our family and 
it has been absolute hell. He’s so bitter inside and I know this won’t 
be the last. It’s not fair that we are left to suffer'

Mr Maxwell

'You can either look at yourself in the mirror and make a decision to bring it to an end or the other option is for the court to send you to prison.

'There are a catalogue of incidents I have heard about that are so serious they can only be dealt with by a custodial sentence.

'But, you are 81-years-old and you are not in the best of health and you look after your wife, who is of a similar age.

'No court would want to send an 81-year-old man to prison but I can assure you it will if it needs to.'

Mr Maxwell, a council worker, said: 'We were hoping for a prison sentence.

'I think he thinks of himself as a loveable rogue and he believes he’s always right. He doesn’t have a lot in his life and he just sits and waits for us to get home.

'He is so hateful towards our family and it has been absolute hell. He’s so bitter inside and I know this won’t be the last. It’s not fair that we are left to suffer.'

Mrs Maxwell added: 'All we want is for him to leave us alone so we can enjoy our lives.'

Seed was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years, and his ASBO was extended for five years.

He was fined £165 and was given a curfew to last four months.

Seed previously avoided jail in 2003 after he admitted killing up to 10 cats by smashing them over the head with a hammer and then drowning them in a dustbin filled with water.
