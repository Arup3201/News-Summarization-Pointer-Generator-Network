Squid fishermen have been blamed for the vicious slaughter of four sea lions found washed up on Malilbu beaches with gunshot wounds in the last two months.

While investigators are hunting the culprits, wildlife rescue workers say squid fishermen trying to keep sea lions away from their boats at night are responsible.

Fishermen are allowed to use special firecrackers to ward off the mammals, but shooting them is illegal.

Shocking: This is one of four sea lions found with fatal gunshot wounds on a Malibu beach

California Wildfire Center's Jonsie Ross told CBSLA.com sea lion shootings happen every year in October when squid fishing season begins.

'When the fishing season starts, October 1, yeah, we actually have documented more sea lion shootings,' she said.

The process to attract the squid to the surface of the water, which involves switching on a light, also attracts sea lions. The coast off Malibu is a popular area for squid fishing.

However the squid fishing industry has denied the accusations.

'I called several fisherman. They knew nothing,' California Wetfish Producers Association executive director Diane 
Pleschner-Steele said. 'They didn’t know who had done it. We don’t condone it. It’s illegal to 
shoot for any reason.'

Sea lions are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and anyone found harming them could be fined $10,000 and spend up to a year behind bars.

Devastating: Investigators are trying to work out who was behind the murder of four sea lions, including this one

NBC reported the first sea lion - a male yearling - was found on August 1 at Pirate’s Cove near Zuma Beach. A bullet was found in his right shoulder.

A necropsy report confirmed that he died from his bullet wounds.

Another male yearling was found on August 17 at Point Dume. He'd been shot through the cheek.

In October, another two sea lions riddled with bullet wounds were discovered.

On October 10, a sea lion with four gunshot wounds washed up at Broad Beach. He died 30 minutes after being rescued.

The next day, another dead sea lion appeared at Big Rock. The bullet came from a high caliber gun.

Donna Collins and her daughter were watching fishermen in Malibu one night when they said they were shocked to hear gunshots.

'We started hearing the gunshots. And they weren’t M-80s, they weren’t flash bombs. They were rifles,' Collins said.

David Reilly, a special agent at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he is investigating the cases.

He said it’s tough to find the culprits and investigators rely on tips from the public.

'You almost have to see it for a prosecution to be made,' he told NBC.
