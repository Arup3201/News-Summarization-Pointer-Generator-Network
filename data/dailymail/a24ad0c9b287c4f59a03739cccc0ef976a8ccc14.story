Chris Christie has personally appealed to President Barack Obama to extradite Tupac's aunt from Cuba.

Joanne Chesimard, a former Black Panther Party member who is living under the name Assata Shakur, last year became the first woman on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list for fleeing to the Caribbean island after executing a police officer in 1973.

Now, following the landmark change in relations between the US and Cuba, New Jersey Governor Christie has launched a bid to retrieve the 67-year-old from her hiding place.

Wanted: Gov Chris Christie has launched a personal appeal to extradite Tupac's aunt Joanne Chesimard

Convicted: The 67-year-old, now living as Assata Shakur, escaped jail in 1973 after killing Werner Foerster

In a letter to the president, Christie slams the deal with Castro's communist government but says it is an opportunity to bring justice and prove Cuba is ready for 'serious change'.

He wrote: 'I do not share your view that restoring diplomatic relations without a clear commitment from the Cuban government of the steps they will take to reverse decades of human rights violations will result in a better and more just Cuba for its people.

'However, despite my profound disagreement with this decision, I believe there is an opportunity for Cuba and its government to show the American people it is serious about change.'

Chesimard was convicted of killing New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973 during a gunbattle after being stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike.

Appeal: Christie wrote to Obama condemning the new relationship with CUba but urging action on Chesimard

'Armed and dangerous': Last year Chesimard became the first female on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list

Chesimard's nephew was rapper Tupac Shakur, who was shot dead in a drive-by in September 1996

She was found guilty but escaped from prison and eventually fled to Cuba, where she was granted asylum by Fidel Castro.

Christie's appeal comes despite his reluctance to weigh in on contentious foreign policy issues as he mulls a run for president in 2016.

He said Cuba's decision to grant Chesimard asylum 'is an affront to every resident of our state, our country, and in particular, the men and women of the New Jersey State Police, who have tirelessly tried to bring this killer back to justice.'

Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said it will 'continue to press in our engagement with the Cuban government for the return of U.S. fugitives in Cuba to pursue justice for the victims of their crimes.'
