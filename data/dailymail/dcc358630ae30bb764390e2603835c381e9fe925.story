Down on his luck: Former England cricketer Adam Hollioake has appeared in an Australian court this week over £14m debts from a disastrous property venture

Twelve years ago he was  captain of the England one-day cricket team.

But this week, after a spectacular fall from grace, Adam Hollioake was in court over £14million debts from a disastrous property venture.

Now bankrupt, the 40-year-old has even taken up cage fighting in an attempt to scrape some money together.

Bemoaning his downfall, he said of his wife, Sherryn: ‘When we married I was captain of England, good looking, plenty of money, not a care in the world. Now she is married to a fat old guy, not good looking any more, and no money.’

Hollioake gave up cricket and returned to Australia, where he was born, to go into business in 2004.

But last year he was declared bankrupt, and this week he appeared in court to confirm how much money is owed to each of his 40 creditors.

In an interview with the Daily Mail after his court appearance, he said: ‘Those who grumble about losing some of their money have lost nothing against what I lost, which is everything.

‘But you know, there is one thing that no one can take away from me. And that is the love of my wife Sherryn and my three beautiful kids. That along with my health. Health and a wife’s love are far more precious than money.’

He added: ‘Cage fighting doesn’t pay all that well. It hurts, physically, at times, but I haven’t got my head knocked off yet.

‘But boy, do they love to boo me when I go into the ring. I’m a traitor to the Aussies, after all, having been born here and then ending up in the UK playing cricket for England. I’m less popular than the taxman.’

Hollioake captained Surrey between 1997 and 2003, winning three County Championships, and led the England team in one-day internationals. He also represented his country in Test matches.

His brother Ben, also a cricketer, died in a car accident in 2002.

Hollioake then retired after his father, John, suggested he could receive a salary of around £100,000 a year if he joined him in a property development company.

Hollioake had doubled his money on a house sale in 1994 and believed he could do it again. ‘I was a genius – or so I thought,’ he said.

The venture soon turned sour. From living a life of luxury, with more than one home on each side of the Australian continent, he and his family now own no property and are renting.

Hollioake said: ‘The lawyers representing the creditors  in court yesterday wanted to know where every cent had gone and it was not a pleasant experience. They wanted to know everything about my life, almost down to how many times I went to the toilet.’

Since his bankruptcy, he said, attempts had been made ‘by enemies’ to paint him as a criminal, but he insisted: ‘I’m no crook. My life is an open book.’

He opened his wallet and added: ‘This is all I have left – just a few dollars. Yet there have been claims that I’ve ripped people off, run away with their money, got it all tucked away, secretly loaded myself up.

‘The truth is, I’ve been left with nothing. Nothing, that is, except the devotion of my wife, Sherryn, and the love of my kids.’

He said he was a victim of the global financial crisis, adding: ‘What happened was mostly out of my hands, although I accept that I did not apply the same professionalism in my business affairs as I did in my cricket.’

He now admits that he made a ‘massive error’.

His firm was liquidated in September 2010. Among his creditors is former England and Surrey teammate Alec Stewart, whose claim is estimated to be more than £400,000.

‘Alec understands the position I got myself into, as do the other creditors, apart from one who is determined to stamp me into the ground,’ Hollioake said.

‘There was another man I went into business with when I managed to get a TV show up and running on Channel Nine here in Australia.

‘Things didn’t go well between us – he ended up alienating my friends and business associates. Finally he tried to remove my wife as a director. I had to take him to court to put him back in his box.

‘But even though the court found in my favour and removed him from the directorship he in his anger accused me of stealing money.’

Hollioake showed the Mail a copy of a police search warrant which he said suggested he had indeed stolen cash. ‘Why else would the police want to draw up a search warrant?’ he said.

‘However, there is one problem with this document. It wasn’t signed, never executed. It was printed up as a result of a complaint by one of those working against me and of course the police had to get things rolling, but it didn’t get anywhere.’

Hollioake’s determination to fight the damage to his reputation was not helped when it was revealed that he had tried to leave the country without the permission of his bankruptcy trustee, and had been stopped by Australian Federal Police.

‘In fact, I had no idea I wasn’t allowed to leave after being declared bankrupt,’ he said.

‘I was actually on my way to Papua New Guinea to do some charity work, but when it was pointed out to me that travel was not allowed without explicit permission I realised I had made an innocent error.’

He added: ‘In two years I’ll be free of bankruptcy and the first thing I plan to do is to shake the hands of people who have lost money through my property ventures.

‘I am trying to establish whether I am legally entitled to try to pay them back after I  have been dismissed from bankruptcy but either way I feel very badly about what has happened and I hope that I can clear  the air with those creditors one way or the other.’
