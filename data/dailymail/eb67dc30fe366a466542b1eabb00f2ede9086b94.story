Dame Kelly Holmes insists the next generation of Team England stars can emerge at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.

The 44-year-old British track legend was accompanying the Queen’s Baton Relay on its journey around her home county of Kent today and insisted that excitement is building even now for the July showpiece event.

While the Games may struggle to match the magic and magnitude of the London Olympics, double Olympic gold medallist Holmes insists that the combination of established stars like Mo Farah and the best of England’s young talent can still inspire the nation.

Future: Dame Kelly Holmes believes a new generation of stars can come forward to Glasgow 2014

Champion: Dame Kelly won two gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 800m and 1500m

And, with Team England set to confirm their track and field squad on Monday, Holmes is optimistic about what she will witness at Hampden Park.

‘I won my first Commonwealth Games gold 20 years ago in Victoria,’ said the former 800m and 1500m specialist.

'I was sharing an apartment with Sally Gunnell. The year before, she had become world champion. The year before that, she had won Olympic gold.

‘So there I was - no one knowing who I was, still young in sport - and I’m sharing a room with an Olympic champion. It was incredible.

‘This is what I think will happen again, with the likes of Mo Farah, Tom Daley, all those people, in Glasgow.

‘Two years after Victoria, I was competing in an Olympics, where I came fourth. 

‘I got the silver medal in 98 after injury in Kuala Lumpur, and then I won bronze at the Olympic Games in Sydney two years after that.

Venue: Hampden Park will be the main athletics stadium at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games

‘I then won gold in Manchester prior to my double gold in Athens in 2004. So I’ve always had the Commonwealth Games as a massive part of my own development.

‘The atmosphere, the environment, the fact you’re with people from all different sports - that’s an education in itself.

‘It’s called the Friendly Games and it is as everyone pretty much speaks the same language – but it’s a friendly, competitive environment. 

‘We’ll see some amazing events happen.’ 

But what of Team England’s chances of gold? Will the focus be on the likes of Olympic champions Farah and Greg Rutherford or could there be others to emerge as Holmes once did? 

‘It will be a strong squad,’ said Holmes, now the president of Commonwealth Games England.

‘But the advantage of the Commonwealths, because of the breakdown of the Home Nations, is that it gives a lot more people the opportunity to participate.

‘It will provide some of Team England’s up and coming talent with the chance to perform and make a breakthrough. 

‘I’d won European silver (in the 1500m) in my first year as an international athlete in 1994 but no one really knew me. 

‘Two weeks later, I won Commonwealth gold in Victoria and suddenly I was put on a completely different pedestal in terms of world-class sport. 

‘And I think that’s what is going to happen in Glasgow for Team England - with some new stars born.’
