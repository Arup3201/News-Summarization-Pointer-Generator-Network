A worker who is being hunted by SWAT teams after opening fire at a meeting in a quarry - killing three people and injuring six more - was reportedly disgruntled at having been switched from day shifts to night shifts.

Loader operator Shareff Allman, 47, allegedly opened fire after walking into a safety meeting at a California quarry with a handgun and rifle. He was angered at the rota switch which stopped him from spending more time with his teenage daughter, neighbours said.

Allman fled the scene at Permanente Quarry in Cupertino this morning and several SWAT teams have been dispatched to find him - searching door-to-door with guns drawn, authorities said.

Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith confirmed the fatalities as Manual Pinon, 51, of Newman, California, John Vallejos, 51, of San Jose and Mark Munoz, 59, of San Jose.

Police said Allman walked into a routine safety meeting this morning at 4.15am.

When he left the meeting he began 
walking around the grounds of the quarry owned by Lehigh Southwest 
Cement Company, authorities said.

He returned with a handgun and an assault rifle, and opened fire, according to Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies.

Inside that meeting room, nine people of the 15 people in the meeting were shot.

One of the victims, now in critical condition, was shot in the face outside of the meeting room, according to a sheriff's deputy at the scene who declined to be named, NBC reported.

The sheriff said the suspect left the scene of that workplace shooting in his car.

Three hours later and five miles away, police said the suspect ditched his car near Homestead and Wolfe Road and attempted a carjacking in a nearby Hewlett-Packard parking lot.

The sheriff said he shot the female driver in the leg there and took off on foot to a nearby neighbourhood in Sunnyvale.

At 7pm Sheriff Smith said the search of a Sunnyvale neighbourhood would finish soon. She said SWAT officers had searched extensively but could not find the man they were looking for after a 12-hour effort, NBC reported.

'The only reports we have right now is 
that he was disgruntled and he was unhappy,' a Santa Clara County Sheriff's spokesman told NBC News.

'Whether it was work-related
or home-related, we don't know at this point.'

Potential reductions in employee 
hours at the quarry were cited as a possible reason for the shooting, 
but one of Allman's neighbours told the San Jose Mercury News that he 
had been upset after being moved from the day shift to the night shift.

The rota switch interfered with his plans to spend more time with his teenage daughter, Rose Douglas said.

Cupertino schools were on lockdown or closed as the search continued on Wednesday.

Sheriff Smith said two people were pronounced dead at Permanente Quarry in Cupertino, and a third person died later at the hospital.

Six others at the quarry were wounded and taken to area hospitals, Sheriff Smith said. Some of them remained in critical condition.

About 15 workers were evacuated and being kept at a safe location.

The carjacking victim is expected to fully recover.

Allman allegedly used a weapon similar to the gun used in the quarry shooting.

Permanente Quarry is a limestone and aggregate mining operation
and cement plant located in the foothills above Cupertino, near San Jose.

The shootings rattled those who know Allman.

'He's always had a smile on his face,' said Paulette Conner, 57, a neighbour at Allman's San Jose apartment complex who said she's known him for five years. 'I've never known him to have any violent tendencies. Never. Ever.'

Conner said Allman occasionally griped to her and others over the years about his job, including his various shift changes and some co-workers.

Allman is known as a local fixture long involved in San Jose's black community. Before a news conference where community leaders urged him to turn himself in, friends described Allman as a non-violent person not known to own guns.

'He used to do so much for the community. Something must have happened to make him flip out like this,' said Pastor Oscar Dace of Bible Way Christian Center. 'Everybody just can't believe that this has happened.'

In addition to working at the quarry, Allman has produced and hosted a public access television show for CreaTV in San Jose.

NBC showed him on a YouTube video 
interviewing civil rights campaigner Reverend Jesse Jackson at a Walter 
Hawkins Memorial Celebration. But the video has since been taken down.

Allman was one of 130 series producers who came in once a month and provided the public access station with content, CreaTV executive director Suzanne St. John-Crane said.

'Based on what we know now, we're shocked and devastated and feel for the families of the victims,' Ms St. John-Crane said. 'But he didn't work here. I want to make that clear. We're very frightened.'
