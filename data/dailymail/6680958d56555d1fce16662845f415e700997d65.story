England suffered another blow on Thursday morning when Andros Townsend pulled out of the squad to face Slovenia and Scotland through injury.

Townsend was unable to train with England for the last two days because of a slight ankle injury he suffered while playing for Tottenham.

And the Football Association confirmed on Thursday that the player would not be fit for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley or the friendly in Glasgow three days later.

Andros Townsend has had to withdrwa from the England squad due to an ankle injury

Michael Carrick is also a doubt for the games against Slovenia and Scotland

An FA spokesman said: 'Andros Townsend will today leave the England squad and return to his club.

'Townsend reported for duty on Monday with a minor injury and will go back to Tottenham Hotspur for further treatment.

'He will miss England's games against Slovenia and Scotland.'

Roy Hodgson's preparations for the double-header were disrupted on Wednesday when Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was ruled out because of what the FA called a 'minor groin injury'.

And 24 hours later, he learned Townsend would have to withdraw.

It is understood that Hodgson will not call up a replacement for Townsend, who scored a stunning goal on his England debut against Montenegro last year.

Townsend has endured a frustrating season with Tottenham but impressed for the Three Lions last season

Although Townsend was unlikely to have started this weekend's Euro 2016 qualifier, he would have probably featured at some stage against the Scots at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.

The Spurs midfielder missed the World Cup with an ankle injury, but returned to the squad in August and scored his second England goal in the 5-0 win over San Marino last month.

Townsend has struggled for form domestically this season and has started just one game in the Barclays Premier League.
