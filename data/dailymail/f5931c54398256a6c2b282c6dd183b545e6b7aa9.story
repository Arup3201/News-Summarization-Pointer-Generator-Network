Charged: Ian Ball, the day after he ambushed the Princess's car en route to Buckingham Palace

The fanatical loner who tried to kidnap Princess Anne believed he ought to be thanked for highlighting serious flaws in Royal security.

Ian Ball, who ambushed the Princess’s car en route to Buckingham Palace on March 20, 1974, said the police realising that the Royal Family needed better security was the ‘one good thing’ to come out of his ‘audacious’ crime.

Ball seeks to justify his actions in police files which were supposed to remain classified until 2048 but which have been obtained by The Mail on Sunday following a seven-month Freedom of Information battle.

In his interrogation after being arrested, the then 26-year-old told police: ‘I suppose I’ll be locked up for the rest of my life. I am only sorry I frightened Princess Anne. There is one good thing coming out of this: you will have to improve on her protection.’

The interview transcript provides new insights into a crime that shocked Britain. Princess Anne was 23 and had celebrated her marriage to first husband Captain Mark Phillips only months before. 

The couple were returning from a charity event when Ball used his Ford Escort to force their car to stop on The Mall.

Ball shot and wounded the Princess’s driver Alexander Callender and Inspector James Beaton, a Royal protection officer whose gun jammed as he confronted the attacker.

Ball demanded that the Princess get out of the car but she told him: ‘Not bloody likely.’

The would-be kidnapper told police that he thought she would be an easy target and that he had learned her movements simply by telephoning the Buckingham Palace press office.

He said: ‘I had thought about it for years… She would have been the easiest. I have seen her riding with her husband.’

Before his arrest, he also shot Brian McConnell, a journalist who tried to help the Princess, and constable Michael Hills. The files reveal that Ball showed no remorse for wounding the four men.

He said: ‘They were getting in my way so I had to shoot them. Well, the police, that’s their job. They expect to be shot. I took a chance of getting shot so why shouldn’t they?’

Ball had planned to take the Princess to a Central London property which he had rented under an alias, and to demand a ransom of £3 million.

Detectives initially feared Ball was part of the IRA but he told officers: ‘I have got no friends. I’m a loner. I put a lot of thought and work into it.

‘I can’t expect people like you to understand or accept that I did it and planned it alone. Do you think I am part of the IRA or something? If there had been anyone else they would have helped me at the scene.’

He also told police: ‘I knew [Beaton] would be armed. If his gun had not jammed, I would be dead.’

The Princess’s car was unaccompanied because police did not think the Royal Family was a target. But Ball’s actions led to a major overhaul of security arrangements for all VIPs.

Mr Beaton, who was awarded a George Cross for his bravery, last night said: ‘I am not surprised about the lack of remorse because he was mentally ill. But in a sense his comments about Royal security were right. Nobody expected anything like that to happen, not even with the IRA.

‘We took precautions but nothing like you have today. I was walking past the door at the wrong time and they said, “We want someone to help with the Royal protection team,” and that was it. There were no interviews or training.’

Ball pleaded guilty to kidnap and attempted murder. He was committed to a mental hospital and is believed to be currently in Broadmoor.
