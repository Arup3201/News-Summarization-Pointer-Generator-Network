Battle: The trial over the fortune of Huguette Clark, pictured, could now go ahead on Thursday

The sprawling, Connecticut estate of heiress Huguette Clark has finally been sold after almost a decade on the market.

Clark, a famous recluse never spent a single night in the place, also known as Le Beau Chateau, after buying it in 1952.

The new buyers finalized the deal Monday and got the home for $14.3 million, well under half the original $34 million asking price.

Clark had always said that the house was bought to 'get away from the horrors' of nuclear war, according to a great-half-nephew.

New Canaan News is reported in February that there was a sale pending on the 1937 chateau-style home.

That sale has now been made official, though the identity of the buyer remains undisclosed.

Le Beau Chateau, as Clark's estate was called, was listed at $15.9 million after being slashed from $34 million.

The nine-bedroom, eleven-fireplace mansion sits on a 52-acre estate.

However, the residence and the grounds need extensive renovation and restoration.

Real Estalker says that fashion designer and former Coach executive Reed Krakoff and his wife, interior designer Delphine Krakoff, who just sold their Upper East Side mansion for an astounding $51 million, are the proud new owners.

Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37

New Canaan realtor Barbara Cleary says she believes the right buyers have been found for the property. 

'They have a keen appreciation for the rarity and unique history of this beautiful estate,' she told New Canaan News.

Ms.
 Cleary also said the couple intended to restore and renovate both the 
house and the property. She also said the buyers are 'creative' and they
 intend to live there.

daughter of turn-of-the-century copper tycoon and U.S. Sen. William 
Clark, purchased the property in 1951, but never spent a night in the 
mansion..

'It's good for us 
to know that this incredible and historical estate will remain intact as
 of one of the area's crown jewels,' she  said.

Clark
 was the last surviving child of U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, who was 
born in a log cabin in Pennsylvania and became one of the wealthiest men
 of his day.

He is the namesake of Nevada's Clark County and established its county seat, Las Vegas.

A onetime socialite who became a social shadow, Huguette Clark died at 104 in 2011.

She
 had a penthouse and two other apartments on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue 
and exquisite homes in Santa Barbara, California, and New Canaan, 
Connecticut, but she elected to spend her last 20 years in a hospital.

With
 no close relatives, she left a roughly $300 million estate and a swirl 
of questions about the input she'd gotten from a close circle of 
caregivers and advisers and about the extensive gifts and bequests she'd
 given them in return.

She 
signed two wills within six weeks at age 98, the first bequeathing her 
riches mostly to about 20 distant relatives and the second cutting them 
out.

She died aged 104 in May 2011. Her distant relatives fought for years over her $300 million fortune

Empty Mansions: The 
Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American 
Fortune by Bill Dedman and one of Clark's relatives Paul Clark Newell 
Jr., lifts the lid on the fascinating family known for staying out of 
the limelight.

Oone of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s 
said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own 
sumptuous armchair.

One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls.

The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models.

A
 lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for 
someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of 
the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion. 

While she stayed at the hospital, her
 three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a 
$24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the 
largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

She
 inherited her wealth from her father, Montana Senator William Clark, 
and his copper mines but regarded her great wealth as 'a menace to 
happiness'.

When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.
