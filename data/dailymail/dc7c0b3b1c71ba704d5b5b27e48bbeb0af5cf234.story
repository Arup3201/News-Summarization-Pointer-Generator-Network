The Rangers power struggle took another twist on Wednesday as director Sandy Easdale revealed he had received 'several threats'.

The 47-year-old provided a £500,000 crisis-loan for the cash-strapped club earlier this month but has since found himself the object of supporters ire, and now the police have been forced to step in after he was threatened online.

The police are investigating internet posts that allegedly encouraged Rangers supporters to attack Easdale's home and force him out of the club.

In a statement to the BBC, Easdale said: 'I have received several threats that are now in the hands of the authorities and I am confident that Police Scotland will get to the bottom of this.

'I appreciate that feelings are running high but I would like to make an appeal for calm.

'This sort of behaviour is not in the best interests of the club, its shareholders or its true supporters.'

Easdale admitted he was not the only Rangers board member to suffer at the hands of the public, claiming all involved had been 'subjected to an unprecedented level of abuse'.

Easdale increased his stake on in the club on Tuesday after buying up more than one million shares.

The purchase means he now owns just over 5,250,000 shares - or just less than 6.5 per cent.
