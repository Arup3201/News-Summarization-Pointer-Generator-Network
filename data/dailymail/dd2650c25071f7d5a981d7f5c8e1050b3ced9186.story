A former doctor in Oklahoma faces nine counts of murder for allegedly over-prescribing controlled substances to several patients, eight of whom died from prescription drug overdoses and another caused a fatal car accident while under the influence of drugs supplied by the doctor.

Additionally, 71-year-old William Martin Valuck is charged with  72 counts of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance in Oklahoma County District Court.

Authorities say Valuck is responsible for the deaths of  Victoria Pretzer, Michelle Salazar, Jennifer Zimmerman, Paul Beesley, 
Christina Green, Joyce Curnett, SaShawn Saatian and Lorra Hilton, each of whom died from drug toxicity from excessive amounts of drugs prescribed by Valuck.

Dr. Feel Good: William Valuck faces eight murder charges for over-prescribing patients prescription narcotics

Valuck faces an additional murder charge in the death of Ronald Banton, who was killed in a car wreck on December 9.

The driver of the other car, Dustin Hall, was allegedly under the influence of prescription drugs illegally prescribed by Valuck.

The indictments were handed down Wednesday.

'Our investigation has revealed that during a period of approximately 
one year, Dr. Valuck prescribed extremely large amounts of controlled 
substances â€” including the most abused prescription drugs on the street â€”
 to numerous patients with very little medical examination or the 
establishment of a valid doctor-patient relationship,' Oklahoma State 
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control agent T.N. Briscoe wrote
 in the arrest warrant, which was first obtained by the Oklahoman.

In the past, getting a murder conviction for a doctor who over-prescribes prescription drugs is no easy task.

Propofol: Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced to four years in prison for over-prescribing the drug Propofol to Michael Jackson

The most notable case of a doctor facing charges in a patient's death for over-prescribing drugs is that of Conrad Murray, the former physician of pop star Michael Jackson.

Murray was accused of illegally injecting Jackson with high doses of the drug propofol, which the pop legend claimed he needed to sleep.

Following Jackson's death, an autopsy revealed that he died as a result of an overdose from propofol and other drugs.

The jury in the case found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and sentenced him to four years in prison. He was released in October of 2013.
