Thailand is not short of a marvellous beach or two. It is, after all, a country with 2,000 miles of coastline. 

There's The Beach, of course, on the island of Ko Phi Phi Lee, as featured in the 2000 film based on the Alex Garland novel and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

And there's the small sandy cove on Khao Phing Kan in uber-picturesque Phang Nga Bay. 

The Khao Sok National Park is one of the oldest rainforests in the world, where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps

The island is now known as James Bond Island, upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons, echoing the scene from The Man With The Golden Gun of 007 (Roger Moore) and the evil Scaramanga (Christopher Lee).

But the problem is practically every other visitor who chooses Thailand for their exotic sun, sea and sand holiday wants to sit and be seen in the country's most famous hotspots too. It gets a little crowded, to say the least.

At the risk of sounding a bit of a beach snob, I want to be alone, or at least not swamped by hundreds of other sunbathers, when I'm on my holiday, at least until I've shaken off some stress.

If you do too, you'll adore the JW Marriott Khao Lak. And thanks to direct flights to Phuket aboard Thomson's Dreamliner, you don't have to faff around catching a connecting flight from Bangkok. It's a real bonus.

If you have flown long haul before, you will notice the difference - more space, both seat-wise and all around, dimmable windows, more oxygen and better lighting all make the journey more bearable.

And it's only an hour or so drive north from the airport to Khao Lak, or 90 minutes away from the busy and, er, colourful attractions of tourist trap Patong.

The JW Marriott Khao Lak is very classy and quiet and has a glorious beach whch is free from crowds

I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting such a tasteful resort. Distinctly oriental in design, the JW Marriott Khao Lak is very classy and quiet, with 250 rooms and all the facilities you need for a proper rest and de-stress, whether there's just two of you or the whole family.

There's a nice spa, Quan, offering all the usual pamperings and treatments. The range of dining options includes breakfast and international cuisine in the Waterfront restaurant, Thai food at Ta-Krai, Japanese at Sakura, and Mediterranean at Olive. There's a deli, too, and numerous bars and lounges.

It's easy not to step outside for the whole holiday, but I was persuaded to do a little sightseeing.

A trip to James Bond Island also included a look at a small rubber plantation, feeding monkeys beside a Buddhist temple, cruising through mangrove swamps in a long-tailed boat, and lunch in the Muslim village at Panyi Island. It's all well run and very commercialised.

More off the beaten track is Khao Sok National Park, one of the oldest rainforests in the world, where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps.

However, do be very careful to choose a well-run establishment when selecting this kind of adventure. 

We were taken by canoe - you don't even have to lift an oar yourself - down the Sok River, admiring the trees and waterfalls as we went.

And, of course, there are dozens of snorkelling and diving sites to choose from.

The JW Marriott Khao Lak itself offers numerous sports on site, a fitness centre, and there's golf galore nearby.

Naturally, it has plenty of places to sunbathe or take a dip, not least Khuk Khak Beach, a marvellously empty stretch of white sand fringing the Andaman Sea.

The resort also claims to have South-East Asia's longest swimming pool - indeed, it winds around and in between the buildings like a huge lazy river, allowing some rooms to actually be swim-up, which is great for families.

The best bit for me, though, was the very private hidey-holes complete with loungers, cleverly sheltered with hedges, but still with easy access to the water. Paradise found.
