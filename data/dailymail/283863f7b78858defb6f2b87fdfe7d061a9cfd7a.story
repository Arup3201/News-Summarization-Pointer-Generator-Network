A Good Samaritan who stopped a nurse being harassed on a train suffered a heart attack as he left the station - and was saved after she gave him emergency treatment.

Grandfather-of-four Stephen Breed, 65, stepped in after he saw Polly Collins, 43, being shouted at and abused by a stranger on the Tube.

Mr Breed, who had never met the registered nurse before, waded-in and told the man to go away and he quickly left her alone.

Miss Collins and Mr Breed then got off at the same Underground station but because of the stress he suffered a heart attack and slumped to the floor minutes later.

But incredibly the nurse saw him as she left the station and immediately gave him emergency treatment including CPR - saving his life.

Retired warehouse manager Mr Breed, a dad-of-two, said: 'It's funny isn't it. She saved my life.

'She was on the phone texting and when we pulled into the station this man got aggressive about its noise and got in her face. This guy was awful, so rude.

'I had a go and then he got in my face - I can look after myself but I was a bit intimidated and my heart was racing a bit.

'But it all got sorted and then my stop came. I got off the train, and 30 seconds later that was it - good night Vienna.'

But modest Miss Collins, of Grimbsy, Lincolnshire, said: 'I was just carrying out the duty of care, being a registered nurse, and anybody would do the same.

'At the end of the day, this guy was quite remarkable himself. He defended me in such a manner and it turns out he was the one that needed defending.

'It could have been such a sad story, but thankfully it turned out brilliantly. I was just pleased, and praise the Lord, that he survived.

Miss Collins was heralded Nurse of the Week by her employers for her efforts 

'Had he not, I would have had to live with it for the rest of my life, because he didn't need to do what he did.'

Miss Collins started being abused by the stranger on her way to work at nearby Hillingdon Hospital but the man was quickly confronted by Mr Breed.

After calming the situation he got off the tube but as he walked ten metres from the train he dropped down with a heart attack and technically 'died' three times.

Miss Collins then spotted her own hero lying on the floor at the turnstiles while his wife Masdalina, 62, screamed for help.

She quickly grabbed the station's defibrillator and resuscitated the grandfather following the incident on Saturday.

Miss Collins preformed CPR on him until ambulance crews arrived at Uxbridge station, in Hillingdon, north west London.

Paramedics took Mr Breed to heart specialists at Harefield Hospital where he was operated on, receiving a stent, and was discharged on Tuesday.

His daughter Sarah, 42, of Queen's Park, north west London, said: 'They are both heroes but she is a much greater one.

'She turned into superwoman at that moment. I couldn't be more thankful to her.'

Miss Collins has since been heralded 'Nurse of the Week' by her employers, Thornbury Nursing Services, for saving Mr Breed.   

The grandmother-of-two  said: 'They've nominated me for nurse of the week - it's great.

'I think you just get some Marks and Spencer vouchers - but it's great to have a little bit of recognition.

'I didn't do it for that though, I only did what anybody would do.' 

Doctors told Stephen that his heart stopped three times after he collapsed, meaning he technically 'died' three times.

tish Transport Police are now looking for the man who abused the nurse on the busy train shortly before 12pm on Saturday.
