The elusive 'Post Office Mauritius' two penny blue stamp fetched just over £1 million to become the most valuable ever sold in the UK.

An unidentified telephone bidder beat off competition from six would-be buyers in the crowded sales room to pay twice as much as expected for one of the world's most famous stamps at Spink Auctioneers, London.

The stamp was one of the highlights of the Chartwell collection formed by businessman and philanthropist Sir Cyril Humphrey Cripps, expected to fetch more than £20million in nine sales over 18 months.

He had originally bought the stamp in 1972 for £29,000. Five days later he was offered £39,000 for it but turned the money down. 

Collectors from around the world have descended on the auction house to bid for stamps currently held in 80 albums.

Another rarity going under the hammer is the finest known 'penny black', dating from the beginning of the Post Office in 1840.

It is expected to fetch between £150,000 and £200,000. 

Auction house chairman Olivier Stocker 
said: 'The Chartwell Collection is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of 
the biggest ''wow'' moments we have ever experienced.

'When the collection arrived in 
London it was amazing to watch as our specialists turned the pages of 
what may be one of the finest philatelic collections of our time to 
reveal treasure after treasure.'

Sir
 Humphrey was a passionate collector all his life. After his death in 
2000, his children found a shoebox in the back of his wardrobe 
containing thousands of train tickets.

He
 had kept the ticket from every journey he had ever made.

Sir Humphrey 
began collecting stamps in the 1950s, encouraged by his son Robert, who 
had inherited a stamp album from an uncle.
