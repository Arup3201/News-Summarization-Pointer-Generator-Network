Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told councillor Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead.

Miss Harman allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to Mrs Danczuk for the first time.

It comes after the Labour shadow minister was accused of 'patronising' women after unveiling a bright pink women-only mini bus to attract female voters ahead of the election in May.

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told MP's wife Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead 

Mrs Danczuk, whose husband is the Labour MP Simon Danczuk, said Miss Harman's pink battle bus exposed politicians' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns.

She said: 'What women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner. Not a patronising pink bus screaming drama queen!'

Mrs Danczuk later added: 'When I first met Harriet Harman she said I was far too pretty to be interested in politics & should be in Girls Aloud.'

She told MailOnline: 'It was at a conference in Manchester. I wanted a photo with her and she said "you're far too pretty to be in politics". I suppose I've proved her wrong - I did go on to be a councillor.'

But Miss Harman this afternoon rejected the allegation. She said: 'I deny I ever said that and it’s inconceivable I would have ever said that.

'I have always believed it’s what you do in politics, not what you look like. I have never discouraged a woman from getting involved in politics on the basis of their looks.'

The allegation sparked fresh accusations that Mrs Harman was belittling female voters.

Labour's 'woman-to-woman' campaign tour got off to a rocky start in Stevenage yesterday when an angry voter told her it was 'patronising and wrong' to divide men and women.

Mrs Danczuk said Labour's pink battle van – which has been dubbed the Harriet's Barbie bus – exposed MPs' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns

In a bizarre twist in gender politics, Ms Harman revealed the party had even held 'doctrinal discussions' about whether a man is allowed to drive the Woman to Woman bus as it tours marginal seats. Yesterday it had a woman driver.

The minibus, funded by the Unite union, will tour 70 marginal seats in the run-up to the election on May 7, with female Labour MPs, councillors and trade unionists on board.

Labour said it will visit school gates, shopping centres and high streets.

Miss Harman's tour received a mixed response yesterday. Nicola Dinnage from Stevenage, said: 'I think it's silly and I think it's patronising.'

Her sister, Kirsty Dinnage, added: 'Them using a pink bus wouldn't make me vote.'

Beverley Gould from Knebworth said it is 'very patronising', adding that she does not think the pink bus will make any difference to female voting numbers.

But other shoppers disagreed, with Beb Metcalfe, from Welwyn, saying the colour of the bus 'doesn't matter'.

However, Miss Harman has spent the day denying it is patronising because it 'doesn't have big eyelashes on the front'.

She told Sky News: 'It's not about a colour it's about something, it's about our democracy. It's a small bus but big issues.'

The Labour bus has sparked a storm of criticism, and has been repeatedly likened to a Barbie vehicle

Ahead of the bus's official unveiling, Miss Harman said that 'ultimately' the colour choice was hers it had to be 'eye-catching' because there is a 'big hole in our democratic politics at the moment'.

She insisted that the bus would help to address political disengagement amongst women.

But critics said the pink obsession makes it look like something from an advert for women-only insurance firm Shelia's Wheels

Senior Labour MPs tried to defend the colour, insisting it was actually 'magenta' and had been used at party conferences in the past.

A Labour source joked: 'We modelled it on the colour that David Cameron's face goes when he gets cross during Prime Minister's Question time.'

But the Prime Minister mocked the bus in the Commons yesterday: 'What Britain's families need to get on most of all is the security of a good school place, and we are providing them, the security of a good job, and we are providing them, and the security of a safe community, and we are providing them.

'I have to say Labour's campaign - I would say the wheels are falling off the wagon but I think the wheels are falling off the bus.

'We now know it is not going to be driven by anyone on the front bench, surprise, surprise it is going to be driven by Unite.'

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman defended the party's women-only pink minibus, insisting it would be 'looking great

Ms Harman was challenged on ITV's Good Morning Britain about why everyone was talking about the colour of the bus and not important election issues

Given that Labour's official colour has long been red, it would have made sense – and caused less controversy – if the mini-bus had been red too.

But Harriet Harman worried it might have ended up looking like a sandwich delivery firm.,

She told journalists: 'We could have had red but that would look like all the other Labour vehicles and we wanted something different.

'Then we wanted a darker red but it looked like Pret a Manger. We wanted it to look conspicuous and therefore obviously a white van was not going to do the job.

'It is a very nice looking bus. It is the correct colour. This is a One Nation Labour colour.'

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Miss Harman said: 'We just wanted an eye catching colour. The reason why it has to be eye-catching is because there is a big hole in our democratic politics at the moment.'

She claimed 9.1million women did not vote in the general election in 2010 'because they just don't think that politicians have got any interest in their lives or understand their lives or have got anything to offer to them'.

She added: 'In this general election we think it's important that women do think that they have got a chance to have a say and this election is about their future and their daughters and their granddaughters' future.'

Lib Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said it was the wrong way to attract female voters.

He told the Western Morning News: 'The Barbie bus? It's just a tiny bit condescending because it's bright and pink therefore women relate to it more.

'It's a bit like saying that political parties should drive around in macho red sports cars and blokes across the country will suddenly listen to them.

'It just a slightly patronising way to deal with voters it seems to me.'

Tory Caroline Dineage: 'The wheels have come off the Labour bus. Getting Harriet Harman to drive around the country in a pink van to try and attract the female vote is as patronising as it gets.

'This is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through.

The launch of Labour's Woman to Woman bus left internet bloggers tickled pink – as the web buzzed with a host of jokes and parodies.

One mocked-up an image of deputy leader Harriet Harman, along with MPs Gloria De Piero and Lucy Powell, in a spoof advert for women's car insurer Sheilas' Wheels. The pink theme was also likened to the 2001 film Legally Blonde in a mock film poster declaring: 'Reese Witherspoon Votes Labour this summer.'

But one less humorous posting referred to the child grooming scandal which has hit Labour-run Rotherham Council. It showed the back of the bus emblazoned with Miss Harman's face and the large slogan 'Labour looking after women'.

Attached to an asterisk underneath, the caption adds: 'Like we did in Rotherham.'
