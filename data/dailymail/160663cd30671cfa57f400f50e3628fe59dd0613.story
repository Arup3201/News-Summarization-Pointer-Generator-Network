Evidence: This is footage from the video, where the officer, who has been blurred, asked the potential informant for details about students in return for cash

Police are spying on Cambridge students, with one undercover police officer secretly filmed asking a potential informant to relay information about political activities on Facebook for £30-a-time, it emerged today.

The plain-clothes detective was caught on camera offering cash to an undergraduate to provide details about his friends and any links they might have to political or environmental groups.

Focussing on social media the officer, who has not been identified, asked him: 'Can you have a look on Facebook and let us know?', adding: 'We cannot hack accounts... It would be more of an education for me'.

The officer explained his force is hungry for inside information on groups at the 800-year-old institution, so they could disrupt or manage any protests.

He said it is ‘impossible’ to infiltrate the student union and other organisations with undercover officers so they must recruit informants instead.

But his potential recruit instead wore a hidden camera and captured every word on tape to expose the undercover officer’s tactics.

The video raises fresh questions about the scale of police undercover activities targeted at legitimate and mostly peaceful protesters.

It is also an utter humiliation for the officer who is 
likely to work for an intelligence unit responsible for policing public 
protests.

Cambridgeshire Police tried to defend his actions claiming 
officers can use ‘covert tactics’ to help in the ‘prevention and 
detection of criminal activity.’

But senior officers nationwide have
repeatedly signalled that such intrusive tactics should only be used 
against the most dangerous criminals.

There have been a series of 
scandals in which undercover officers ran amok among protest groups, 
fathering children and adopting the identities of dead babies. 

Protest: Anti-Chinese protesters, none of whom are linked to today's revelations, are controlled by police in Cambridge as they fight for a free Taiwan

Message: A Cambridge University proctor walks though the middle of the protest, as students, again not linked to today's story, stage a sit-in in opposition to Government plans to introduce student fees

The latest controversy emerged after the activist, aged in his 20s, was approached by the police officer by telephone.

He
attended a police station twice and was asked to launch a secret spy 
operation on the political activities of his friends and students.

The
officer asks the man to target ‘student-union type stuff’, claiming 
this would be of interest to police because ‘the things they discuss can
have an impact on community issues.’

During a lengthy chat, he 
asked for the names of students who attend protests, the identities of 
their leaders and details of their vehicles.

The potential informant 
is told to also focus on UK Uncut, Unite Against Facism and 
environmentalists, including those opposed to fracking.

Wearing a 
blue and white striped T-shirt, the burly officer also asked the student
to monitor Facebook for details of forthcoming events.

He said that 
when groups hold meetings they may ask the potential informant to attend
and pay him around £30 for his time and effort.

The officer said: 
‘Let’s keep it small, you know little things that go on, little meetings
that happen where they are going to discuss different issues in 
Cambridge, whether it be, such as at the university or those sorts of 
things.’

Targets: Footage of the interview reveals that police are want information on Canbridge students, which the force says helps the 'prevention and detection of criminal activity'

The activist was first contacted at the beginning of 
October, before contacting The Guardian newspaper which helped record 
the meeting.

He believes he was chosen because he was a member of anti-nuclear groups and had been arrested three times on demonstrations.

Last night, the failed attempt to recruit the activist was blasted as a ‘a gross abuse of surveillance powers.’

Big
Brother Watch director Nick Pickles said: ‘For the police to pay 
students to infiltrate and spy on anti-fracking or educational campaign 
groups, where there is zero suspicion of any wrongdoing, is a gross 
abuse of surveillance powers.

‘Coming after attempts to discredit the
family of Stephen Lawrence and undercover officers fathering children 
with activists this episode makes clear why the police should not be 
able to approve their own undercover surveillance operations.’

‘Were
it not such a stark reminder of the weak oversight of police 
intelligence operations you’d be forgiven for thinking this was the plot
for a student film, albeit inspired more by David Brent than James 
Bond.’

Rachel Wenstone, of the National Union of Students, said the move undermines the legitimate right to protest.

She said: ‘This revelation is an absolute scandal. We now need to know just how widespread this practice is.’

Cambridge University Students’ Union said it was ‘absurd’ that its members were a focus for the police.

A
spokesman said: ‘Tactics such as these are not only intrusive, they 
also waste time targeting groups which are involved in making important 
and positive change in our society.’

Cambridgeshire Police said: 
Officers use covert tactics to gather intelligence, in accordance with 
the law, to assist in the prevention and detection of criminal 
activity.’
