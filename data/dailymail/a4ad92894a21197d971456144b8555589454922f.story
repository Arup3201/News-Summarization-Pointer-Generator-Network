As the Ebola outbreak worsens in West Africa, America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned U.S. travellers to avoid non-essential trips to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

The advice was a Level 3 travel warning, which is the strongest that can be issued.

It comes as the first Ebola victim to be brought to the United States from Africa arrived in the country yesterday.

Along with advising passengers not to travel to affected countries, CDC
 said it was assisting with active screening and education efforts in 
West Africa to prevent infected travellers from boarding planes.

If
 an infected passenger does make it on to the flight, CDC said it had 
protocols in place to protect against further spread of the disease, 
including monitoring suspected infections during a 21-day ‘fever watch’ 
and then isolating anyone who develops the disease in quarantine.

CDC 
Director Tom Frieden said: ‘This is the biggest and most complex Ebola 
outbreak in history. Far too many lives have been lost already.

‘It will take many months, and it won’t be easy, but Ebola can be stopped. We know what needs to be done.

‘CDC is surging our response, sending 50 additional disease control experts to the region in the next 30 days.’

Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, appeared on CNN today to re-assure the American public that they were not at risk from an Ebola outbreak

Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary working in Liberia, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 80 per cent of those it infects.

He was safely escorted into a specialized isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where doctors said they were confident the deadly virus won't escape.

Nancy Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second American to contract the disease in Liberia, and is expected to arrive in Atlanta tomorrow.

Fears that the outbreak in Africa could spread in the U.S. has generated considerable anxiety among some Americans, but infectious disease experts said the public faces zero risk.

CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told The Associated Press that the centre had received "nasty emails" and at least 100 calls from people saying: 'How dare you bring Ebola into the country!?'

‘I hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill Americans return to the U.S. for care,’ Dr Frieden said.

He added: 'Ebola is a huge risk in Africa. It's not going to be a huge risk in the U.S.'

The virus, which has gripped both Sierra Leone and Liberia (pictured) has also spread to neighbouring Guinea

Emirates has suspended flights to Conakry after there was an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea

The UK Government has not advised against travel to West Africa but said it was closely
 monitoring the spread of the virus and was taking "precautionary 
measures".

It
 claimed that Ebola was "not an issue that affects the UK directly" and said that the risk of the disease spreading in the UK was low thanks to the work of 
experienced scientists and doctors at the Royal Free Infectious Disease 
Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of
 Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Despite 
fears over flights still operating into and out of West Africa - often 
with direct routes to London - the Foreign Office claims Border Staff 
have been trained to recognise symptoms.

A
 statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) read: 'Border 
Force has been working closely with Public Health England and other 
agencies to ensure staff are prepared to deal with the threat of the 
Ebola virus.

'As
 part of this planning, guidance has been issued to front line staff on 
how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola that makes
 clear what steps need to be taken should a passenger arrive at the 
border unwell.

'If
 a person is identified at the border as being a potential carrier of 
Ebola they will be immediately referred by a Border Force officer to a 
specialist medical care provider and reported to the Public Health 
England.'

Guinea's capital Conakry will not be serviced by Emirates flights until further notice

British Airways has confirmed it will continue to run its route to Liberia and Sierra Leone

Last week, Emirates announced that it had suspended flights to Guinea over fears of spreading the Ebola virus.

The
 Dubai-based carrier is the first major international airline to cancel 
flights due to the epidemic which has taken hold in West Africa.

However,
 British Airways continues to operate its flight from Liberia to London 
Heathrow, which also stops at Lungi International Airport in Sierra 
Leone.  

Emirates confirmed the decision to suspend flights to Conakry came after there was an outbreak of the virus in Guinea.

The
 suspension of the route follows a similar decision by Pan-African 
airlines Arik and ASKY, which have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra 
Leone.

The current 
Ebola outbreak is the first documented outbreak in West Africa, and  the largest ever recorded since the virus was first 
detected in 1976, with more than 1,200 cases so far.

It far exceeds the next largest outbreak, involving 425 cases.

Around 60 per cent of cases so far have been fatal and more than 700 people have died since the start of February.

Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas is considered very low as long as they take the correct precautions.

The highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes.

It is recommended that travellers:

The first stage of the illness is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea.

The
 second is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure 
difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their 
body.

Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes 
from white to red. Generally patients who 
enter the second stage do not survive.

There is no proven cure for the virus, 
which kills an estimated 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the people it 
infects, but American doctors in Africa say the mortality rate would be 
much lower in a functioning health care system.

They have also been using experimental treatments, including the transfusion of blood that includes antibodies.
