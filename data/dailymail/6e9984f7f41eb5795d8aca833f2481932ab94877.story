Hospital staff called a woman to say her father needed urgent tests - while she was with family and friends at his wake.

Oksana Holbrook couldn’t believe her ears when a nurse from Nottingham City Hospital rang her mobile phone to ask her 89-year-old father to come in for blood tests, just after she had buried him.

Ms Holbrook, 55, of Carlton, Nottingham, said the nurse wanted her father, Mychajlo Tiahnybida, to have his blood checked to see if his prostate cancer had got any worse.

Horrified: Oksana Holbrook took a call from a nurse at Nottingham City 
Hospital at her father's wake asking the 89-year-old (pictured in the photo) to come in for 
blood tests

But he had just been buried at Wilford Hill Cemetery, Nottingham, and the family was at his wake in the city’s Ukranian Cultural Centre.

Ms Holbrook, said: 'I couldn’t believe it. It proved what a waste of space the hospitals were - one department was not talking to the other.'

Nottingham University Hospitals Trust admitted it had made a mistake.

Jenny Leggott, director of nursing and midwifery, said: 'We extend our sympathy to the family for their sad loss and offer sincere apologies.

'Due an administrative error the information about this patient’s death was not processed as it should have been.

'An alert which would have avoided any further contact from the hospital was omitted from the medical record.'

Mr Tiahnybida was told he had prostate cancer at Nottingham City Hospital in April.

After
falling at home in West Bridgford, Nottingham, he was admitted to the 
city’s Queen’s Medical Centre in May for eight weeks, before being 
discharged and readmitted on the same day at the end of July.

Mr Tiahnybida, a former carpenter for Boots, was sent to Lings Bar Hospital, Gamston, Nottingham, a week later and died on Wednesday, August 8. His funeral was held on August 20.

NHS Notts Healthcare, which runs Lings Bar, said: 'In the event of a patient’s death, Lings Bar Hospital follows a strict procedure, issuing an electronic death discharge letter to the patient’s GP and to medical secretaries across other organisations.

'On this occasion this letter was sent out to all necessary parties on August 10, two days after Mr Tiahnybida’s death.'

Ms Holbrook said she also had concerns over her father’s discharge at the end of July, and would make a complaint.
