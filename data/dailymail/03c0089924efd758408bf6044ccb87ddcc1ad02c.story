Cycling anywhere with a toddler in tow means having to leave the buggy at home. 

And any parent who has tried this will know how tiring it can be when you then have to carry your child around once you arrive at your destination.

A Swedish firm is hoping to make getting around with a young child easier - and save your aching arms - by introducing the bike seat that doubles up as a stroller. 

Påhoj (pictured) was designed by Swedish designer Lycke von Schantz. It has a 'lightweight chassis' and is 3.2ft (1 metre) tall. The product will launch on Kickstarter next week but prices are not yet known

Called Påhoj, it clips onto the back of a standard bike using a specially-designed attachment. 

A child, up to a height of 3.2ft (1 metres), is then strapped into the seat in an almost vertical position. 

The parent cycles to their destination, and once they arrive, can unclip the seat and push it like a regular buggy. 

The concept was created by Swedish designer Lycke von Schantz and a prototype has been safety tested.

Designer Lycke Mr von Schantz plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign on 9 April, and if successful, the models could be available before the end of the year. 

'An ordinary bicycle with a bike seat attached is a fantastic way to get around with your child,' explained Påhoj - which is Swedish for 'on bike.' 

'But what options do you have when you have arrived at your destination, parked your bike and need to walk around?

'As of today there is a simple solution to this problem: Påhoj - a child bike seat and stroller in one'

'Using Påhoj you can be flexible in what way you want to get around.

'Whether you choose to bicycle or not you can always be sure you can easily bring your child.

Mr von Schantz plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign on 9 April, and if successful, the models could be available before the end of the year. 

However, prices and an exact release date have not yet been announced.
