Click here to read Neil Ashton's interview with Adel Taarabt

Adel Taarabt and Harry Redknapp aren't exactly getting on at the moment. After QPR's last-gasp defeat against Liverpool on Sunday, the manager gave it both barrels to Taarabt about his physique, claiming the maverick was 'three stone overweight'. 

The 25-year-old wasn't particularly impressed with that assertion and told Sportsmail that he would prove he's in tip-top shape. 

And it isn't the first time managers have played out major bust-ups with their players in public. Sportsmail takes a look at some of the more colourful characters to have disagreed in the past.

Souness vs Bellamy – January 2005

Graeme Souness isn’t a man to mince his words and accused Craig Bellamy of feigning an injury in order to get out of playing wide right at Newcastle. The striker was fined £80,000 by the Magpies after claiming his manager had fabricated about the background to their bust-up before a trip to Arsenal.

‘Craig Bellamy has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club with his attitude to the coaching staff, to me and to his team-mates,’ Souness said.

‘I told Bellamy that he had to apologise to the rest of the players but then I found out later he had not done so. That was on Friday teatime and that's when I decided he wasn't going to be in my team at Arsenal. If he had apologised, he would have been.’

Craig Bellamy was alleged to feigned an injury in order not to play for Newcastle under Graeme Souness 

William Gallas and Jose Mourinho did have a good relationship before their spat in July 2006

Mourinho vs Gallas – July 2006

William Gallas was told in no uncertain terms that he had disrespected his Chelsea team-mates for failing to join the rest of the squad on a pre-season trip to Los Angeles.

‘It's not only me that is upset - we're all upset,’ Mourinho fumed.

‘Everybody is upset because we had a strong family and a strong group and this has shown a lack of respect to everybody and I don't like that.’

Gallas left Stamford Bridge soon after. Don’t mess with Mourinho.

Redknapp vs Bent – January 2009

Tottenham’s Darren Bent glaringly headed wide when presented with an open goal during a disappointing draw against Portsmouth.

Harry Redknapp’s synopsis was that ‘you will never get a better chance to win a match than that. My missus could have scored that one’.

A fair enough assessment given the gravity of the miss, but it didn’t stop a disgruntled Bent forcing a move away from White Hart Lane.

Mancini vs Balotelli – January 2013

This was an on-going soap opera worthy of primetime on terrestrial television - neither of these egos refused to budge an inch. The frosty relationship appeared reached its height in January 2013, the season in which Manchester City relinquished their Premier League crown.

Roberto Mancini reacted angrily to something Mario Balotelli had done in training at Carrington, yanking on his striker’s bib as the pair became embroiled in a bust-up.

The manager lost his job at the end of the campaign and Balotelli was sold to AC Milan the same year. City weren’t about to see their reputation tarnished and washed their hands of both, who had distracted from retaining the title.

Houllier vs Ginola – November 1993

This feud lasted a good 19 years. France winger David Ginola had over-hit a last-minute cross in a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria. Fairly nondescript stuff, until you fast-forward 15 seconds and see the ball nestled in the French net from the resulting counter attack – a goal that in fact ended their hopes of reaching the United States.

Gerard Houllier, then the manager, was clearly still disgruntled by Ginola giving the ball away and wrote so in a book. Ginola took his former boss to court – citing defamation – only for it to be thrown out.

‘The court wanted to end this story by dismissing David Ginola's case,’ Houllier’s lawyer said.

Di Canio vs Foderingham – September 2012

Swindon Town goalkeeper Wes Foderingham wasn’t having the best of days away at Preston two years ago. He was at fault for two goals in the opening 20 minutes at Deepdale and hauled off by manager Paolo Di Canio.

But it got markedly worse, quickly.

The 21-year-old was so incensed by this decision that he had sulked off straight down the tunnel. Di Canio’s response? ‘He was one of the worst players I have ever seen in a football match.’

Foderingham – characterised as ‘arrogant’ and ‘ignorant’ - was forced to apologise. He duly obliged.

Romelu Lukaku wasn't able to exert himself on the Chelsea first team during his spell at Stamford Bridge

Mourinho vs Lukaku - July/August 2014

Chelsea may have managed to scoop £28million from Romelu Lukaku this summer, but it appeared Jose Mourinho never had any intention of blooding the striker into his first team.

‘Romelu was always clear that in his mentality and his approach he was not highly motivated to come to a competitive situation at Chelsea,’ argued Mourinho.

Lukaku and blunt in his response: ‘I need to play at a high level and play in a good team. I'm not saying Chelsea are not a good team but I needed to be in a place where it felt right.’
