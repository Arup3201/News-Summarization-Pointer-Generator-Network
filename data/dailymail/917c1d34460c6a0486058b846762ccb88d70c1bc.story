If anybody was going to get away with mentioning that trip to Vegas, it would have been little Alex Logan.

The cheeky six-year-old, who was due to meet Prince Harry at an awards ceremony, vowed on ITV’s lunchtime news yesterday to bring up a certain set of naked photographs.

Alex, who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of three, promised his TV audience he would say: ‘I’m glad you’ve got your clothes on Prince Harry.’

Royal welcome:Prince Harry talks to Alex Logan, who was diagnosed with acute Leukaemia when he was just three years old. He wiped his favourite toy penguin, Hookie, all over the Prince's head

Cheeky: Ahead of the ceremony the youngster said he would say to the royal: 'I'm glad you've got your clothes on Prince Harry!' But Prince Harry wagged his finger and light-heartedly admonished the little boy last night

Knowing look:'You keep looking up at your Mum. It looks like you're dying to say something but you're worried she'll tell you off,' the Prince said, wagging his finger to admonish him

Vow: The cheeky youngster looking relaxed on ITV News yesterday

But unfortunately for Alex – and the rest of us – when the big moment came, Harry was one step ahead.

Before the youngster had time to follow his script, the prince wagged his finger and said with a grin:

‘You keep looking up at your mum. It 
looks like you’re dying to say something but you’re worried she’ll tell 
you off. I heard you were on ITV earlier and you said something cheeky –
 but let’s not talk about that here.’

Adoration: Prince Harry's face noticeably reddened when five-year-old Hope Hillis gave him two sloppy licks across his face

Friends: 'But we've only just met,' said Harry, laughing after the first lick. When Hope, who was born prematurely weighing just 1lb 9oz and has undergone more than 50 operations for a host of health problems including a bleed on the brain

Alex played ball and just tickled the prince with his toy penguin, Hookie, as his mother, Debbie watched proudly.

Yesterday’s event, the WellChild 
Awards in London, was the first time the prince had been seen in public 
since he returned from Las Vegas.

He has been patron of the charity, 
which supports critically ill children, since 2007.

Each year it 
presents awards to those it considers the bravest in Britain.

In his speech last night, the prince 
said: ‘All of you … are, quite frankly, too remarkable for me to 
adequately describe with mere words. But never one to be shy in coming 
forward, I’ll give it a go.’ 

Cue a knowing silence and then giggles from the audience – and from Harry too.

Sources said the prince was concerned
 about appearing in public after the media onslaught of the past few 
weeks but was more worried that the continuing rumpus over his ‘wild 
weekend’ in Sin City would overshadow such a worthy occasion.

'But we've only just met,' said Harry, laughing after the first lick.

When Hope, who was born prematurely weighing just 1lb 9oz and has 
undergone more than 50 operations for a host of health problems 
including a bleed on the brain, licked and hugged him a second time, the
 Prince giggled and exclaimed: 'Oh no.'

Hope's
 mother Sarah Hillis, 32, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: 'That's a
 great compliment from Hope. A lick on the side of the face - that's 
better than a kiss.'

She said Hope had planned to give the Prince what she called a cow lick.

Keeping up appearances: Dressed in rather more than we have seen of late, Prince Harry has made his first public appearance since the scandal over his naked Las Vegas antics broke

The 27-year-old royal, clad in a smart blue suit and pink spotted tie, arrived at the InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane in a chauffeur driven car with a small security detail

A source close to the prince 
told MailOnline: ‘Prince Harry is keen that what has happened does not 
overshadow what is going on today. He knows and understands there will 
be a lot of press interest because of recent events but just wants to 
focus on the children. That’s why he is there.’

The
 Royal Family was left reeling last month after photographs of the 
prince frolicking with an unnamed blonde in his Las Vegas hotel during a
 sordid game of 'strip billiards' were published on the Internet and in 
one British newspaper.

One
 photograph shows Harry holding his genitals as he cavorts with the girl
 while another shows the third in line to the throne's bare bottom.

Wild times: Harry's partying in Vegas got him into serious trouble, forcing him into hiding when he got back afterwards

Controversy: The Prince's antics attracted accusations he had brought the royal family into global disrepute - a source admitted to MailOnline he was nervous about venturing out to an official event today

St James's Palace have appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures, arguing that Harry has a reasonable expectation of privacy since he was on a private holiday.

Only The Sun chose to run them arguing that the photographs - which were taken by fellow revellers with the knowledge of his police protection officers and then sold to a US celebrity gossip website - were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest.

Their decision has prompted 3,600 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission but the palace has not made a decision over whether to take legal action yet.
