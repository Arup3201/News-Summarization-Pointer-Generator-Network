Dramatic pictures show the moment a huge alligator overpowers a smaller member of its own species.

Snapped by Lauren Hansen, 27, the pictures show the sheer force of the bigger alligator's jaws as it thrashes the smaller opponent around in an attempt to rip it apart.

Lauren, a dive operations specialist and keen wildlife photographer, took the pictures while walking through Brazos Bend State Park, Texas.

She said that she found the victorious gator with the smaller opponent in its mouth, splashing around in the water in an attempt break some meat from the smaller gator.

Lauren, from Bayou Vista in Texas, said: 'As I was walking on one of the trails at the state park, some movement in the water to my left caught my attention.

'At this moment the adult alligator seemed to be at rest, occasionally moving its head to situate the carcass in its jaws. I took a few pictures, and decided I would leave the alligator to its meal.

'As I started to walk away the alligator moved toward the bank, raised high on its front legs, and began thrashing the juvenile side to side.

'It was apparent that the alligator was trying to rip the juvenile into smaller pieces. I was amazed by the speed and power of the animal, so I pulled my camera back out and started taking photographs.

'I watched this happen over and over again for three hours. The large alligator would rest for fifteen minutes between each thrashing of the carcass. I couldn't take my eyes off of what was happening, and the alligator didn't seem to notice my presence.'

Lauren approached a park volunteer to ask them why the alligator had behaved like that.

'The volunteer said that when the water levels drop, the alligators become very territorial.' She added, 'They defend their territories to the death, and alligators are known to be cannibalistic.

'I was surprised by the pictures - I love how they show the incredible strength and speed that alligators possess. Everyone that has seen the pictures has been shocked. Mostly because they did not know that alligators behaved in this way. I love alligators, and I think that they are very important and impressive predators.'
