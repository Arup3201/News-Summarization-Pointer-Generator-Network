James Anderson will face a preliminary hearing next Tuesday on his Level 3 disciplinary charge, following the altercation between him and India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.

The International Cricket Council has announced the first stage in the procedure - involving Jadeja too, at Level 2 under the governing body's code of conduct - will be a tele-conference with appointed judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis.

The preliminary hearing is to take place, as stipulated in ICC protocol, as soon as practicably possible - on the day after the ongoing second Investec Test is scheduled to finish at Lord's.

On song: England's strike bowler seemed unfazed by the allegations as he took four wickets on Thursday

Appeal: If Anderson is found guilty he could be banned for up to four matches, before any appeal

The primary task for Lewis, Australia's representative on the ICC's code of conduct commission, will be to 'address preliminary issues' in the case before setting a date for a full hearing.

Anderson and Jadeja have been charged after their fracas in the stairwell of the Trent Bridge pavilion as they made their way off for lunch on day two of the drawn first Test.

It is highly unlikely that there will be any decisive outcome at the preliminary hearing - although an amendment to the level of charge is possible for either player.

For Anderson, for example, a reduction from Level 3 to 2 - for allegedly 'abusing and pushing' Jadeja - would drastically reduce the probability of any resulting suspension during the remainder of the five-match series against India.
