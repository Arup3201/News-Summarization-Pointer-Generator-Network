The Solicitor General who criticized Bill Clinton for having an affair with a consenting adult has written to a court in defense of a convicted child molester.

Ken Starr, who sparked the Monica Lewinsky scandal with his report on the President, is among a host of celebrities and politicians to come out in support of retired teacher and sex offender Christopher Kloman.

The man named as Time magazine's Person of the Year alongside Clinton in 1998 wrote to a Virginia judge, pleading to overturn the 43-year prison sentence handed down to his family friend in October.

It was one of dozens of letters of support for the former Potomac teacher, who admitted molesting several schoolgirls under the age of 14, according to Gakwer.

Alongside Starr, the judge received correspondence from former ABC news anchor Charlie Gibson, a former Laura Bush aide and a one-time GOP congressman.

Many of them had sent their children to the $34,000-a-year Virginia school Kloman taught at from 1965 to 1994.

When he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing several female students in the 1960s, he told the court: 'I violated their trust. I am embarrassed, horrified, and ashamed of my actions,' ABC 7 reported.

One of his victims came forward in 2011 after learning that her abuser was being used as a substitute teacher at her son's school.

Kloman was accused of molesting his victims, aged 12 to 14, after luring them to isolated locations under the guise of helping them with homework.

Sympathy: ABC anchor Gibson's letter says any punishment would be retributive rather than rehabilitative

Yet despite his victims' tearful testimony in court and Kloman's own admission of guilty, Starr and other supporters do not believe he should serve a prison sentence.

In the letter sent from Starr and his wife, the couple wrote that Kloman should be spared jail because 'he took the time to chat' with their daughter.

They added that he had 'made a concerted effort to correct his behavior of the past' and suggested a community sentence would be a more fitting punishment.

Their sentiments were echoed by ABC news anchor Charlie Gibson, who wrote: 'Any punishment for Chris now, however, strikes me as retributive not rehabilitative.'

Good behavior: Former congressman James K Coyne III highlighted Kloman's positive attributes

A letter from former GOP congressman, James K Coyne III stated that by avoiding jail Kloman could continue his good work in the community - a belief shared by Margaret Whitehead, former aide to Barbara Bush, who also believed that the child molester should be allowed to continue his 'community activism'.

Ms Whitehead added that while she was 'reluctant to psychoanalyze Chris ... he has seemed as someone who has already been to prison, felt deep remorse, and was atoning'.

Among Kloman's other supporters are former National Geographic editor Gilbert M Grosvenor; senior director of business affairs at Hard Rock International Rebecca L Roby; and William D Hager, a former assistant inspector general for investigations at NASA.
