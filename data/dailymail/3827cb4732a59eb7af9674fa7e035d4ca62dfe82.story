Richard Branson once said 'Business opportunities are like buses; there's always another one coming.' If that's the case, he must have a fleet of depots filled with double deckers.

One of his latest business ventures  to come under the spotlight is Kasbah Tamadot - the Virgin Atlantic boss's Moroccan holiday home which has just won ninth place in Conde Nast Traveller's best hotels in the world.

As well as making space for Branson twice a year, the renovated riad tucked 4,300 feet above sea level in the Atlas mountains has 27 rooms  which you can now book into from £345 a night (4,890 MAD)  through Better Late Luxury, a travel company who offer deals on luxurious holiday destinations.

Upgrade to the master suite in peak season and you’ll have to dig deep. It costs almost £1,800 (25,000 MAD) per person per night. For that, you get a private swimming pool, terrace and three bedrooms. 

Mick Jagger, Annie Lennox and Peter Gabriel have already been and when the man himself does he likes to sleep in Room 31 now named Tarrat, which is – aptly - the Berber word for Virgin.

The property has a infinity pool, sauna, multiple jacuzzis, a tennis court, ping pong table gym and outdoor cinema. Or you can go for a ride on one of Branson's four mules - Peppermint, Parmesean, Paprika and Peanut - who live in a menagerie with three donkeys and two camels.

The grounds are extensive, with courtyards and landscaped gardens. Every room is stuffed with antiques and you can book in to one of nine Berber tented suites from £609 (8,650 MAD). These are traditional style luxury tented rooms overlooking a valley below. Each has a king bed, terrace, view of Mount Toubkal, the Atlas' highest peak, and most come with a Jacuzzi.

Sir Richard purchased Tamadot in 1998 after his parents spotted it, fell in love with the place and insisted he buy it. He paid about $1.5 million for the tumbling riad, displacing an antique dealer who had been living there.

It's a one hour jeep ride from Marrakech (or a quarter of an hour by helicopter, though Branson apparently prefers to travel by car) and if you're lucky you might catch a sight of him - when he’s there he likes mingling with guests.

He told Forbes, 'I think life is all about meeting people. If you own a place like the Kasbah Tamadot, you know it's important to say hello to the guests, it's important that you shake hands, and it's important that you ask questions.'

The mogul, best known for founding Virgin Group with an estimated net worth of  US$4.6 billion, also has properties on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands and the Ulusaba Private Game Reserve in South Africa.
