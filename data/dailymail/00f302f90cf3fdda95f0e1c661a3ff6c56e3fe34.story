These staggering pictures of a beautiful rare white deer might seem like something straight out of a CS Lewis adventure.

But they were in fact taken by a Scottish family in Taynuilt, Argyll as they literally came face to face with the stuff of legends.

The shots of the white stag were captured by Michelle and Anthony Veitch who were stunned to come across the mythical creature - said by many to be a lucky charm - as they 
took their four-year-old daughter Olivia to her dance school.

Beautiful: Michelle Veitch and her family spotted this rare white deer near Taynuilt, Argyll and Bute

Rare: Far from being afraid of the Veitch fmily, the white stag led them long the pathway towards four-year-old Olivia's dance school

The family were driving through the Highland forest when they spotted the unusual stag and slammed on the brakes.

But the ghost-like deer was not fussed with the stunned family and stared them down before running off back into the forest.

Michelle, 30, said she had never seen or heard about white deer before and took a snap of the animal.

The family now hope that spotting the creature will bring them a slice of luck before Christmas.

She said: 'Usually deer disappear into the trees, but this one didn’t, and just kept walking up the road in front of us.

'It led us a considerable distance right up the road until we got to a cattle grid then it jumped into the woods.

'We went over the grid and parked in the Ballet West car park and there it was again right in front of us, staring straight at us.

Graceful: The beautiful creature eventually disappeared silently into the bushes

'I took its picture then it just silently disappeared into the woods again.'

After the discovery on Saturday, Michelle went home, ironically to Stag Park in Lochgilphead, and looked up white deer on the internet.

Michelle found that many people believe a white stag is a lucky omen and they also hold a place in the mythology of many cultures.

Legend has it on the island of Arran that if a white stag in seen then a member of the ruling family, the Hamilton Clan, has died.

Michelle added: 'It’s a bit weird when you think about it, us in Stag Park, then this unusual stag.

'The whole thing sounds like a good omen to me. I hope so. Christmas is coming up, and a lottery win would be nice.'

Olivia who was being taken to her class couldn’t believe her eyes and ran to her shocked teacher claiming: 'A white deer led us up the road.'

A spokeswoman for Scottish Natural Heritage said it was unlikely the deer was an albino and was more likely to have a rare condition called leucism.

She said: 'White deer are rare. They can either be albinos or they can have a rare genetic pattern called leucism which causes a reduction in the pigment of their hair and skin.'

White deer are often confused with albino deer but the albino is distinctive because of its characteristic red eyes. Unlike an albino, leucism causes a reduction in pigmentation and not just melanin.

There are several well known references to the white deer in mythology, legend and literature:

According to the Scots legend, in 1128, David I, King of Scotland decided to go hunting on the Feast Day of the Holy Rood, against the wishes of his priest. While hunting he saw a huge white stag, or "hart", and while giving chase he was thrown from his horse.

The white hart charged forward to kill him, so David - son of Malcolm Canmore and St Margaret - called on God to save him.

As the king grasped the hart's antlers, they miraculously turned in to a large cross, and the beast raised its head and vanished.

Inspired by his vision, King David built a shrine to the Holy Rood - meaning Holy Cross - on the spot where the miracle occurred.

The ruin of Holyrood Abbey can still be seen today, at the foot of the Royal Mile next to Holyrood Palace.

The White Hart Inn in Edinburgh's grassmarket, reputedly the oldest pub in the capital, took its name from the legend.

The Celts considered white stags to be messengers from the "other world" and their appearance was said to herald some profound change in the lives of those who encountered them.

In the Chronicles of Narnia, the White Stag is fabled to grant wishes to whoever catches him.

And in the Arthurian legend, the white stag is the creature that can never be caught.

King Arthur's repeatedly unsuccessful pursuit of the white stag represents mankind's quest for spiritual knowledge.

In Christianity a white stag was said to be instrumental in the conversion of the martyr Saint Eustace after he saw a vision of the animal that told him he would suffer for Christ.
