With nine in every 10 cosmetic operations now involving either fillers or Botox, jabs are fast becoming a routine part of the average beauty regime.

But there's a snag: unlike surgery, cosmetic fillers remain unregulated and as a result, horror stories about bungled procedures that leave people disfigured and traumatised are increasing.

One woman who knows the risks of cosmetic filler all too well is Stacey Hohn, a 41-year-old mother-of-four from London who was left with infected lumps all over her face after being injected with permanent filler.

Shocking: Stacey Hohn, 41, was left with lumps all over her face after cosmetic filler became infected

Although initial injections using non-permanent lip plumpers had worked well, Ms Hohn wanted a procedure that lasted and when she was offered the chance to have an irreversible injection for £700, she jumped at the chance.

'They [the surgeon] said "if you have this done, you don't have 
to worry about coming back and having needles",' she remembers.'I 
didn't think anything would go wrong.

'Because it was so expensive, I didn't expect them to inject anything bad into my face.'

At first she was pleased with the results but seven years after having the treatment, her lips broke out in lumpy sores that oozed pus.

Worse, lumps began appearing all over her face as the filler migrated through fatty tissue, leaving her distraught and too embarrassed to leave the house.

Painful: Her lips were covered in pus-filled sores while lumps of filler migrated to other parts of her face

Painful: Ms Hohn had to undergo a two hour operation to remove the lumps of plastic 

In a bid to repair the damage, she went to see the surgeon who had performed the original procedure and asked him to help.

His solution? Injecting the lumps with an anti-inflammatory - a process that Ms Hohn describes as 'extremely painful'.

'They were as hard 
as rocks and I think that angered me more,' she adds. 'He's never apologised - he 
never said sorry.

'What's left in my face is hard plastic and hence my 
body is rejecting it and pushing it out.'

And she's not the only person to have suffered the ill-effects of permanent fillers. Of those who have them, 49 per cent experience problems and of those, 89 per cent need to have surgery to resolve them.

The issues created by permanent fillers have not gone unnoticed. Speaking to the Independent newspaper, leading French surgeon, Dr Daniel Marchac said:

'All of the permanent fillers are creating, from time to time, serious problems with bumps and deformities, and sometimes you have to operate.

Dangerous: Leading surgeons recommend avoiding permanent filler because of the risk of problems

Improvement: Although Ms Hohn has been left with faint scars following surgery, the lumps are finally gone

Difference: Ms Hohn says since surgery, she's no longer afraid to smile and leave the house

'All serious plastic surgeons agree one should avoid permanent fillers. We will see in the future patients of 50 who have had 15 years of fillers with fibrous, tough tissue we wouldn't be able to do anything with.'

Another leading cosmetic surgeon, Los Angeles based Dr Francis Palmer, added: 'The issues with permanent fillers 
are all the same in my opinion.

'The filler needs to be injected into the
 fatty tissues of the face but fatty layers of the face don't stay put. If 
they did, we would literally be out of business.'

For Ms Hohn, and others like her, the only solution is more surgery to remove the hard lumps of plastic dotted around the face.

Cranio-facial specialist, Dr Niall Kirkpatrick, who appears, along with Ms Hohn, in tonight's episode of Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, adds: 'You can easily end up with a permanent 
problem, which with something that was meant to treat something that was
 a small problem in the first place, is a real shame.' 

After years of suffering thanks to her disfigured face, Ms Hohn, at least, has had the happy ending she hoped for.

Five weeks after surgery to remove the plastic-filled lumps, her complexion is visibly smoother and the weeping sores are gone.

'It's made a huge difference,' she says excitedly. 'I keep being told I have a really nice smile, which is great!

'I can finally look people in 
the eye and talk to them. I'm no longer hanging my head in shame and 
hiding away.'
