Detroit police said graffiti of an angel pointing a gun at a police officer has left them 'hurt and dismayed' following a wave of violence directed at cops.

The image was spray-painted on to the wall of a youth center in Detroit, Michigan, close to the police department's third precinct late last month, authorities said on Tuesday.

It depicts a small figure with wings and a halo pointing a gun at a police officer with his hands raised in the air. The number 247 is sprayed next to the graffiti.

A small figure with wings and a halo pointing a gun at a police officer with his hands raised was sprayed on the wall of a youth center in Detroit, Michigan

The director of the youth center where the graffiti was sprayed said that he found the image 'hurtful'

Steve Dolunt, assistant Detroit police chief, told Fox: 'I don't believe looking at the painting that God would give an angel a gun to shoot a police officer. 

'I think God gives angels to police officers to try to protect them.'

The director of the youth center, Roger Simmons, said he was 'horrified' by the graffiti but that the perpetrator was likely caught on surveillance cameras.

It has since been painted over.  

It is not clear when the image appeared on the wall but authorities believe that it was sprayed some time after the shooting deaths of two NYPD officers on December 20.

Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley who then committed suicide. 

According to threats that Brinsley posted on social media prior to the shootings, he was seeking revenge for the cop killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Among the deranged messages was a vow to 'put wings on pigs'.

Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August. 

Several weeks earlier, Eric Garner, a father-of-six, died after being placed in a chokehold by an NYPD officer on Staten Island

The graffiti was later painted over by authorities after it was sprayed late last month in Detroit, Michigan
