North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has been photographed visiting yet another orphanage - just days after reports he executed six more high-ranking government officials.

The enigmatic leader was pictured looking jubilant as he toured the newly-completed Pyongyang Baby Home and Orphanage in the country's capital city today.

Kim walked around the vibrantly-coloured building inspecting pink bunk beds and children's playrooms while his entourage of uniform-clad note-takers smiled approvingly.

At one point during the tour Kim, who now uses a cane to help him walk, appeared to stop for a rest - perching on the edge of a ball pit in an indoor playground filled with trampolines. 

It is not the first time the dictator has displayed his softer side through state media.

In June, he was pictured kneeling down to play with a classroom full of youngsters and in February he was seen holding a crying toddler in his arms - both during trips to orphanages in the capital.

The leader’s health and grip on the nation was recently questioned after he disappeared from local media reports for more than 40 days.

However, Kim has quelled the rumours of ill-health and unrest by being shown on state media visiting military facilities and construction sites.

Now speculation is now growing that the leader may have actually used his time away to oversee another government purge, after executing his uncle and other officials last year.

South Korean media reported that six officials - including the the minister of posts and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months.

An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'. 

If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011.

Yesterday, South Korean activists, led by North Korean defectors, launched balloons to send 20,000 leaflets to North Korea with messages critical of its leader.

The group had been warned against the action by South Korean officials after Pyongyang threatened unspecified 'military action' if the launch were to be allowed.

On Saturday, the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper repeated a warning that inter-Korea ties will forever collapse if the South Korean government continued to allow the leaflet campaign, which it called 'an act of war'.

The propaganda printed on the leaflets infuriates Pyongyang and has threatened to derail talks agreed between the two Koreas after the North sent a high-level delegation earlier this month, which was seen as its biggest peace overture in years.
