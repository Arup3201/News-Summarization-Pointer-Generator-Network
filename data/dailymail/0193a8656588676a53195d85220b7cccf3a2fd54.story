Frank Lampard will be given every chance to extend his England career by New York City after moving to America’s Major League Soccer.

The 36-year-old former Chelsea midfielder has won 103 caps for his country and has yet to decide whether to follow Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole into international retirement.

But New York’s director of football Claudio Reyna insists that the Manchester City owned club will support Lampard if he wants to make himself available for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

‘We would support any player,’ said Reyna. ‘It would be great for him and great for us as well. We signed David Villa and he was representing us at a World Cup, so we would never ever tell a player not to play for their national team.’

With New York’s players not reporting for pre-season until January and Lampard reluctant to follow Villa to Australia to keep fit with City’s other sister team Melbourne, it would be difficult for England boss Roy Hodgson to select the veteran midfielder if he is effectively without a club for six months.

However, Reyna has not ruled out the possibility of Lampard training with the Premier League champions in the meantime. He added: ‘It’s something we’ll sit down face to face and speak to people – the Manchester City team, the manager, and have those conversations.

‘Nothing’s decided yet. We need to keep Frank sharp and fit, and that’s what he wants. The most important thing for us is that he’s ready to go in January.’

Reyna also revealed that marquee players like Lampard and Villa have been told not to view MLS as a way of making some easy money at the end of their careers.

‘It’s a discussion we have with any player who is coming to MLS for the first time,’ he said. ‘All the players are well aware that this isn’t a retirement league. We spoke to them and said they have to show up, train, and really carry on being what they’ve been – model professionals and great players.

‘It’s a very competitive league. There are a lot of challenges – weather, travel, the level of the games. There are going to be many players and teams motivated to play us because of the players we have.

‘Certainly in our city, we need big names, star players. The fans here identify with it in all sports. David and Frank tick all the boxes and hopefully our third designated player will be in the same category.

‘MLS has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace. We need to continue to be mindful of our growth but it is a moment where we’re ready to take the next step. We hope that with some of the other newer franchises, like David Beckham in Miami, that we continue with this development.

‘The league has signed Kaka, we have Robbie Keane and other big-name players so it’s important. We’d like to get players a little bit earlier but at the same time we’re competing with Europe where they are still paid well and playing at the highest level.’

Reyna is delighted that Lampard decided to move to New York after his 13-year stay at Chelsea came to an end.

‘Having spoken to him and his excitement for this new challenge it was really a no-brainer to make him a New York City FC player,’ said Reyna.

‘There are many out there who were interested to come but it was really important that we got the right one.

‘Just seeing that he’s still where he’s at and takes care of himself, it makes sense to have someone like him on the field.

‘Everyone knows what he does – he scores goals, he sets up goals, that’s the type of player he’s always been and we intend to use him in the same way.

‘We’re not asking him to do anything different, but for our club it’s a tremendous boost and the next chapter in our short history.’
