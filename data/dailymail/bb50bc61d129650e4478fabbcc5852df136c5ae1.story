Cristiano Ronaldo has won the UEFA's Best Player in Europe Award ahead of Manuel Neuer and Arjen Robben.

The accolade for Europe's top player in the 2013-14 season was handed out during the draw for the Champions League group stage.

Ronaldo had a stellar season at Real Madrid last season - proving the catalyst as the club won a record 10th European Cup.
