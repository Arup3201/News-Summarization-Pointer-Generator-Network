From striking the right balance between being informative and smug, to tracking down stamps and locating a postbox, sending a postcard can seem like a chore to holiday makers wanting to get away from it all.

But a new smartphone app claims to enable lazy sun worshipers to send postcards to their friends and family without having to leave their sun loungers.

The app allows a user to upload their own scenic photo for the front of the card and type a message that will be printed onto the back.

Wish you were here: A new app called Ps Postcards has been invented that will send postcards for lazy holidaymakers who struggle to find the time themselves

Once completed, the virtual postcard is sent to a 'mailroom' of the company, which is based in Britain, where a real paper version is created and posted to the desired recipient.

The app, called Ps Postcards, could halt the demise in the trend of people sending postcards while on holiday as research has shown that just 16 per cent of the population now send postcards regularly while holidaying.

The app is the brainchild of Fionn Concannon, 33, from Queen's Park, north west London, who says he aptly came up with the idea when he came back from a holiday.

The app allows a user to upload their own photo (pictured left) or choose from a range of per-loaded pictures for the front of the card and write a message (pictured right) that will be printed onto the back of the postcard

'I really like people sending me postcards but when I try to write them for other people I always end up coming back with them in my bag because I hadn't been bothered to write and send them,' he said.

'I heard of people who normally don't manage to find a stamp or can't find a postbox and eventually end up just giving them to their family and friends when they arrive home.

Mr Concannon set out to find an easier way to send the cards and came up with his iPhone app, which allows people to create and send a postcard from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

Once the picture has been chosen and the message written, the virtual postcard (pictured) is sent to a 'mailroom' of the company, which is based in Britain, where a real paper version is created and posted to the desired recipient

'All they have to do is upload a picture, enter their text and send it off, and we will print it out in the UK and post it to wherever they want it to go,' he said.

'It's perfect for people who are travelling around, to show grandparents photographs, and for those who prefer something physical instead of an email.'

The postcards can be generated from a mobile phone on a wireless or 3G network.

Users of the app can choose from a gallery of pre-loaded pictures of popular holiday destinations (pictured left) A screen (pictured right) shows a list of postcards written for people - allowing particularly lazy holiday goers to copy and paste messages!

As well as uploading personal photos, and there is also a gallery of scenic snaps of popular holiday destinations for the users to chose from.

Each postcard costs Â£1.49 which includes the postage and can be purchased while logged onto the app.
