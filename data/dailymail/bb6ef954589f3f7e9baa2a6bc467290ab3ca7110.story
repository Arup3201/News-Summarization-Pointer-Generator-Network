Less than sixty years after a young black woman was arrested for not giving up her bus seat for a white passenger, America's first black President sat in the very same spot to consider how far the U.S. has come on its civil rights journey.

President Barack Obama took time out of a campaign trip to visit the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan to step on board the GM vehicle that Rosa Parks made famous when she refused to vacate her seat for a white passenger one evening in December 1955.

A moment of contemplation: President Barack Obama sits on the bus made famous by Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat for a white passenger in 1955

At a fundraiser at the museum that 
night, Obama described: ‘I just sat there for a moment and pondered the 
courage and tenacity that is part of our very recent history, but is 
also a part of that long line of folks -- sometimes nameless, oftentimes
didn't make the history books - but who constantly insisted on their 
dignity, their stake in the American Dream.'

 

Turning point: Rosa Parks riding on the Montgomery Area Transit System bus, where she refused to give up her seat, sparking the modern civil rights movement

In December 1955, seamstress Rosa Parks, 42, was told by a Montgomery bus driver to give up her seat for a white man to sit, as the rules required.

But Parks said: ‘No. I’m tired of being treated like a second-class citizen.’ The driver called the police who arrested her.

The same day, black residents began a boycott of the bus system, which lasted 381 days. The legal challenges led to a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision that forced Montgomery to desegregate its bus system and ended ‘Jim Crow’ laws separating blacks and whites at public 
facilities in the South.

Rosa Park’s prosecution led to widespread protest and a successful boycott of the segregated bus system.

It
prompted the creation of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which 
led to the elevation of a young minister named Martin Luther King.

At a later campaign stop, the President reflected further: 'It takes ordinary citizens to bring about change, who are committed to keep fighting and keep pushing, and keep inching this country closer to our highest ideals.'

The photograph of the President was taken by White House photographer Pete Souza, who posted the image on Twitter yesterday. 

President Obama spoke to 600 guests at the Henry Ford Museum, some of whom had paid $250 to attend, others $1,000 to shake his hand.

Rosa Parks received the highest US civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1996 and Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1999.

She died at the age of 92 in 2005 at her home overlooking the Detroit River and the border with Ontario, Canada.
