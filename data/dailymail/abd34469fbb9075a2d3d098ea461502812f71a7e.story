The Obama administration should ban all air travel to the United States from the three African countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, say at least 41 members of Congress including three Democratic House members.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz, whose home state is ground zero for Ebola in North America, wrote Wednesday in a Texas Tribune op-ed that 'we all very much hope the virus will not spread any further in Texas. But hope is not a strategy.'

'Given the gravity of the threat, common sense dictates that it’s time to ban flights from the countries afflicted by Ebola.' 

'There's no reason to allow ongoing commercial air traffic out of those countries,' he told the Dallas Morning News.

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at an Oct. 9 political rally for Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts. Both men have called for a commercial air traffic ban between the U.S. and the three African nations where Ebola rages out of control. 'I have no confidence in how the Obama Administration is managing the Ebola crisis, and neither do the people of Kansas,' Roberts said Oct. 14

Only a drill: Hazmat suits like these could become commonplace at US airports if Ebola spreads without end

Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in a statement that the U.S. is 'faced with the growing threat of a disease for which there is no known reliable cure, and we know where it’s coming from. Why would we not act in every way possible to stop it from reaching us?'

That sentiment is 180 degrees opposition from the White House's point of view, producing a clash that has D.C.beltway insiders scratching their heads.

A group of 26 House members, including Democrats Alan Grayson, Dave Loebsack and Kyrsten Sinema, wrote to Obama on Oct. 8 that 'the United States needs to institute travel restrictions, enhanced airport screening and possible quarantine of individuals who have traveled to, or from' Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. 

House Speaker John Boehner joined that group on Wednesday after the chief White House spokesman said a travel ban is not under consideration.

'A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider,' he said, 'along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow.'

The White House is nowhere near considering restrictions on commercial airline flights from the Ebola hot zone to major American airports.

Instead, it has ramped up disease surveillance at the five airports that handle about 94 per cent of the passenger load from the hardest hit African nations. 

The extra screening – carried out by Customs and Border Control officers, not health care professionals – have begun at New York's John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty,Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airports. 

Obama did not address the possibility of a travel ban during his remarks after a two-hour emergency cabinet meeting Wednesday afternoon.  

Not going to happen: White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest

Urgency: Obama skipped his planned political fundraising in order to chair a cabinet meeting about his administration's Ebola response

The president canceled planned political campaign appearances in New Jersey and Connecticut to call the meeting.

The White House said late Wednesday that presidential campaign trips to New York and Rhode Island had been called off for Thursday as well.

But hours before the president spoke, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated that banning America-bound flights from Ebola-ravaged countries 'is not on the table.'

'It's important for people to understand exactly why that's the case,' Earnest said.

'Shutting down travel to that area of the world would prevent the expeditious flow of personnel and equipment into the region.'

'And the only way for us to stop this outbreak, and to eliminate any risk from Ebola to the American public, is to stop this outbreak at the source.' 

Earnest and Centers for Disease Control chief Thomas Frieden have emphasized that isolating entire countries would make it harder, not easier, to contain the spread of Ebola. 

At the same time, the CDC has tried to isolate individual Americans who have come into contact with Ebola-infected people. 

Earnest added that the administration is already 'mobilizing significant resources to make sure that supplies and personnel can get to the affected region.'

MailOnline asked the White House why military aircraft couldn't be used for the same purpose without putting civilians' health at risk, but no response has come.

A survey of online airfare booking websites including Kayak and Expedia found that domestic U.S. airlines are no longer flying between U.S. airports and the Liberian capital of Monrovia – the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.

But several foreign-owned airlines fly those routes every day, including Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Moroccan carrier Royal Air Maroc.

That, says Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, should stop. 

'Allowing people to come from outbreak areas into the United States threatens the lives and health of American citizens,' he told the News Courier in Athens, Alabama, on Oct. 12. 

'It’s crazy and irresponsible.' 

Two-thirds of Americans agree, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday.

Fully 67 per cent told pollsters they would agree with 'restricting entry to the United States by people who've been in affected countries.'

Just 29 percent lined up against the idea.

Texas Rep. Joe Barta said last week during a congressional field hearing in Dallas that the Obama administration is 'almost guaranteeing mathematically we're going to miss some people' with airport screening alone.

'If we were really treating this as a public health issue why would we not immediately stop these flights?' he asked.

Others in Congress are asking the State Department to suspend  the 13,000 travel visas issued to foreign nationals from the three countries that have been hardest hit.

That's a position shared by House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce, Homeland Security chairman Michael McCaul and at least five other House members.

Most Democrats in Congress share the White House's view, however, including Wisconsin Rep Gwen Moore.

She downplayed the health risks from Ebola in the United States, complaining in a statement Wednesday that 'many of my congressional colleagues have let their anxiety about this crisis dictate a panicked and perilous tone during a time when we need a cautious yet vigilant discussion.'
