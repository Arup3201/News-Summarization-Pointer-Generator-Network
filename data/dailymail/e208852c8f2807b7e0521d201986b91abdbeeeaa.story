Inspired by injured player Kevin Ware, the Louisville Cardinals turned early adversity into triumph, capturing the NCAA crown over the Michigan Wolverines.

Accompanying his team to the final games in Atlanta, Ware was a major presence for his team, motivating them since his gruesome injury on March 31.

Luke Hancock made all five of his 3-pointers and led Louisville to its first NCAA men's basketball championship since 1986 with a 82-76 victory over Michigan on Monday night.

Jubilation: Confetti rained on the Louisville squad as the clock ran out

Coach Rick Pitino added this title to 
the one he won at Kentucky in 1996 and is the first coach to win a 
championship at two schools.

Earlier in the day, Pitino was elected 
to the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame. After the game, Pitino called his
squad 'the toughest group of guys I have ever coached.'

Pitino added that he would now get a tattoo, a promise he had made to his players if they went on to win the tournament.

While much fanfare surrounded Pitino, there was no doubt the Cardinals wanted to win a national title for someone else - Ware.

Watching again from his seat at the end of the Louisville bench, his right leg propped up on a chair, Ware smiled and high-fived his teammates as they celebrated in the closing seconds, the victory coming just 30 miles from where he played his high school ball.

It was a complete turnaround from a week ago, when Ware was writhing on the court in agony as six inches of his leg bone was fully exposed after the gruesome injury.Â

Champs: The team is covered in confetti as they embrace on the court

The arena's crowd gave Ware a standing 
ovation as he hobbled onto the court in a sea of confetti.

One of the arena's backboards was then lowered for him so that he could partake in the ceremonial cutting of the net.

Ware said: 'These are my brothers. They got the job done. I'm so proud of them, so proud of them.'

Hancock scored 22 points and Peyton Siva had 18 for the Cardinals (35-5), who trailed by 12 late in the first half.

He was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, the first reserve player to take that award, according to the NCAA.

'We needed a rally and we've been doing it for a couple of games straight, being down,' Hancock said. 'We just had to wait and make our run.'

Trey Burke had 24 points for Michigan (31-8), which was in the final for the first time since the Fab Five led the Wolverines there in 1993.

Little-used freshman Spike Albrecht added 17 points.

After trailing by as many as 12 points in the first half, Louisville stormed back. Hancock began the charge with 16 points in the first half.

All eyes have been on Louisville since the devastating injury to Ware, who landed awkwardly while trying to block a shot during last Sunday's game against Duke.

Ware captured the hearts and emotions of America that night as he told teammates to 'go out and win this thing.'

The team made good on Ware's demand, winning that game and their next two to win him a championship trophy.

In several TV interviews and a press conference following his release from the hospital, Ware vowed to return next year.
