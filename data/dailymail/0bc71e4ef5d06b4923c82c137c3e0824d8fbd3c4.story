A lawyer is being investigated by police for allegedly charging clients £25,000 for court appearances that never happened. 

Andrew Benson, who worked for London law firm Byrne & Partners, practised 'breathtaking deception' over three years while acting on behalf of a diamond dealer, a court has heard. 

His alleged dishonesty was highlighted by the former client who is fighting a High Court order to pay an Islamic investment company millions of pounds. 

A lawyer acted dishonestly over three years, charging his client £25,000 for court appearances and litigation with opposing solicitors in an ongoing civil claim which never happened, the Court of Appeal heard 

Mr Benson, who has been dismissed from his former law practice, produced 'fictitious litigation' over three years while billing diamond dealer Rajesh Mehta. 

During this time he claimed to appear at court hearings and have extensive contact with solicitors acting on behalf of the investment company to which Mr Mehta was ordered to pay money. 

A High Court Justice has ruled however that no such appearances took place, and could find no correspondence between Mr Benson and opposing solicitors Norton Rose. 

The court heard how Mr Mehta paid £25,000 to the lawyer, under the impression he had been acting on his behalf in an ongoing civil court claim. 

'The deception practised by Mr Benson... is rightly described as breathtaking,' said Mr Justice Hamblen. 

'The motives for Mr Benson's actions are presently unclear.' 

Mr Justice Hamblen likened the lawyer's behaviour to A.P. Herbert's Uncommon Law, a satirical book poking fun at the British legal system through a series of made-up legal complaints.  

The lawyer is now being investigated by Metropolitan Police and the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

As a result of his alleged deception, all adverse orders made against Mr Mehta in the period while he was being represented by Mr Benson have been set aside. 

This amounts to one order, made in 2010, being discarded by the court. 

Mr Justice Hamblen added: 'There is good reason to believe that [Mehta’s] own solicitor, a man who has been shown to be dishonest, was acting against his interests,’ the Law Gazette reports. 

‘It is axiomatic that justice must be both done and seen to be done. 

'In the circumstances of the present case in my judgment that requires the setting aside of the [order] unconditionally.'

A spokesman for Byrne & Partners told the newspaper they had cooperated fully with police investigations into the man.
