Self-styled peer Hugh Rodley was accused of targeting 600 pensioners in a £6million investment scam

A self-styled Lord and four other fraudsters targeted 600 pensioners from a series of 'sucker lists' in a £6million investment scam, a court heard.

Bowler hat-wearing Hugh Rodley, 64, who bought his title and is not a real peer of the realm, tricked elderly people into backing various companies with the promise of 'rich rewards', a jury was told.

He was joined in the scam by Julian Silver, 43, Phillip Dennett, 41, Adam Corbett, 31, and Sonny Willis, 28, prosecutors said.

They allegedly spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle including a fleet of luxury cars, such as an Aston Martin, Range Rover S3 and a Lotus Elise.

The men used high-pressure sales techniques to convince members of the public to invest in firms, claiming they would soon be floated on the stock market, Southwark Crown Court heard.

They claimed the cash would be invested in 'exotic' and 'fail-safe' projects such as land development Europe and Asia and water projects, including one for 'desalination by reverse osmosis', it was said.

One 87-year-old man was said to been persuaded to invest more than £800,000.

But the firms were not floated and investors did not receive any returns, it is alleged.

The defendants cherry-picked their targets using so-called 'sucker lists', detailing people who had already invested in some shares.

Prosecutor Simon Farrell explained that one of the men in the dock, Lord Rodley bought his title and was 'not a peer of the realm'.

He told the jury: 'This case concerns the dishonest extraction of several million pounds from payments of investors who were all promised rich rewards for their investments.

'The proceeds were laundered, converted and transferred to cash between 2004 and 2007.

'Individual members of the public began to receive unsolicited telephone calls from people purporting to be brokers and were convinced to invest substantial amounts of money, often through a hard sell, into various companies.

'They were all told they would quickly make handsome profits as their companies were due to be floated on the AIM - Alternative Investment Market.'

It is alleged the gang spent the money on luxury cars including a Lotus Elise, like the one pictured

But none of the companies were in fact floated and none the investors received any profit - they simply lost their money, the court heard.

'This type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud,' Mr Farrell said.

'There term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims.

'A large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest.

'One 87-year-old gentleman, Mr Birch, unfortunately parted with £828,000 investing in most of the companies.

'Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.'

The first person who tried to target Mr Birch gave up and passed it on to someone else, who later secured the deal, said Mr Farrell.

Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment.

But most people gained little or no contact afterwards, the court heard.

Most people who complained received littly by way of response and those that did were 'fobbed off', said Mr Farrell.

'The companies appear to have done little if any real trading and none of the investors received any return at all.

'Substantial amounts of money from victims were passed through bank accounts either controlled by or for the benefit of the defendants.

'All of the defendants face charges of defrauding the victims out of their money. Other charges represent money laundering.'

Mr Farell said at the heart of the scam was a 'floor book' - a list of hundreds of investors.

The document was seized after being discovered on Rodley's computer when his property was searched following his arrest

'Many of the victims are not rich, they just have some savings,' Mr Farrell said. 'The floor book gives us a very interesting picture into how many victims we are talking about.

'But we have to approach it with some caution because the fraud was going on before the start date and after the end date, in fact to early 2007.

'Some people on here were tricked again to con more money out of them. There are also very many victims who are not on this book at all.

'The book has in excess of 1000 names, 600 of which handed over money for investment. They didn't all hand over money, but hundreds did.

'The floor book records around £6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £3million.

'But what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £2.7million.

'The defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects.

'One project was desalination by reverse osmosis.'

Mr Farrell described the schemes as 'push button investments', adding: 'Not only was this a wonderful investment, but it's a really good idea and it's going to save the planet.

'People were told it was impossible for it to fail.'

Rodley, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Dennett, of Warrington, Cheshire, Willis, of Billericay, Essex, Silver, of Ashford, Kent, and Corbett, of Camberley, Surrey, all deny conspiracy to defraud.

They are alleged to have committed the offence with Bernard Davies, who died having committed suicide in 2009.

They are accused of defrauding customers through companies including World Aqua Tech PLC, ART IT PLC, Mediatel PLC, BMHC PLC, European Land Development Agency PLC, and Eurowaste Recycling PLC, between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007.

Rodley, Willis and Corbett also deny defrauding customers through Northface Trading Ltd, Datawave Systems Inc and Novopal Limited from January 1, 2005 to December 3, 2005.

Rodley, Dennett and Silver deny fraudulent trading in relation to World Aqua Tech Limited between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006.

Silver and Dennett deny fraudulent trading in relation to ART IT Limited between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007.

All five defendants deny converting and transferring the proceeds of the fraud between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006.

They each separately face a single charge of converting and transferring criminal property on the same dates.

The trial, which is expected to last nine weeks, continues.
