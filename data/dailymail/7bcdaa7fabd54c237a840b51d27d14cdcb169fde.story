Chris Froome took the brave step of starting a Twitter Q&A as he let his followers divulge into his life and find out more about the cycling star.

The Kenyan-British born rider has recently started stepping up his training as he recovers from illness which kept him out of the Tirreno Adriatico. 

The  Sky Team member revealed that his favourite pizza was a ham and mushroom calzone, and doesn't mind a glass of Baileys when he's not in training.

And the creator of his nickname 'Froomedog' was also revealed as fellow rider Russ Downing - a label which has stuck with him during his recent success.

Froome also didn't hold back when a follower asked him about the Lloyd Mondory - labeling the Frenchman an 'idiot' - after he failed a recent drug test for EPO. 

With Rio 2016 just over a year away, the Great British rider says he's looking to attempt the time trials at the Olympic games after being asked what event he fancied.

The questions weren't all serious with the cyclist revealing he loves a bit of tomato ketchup on a bacon sandwich and misses white chocolate when in season.

'Froomedog' admitted he's a fan of DJ Tiesto's music and that if he could do any other sport then he'd want to follow in Lewis Hamilton's footsteps and be a Formula One driver.
