Labour officials are considering making a commitment to cut the voting age from 18 to 16 in their election manifesto, it was revealed today.

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the change should be combined with improved citizenship education in schools to teach 16-year-olds about the democratic system.

MPs believe the pledge by Labour would increase the likelihood of a coalition at the next election between them and the Liberal Democrats - who have long supported the lowering of the voting age.

Mr Khan, who is also MP for Tooting in south London, told The Sunday Times: ‘The evidence we have is that if you vote the first time you are entitled to, you will carry on doing so through your life.

‘There are more and more things that 16 and 17-year-olds can do - work, pay national insurance and tax, have sexual relationships, get married and enter civil partnerships and join the armed forces.’

The reform would be introduced in time for the election in 2020 if Labour return to power in 2015. One of the major reasons behind it is that the party wants to capture the vote of young people.

Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams fronted a successful backbench motion for the lowering of the voting age - and said Labour’s support could help the party decide who to support in a hung Parliament.

He told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘If we can bank that as an agreement then if the next Parliament does result in an inconclusive election, which I think is quite likely, the more issues that we know in advance that we're likely to agree on will make the negotiations swifter.’

Mr Williams added: ‘I have never been in favour of compulsory voting. I think voting should be attractive to people but it's up to politicians to give people good reasons why they should turn out to vote.’

The MP’s motion earlier this year was passed by 119 votes to 46 - but this was not binding, and Prime Minister David Cameron insisted he would not be supporting a change in the voting age.

You are only able to vote aged 16 in a select few countries in the world. Those aged 16 have been able to vote for two decades in Brazil, while Argentina lowered the age of voting to 16 last year.
