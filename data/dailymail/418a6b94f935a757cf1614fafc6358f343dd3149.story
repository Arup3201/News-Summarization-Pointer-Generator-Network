England's talisman batsman Kevin Pietersen, who has described team spirit on this desperate Ashes tour as ‘not that bad’, was nevertheless one of the squad who chose to miss the players’ Christmas lunch yesterday.

It was the third time in a row on Ashes trips that Pietersen has opted to have his festive meal away from the England team environment, spending it instead with more than 10 family members in Melbourne.

The players were under no three-line whip to attend and some, including Steve Finn, preferred to go to the beach, while Jonny Bairstow also opted out to spend time with his family.

Keeping his ear to the ground: Kevin Pietersen has a word with the groundsmen at the MCG ahead of the fourth Test

The England function took place on the top floor of Melbourne’s swish Langham Hotel with Graeme Swann and family among the 100-strong turn-out despite the spin bowler’s retirement from all cricket last Sunday.

Pietersen swerving the party comes after continued speculation that Swann — despite the subsequent denials — was aiming his ‘up their own backsides’ barbs at Pietersen in particular. And KP said himself this week about how difficult it is building a team’s unity when they keep losing.

Meanwhile, the Australians held their traditional Ashes Christmas lunch at the Melbourne Crown Casino and captain Michael Clarke, who had been absent in 2006 and 2010, attended this time.

Christmas lunch: Piers Morgan - one of KP's loudest and most influential friends - tweeted a picture from his lunch in Melbourne

Piers Morgan, keen village cricketer and CNN host, is in Melbourne and due to be a guest on BBC’s Test Match Special.

No doubt master publicist Morgan will use that platform to promote his mate Kevin Pietersen at every opportunity and at the same time launch into Graeme Swann for quitting the tour with two Tests still to be played.

The fact KP and Swann are not the 
best of buddies seems to be very relevant to all of Morgan’s many 
comments — particularly on Twitter — on the manner of Swann’s exit.

IT will be down to ECB chief executive David Collier, who is at the Melbourne
 Test, to decide how much Graeme Swann will receive of his 
£500,000-a-year central contract having quit three months into the deal.

The likelihood is that Swann will get around £200,000, plus the 30-day notice period, which he did not give.

Team player: Pietersen's relationship with team-mates - and his attitude to batting - have once again been called into question in this series

Lawyers from all sides are set to get involved in the squabble over who should receive what for the aborted Graeme Swann Ashes video dairies following his retirement.

Happier times: Swann was always the character in the England dressing room, which is why his Ashes diaries attracted a lucrative deal

Only one of the minimum four editions contracted with England backers Yorkshire Tea was released — and even that one followed doubts about the project after the abysmal start to the tour.

The sponsors were due to pay £100,000 for endorsing Swann’s diaries — such a success on the victorious Ashes trip in 2010/11. But it is understood no money has yet been paid.

BT Sport, who will be strong bidders in the upcoming tender for ICC’s 50-over World Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy rights, are expected to head the queue to employ Graeme Swann, who is likely to have a number of broadcast options.

But Swann, who has a habit of making rash comments which later need apologies or clarification — such as England being ‘raped’ in Perth or unnamed players being ‘up their own backsides’ — is going to need a significant amount of media training before being trusted to go live on air.

Spin doctor: Swann's outspoken views and loose tongue could make him a must-watch pundit for BT Sport or Sky Sports

However, Sky Sports boss Barney Francis, who is on holiday in Melbourne and Sydney for the cricket, showed no great immediate interest in adding Swann to his already over-populated pundits team.

But Francis, wounded by BT’s capture of Champions League football, will certainly be using his time Down Under to shore up his close links with the ECB and Cricket Australia — both of whom have long-term Sky deals.

Only Jonathan Agnew, who was relaxing in Perth while Graeme Swann was announcing his shock retirement in Melbourne, could highlight the BBC cricket correspondent not being around for such a big story by tweeting: ‘Goodbye Swanny, Hello Rotto’ – a reference to Rottenest Island which he had flown a light plane over that same day.
