The crew of a private jet that 
crashed in Massachusetts, killing Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis 
Katz and six other people, did not perform a flight control check before
 attempting takeoff, a federal report issued Friday suggests.

The
 preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
 on the May 31 crash at Hanscom Field outside Boston also indicated a 
possible problem with a mechanical gust lock system on the Gulfstream 
IV, which protects aircraft components from wind damage while planes are
 parked.

The plane would have been unable to take off had the lock been engaged, according to aviation experts.

Boston on Saturday, killing seven

Terror: An image shows the plane crash at the 
bottom of the runway at Hanscom Field. The aircraft was heading to 
Atlantic City on May 31

Fiery tomb: Lewis Katz, the billionaire co-owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and six other people died in the crash that was headed to New Jersey

Pilots
 typically check wing flaps, elevators and other components before 
takeoff to make sure they are working. The flight data recorder would be
 expected to have recorded such checks, but investigators found no 
evidence of such movement, the report stated.

The
 report did not identify a probable cause for the crash, and officials 
have said a final report could take months to complete.

NTSB
 investigators previously said data from the jet's flight data recorders
 indicated it reached takeoff speed of 190mph but never lifted off before it went 
off a runway, crashed into a gulley and burst into flames. Cockpit voice
 recordings revealed comments from the crew concerning 'aircraft 
control,' the NTSB said.

The black box also indicated that the pilot tried to brake and reverse the thrusters before the fiery accident that killed the billionaire and six others. Tire skid marks were also found on the runway leading up to the crash site.

According to the preliminary report, flight data showed evidence that the gust lock was engaged during the taxi and attempted takeoff, though a physical examination of the wreckage found the handle that locks the device was in the ‘off’ position.

‘There is some evidence that there was a problem with the gust lock system,’ said aviation consultant John Cox, a former pilot and accident investigator.

This is the flight data recorder recovered from the jet that crashed Saturday near Boston, killing eight people. Investigators are currently examining it for clues about what went wrong

This is the cockpit voice recorder from the doomed flight. Investigators said it picked up discussion among the pilot and co-pilot about trouble with air traffic control

Crew members, however, may not have been aware of the issue without a flight check.

If
 controls were locked or stuck, ‘those things would normally be found in
 a flight control check prior to takeoff,’ said John Gadzinski, an 
airline captain and aviation safety consultant. ‘We know one thing that 
definitely wasn't moving as planned was the elevator, which is necessary
 to rotate the aircraft (to lift the nose up).’

There was no evidence of catastrophic engine failure, the NTSB report said.

Flight
 data also indicated a rise in brake pressure and that the crew engaged 
thrust reversers, suggesting a desperate attempt by the crew to stop the
 aircraft after the failed takeoff.

The photographs of the charred plane wreckage show the shell of the burned-out aircraft splayed across the banks of the Shawsheen River after leaving a trail of debris across the field in Bedford, Massachusetts where it erupted in flames following a takeoff attempt at Hanscom Field.

Investigators have found that the crash was so quick that the pilots had no time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway. It then plowed through a fence and across the river banks - killing everyone on board - before coming to a stop.

'It's our understanding from a witness
 the aircraft never became airborne,' Luke Schiada, senior air safety 
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the 
Boston Herald last month.

Remains: The National Transportation Safety Board has taken over the investigation into the plane crash to determine what caused it

Shall: A National Transportation Safety Board official looks through the wreckage where it came to a stop after plummeting down an embankment

Terror: Officials work near wreckage at the scene on Monday. Investigators have said there's no reason to suggest it was anything but an accident

Skeleton: The pilots did not even have time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway

The plane, 
which was bound for Atlantic City, was carrying seven people, and six 
have now been identified by the District Attorney's Office.

Katz, 72, perished just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer following a bitter legal battle.

Marcella
 Dalsey, the executive director of his son Drew's foundation, also died 
alongside Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Marcella Dalsey, 59, from Williamstown, New Jersey, and Katz's neighbor Anne Leeds of Longport, New Jersey.

The chief
 pilot was identified as James McDowell, 51, from Georgetown, Delaware; co-pilot was Bauke 'Mike' de Vries, and Teresa Ann Benhoff, 48, from Easton, Maryland was on board as air 
crew.

Nearby residents recounted seeing a fireball and feeling the blast of the explosion shake their homes.

Katz, 72, and business partner H.F. 'Gerry' 
Lenfest only recently became the controlling owners of the Inquirer, The
 Daily News and Philly.com after buying out the other partners for 
$88million in a private auction.

'We
 all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in 
ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,' 
Lenfest said. 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that 
Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on the board of our new 
company.'

Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 

'My father was my best friend. He 
taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he 
worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were 
seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement.

'He loved his native 
city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia. He believed in 
strengthening education through his founding of charter schools, his 
support of the Boys & Girls Clubs and his generosity to his alma 
maters, Temple University and Dickinson Law School.

'But his greatest 
accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and
 me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.'

Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife, Anne, had been invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon.

Killed: Lewis Katz, 72, was among the 7 people who perished in the crash - which occurred just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer

Loss: Marcella Dalsey (left), executive director of the Drew A Katz foundation, and Anne Leeds (right), wife of Longport, New Jersey commissioner James Leeds, died

Victim: Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey was also killed. She is pictured with her husband Sam, a former Camden County prosecutor

The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin.

Mr
 Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the 
Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of
 interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher.

Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash.

Ms
 Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ 
Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012.

Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim.

Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake.

The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years.

Katz grew up in Camden, New Jersey and attended Temple University. Katz made 
his money investing in the Kinney Parking empire and once owned the 
NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils and donated money 
to Temple University.

A star-studded public memorial attended by former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Senator Cory Booker and entertainer Bill Cosby was held June 4 at the Performing Arts Center at Temple University, where Katz was a trustee.
