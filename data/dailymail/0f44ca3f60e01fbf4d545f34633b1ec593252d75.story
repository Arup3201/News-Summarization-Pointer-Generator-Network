Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard has declared that playing in England and the Premier League has made him into a better player.

The 24-year-old joined the Blues from French side Lille in 2012 and has gone on to win the Europa League in his first season and Capital One Cup earlier this month.

Hazard has been one of the stars of the Premier League season so far as Chelsea look set to run away with the title. Jose Mourinho's side currently sit six points clear at the top with a game in hand on all their rivals.

'I have become stronger in England because I play with and against greater players,' said Hazard, according to The Sun. 'I have to raise my level. I am gaining experience. It's a big match every weekend. Each season I find new qualities.'

'This season I score headers. Who would have thought it? I am progressing. I'm happy with my season like I was with last season. I am continuing my apprenticeship.'

Hazard has scored 16 times in 43 games so far this season, but has denied talk that he should be netting at a better return.

'People expect Eden to score 30 to 40 goals a season. I don't think about doing it. I'm not like that. If there is a point in my game where I still need to work, it is of course, to be more efficient, to play even more for myself, to score goals.

'But I am having a great season. Maybe I will have two trophies and that will be great.'

Hazard is currently preparing for Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifying clash with Cyprus on Saturday, as they look to get their misfiring campaign back on track with victory.

The Red Devils have just one win from three games so far in Group B, at home to minnows Andorra, with they have been held by Bosnia-Herzegovina and Wales.
