This first dedicated BXG suite follows the launch of Box of Grey's Hotel Hotlist - a first of its kind concierge service which allows couples to pre-order a box of choice and have it delivered discreetly to a luxury hotel room ahead of their stay via Box of Grey.

Burmiston, from London, has snapped some of the world's most biggest icons such as David Bowie and Kate Moss.

In a brief détour from his usual style, he collaborated with BXG to produce the exciting photographic collection. It can only be seen in its entirety within the BXG Suite as part of the Box of Grey experience. 

The pictures feature Box of Grey's 
Fantasy Concierge, transporting one of the brand's exclusive flight 
cases from BXG, across iconic London locations and delivering it to its 
literal 'sanctum' where a couple awaits. The custom flight case depicted
 in the imagery will be stationed in the room, on standby...

'Working with Box of Grey was an exciting challenge and as a team we have created an utterly sexy body of work which I believe will engage the viewer and draw them into the fun and adventurous world of the brand', says Burmiston.

This photographic collection will be 
available as a series of limited edition prints and as part of the Box 
of Grey experience.

The BXG Room can be booked directly via Sanctum Soho
 or BoxofGrey.com/concierge.
