The city of Phoenix is facing a possible lawsuit after telling a woman she couldn't pass out free bottled water to people in Arizona's 112-degree heat.

Dana Crow-Smith said she and a religious group were offering the water at a downtown festival in July as a kind gesture and to offer conversation on their Christian faith when told they were violating a city code.

'It was really hot and yeah we wanted to show God's love and a small act of kindness is a great way to do that without shoving it down someone's throat,' she told ABC 15.

A city worker told her she was operating without having a permit for the water's distribution she claims and told her she would need to stop immediately.

Non-profit civil liberties organization The Rutherford Institute has since offered to represent Ms Crow-Smith against the city.

They claim her First Amendment rights were violated and her claimed need of a permit was unjustified under the city's code itself.

'In fact, the Phoenix's City Code prohibits only "vending" on City sidewalks without a license agreement,â€™ the institute wrote in a letter to the city earlier this month.

'Having read a Bible passage referencing 
the importance of small acts of kindness such as offering water to the 
thirsty, Ms Crow-Smith was further moved to offer cold bottles of water 
to people at the Festival who were braving the desert's scorching 
112-degree heat,' the institute wrote.

'I don't even think it's about religious
 beliefs, I think anybody should be able to give away water, on the side
 walk to anybody. It's hot, and it's a nice thing to do,' Ms Crow-Smith 
said.

The Rutherford Institute has since notified the city that they will file a lawsuit unless an apology is issued, they agree to train city workers on First Amendment rights and assure to never interfere with her distribution of water again.

'It is beyond comprehension that local government officials would interfere with citizens performing such a basic act of charity as giving water to the thirty in your city,' the institute wrote.
