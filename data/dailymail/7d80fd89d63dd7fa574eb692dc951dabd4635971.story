Wayne Rooney's agent has been locked in talks with Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward over a new deal for the England star.

Rooney, who has 18 months left to run on his contract, has attracted interest from Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid.

The forward's agent Paul Stretford was at United's Carrington training base on Wednesday before returning on Thursday morning to hold further discussions, with Rooney's Old Trafford future topping the agenda.

In demand: Rooney has attracted interest from Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid

United will resist any attempts by Madrid to force through a deal for the 28-year-old, who, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier this week, is on a list of three centre forward targets for the La Liga club this summer.

Rooney is wanted by Carlo Ancelotti, with the former Chelsea boss also interested in Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Monaco striker Radamel Falcao.

When informed at the weekend that Chelsea's Jose Mourinho had predicted Rooney would be sold abroad this summer, United manager David Moyes said: 'I disagree'.

United, who were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by Sunderland on penalties on Wednesday night, will be boosted by the imminent £37million arrival of Juan Mata from Chelsea who arrived at Carrington on Thursday morning.

Uncertain: The England international's future remains in the balance - although United are keen for him to sign

Mata will undergo a medical at Bridgewater Hospital ahead of the move, which will be a club record fee for the Premier League champions.

But earlier this week, United legend Gary Neville questioned the signing of Mata. The Sky Sports pundit does not believe the Spaniard, who fell out of favour under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, fits in with the 'typical philosophy' of United.

In a series of tweets, England's assistant manager said: 'Does he fit in with what I would call the typical philosophy of Manchester United? I would say no.

'Positives of signing a player like him are obvious-lift everyone (spark) creativity, knows PL, 4th place chances go up - fantastic player.'

Then, on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Neville added: 'The first question, I think, is where are you going to play? Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are up top if they are fit so where are you going to play him? Are you going to play him off the left or off the right?

'Maybe they have to change the philosophy and maybe that's what David Moyes is thinking. Maybe he wants to play narrow wide players and maybe a three in midfield.

'They would have to change to accommodate Juan Mata in the way they normally play. They normally play with wide players.

'He's obviously a fantastic football player, there's no doubt about that, but one thing it does do, I suppose, is that David Moyes, Manchester United and Ed Woodward need to sign a big player.

'They need to make a noise and if they get him in it will attract potentially other players - and they need three or four players. 'What it could be is the start of something to lead to other things, but typically I wouldn't say he fits.'
