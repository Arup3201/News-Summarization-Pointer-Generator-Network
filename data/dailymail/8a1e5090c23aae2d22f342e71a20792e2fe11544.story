Team news

Hull 

Veteran goalkeeper Steve Harper returns to the Hull side for Saturday's visit of Crystal Palace with Allan McGregor out for up to six weeks with a shoulder injury.

Manager Steve Bruce must also decide whether Hatem Ben Arfa or Gaston Ramirez are ready to make their first Barclays Premier League starts since arriving on transfer deadline day, while James Chester is in line for a recall if Bruce chooses to return to a 3-5-2 formation.

Robert Snodgrass (knee) remains a long-term absentee but David Meyler is set to return to the squad.

Provisional squad: Harper, Jakupovic, Davies, Dawson, Rosenior, Robertson, Chester, McShane, Elmohamady, Meyler, Diame, Huddlestone, Livermore, Ince, Brady, Ramirez, Jelavic, Aluko, Quinn, Hernandez, Ben Arfa.

Crystal Palace

Marouane Chamakh played 18 minutes against Leicester last weekend and the striker is considered fit enough to start after recovering from a hamstring problem.

The Eagles, who are currently ninth in the table, go to the KC Stadium gunning for their third straight league victory after recording back-to-back wins over Leicester and Everton. They also did the double over Hull last season.

Provisional Squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Kelly, Fryers, Ward, Delaney, Dann, Hangeland, Jedinak, McArthur, Bannan, Ledley, Williams, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Gayle, Campbell, Johnson, Doyle, Chamakh, Zaha.
