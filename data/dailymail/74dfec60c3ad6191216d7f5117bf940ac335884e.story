Fears were rising today for the crew of a South Korean trawler which sank in the Bering Sea, off the east coast of Russia.

More than 50 men were reported missing in appalling conditions with high seas and strong winds.

Seven people were rescued from the 1,753-tonne Oryong 501 - including a Russian inspector on board the ship when it got into difficulty.

More than 50 men are missing and feared dead after their trawler sank in the Bering Sea in bad weather

One man was confirmed dead by the Russian rescue services.

The vessel sank off the Chukotka peninsula after being hit by a large wave as the crew hauled in their catch.

'One person, a fishermen from South Korea, died from hypothermia,' said Artur Rets, chief of the Naval Coordination and Rescue Centre in Petropavlosvsk-Kamchatsky, where the temperature is currently -4°C.

'The destiny of 54 other crew members is as yet unknown.'

'The ship tilted slowly after taking in water, forcing crew members to abandon it,' said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.

'Several vessels from nearby waters were involved in search and rescue efforts, but the operation has been hampered by bad weather.'

Other accounts said 52 were missing.

'Seven people were rescued, including a Russian inspector,' said Rets.

'Five were taken on board the Russian 'Karolina-7' fishing trawler, two others to the 'Zaliv Zabiyaka' boat'.'

He said that a huge search was underway as night fell.

'The crew of all boats in the area are carrying intense searches right now, looking for 54 others in the water,' he said.

However, the weather conditions were difficult.

'The wind is 25-27 m/c, with waves reaching 5-6 metres.

'We received information about the incident at about 5 pm local time, when the emergency buoy of 'Oryong-501' went off. The trawler sank very quickly.'

Reports said the crew comprised 11 South Koreans, 13 from the Philippines, 35 from Indonesia, plus one Russian inspector.

Other versions said there were 62 on board when it went down in mid-afternoon on Monday.

The vessel was operated by South Korea's Sajo Industries.

The human body cools 25 times faster in cold water than it does in air. 

The expected time of survival of a person in 41-degree F (5°C) water is up to three hours.
