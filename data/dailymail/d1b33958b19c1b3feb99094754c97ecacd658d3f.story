Ties: A website associated with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has outlined why it would be acceptable to kill all Jews and annihilate Israel

A website with close ties to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has outlined why it would be acceptable to kill all Jews and annihilate Israel.

Conservative site Alef has published a doctrine detailing why the destruction of the nation and the slaughter of all its people would be legally and morally justified.

The doctrine, first reported by WND.com, warned that the chance to remove the 'corrupting material' of Israel must not be lost - and that it would only take nine minutes to wipe it out.

And it said it was a 'jurisprudential justification' for Iran's Islamic government to then take the helm.

The article, written by Khamenei's strategy specialist Alireza Forghani, is now being run on most state-owned conservative sites, indicating it has the regime's support.

The crux of dossier said Iran would be justified in launching a pre-emptive strike against Israel because of the threat the Jewish state's leaders are posing against its own nuclear facilities.

It said Israel would need U.S. approval and help to carry out such an attack, and that because of acurrent passive climate in America the time for Iran to strike was now.

Danger: The dossier said that Ghadr missiles could be used to target urban settlements until the Israelis were wiped out

Listing statistics that reveal 5.7million of Israel's 7.5million citizens are Jewish, the dangerous dossier breaks down the districts with the highest concentration of Jews.

It states that Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa contain more than 60 per cent of the Jewish population, which could be hit by Shahab 3 ballistic missiles to easily kill everyone.

Sejil missiles, which are almost impossible to intercept, could be used to hit key nuclear plants - including Israel's main engineering centre Rafael and the Eilun and Nebrin plants.

They could also targety the Dimona reactor, in the nuclear research centre in Neqeb, which produces 90 per cent of the enriched uranium used in Israel's nuclear weapons.

Airports, air force bases, power plants, sewage treatment facilities and energy resources would also be hit.

And, the dossier concluded, Ghadr missiles could also be used to target urban settlements until the Israelis were wiped out.

The publication of the doctrine comes after Khamenei announced on Friday that Iran would support any nation or group that attacks the 'cancerous tumour' of Israel.
