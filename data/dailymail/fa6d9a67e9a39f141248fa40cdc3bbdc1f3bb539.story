A stunt where a woman rode a horse into a supermarket as part of the 'NekNominate' craze has been branded 'senseless and foolish' by police.

Inky Ralph, 21, was filmed by her laughing friends riding her thoroughbred cob Harvey into a branch of Tesco in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, before downing a can of Pepsi as part of a Neknomination challenge.

Police say they are investigating and added that it was pure luck that no one was hurt - but the rider has defended her actions as 'harmless fun'.

As she enters the shop on her horse Harvey, she is confronted by a security guard and an announcement can then be heard calling for the duty manager.

Miss Ralph turns to the camera and nominates friends of hers to complete their own challenge, as well as the security guard.

The craze, which has taken off on social media sites, involves people completing dares and ending by downing a drink.

As she doesn't drink, Miss Ralph downed a cola for the 'NekNominate'

She told the Northern Echo newspaper: 'It was something nobody else had done. It was just harmless fun. Everybody seems to find it really funny.

'I didn't realise how far it would spread and how many people would see it. I have had messages from as far as Australia and people are calling me a legend.'

But the police have said they will be arranging for those involved to attend their local station and are trying to establish what offences might have been committed.

Chief Inspector Sue Robinson, of Durham Constabulary, said: 'On Monday afternoon police were called by staff at the Tesco store in St Helen Auckland reporting a number of young women had been in the premises, with one of them riding a horse. They allegedly threatened a member of staff before leaving a few minutes later.

'Officers have viewed the in-store security footage as well as the video clip which has been circulating on social media.

'Those involved are believed to be well-known to both staff at the store and to ourselves and we will be arranging for them to attend their local police station at the earliest opportunity.

'At this stage we are trying to establish what criminal offences might have been committed and discussions have taken place with the RSPCA in regards to the welfare of the horse.

'It goes without saying this was a senseless and foolish thing to do. There were a number of shoppers in the store at the time and it is fortunate no one was hurt.'

Police said: 'At this stage we are trying to establish what criminal offences might have been committed'

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We are aware of the incident and the police are investigating.'

'NekNominate' has sparked controversy after two young men died in Ireland over the weekend that are believed to related to the drinking craze.

Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death.

Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination.

Mr Byrne's family pleaded with people not to take part in the drinking game.

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up.
