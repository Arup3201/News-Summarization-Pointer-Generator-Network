Police say they walked into a bloody, chaotic scene the night two former Auburn University football players and another man were shot to death at a party.

The officers testified Friday as the trial opened for the man charged in the killings, 24-year-old Desmonte Leonard.

Prosecutors are after a death sentence.

Desmonte Leonard enters the courtroom before opening statements on Friday as prosecutors asked jurors in opening statements to convict him of capital murder

Police described getting reports of multiple gunshots at an apartment clubhouse on June 9, 2012, and arriving to find one former player dead in a flower bed.

Another man was dead on a sidewalk, and a third man was fighting for life in a pool of blood.

The dead have been identified as former Auburn players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and Opelika's DeMario Pitts, reports AL.com.

Prosecutors told jurors in opening statements that Leonard began shooting after a verbal dispute escalated into a fistfight.

Leonard shot as many as nine rounds into the group, AL.com reports.

He then fled the scene.

The defense concedes Leonard was the gunman but says he fired in self-defense.

They're citing Alabama's 'stand your ground' law.

'Mr. Leonard thought he was going to die,' said his attorney, Jeff Duffey.

He continued in opening statements: 'This is a case where Mr. Leonard was assaulted himself, he was attacked, and he defended himself. There was no premeditation.'

Leonard's defense claims he has a 'heightened sense of awareness' to threats after being shot in the abdomen in 2008.

The trial's first witness, Auburn Police Sgt. Darrell Downing, described the scene as 'mass chaos.'

As the first officer on the scene, he saw people scattering in all directions and the dead in pools of their own blood.

He agreed that Alabama state law would allow someone to use deadly force if they believe their own lives are threatened.

'That is really what this case is about, the Stand Your Ground law,' he said.
