The gang of men who attacked an Indian woman who later died from her horrific injuries tried to run her over with the bus she was brutally raped in, it emerged today.

The 23-year-old was tossed out of the moving vehicle only for her fiance to battle to pull her from under its wheels, police in Delhi have said.

'They tried to drive the bus over the rape victim and her male friend. Her friend pulled her to safety, just in time', an officer close to the investigation claims.

Neighbours said the couple were planning
to marry in February but the woman, who remains anonymous, died on 
Saturday despite treatment at a Singapore hospital - two weeks after she
was attacked.

Anger: Protests continued in Delhi on New Year's Day as it was revealed that the victim was thrown under a bus by her attackers, police sources said

Meanwhile a row has erupted over whether the tragic victim should be named.

Minister Shashi Tharoor said 
if her parents do not have any objection her identity should be revealed.

In India rape 
victims cannot be named in any circumstances under section 228-A of its Penal Code.

Mr Tharoor said on Twitter: 'Wondering what interest is served by 
continuing anonymity of #DelhiGangRape victim. Why not name&honour 
her as a real person w/own identity?

'Unless her parents object, she should be honoured&the revised 
anti-rape law named after her. She was a human being with a name,not just a
symbol'.

A bone test is also being carried out to confirm the age of a young suspect in custody over the fatal assault and gang rape of a woman on a bus in India's capital.

Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for five other men arrested with him, police said today.

The six will be formally charged in court on Thursday on accusations that they kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered the 23-year-old woman in New Delhi on December 16, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said.

Media reports said some 30 witnesses have been gathered, and the charges have been detailed in a document running to more than 1,000 pages.

It emerged yesterday that the victim told her family as she lay dying in hospital that she tried as hard as she could to fight off her attackers.

The 23-year-old told her younger brother she bit and kicked the men as they raped her on a bus in Delhi. As they assaulted the student the men said they would kill her.

Following her death her brother paid tribute to the strength and courage she showed following her ordeal.

He said: 'She
was very strong. She always said one should never bear atrocities but 
fight against it.

'While she was admitted in hospital, she told me that 
she fought back as hard as she could. She was defending herself by 
beating and biting them.

'She
thrashed them and kicked them too. They were boiling in anger by her 
defence so they decided to kill her. She told me that they were 
murmuring 'maar do ise' (kill her). They threw her considering she was 
dead.'

He also paid tribute to the woman's friend, who was also attacked on the bus as they were returning home from a cinema trip.

Her brother said: 'The boy was equally courageous like my sister. She told me that he guarded her until he became unconscious.'

Rituals: After the body arrived at the airport, it was taken to the woman's New Delhi home, where police stood guard outside, for religious rituals before being escorted by police to the crematorium

He added that he hadn't slept since the incident occurred.

'Iâ€™m missing her voice. She was my best friend. Whenever I had a problem, I talked to her over the phone for hours. She 
used to give me the best advice,' he said.

In an interview with The Indian 
Express today, the brother said he and her family believe she could have
survived if she had been taken to Singapore for life-saving treatment 
sooner.

He said his sister caught a series of preventable infections in Delhi.

The trainee physiotherapist
was flown to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore four days ago - 
almost two weeks after she was raped by a gang of six men on a bus in 
Delhi.

'She could have been saved perhaps, but 
the decision came late,' her brother said, adding: 'Mount Elizabeth Hospital had very high standards
of hygiene. They could have prevented the infection.'

It comes as a second victim, a 
16-year-old girl claims she was raped by a conductor on a Delhi bus the 
same day as the gang-rape victim died.

The family of the 23-year-old student said they will 'fight' for the death penalty to be handed down to the perpetrators.

He said: 'The fight has just begun. We want all the 
accused hanged, and we will fight for that, till the end.'

The woman's body was cremated 
yesterday after being brought back to Delhi by an aircraft chartered by the Indian government.

Her horrific ordeal has galvanised 
Indians to demand greater protection for women from sexual violence with
mass demonstrations, candle-lit vigils and street protests with 
placards, chants and road blocks.

The Indian Army has cancelled New Year's parties across its airforce, navy and army in a show of solidarity with the family.

A
hotel in Gurgaon has cancelled rapper Honey Singh's performance tonight
after online outrage over his lyrics which boast about the different 
ways he will sexually assault a woman.

The Indian Congress has put forward plans for chemical castration and 30-year jail terms for all rapists following the attack.

A draft Bill has been put together and will be finalised and handed to India's chief justice by the end of January.
