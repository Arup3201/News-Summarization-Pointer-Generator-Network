She said she heard some rustling and unusual noises coming from the couple's bedroom and her granddaughter's crying seemed weak, but she did not hear any noises from her granddaughter anymore.

She became concerned at 5 p.m., when she noticed the breast milk her daughter left in the refrigerator had not been used and she told the newspaper that Warner - who has been to prison - was acting unusually hyper.

She tried to phone her daughter, but she said Warner had disconnected the phone line so she went to a neighbor's house to call police. 

She says Warner had left and police were unable to find him.
