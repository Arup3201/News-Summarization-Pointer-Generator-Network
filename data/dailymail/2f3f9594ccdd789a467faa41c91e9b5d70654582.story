A retired electrician has been awarded £187,500 after his wife died from exposure to the asbestos dust on his work overalls.

Mother-of-three Yvonne Moaby, 66, contracted the incurable lung cancer mesothelioma while husband John was repairing and stripping out storage heaters for four years in the 60s.

She was diagnosed in 2009 and died at her home in Quenington, Gloucestershire, in May 2010.

Retired electrician, John Moaby,  71, has received £187,000 in 
compensation because his wife died of mesothelioma after being exposed 
to asbestos on his overalls

Mr Moaby, 71, secured the payment after the case went to the High Court.  He said: ‘It is nice [to have the money] but you can't put a value on someone's life. It's taken such a long time and a lot of heartache.'

The Moaby's  case was eventually 
settled out of court, with SSE plc (formerly Scottish & Southern 
Energy) agreeing the compensation figure.

Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral that became a popular building material in the 1950s. 

Widely
 used as insulation and a fire-deterrent, it also found its way into 
products such as ceiling tiles, pipe insulation, boilers, sprayed 
coatings and garage roof tiles.

Mesothelioma
 has a very strong association with exposure to asbestos. The disease 
affects the lining of the lungs and is almost always fatal, with 
survival from point of diagnosis is usually just 18 months.

There were over 2,300 deaths from mesothelioma in the UK in 2009 – more than from cervical cancer or malignant melanoma.

Twice
 as many people die from asbestos exposure in Britain as are killed on 
the roads, according to a recent All Party Parliamentary Group report.

And
 mesothelioma incidence is still rising due to the long ‘time lag’ 
between exposure and the development of the disease – typically between 
30 and 40 years. 

Mesothelioma
 is much less common in women – men account for 80 per cent of cases - 
they tend to work less in industry so have had less exposure.

‘Asbestos
 fibres seem to alter the way in which cells multiply and divide,’ 
explains Dr John Moore-Gillon, an Honorary Medical Adviser at the 
British Lung Foundation. ‘Even a small amount of asbestos exposure – 
from clothes, for example – is enough.’

Indeed,
 secondary exposure is increasingly becoming a legal and insurance 
wrangle, says Christine Winter of the Independent Asbestos Training 
Providers, which champions safety and awareness when working with 
asbestos.

She said: ‘Unfortunately there is a real injustice of compensation pay outs for this area.’

Describing his wife as an unsung hero
 who worked tirelessly for the community, Mr Moaby said three years on he 
had still not recovered from losing her. 

He said: 'Yvonne was an angel. She was my rock.'

'Long before her illness she said to me "If I go first,  don't sit around and vegetate - find someone else".

'She was always there for me and it's only now I realise what she did.'

He
 added they had managed to secure a £50,000 compensation payment while 
Yvonne was alive, which the couple spent on two exotic cruises before 
she became too ill to go away. 

John said: 'She never complained once. She just kept saying 'I'm not going anywhere".

'She kept her looks and looked just as young as she did before she was ill.'

Although Yvonne spent some time at a hospice in Swindon, she spent her last days at home surrounded by her family and friends.
