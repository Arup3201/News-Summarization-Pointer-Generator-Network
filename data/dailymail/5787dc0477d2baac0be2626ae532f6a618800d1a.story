Angry travellers have taken to social media in frustration after Jetstar's website and phone lines crashed in the midst of a one day sale frenzy.

Thousands tried to snap up cheap $88 flights from Australia to Bali when seats went on sale at 4pm on Monday, but Jetstar's systems crashed soon after it began.

The cheap flights were released in competition with Air Asia's $99 fares on flights from Melbourne to Bali to celebrate entering the competitive Australia-South East Asia travel market.

Angry travellers have taken to social media in frustration after Jetstar's website and phone lines crashed in the midst of a one day sale frenzy on Monday afternoon

As angry travellers vented on Twitter using the hashtag #JetstarFail, the airline apologised to its customers.

A Jetstar spokesman said on Tuesday that the popularity of the sale put significant pressure on the airline's booking system, News Corp reports. 

'While customers were able to book throughout the night the heavy traffic on out website meant some customers had difficulty purchasing the sale fares,' he said.

'Our web team worked hard to fix the website's performance overnight and there are plenty of sale fares still available for travellers this morning.'

Some would-be travellers claimed they spent six hours trying to snap up the cheap fares.

It comes as Jetstar announced it will slash its carry-on baggage allowance for economy passengers by three kilos as the Australian airline cracks down on overweight luggage.

The maximum weight per cabin bag is decreasing from 10kg to 7kg on most Jetstar flights from next month. 

The changes will come into effect on flights booked from today, but weight restrictions will not be implemented until November 25.

Passengers who booked flights prior to October 28 will still be allowed to bring up to 10kg on-board.

Under the changes, economy passengers can bring one main item of carry-on luggage and one other small item, like a handbag, with a total combined weight of up to 7kg.

Business class passengers will be entitled to two bags as long as they don't weigh more than 7kg each - down from the combined 20kg they were entitled to prior to the changes.

'We know many customers get frustrated when there is not enough room for their bags in overhead lockers,' a Jetstar spokesman said.

'To address this we are reducing the amount of baggage that customers can bring on board, which will align us with other carriers in Australia and across the Asia Pacific region.

'This change will help speed up the boarding process, enable more flights to depart on time and ensure all customers get their fair share of overhead locker space.' 

The changes will come into effect on flights booked from today, but weight restrictions will not be implemented until November 25

Jetstar passengers can expect a $50 fee if their cabin baggage exceeds the weight and height dimensions and has to be checked at the gate.

The airline's cabin baggage officers are now checking passengers at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast airports in a bid to crack down on overweight luggage.

Cabin bags on Qantas and Virgin Australia are already restricted to a maximum of 7kg each.
