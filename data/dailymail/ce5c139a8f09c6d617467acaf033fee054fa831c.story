Authorities in Indiana have discovered a body in a lake - which they believe might be that of Teleka Patrick - the missing Michigan doctor accused of stalking a gospel singer.

Indiana State Police say a fisherman on Lake Charles in the town of Porter reported something suspicious on Sunday morning and  divers recovered a female body dressed in dark clothing soon after.

Local police, the FBI and 
Michigan police already searched the same lake on January 23 for Dr. Teleka Patrick
 of Kalamazoo, Michigan who disappeared on December 6,  but didn't find any evidence related to her 
disappearance.

At the time of her disappearance, Patrick's car was found abandoned by an Indiana trooper on December
 5 along Interstate 94 and near the lake about 15 miles east of Gary.

Police may have found the missing body of Teleka Patrick who disappeared on December 6

Authorities say the body of a woman has been found in a northwestern Indiana lake near where they conducted a January search for a missing Michigan doctor

Gospel performing artist Marvin Sapp was allegedly stalked by the missing doctor Teleka Patrick

Police say an autopsy will be conducted this week to positively identify the body.

The Michigan doctor had been stalking a 
well-known local gospel singer, and even referred to him as her 
'husband', a local newspaper reports.

Dr
 Teleka Patrick, 30, had a personal protection order filed against her 
by pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, who said Dr Patrick had 
visited his home and contacted his young children to get close to him.

It
 is also indicated in the PPO that Dr Patrick, who started her residency
 at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, moved to 
the area from California because of Pastor Sapp.

'She has moved from CA to MI,' Sapp wrote in part in the PPO request. 'Joined my church, contacts my children, and has been to my home.'

WOOD-TV
 reported that Pastor Sapp had filed the PPO order in September, and 
that he had 'over 400 page(s) of correspondence from her to which I have
 never responded.'

He added that Patrick’s stalking had gone on for at least a year prior to her moving to Michigan.

The young doctor was reported missing when she did not show up for work on December 6.

Surveillance
 footage showed her the night before failing to secure a room at a 
Radisson hotel just five minutes away from her apartment.

According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work.

Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money.

In the footage, without 
audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 
minutes before leaving after not getting the room.

She is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold 
Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her.

It
 was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her
 before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT.

Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's 
car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 1-94, 
more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana.

The keys were missing from
 the inside of the car.

Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work

Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work.

One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up.

Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays.

They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship.

Her family has now asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her.

Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek and the agency will now work on her case.

Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked

Dr Patrick had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring

Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment

Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.'

She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida.

'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked. 

Her
 family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her 
disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator.

'We keep getting closer to Christmas, and it keeps getting further and further away,' Tenesha told ABC News.
