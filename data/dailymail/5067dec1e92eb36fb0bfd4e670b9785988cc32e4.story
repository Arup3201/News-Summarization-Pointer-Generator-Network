Police have released new information today in the death of a college student who was killed in 2012, including a chilling note that was left next to the girl's body.

This Sunday will mark the two year anniversary of the murder of Faith Hedgepeth of Hollister, North Carolina, whose killer still remains at large.

Among the new details being made available to the public is the existence of a note that was scribbled on a fast food bag left next to the University of North Carolina student's naked body, which read, 'I'm not stupid bitch jealous.'

Tragedy: UNC student Faith Hedgepeth was found dead in her off-campus apartment on Sept. 7, 2012

Chilling: The note left next to the victims bed (above) read, 'I'm not stupid bitch jealous'

The note is believed to have been left by her killer. 

Other new details include the gruesome way the 19-year-old died, with WNCN reporting her body was found in a pool of blood, and blood spatter was found on the wall and bedroom closet door of her apartment. 

She was naked from the waist down and had her shirt pulled up over her breasts.

Investigators also discovered semen on her body, thought to be left by her killer, that matched a man's DNA found elsewhere in the apartment. 

An autopsy determined that she had been beaten to death, dying of blunt force trauma to the head. 

'As we approach the two-year anniversary of Faith's death, we're issuing an appeal to the public for help in finding her killer and with that help, we can bring some peace to Faith's family by bringing her killer to justice,' said Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue.

'We've conducted an extensive investigation and we have excellent evidence. This is a very strong case. What we need to do is connect that case to Faith's killer.' 

A $40,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Hedgepeth's killer.

'I don't want anyone else to have to go through what her mom and her sister, her brothers and sisters and myself have had to go through,' said father Roland

'Still not knowing after two years, it's really hard,' said the victim's mother Connie.

Hedgepeth was discovered dead in her off-campus apartment on Sept. 7, 2012, at 11 am by her roommate, Karena Rosario.

The girls had spent the previous evening out at a local club, returning home at around 3 am. Rosario then left their apartment at around 4:30 am, the last time anyone saw Hedgepeth alive. 

Her family is hoping this new information gets authorities the information they need to catch their daughter's killer.

'Still not knowing after two years, it's really hard,' said her mother Connie.

'But to me, the biggest question is why?'

The young woman's father, Roland, seems  concerned with this happening to other young woman in the area.

'Whoever did this, whether it was one person or multiple people, are very likely to do it again and these people, or persons, are walking around free,' he said.

'I don't want anyone else to have to go through what her mom and her sister, her brothers and sisters and myself have had to go through.'
