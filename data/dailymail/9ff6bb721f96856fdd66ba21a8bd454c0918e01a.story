Eurosceptic Tory MPs are to draw up a Christmas wishlist of powers they want David Cameron to bring back from Brussels, it emerged today.

A dozen members of the Fresh Start group will launch a report in December demanding the Prime Minister to take back control of immigration, energy and business policy.

Mr Cameron is facing growing calls to take a tougher line with Brussels to see off the electoral threat posed by the UK Independence Party.

Andrea Leadsom, a leading Tory MP elected in 2010, revealed the catalogue of rules and regulations requiring change will be wide-ranging.

‘By Christmas we will have produced a short and punchy manifesto for change which will be a shopping list of reforms across EU policy areas, including business, immigration, justice, agriculture, energy and many others,’ she said in a debate in Parliament today.

The ongoing financial crisis gripping the Eurozone presented an opportunity to extract a new deal with Europe.

A shake-up of the relationship was ‘absolutely essential’ she said, but dismissed claims the UK should withdraw from the EU.

‘There is no doubt that it isn’t just 
that we have the opportunity but we have the absolute need to get in 
there, to make British interests very, very clear long before the next 
European parliamentary elections in 2014.

‘The absolute burden is for us to define what we want that renegotiation to look like.

‘If
we do nothing because we are afraid they won’t listen to us, then we 
will get nothing, and we will end up with a position where it’s either 
in or out.’

Polls
have repeatedly highlighted the danger of UKIP, with as many as a 
quarter of Tory voters saying they would consider backing the smaller 
party at the next election.

A survey by the ConservativeHome 
grassroots website last month suggested 60 per cent of Tory activists 
favoured an electoral pact with UKIP.

Tory MP Peter Bone said today: ‘The way the Prime Minister can unite the Conservative Party on this and the way we could have a huge leap in the polls, how we get UKIP members coming back to vote Conservative, is quite simple - have a renegotiation then put it to the British people with two options: you accept the renegotiation or if you don’t accept it you come out of the EU.’

The Tory party is once again split on the issue of Europe. 

Mr Cameron has repeatedly argued that Britain should remain part of the EU, but many of his backbenchers disagree.

Senior Tories are worried that the party will lose votes to the UK Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage, who has called for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU

David Nuttall said leaving the 27-member EU was the solution.

‘With all the problems in the eurozone it is a fruitful time to be trying to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, but I fear that if one looks at the precedent, the hope of success is not great,’ he said during the debate.

If a referendum was held on the UK-EU relationship, and not on Britain withdrawing altogether, he urged voters to spoil their ballot papers, writing ‘OUT’ across the voting slip.

In response, Foreign Minister Mark Simmonds said a review ordered by William Hague this year was already considering which powers, if any, could return from Brussels.

Mr Simmonds said: ‘The Government has been absolutely clear that there should be no further transfer of competencies or powers from the UK to the EU over the course of this Parliament.’
