Training budgets for nursery staff have been slashed by 40 per cent, MailOnline can reveal as minister scramble to secure a deal on cutting crippling childcare bills.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg last night failed to agree a deal on giving more help with the cost of looking after their children, including offering tax breaks to working parents and tearing up red-tape for nurseries and childminders.

But new figures reveal councils across England have dramatically cut funding budgets to train new childcare staff, undermining hopes of a massive expansion in the sector to reduce costs.

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg, who obtained the figures, said parents are ‘rightly frightened’ at the prospect of the quality of care being hit.

In an article for MailOnline, Mr Twigg also warned that plans to copy the French system where staff can look after eight children at once – up from four in the UK – will fail to reduce costs.

But the government accused him of 'total opportunism and incoherence on childcare' after backing the Swedish system where there are no ratios at all.

Mr Twigg writes: ‘Cameron needs to make sure he doesn’t repeat the same mistakes he’s already made – he could make the right choices and improve the childcare system for parents but the real fear is that their plans will cause collateral damage: cutting the quality of childcare.'

He urged the government to follow the Sweden childcare system which 'gives parents choice, affordability and good quality places'.

But education minister Liz Truss hit back, saying the Swedish system has no ratio rules at all.

‘Stephen Twigg has today exposed Labour’s total opportunism and incoherence on childcare.

'He starts by attacking the idea of loosening staff: child ratios but in the next breath he says we should move to the Swedish system – where they have no compulsory ratios at all.

'Either he is deliberately pulling the wool over people’s eyes, or he doesn’t know what he is talking about.

‘After thirteen years in power, Labour left behind a childcare system where parents faced the highest costs of any major country besides Switzerland and staff were paid barely more than the minimum wage.

'The fact he has made such a basic error proves you can’t trust Labour on childcare.’

It comes as a new study found families living in deprived areas are more likely to receive a poorer standard of childcare.

Labour used Freedom of Information laws to reveal how much councils have spent on training for the early years workforce and supporting childcare providers to employ well-qualified staff.

In 2010-11 almost 140 councils in England spent £93.3million but a year later the budget had been cut by 40 per cent to £56million.

Mr Twigg adds: ‘The Government has slashed the budget for training for nursery staff, putting quality at risk. In four areas – Redcar, Enfield, Solihull and Lewisham, there is now no money available for councils to provide nursery staff training.’

Just 15 councils increased their spending year-on-year.

Miss Truss this week revealed she was considering overhauling staffing ratios to help reduce running costs for nurseries and childminders.

It is hoped that reducing the red-tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees British parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children.

But Mr Twigg pointed to a survey of childminders which showed that 81 per cent said that if the maximum ratios were increased, they would not charge parents less per hour.

‘The Government plans to cut back on childcare standards and safeguards – under the guise of deregulation. ‘This means that childminders could be looking after eight toddlers, instead of three or four under current rules.

‘Most parents say one toddler can be a handful – they will worry that child safety could be at risk, as well as the quality of early learning.’

According to a new report from the Policy Exchange think tank, around six in 10 childminders working in the most disadvantaged areas are rated as good or better by Ofsted, compared to 77 per cent  childminders in the richest areas.

The study, due to be published at the end of the month, suggests that only around one in 10 nurseries and childminders were rated outstanding by Ofsted last year.

The report is due to call for the Government to focus on improving the quality of early years education, and suggest that Teach First - which trains top graduates to work in schools in disadvantaged areas - should be extended to pre-school education.

Report author Harriet Waldegrave said: 'Early years education will only have a positive impact on a child's development if it is of a high quality. While provision is improving, it's not doing so fast enough."Most worryingly of all, lower quality provision in disadvantaged areas means positive effects of early years education are less likely to be seen for the children who need it most.'
