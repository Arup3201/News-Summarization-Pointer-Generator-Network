Labour was accused of insulting the victims of the Mid Staffs hospital scandal last night after its health spokesman suggested it would have been better if the report into their deaths had never been published.

Andy Burnham said events had borne out his view that the benefits of a public inquiry had not outweighed the reputational damage to the hospital.

The Francis report into Mid Staffs Hospital unveiled a catalogue of neglect and abuse that contributed to up to 1,200 needless deaths from 2005 to 2009.

The report also savaged the then Labour government's target culture, blaming it for prioritising box-ticking over patient care.

On Saturday Mr Burnham provoked a flood of comments on Twitter after attacking Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the growing crisis in A&E.

In response Shaun Lintern, a reporter on the Health Service Journal, pointed out that Mr Burnham had always blocked a full public inquiry into Mid Staffs while in office, preferring a more limited probe.

Mr Burnham replied: 'I was worried that a full public inquiry would damage the trust beyond repair. Think that's been borne out.'

Mr Hunt last night condemned Mr Burnham's comment and said it was clear Labour had not learned the central lesson of the scandal, that patients should be put first.

'It's an insult to the victims of Mid Staffs that the Labour Party is still denying the need for a full public inquiry into the awful events at that hospital,' said Mr Hunt.

'The Francis Inquiry recommended a fundamental change in the culture of care in the NHS. If Labour refuse to accept its findings then they cannot be trusted to run the NHS.'

Mr Burnham's intervention prompted an angry reaction from some relatives of the victims of the scandal.

Julie Bailey, who blew the whistle on Mid Staffs after the death of her mother at the hospital, said: 'The message he's sending out is that it is better to cover things up than criticise the NHS, however bad things are.

'The inquiry uncovered huge failings in the NHS, and he thinks it shouldn't have taken place at all. It is very worrying, because if he becomes Health Secretary again at the election it is clear we would go straight back to the old days of covering up.'

Deb Hazeldine, who was yesterday marking the anniversary of her mother's death at Mid Staffs, said Mr Burnham's comments had left her in tears.

In a direct message to him, she said: 'I didn't want to damage any reputations, Mr Burnham. I just wanted other daughters to take their mums home.'

Mr Burnham appointed QC Robert Francis to investigate Mid Staffs in 2009 but blocked calls for a public inquiry, saying it would be too 'distracting for managers'.

His Tory successor Andrew Lansley upgraded the investigation to a full public inquiry after the Coalition took office in 2010.

The Francis report uncovered evidence of similar scandals in other NHS hospitals and produced 290 recommendations to improve patient care and safety.

Last night Mr Burnham said his comments had been misunderstood. He said the lessons could have been learned without a full public inquiry. And he accused ministers of failing to stand by the hospital trust as its reputation was shredded in public.

Mr Hunt announced this year that the trust is to be dissolved.

Mr Burnham said: 'I did not oppose a public inquiry when it was proposed by Andrew Lansley. But I always worried that a lengthy public inquiry might have implications for the hospital and said the Government should provide it with more public support, which I don't think it did.'
