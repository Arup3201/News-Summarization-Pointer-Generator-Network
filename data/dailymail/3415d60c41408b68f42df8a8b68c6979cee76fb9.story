The parents of a 13-year-old girl who committed suicide last year say her death could have been prevented, if the school had informed them of the reports she was being bullied. 

On Tuesday, Jason and Jennifer Lambeth hit the Clark County, Nevada School District with a wrongful death lawsuit for the loss of their daughter, Thurman White Middle School seventh-grader Hailee Lambeth.

On December 12, Just a few hours after excitedly texting her parents about being named student of the month in her math class, Hailee was found dead in their Henderson home from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

Her 6-year-old brother Jacob made the gruesome discovery.

Targeted: The Lamberths claim school administrators did not inform them about reports Hailee was being bullied by two students 

While the Lamberths were initially shocked by what would lead their soccer-star daughter to kill herself, after reading her suicide note they learned she had been suffering 'severe and abusive acts of bullying'.

'I only ask that you tell my school I killed myself so maybe next time people like (C.H.) wants to call someone (names) he wont,' Hailee wrote in her last letter.

Tormented: One student, called 'C.H.' in the lawsuit, allegedly called Hailee 'fat' and 'ugly' 

They now believe administrators did not do enough to shield their daughter from the students who had been tormenting her from as early as August 2013. 

Those bullies have since been identified as a male and female student, called 'C.H.' and 'J.J' in the lawsuit respectively.

Just three weeks before  Hailee's death a student reported that she was being bullied in a P.E. class by J.J., who made her cry almost every day. The Lamberths claim the gym teacher never filed a report. 

Another student said in March that she had witnessed C.H. bully Hailee. 

'I don't remember the exact date when it happened but I know it happened at lunch around Thanksgiving time, he was pushing her around and he called her "fat" and "ugly,"' the student said.

C.H. also reportedly left a letter in Hailee's locker telling her to 'Drink bleach and die' and asking: 'Why don't you die?'

Apparently referencing Hailee's recently-diagnosed epilepsy, C.H. even allegedly left a voicemail on her cellphone the September before her death, saying: 'Where are you Hailee? I hope you died.'

C.H. had been suspended for three days on two different occasions for bullying other students. 

The complaint filed  about Hailee getting bullied in gym class was entered on an district website which allows anyone to report bullying anonymously. District policy states that a school administrator must investigate claims within 10 days and report their findings.

Avoidable: The Lamberths believe their daughter would be alive today if the school had informed them of the bullying reports. The 13-year-old pictured with her father on the left, and mother on the right 

But the Lamberths say they were never told about the report.  In the suit, they point out that under Nevada law, a school principal or other administrator must provide written noticed when there is a reported bullying incident. 

'Without a shadow of a doubt, we wouldn’t be here today if the school had informed us of this,' Mr Lamberth told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 

The school district told the newspaper that they do not comment on pending litigation.
