Elizabeth Murdoch spotted jogging  without her wedding ring

Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth was seen without her wedding ring yesterday as it emerged she is to divorce PR guru Matthew Freud after 13 years.

The TV boss showed a brave face as she stepped out to go jogging with her dog.

The couple – worth £260million between them – are divorcing amid rumours of a long-standing conflict between Mr Freud and his father-in-law, worsened by a row over Tony Blair’s friendship with the media tycoon’s ex-wife.

Mr Freud, 50, and Miss Murdoch, 46, who have two children aged 13 and seven, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week.

Sources said one factor in the breakdown of their marriage was the antagonism between the PR chief and Mr Murdoch.

Mr Freud took the side of his old friend Mr Blair when his 83-year-old father-in-law filed for divorce from Wendi Deng, 45, last year after becoming angered by claims the former prime minister met his wife several times without his knowledge.

Friends of Mr Blair have always insisted his relationship with Miss Deng is entirely platonic.

Relations between Mr Freud and Mr Murdoch then soured further, culminating in him banning his father-in-law from attending his 50th birthday party at his £8million Oxfordshire mansion, Burford Priory, last November.

Mr Freud said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way.

‘Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted.

‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’ A family friend told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Matthew and Elisabeth were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years.’

The couple are expected to split their £260million fortune equally. Miss Murdoch personally made £130million in 2011 when she sold her TV production company Shine, whose hit programmes include MasterChef, to her father’s company News Corporation.

Freud and Murdoch were married 13 years

Her husband, who is the great-grandson of psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud, founded PR company Freud Communications and is worth an estimated £100million.

They met in 1997, when they were both married to other people, and were immediately attracted to each other. Having left their spouses, Miss Murdoch and Mr Freud had their first child, Charlotte, in November 2000. They briefly separated before marrying at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2001. Their second child, Samson, was born in January 2007.

The couple’s parties were legendary for their heady mix of celebrities, senior politicians, media stars and colourful entrepreneurs.

Their combined wealth was estimated at £260million in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranked them as one of the top 25 wealthiest couples in the UK.

The couple have made no public comment about their separation.

But Mr Freud’s sister, radio presenter Emma Freud, retweeted a message from former Sun editor David Yelland: ‘Very sorry to read about the Matthew Freud-Elisabeth Murdoch split, but what I do know is they’re both great parents.’

A source close to Rupert Murdoch said yesterday that his daughter had her father’s full love and support but did not comment further.
