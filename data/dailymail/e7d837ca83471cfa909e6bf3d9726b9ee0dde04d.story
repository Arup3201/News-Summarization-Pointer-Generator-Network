Spartak Moscow have Â agreed a deal to loan Italian international defender Salvatore Bocchetti to struggling AC Milan, subject to a medical the club have confirmed.

Bocchetti, who has won five caps for Italy, joined Spartak from fellow Russian Premier League side Rubin Kazan in January 2013.

In a statement on their website Spartak said that the two clubs had reached 'an agreement in principle' on a 'loan agreement until the end of the current season.'

There was no word on whether the deal includes a clause allowing Milan, currently 11th in Serie A, to make the transfer permanent.

Bocchetti is the third player to leave Spartak on loan this winter after Russia captain Roman Shirokov, who moved to FC Krasnodar, and Argentinian midfielder Tino Costa, who has been loaned to Genoa.
