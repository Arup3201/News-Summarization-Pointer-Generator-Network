American Airlines today filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a desperate push to unload huge debt from years of rising fuel prices and labour costs.

The third-biggest airline in the U.S. wants to reduce costs
 and its $30billion debt to stay competitive but insists the restructure will not affect flights.

The move to bankruptcy protection is a crushing blow to an iconic brand and represents an alarming symbol of America’s dying economy.

In trouble: American Airlines and American Eagle's parent companies are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

Parent firm AMR - based in Fort Worth, 
Texas - along with regional affiliate AMR Eagle Holding, are filing 
voluntary bankruptcy petitions to reorganise.

The third largest U.S. airline also 
said its CEO Gerard Arpey will step down and be replaced by Thomas 
Horton - currently the company's president.

American was the only major U.S. 
airline that didn't file for bankruptcy protection after the 9/11 
attacks on New York and Washington D.C.

The last major airline to file for bankruptcy protection was Delta in 2005.

Labour costs are a big headache for American. It remains the only major airline that still must fund worker pensions.

Jet fuel cost an average of $3 per gallon so far this year - a record according to government data that goes back to 1990. 

Jet fuel is more expensive now than the average of $2.96 per gallon in 2008, when oil rose above $147 per barrel for the first time.

It has risen 56.4 per cent in the past five years. The average price of jet fuel was $1.92 per gallon in 2006.

American says labour-contract rules 
force it to spend at least $600million more than other airlines. It has
 also struggled with rising jet fuel costs.

American lost $162million in the third quarter and has lost money in 14 of the last 16 quarters.

The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York.

‘We plan to initiate further 
negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to 
competitive levels,’ CEO Thomas Horton said.

AMR's top rivals, UAL Corp and Delta 
Air Lines, which both used bankruptcy protection to slash costs, have 
since found merger partners.

Delta bought Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp bought Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings.

AMR has been in labour talks with its pilots for five years and a wave of retirements in October had prompted speculation it was nearing a bankruptcy filing.

Some analysts believed pilots chose to retire to lock in pension values that may now be in jeopardy as the company moves through bankruptcy court.

Long tradition: American Airlines was formed from a group of companies over a ten-year period and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939

'They will have to go through the whole process that their peers have gone through,' aviation analyst John Strickland told Bloomberg.

Firms use Chapter 11 bankruptcy for gaining time to restructure so they can still stay in operation.

This method allows firms to keep many of their assets as they try to become profitable again rather than going straight into liquidation.

'It’s painful but probably necessary. They have fallen behind what others have done.' AMR shares have fallen almost 80 per cent this year.

For the 240,000 passengers who fly American Airlines each day, the airline's bankruptcy filing should have little noticeable impact.

Delta, United, Continental and US Airways all went through Chapter 11. Their planes still took off and landed and frequent flier miles were still earned and redeemed.

The only risk is if the restructuring fails, the airline liquidates and ceases to fly. But travelers who bought tickets by credit card would be protected.

'Miles are safe,' said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent flier site MilePoint.

American was founded in 1930 from the 
combination of more than 80 smaller carriers and started trading on the 
stock exchange in 1939.

Half of its fleet flew for the military airline during World War Two - and it introduced the first domestic scheduled American freight service in 1944.

In 1953 it was the first airline to provide a nonstop trans-continental service. Its holding company AMR was formed after a reorganisation in 1982.

American is now the nation's third-largest airline behind United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines.

It flies about 240,000 passengers per day, has around 78,000 employees and operates out of five major hubs in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Miami.

But AMR has suffered losses of $162million in the third quarter and $2.7billion in the past year.
