Everyone loves a brand new pair of jeans but wearing them in can be a pain - literally. Now a Welsh denim brand has come up with an innovative solution.

'Artisanal' denim brand Hiut, which is based in Cardigan in west Wales, employs 50 'denim breakers' who wear each pair of jeans for six months before they are sold.

The first batch of pre-worn jeans, all of which have been thoroughly washed, are to be auctioned off today but more will follow should the venture prove a success.

Hiut, which specialises in raw and selvage denim, says the wearing-in process will give the jeans a fashionably vintage look as well as making them soft and comfortable.

The environmentally-friendly distressing method is the brainchild of David Hieatt, who, with his wife Clare, founded the company in 2011.

'The idea is that they [the breakers] wear them in for us and then we sell them on,' explained Mr Hieatt, in an interview with the Guardian newspaper.

'We’ve just about got them all back. We’re washing them – well, a guy who has been washing jeans for 30 years is – and we’ll auction them off. 

'The idea is that you break the denim in for the customer. It’s an experiment but so far, so good.'

Eco-friendly: Hiut's denim is all raw which means it isn't washed during the manufacturing process

Fashionable: Distressed denim is currently in vogue but making it can be disastrous for the environment

Hiut is one of a growing number of companies specialising in 'raw' denim which, unlike the regular version, is not washed during the manufacturing process.

This reduces the amount of potentially poisonous dye running off into local rivers - something that has proved an environmental disaster in India and Bangladesh where the majority of high street jeans are made.

Making the problem worse is the vogue for fashionably 'distressed' denim which is usually created via a combination of chemicals and machinery.

Mr Hieatt's method, as well as providing jobs for 50 locals, dispenses with all that. 'Good raw jeans, when you get them, are like wearing cardboard,' says denim breaker Cameron Stewart, 24.

'Luckily, they wash them first [before they are sold]. If you wear something every day, it will smell. By wearing them I’m adding value to them.' 

Eco-friendly distressed denim does, however, come at a price. Basic men's jeans start at £130 for a plain organic cotton pair, while those made from tough selvage cost £230.

Women's jeans, which are currently only available in skinny fit, cost £124.99. 

Despite the expense, Mr Hieatt, whose factory replaced the old Dewhurst denim workshop which used to be one of the main employers in Cardigan, says that his method of making jeans is much better for everyone. 

'In the old factory, they used to wash denim in the river,' he explains. 'The waters ran blue which, of course, wasn’t good, for the wild salmon and seals especially.

'80 per cent of the environmental impact of jeans come from washing and ironing. It’s shocking.'
