Japan’s nuclear crisis escalated yesterday, with fears that more tanks at the wrecked Fukushima plant are leaking contaminated water.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) plans to upgrade the severity of the release from a level 1 ‘anomaly’ to a level three ‘serious incident’.

The tanks were hastily built to store water washed over melted reactors at the station to keep them cool in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.

The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric 
Power Co (Tepco), said on Tuesday that water with dangerously high 
levels of radiation is leaking from one tank, but the NRA is worried 
about other tanks of the same type.

A person standing near the leak would receive five times the annual radiation limit for nuclear workers.

China
said it was ‘shocked’ to hear about the leak and urged Japan to provide
information ‘in a timely, thorough and relevant way’.

About 300 tonnes of water has breached a storage tank at the plant. Experts say that after 10 hours, a 
worker in that proximity to the leak would develop radiation sickness 
with symptoms including nausea and a drop in white blood cells.

Nuclear chemist and professor emeritus at Nagoya University, Michiaki Furukawa, said: 'That is a huge amount of radiation - the
situation is getting worse.'

It is the latest leak to beset the troubled plant in recent weeks, according to operator Tokyo Electric Power.

The embattled utility firm Tokyo Electric has struggled to keep the Fukushima site under control since the 2011 natural disaster hit the plant.

A Tokyo Electric official said that 
workers who were monitoring storage tanks appeared to have failed to 
detect the leak of water which pooled up around the tank.

He said: 'We failed to discover the leak at an early stage and we need to review not only the tanks but also our monitoring system.'

The NRA's impending assessment upgrade came in a document posted on the agency's website today.

The upgrade is set to follow a meeting held by the authority's commissioners, the NRA spokesman said.

'Judging from the amount and the density of the radiation in the contaminated water that leaked ... a level 3 assessment is appropriate,' the document said.

Following the earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima was assigned the highest rating of Level 7, when it was hit by explosions after a loss of power and cooling.

Continued contaminated water leaks from Fukushima have alarmed Japan's neighbours South Korea and China.

Tokyo Electric, also known as Tepco, has been criticised for its failure to prepare for the disaster and been accused of covering up the extent of the problems at the plant.

Massive amounts of radioactive fluids are accumulating at the Fukushima plant as Tepco floods reactor cores via a jerry-rigged system to keep melted uranium fuel rods cool and stable.

The water in the improvised cooling system then flows into basements and trenches that have been leaking since the disaster.

Highly contaminated excess water is pumped out and stored in steel tanks on elevated ground away from the reactors, which lie adjacent to the coast.

About 400 tonnes of radioactive water per day has been pooling and kept in storage at Fukushima.

In order to keep up with the pace of the contaminated water flow, Tepco has mostly relied on tanks that are bolted together with plastic sealing around the joints.

Those tanks are less robust, but quicker to assemble, than the welded tanks that the utility has recently started installing.

The latest leak came from the more fragile type of tank, which Tepco plans to keep using, although it is looking at ways to improve their strength, said Tepco official Masayuki Ono.

Tepco said it did not believe that water from the latest leak had reached the ocean, which is only about 500 metres away.

A puddle that formed near the leaking
tank is emitting a radiation dose of 100 millisieverts an hour about 50
centimetres above the water surface, Ono told reporters at a press 
briefing.

In
recent months the plant has been beset with power outages and other 
problems that have led outside experts to question whether Tepco is 
qualified to handle the cleanup, which is unprecedented due to the 
amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location.

The Government said this month it will step up its involvement in the plant's cleanup, following Tepco's admission - after months of denial - that leaked contaminated water had reached the ocean.

Tepco has also struggled with worker safety. This month, 12 workers decommissioning the plant were found to have been contaminated by radiation.

The utility has not yet identified what caused those incidents, which only came to its notice when alarms sounded as the workers prepared to leave the job site.

A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed on Tuesday media reports that Seoul had asked Japanese officials to publicly explain what they were doing to stop contaminated water reaching the Pacific Ocean and valuable fishing grounds.

Furukawa said: 'Tepco and the government must come up with ways to stop the leaks as well as to monitor and analyze how much and what sort of radiation is entering the ocean, as well as the affect it is having on fish and sea plants.

'They also need to make the information available to the public, all over the world, given this is the first case in history where contaminated water from a nuclear plant is flowing into the ocean at this magnitude.'
