One man has taken to scouring vacuum canisters for change at his local car wash in an effort to save money.

Raul Pinto, a father of four in Cranford, New Jersey, who appeared on last night's episode of TLC's Extreme Cheapskates, brings his wife and children along for the 'treasure hunt,' which he's made a weekly family ritual.

The 57-year-old's tactic for getting access to the bins is to lie to the car wash attendant, who serves as an unwitting accomplice to his scheme.

'Sir, I was vacuuming there and I think my wife lost her earring,' he tells the attendant, who politely shows him how to open the canister, in a clip from the show.

'The first time that I had to dig into a vacuum bin, I was pretty grossed out,' says Mr Pinto's young daughter, Francesca.

'But now as I keep doing it just about every week, I kind of get used to it - it's become like a second nature to me,' she adds.

Mr Pinto's wife, Patricia, approves of the tactic, claiming that it's fun for Francesca and her brother Nicholas.

'The kids love going to the car wash because it's like a treasure hunt for them,' she says.

'We have found ear phones, jewelry, change, of course - a lot of change. We have found candy,' she reveals.

Mr Pinto says that the couple's two older children, Raul Jr. and Monica, also enjoyed hunting for coins to be saved in their 'wish bags' when they were little.

'He'd say "Hurry, hurry! Get the nickels!"' Raul Jr. fondly recalls.

Previous episodes of Extreme Cheapskates, now in its third season, featured a woman who refused to do laundry and a man who covered all of his belongings in protective plastic wrap hoping to preserve the value of his home.

Extreme Cheapskates airs Wednesdays on TLC at 9pm ET.
