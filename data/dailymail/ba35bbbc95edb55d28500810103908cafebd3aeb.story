A luxury cruise operator is being sued for a total of £500,000 by 25 passengers who say they had their dream holidays ruined after contracting stomach bugs.

The passengers, who all sailed on the Independence of the Seas cruise liner at some stage between December 2010 and June 2011, claim they were laid low by gastroenteritis, due to alleged lapses of hygiene aboard ship.

They are now suing Royal Caribbean & Celebrity Cruises, of Weybridge, Surrey, with one couple alone claiming their bathroom cabinet was infested with sewer flies, and that they saw one waiter sneeze into a napkin before placing it on a table, and another wipe his nose on his sleeve.

The group say there had been ‘multiple cases of gastroenteritis on previous cruises’ on the vessel, which they dubbed a ‘sick ship’, and that they ought to have been warned and offered an alternative or a refund.

Charles Crow, the barrister representing the group, states in documents lodged in the High Court that the passengers had been promised that Royal Caribbean were ‘committed to excellence’ and had been told they could ‘look forward to an experience like no other’.

‘The passengers would have presumed and Royal Caribbean must have intended this to mean a unique experience for good reasons,’ says Mr Crow, who claims the firm ‘caused or allowed multiple guests to suffer symptoms of gastroenteritis’.

‘There were often ambulances waiting for customers at the ports visited,’ he states.

Mr Crow alleged Royal Caribbean’s 
staff had ‘failed properly to clean the ship’ before or during the 
cruises, and ‘provided unhygienic food that was capable of causing – and
did cause – the claimants to suffer illness’.

Yesterday holidaymakers involved in 
the class action told the Daily Mail they would never set foot upon such
a large liner again after their ‘horrendous’ experiences on the 15-deck
vessel, which caters for up to 4,370 passengers.

Peter Morley, a retired scientist from Rugby, Warwickshire, booked a £1,500, 11-night cruise to the Canaries with wife Glenys, a retired accountant.

Problems began when they arrived at 
Southampton to be told there was a delay because the ship was undergoing
a ‘deep clean’ because of a sickness outbreak on the previous voyage.

Just
24 hours into the voyage, Mrs Morley, 63, became ‘savagely’ ill for 
around 36 hours, but did not fully recover until two weeks after their 
return.

Mr Morley, 66, said he believes the sheer size of such ships makes controlling outbreaks ‘near impossible’, adding: ‘Once an infection occurs, it spreads like wildfire.

Every day at breakfast and lunch there is a scrum to get to the buffet and you end up with all these people within touching distance of open food, shuffling past and coughing and spluttering. It is little wonder outbreaks like this occur.’

A spokesman for Royal Caribbean said: ‘Of the 25 guests, not all experienced illness. Those affected by the short-lived illness responded well to over-the-counter medication which was administered on-board the ship.

‘Regarding the instances referred to, our crew conducted extensive cleaning on-board the ship and guests were kept up to date on these additional measures prior to embarkation and throughout their cruise.

‘Our hygiene procedures on-board are comprehensive and always strictly adhered to.’
