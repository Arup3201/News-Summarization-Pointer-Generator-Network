Manchester City’s pursuit of top summer target Eliaquim Mangala is being complicated by the fact the French central defender would prefer a move to neighbours United.

City are keen to bring Mangala to the club to partner captain Vincent Kompany as they defend their Barclays Premier League title next season and are hoping to negotiate with Porto over a ¤45million buy-out clause.

City, however, are facing a fight to convince the 23-year-old that he should join them rather than hold out for an offer from Old Trafford that may not come.

Wanted: Eliaquim Mangala would prefer a move to Manchester United over Manchester City

Promises: City boss Manuel Pellegrini can offer Champions League football

Prestige: But Mangala believes United are a more glamorous prospect

Sources close to the player have indicated that Mangala believes United and Chelsea are more ‘glamorous’ clubs than City.

Chelsea
 manager Jose Mourinho does have a fancy for Mangala after losing David 
Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain but he is not a top target for new United 
boss Louis van Gaal as he looks to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja 
Vidic.  

Van Gaal is instead considering a move for German defender Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund.

Mangala
 is so highly rated that one Premier League manager recently told 
journalists that he was the ‘most complete central defender in Europe’.
