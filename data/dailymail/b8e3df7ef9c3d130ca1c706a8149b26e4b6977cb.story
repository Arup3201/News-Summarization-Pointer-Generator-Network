Johnny Kormondy was put to death Thursday after a meal of fried alligator tail, fried okra, fried shrimp, fried eggs, hash browns, vanilla ice cream and cream soda

Florida has executed the convicted ringleader of a 1993 home-invasion robbery that ended with the murder of a Pensacola banker and the rape of his wife.

Johnny Shane Kormondy was pronounced dead at 8.16pm Thursday at Florida State Prison, shortly after the lethal injection was administered.

Kormondy's last meal consisted of fried alligator tail, fried okra, fried shrimp, fried eggs, hash browns, vanilla ice cream and cream soda. His final words were, 'I pray to Jesus Christ, son of God, I'm coming home.'

The execution was delayed by two hours by a late appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court that was eventually denied.

The 42-year-old Kormondy and two associates were convicted of forcing their way into the Pensacola home of Gary and Cecilia McAdams in 1993. Gary was fatally shot, and Cecilia raped repeatedly.

Kormondy and two other men killed McAdams with a gunshot to the back of his head during the home-invasion robbery and raped McAdams' wife, Cecilia McAdams, repeatedly.

It happened after the couple returned home from their high school reunion.

Kormondy's accomplices received life prison terms and Kormondy, who was identified as the ringleader, was sentenced to death.

The killer wanted his sentence reduced to life in prison because that is what his co-defendants received.

Defense lawyers said Kormondy has been denied due process because the Florida Board of Executive Clemency has not taken up a death sentence case in more than 30 years.

Horrific: Kormandy was the ringleader of a 1993 home invasion in Pensacola in which banker Gary McAdams was ambushed and shot dead while his wife Cecilia was raped repeatedly

Kormondy was initially convicted in 1994 but the Florida Supreme Court questioned whether the sentencing phase of his trial was fair.

Cecilia McAdams sat for a WEARTV interview on Wednesday and said, in part:

'I was told by a friend of mine that this might not be something I want to witness, just don't know if you understand what you're going to see. 

'And I said, nothing can be worse than the sight of my husband lying dead on our kitchen floor.'

Mrs. McAdams watched Kormondy die and said afterward, 'My family and I have waited 21 long years for this day to happen...He needed to die.'

She has spoken openly about the rape and her husband's death and has done extensive work on behalf of other victims. 

Kormondy is the 21st inmate executed under Gov. Rick Scott. The same number of prisoners was put to death under former Gov. Jeb Bush. The death penalty was reinstated in Florida in 1979.

Cecilia McAdams said following Kormondy's execution: 'My family and I have waited 21 long years for this day to happen...He needed to die'

McAdams sat for an interview on Wednesday, in which she said she was warned that watching someone die would be unpleasant, regardless of what he'd done, to which she replied, 'Nothing can be worse than the sight of my husband lying dead on our kitchen floor'
