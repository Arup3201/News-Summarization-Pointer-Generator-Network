Mannequins are to be fitted with beacons which allow them to ‘talk’ to the smartphones of shoppers.

People who download the app for the service will receive information on their smartphone on just what outfit the model is wearing, the prices and how it might be teamed with accessories.

Regular customers might be offered a personal discount on the dress on display by way of a loyalty reward, or they would be able to share the images with friends to get advice on whether to buy.

While they can also store the information on their phone to think about it and buy later from the retailer’s website.

The VMBeacon system has been developed by the British technology and design company Iconeme and is the latest evidence as to how technology and smartphones are changing the way people shop.

The beacons installed inside the mannequins have a range of 100 metres and a battery life of three years and so can communicate with shoppers even when stores are closed.

The idea of having a virtual conversation with mannequins has echoes of Dr Who, where the idea of shop dummies that come to life has featured several times over the decades.

The theme was first used in episodes in 1970 when the doctor, who was played by Jon Pertwee, came up against the Autons or Nestenes. The episode caused great controversy at the time with complaints it was too frightening for children.

Many fans will remember the character Rose, played by Billie Piper, being pursued by mannequins when the series was revived in 2005 and featured Christopher Eccleston as the doctor. 

The Iconeme founders are Jonathan Berlin and Adrian Coe, who together have over 50 years’ experience in the retail industry, working with famous name fashion chains.

The two also run Universal Display, which is a leading manufacturer of mannequins and works with a number of top high street retailers, including BHS, Monsoon, Harvey Nichols and Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop.

Mr Berlin said: ‘A recent Google report revealed that 84per cent of smartphone shoppers use their devices to help them browse while in a store. The technology we have developed aims to tap into this trend and offers real value to both retailers and consumers.

‘The Internet of Things and beacon technology has been gaining momentum over the last few years but we are yet to see its practical and widespread use in retail outlets. Installing this technology in mannequins ensures it occupies a prime location and an ideal focus-point for shoppers, whether they are in the store itself or just passing by the window.’

Another British company has developed a similar technology called the PowaTag, which is a smart tag that is used in TV commercials, window displays and print advertisements.

The shopper uses their smartphone to take a picture of the tag and an associated App then links to the store’s website to allow an instant purchase.

The British tech firm Powa Technologies has already signed up 240 global brands from Adidas and Reebok, to Universal Music and the world’s second largest supermarket group, Carrefour.

It is the brainchild of internet entrepreneur and one-time City whizz-kid, Dan Wagner, who has become a multi-millionaire on the back of past investments in a series of tech firms.
