A 2-year-old Utah boy is dead after his 3-year-old sister accidentally shot him last week with a loaded rifle that was left in her family's living room after her father had used the gun earlier in the day. 

The unidentified boy was shot in the stomach with a .22-caliber rifle in Cache County, Utah - a rural part of the state just south of the Idaho border - about 6:40 p.m. Friday in what law enforcement officials are calling 'a tragic accident.'

The boy is the fourth person killed in the U.S. this month by a gun that found its way into the hands of a child.

Careless: A 2-year-old boy was killed by his 3-year-old sister while she was playing with a rifle the kids' father had left in the living room of this Utah home

'The gun had been used earlier in the day by the victim's father and was
 set down after returning home,' Cache County Sheriff's Lt. Mike 
Peterson said in a press release given to KUTV.com. 'The gun was in an unloaded state but did 
have live rounds in the magazine. We believe the three-year-old had to 
manipulate the action enough to chamber a live round prior to the 
incident occurring.'

The children's mother heard the gun go off and immediately called for help.

First responders - some living just a few houses away, according to Desert News - hurried to the scene and rushed the boy to a local hospital in critical condition.

After undergoing surgery at Logan Regional Hospital, the boy was airlifted to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was pronounced dead. 

Peterson went on to say that the incident is just a tragic reminder of the dangers of not properly securing firearms.

'It really does just reiterate that weapons are dangerous and you just 
need to take extra precautions with them,' Peterson said. 'You just 
can't be safe enough.'

It's unclear whether anyone will be charged with a crime in the boy's death - Peterson says investigators are taking statements and reviewing evidence before they pass the case on to the county attorney, who will decide whether charges will be filed.

'Where it is an accident, we're allowing the family the time that they 
need to take care of what they need to,' Peterson said Friday. 'But we 
will conclude the investigation. We'll find out when the weapon came 
into play, how it came into play, all the details that go along with 
that.'

On Thursday, in Easley, South Carolina, a 6-year-old boy accidentally shot a 22-year-old woman when he fired a gun he found in the backseat of the vehicle in which the two were riding.

Alexandra Anita Santos was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle when the boy - who was seated in the back of the vehicle - fired the weapon through the seat and into Santos.

The boy's mother, who was driving the car, had to call Santos' family and relay the horrible news. However, she told them that Santos' ex-boyfriend - and not her son - was responsible for Santos' death.

Santos' family didn't buy that explanation and are 'angry' the unidentified friend would blame the tragic incident on their daughter's ex.

'You give any kind of access to a firearm six-year-old child, somebody needs to be responsible,' Santos' mother, Cynthia Yergeau, told foxcarolina.com. 'Take responsibility, own up to what your kids did.'

Earlier this month, on April 12, a 7-year-old girl was killed at a birthday party in South Carolina after a 5-year-old boy accidentally fired a gun that he thought was a toy.

Lexington County Sheriff James Metts says the boy was trying to get a toy gun out of a trunk Saturday night at a home in Gaston when he picked up a real gun also in the trunk by mistake.

Deputies say the bullet went through a car, and fragments hit Juliet Lynch in the chest. She died a short time later.

Metts says the real gun belonged to the boyfriend of the boy's mother and she did not know it was in the trunk.

The sheriff says charges could be filed in the shooting. Police did not release the name of the boy, his mother or boyfriend.

On April 5, a 2-year-old boy in Philadelphia fatally shot his 11-year-old sister while playing with a handgun that was left in a room with the two unattended children.

The bullet hit Jamara Stevens in the chest, piercing her heart. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital shortly after.

Authorities found gunpowder residue on the boy's hand, NBC Philadelphia reports.

Investigators believe the gun belonged to the boyfriend of the children's mother, who had visited the home earlier in the day and left his .357-caliber handgun with an 8-inch barrel on top of the refrigerator.
