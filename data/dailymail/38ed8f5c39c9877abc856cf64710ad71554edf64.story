Thousands of troops stationed overseas could be sent home to help police cope with a Paris copycat attack amid fears they are not prepared for a large-scale bloodbath.

Ministers are examining plans to have ‘high-readiness’ battalions stationed across the country to respond to a terror attack within minutes.

The infantry units would provide back-up support to armed police and would be especially vital if there is more than one attack at any given time.

Prepared: French soldiers in Paris yesterday. Ministers are considering the possibility of bringing home British troops to be stationed across the country in readiness in case there are any copycat attacks

Currently there are hundreds of troops on standby for an onslaught by Islamic State fanatics. But there are concerns there are not enough armed police outside London, especially in villages.

If there was to be an attack outside the capital, it could be more than half an hour before the police have back-up from the Army.

As a result, it is understood various government departments are now looking at having more soldiers stationed in places such as Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland.

A senior Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘The country has a force of more than 80,000 troops and they need to be deployed where the threat is. Homeland security needs to be stepped up and as part of that we are looking at where there are gaps. We are looking at bringing back soldiers from overseas.’

The Ministry of Defence last night denied that troops are to be brought home, but senior Whitehall sources insisted the plans were under discussion. Details are not yet clear but it is understood thousands of soldiers could be re-deployed across the UK from overseas.

The Army is stationed in more than 80 countries. There are thousands of troops in Germany – a legacy from the Second World War – as well as hundreds in Cyprus and hundreds in the Falklands.

David Cameron consulted senior intelligence and security officials on Monday over Britain’s response to the carnage. It is understood he has put the SAS on standby to head off the ‘fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence’.

The elite soldiers will take part in training exercises in which firearms police will re-create the horror witnessed in France last week.

In the plans being looked at by ministers, regular soldiers could also be trained in how to deal with acts of terror in the UK in the event of a similar attack.

They would provide the back-up to armed patrols and would be prepared to hunt down the terrorists if a situation arose in which they managed to escape.

A source added: ‘The government is recognising the threat could be on British soil. Currently our high-readiness troops are ready to be deployed overseas but we need to make sure we have enough soldiers in the UK.

‘We are looking at sending soldiers to cities such as Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham or having many more troops stationed in Scotland.’

However, an MoD spokesman said: ‘There are no plans to redeploy troops from overseas to within the UK in support of domestic security measures.’

Yesterday Theresa May said paramedics and fire crews had been issued with bullet-proof vests and helmets in preparation for a Paris copycat atrocity.

They have also been taught how to work in buildings, airports and railway stations that may be booby-trapped.

These units, known as Fire Special Operations Teams and Ambulance Intervention Teams, were set up ahead of the Olympic Games, which were feared to be highly vulnerable to a terrorist attack.

It has also emerged security is being offered to moderate Muslims speaking out about the Paris attacks and those working for magazines and newspapers that have circulated Charlie Hebdo images and may be at risk.

Earlier this week France mobilised 10,000 troops to protect high-risk sites, such as Jewish schools. It is the first time troops have been deployed within France on such a scale.
