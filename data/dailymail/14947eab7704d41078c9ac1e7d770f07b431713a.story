Allegations: Dentist Raghuvir Patel allegedly told a trainee dental nurse to go and have sex with as many men as she wanted after she split from her boyfriend

A dentist told a trainee nurse who had just broken up with her boyfriend to have sex with as many men as she wanted and offered to show her 'how it was done', a tribunal has heard.

Raghuvir Patel is alleged to have made a number of sleazy comments to colleagues, treated patients without gloves and failed to ensure equipment was sterilised at his practice in Braintree, Essex.

The General Dental Council heard that male and female employees had to change in the same box-room at the practice and x-ray fluid was routinely disposed of down the sink.

Tim Grey, acting for the GDC, told how Saskia Tikasingh, now a qualified dental nurse, was allegedly bullied by Mr Patel.

He described how Mr Patel called Miss Tikasingh 'Shorty' on account of her height and added that the nickname was unprofessional and made her feel upset and 'put down'.

After Miss Tikasingh had split up with a boyfriend, the hearing heard that Mr Patel allegedly told her: 'You don’t need a boyfriend but you should go and f*** as many people as you like'.

‘He also said he would take her out and show her how it was done’.

Mr Grey also told the panel about the working conditions at the surgery in St Michael's Lane, Braintree.

As well as describing the changing facilities for staff, Mr Grey said that there was no sanitary bin for female staff and that they were told to take used sanitary towels home with them.

Giving evidence Miss Tikasingh told the hearing how she reacted when Mr Patel told her to go and have sex with as many men as she wanted.

She said: 'I was a bit embarrassed but I suppose I just laughed it off.'

Embarrassment: Saskia Tikasingh told the General Dental Council how Mr Patel's comments made her feel embarrassed and she tried to laugh them off

She said the dentist had made similar remarks to her 'about three or four times'.

Of Mr Patel’s clinical practise, she added: ‘He would use the same instruments the whole morning for his orthodontic patients.’

Mr Grey asked: ‘Did he sterilise those instruments between patients?’

Miss Tikasingh replied: ‘No’.

Mr Patel also allegedly shouted at his nurses and other employees, once screaming at Miss Tikasingh in front of a patient.

If Patel is found guilty of misconduct, he could be struck off.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
