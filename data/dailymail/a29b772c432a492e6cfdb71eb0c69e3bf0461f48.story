Thorpe Park has been accused of 'stigmatising mental illness' for naming a Halloween attraction The Asylum.

Campaigners say bosses at the theme park should consider changing the name of the horror maze.

The attraction has featured as part of the Surrey park's annual Halloween event, Fright Night, for eight years.

Campaigners want the name of the Halloween attraction changed and say it 'stigmatises' the mentally ill

Mental health advocates said that having actors chasing people around 'The Asylum' pretending to be patients reinforces stigma around mental illness.

A Thorpe Park spokeswoman said that the attraction is not meant to be offensive nor 'a realistic portrayal' of mental ill health.

The news sparked a row on the attraction's Facebook page, with one user posting: 'I have psychosis, I'm not dangerous, and have never run after someone with a chainsaw.'

Another said: 'Stuff like this genuinely contributes to an atmosphere in which people with mental illness suffer discrimination and violence.'

To which one user replied: 'Obfuscation in discussing mental illness is equally damaging. Do you seriously believe that your bracketing all people who have mental illnesses (of a variety of kinds) under the "offended" flag because of the use of the name "Asylum" isn't offensive?'

Another added: 'It's for Halloween, get a grip.'

The petition organised by nursing student Katie Sutton has attracted hundreds of signatures

A petition calling for the ride to be shut down organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student, has attracted more than 750 signatures.

She wrote: 'Asylum, Thorpe Park's Halloween maze, is stigmatising to mental illness.'

Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to "patients" crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness.

'It really matters because the promotion of the scary "mental patient" stereotype reinforces stigma and means people with mental health problems are afraid to be open about it. This means they are less likely to get support both from friends and professionals.

'We'd like executives from Thorpe Park to meet face-to-face with people with mental illness, to hear about their concerns. We also think they should change the theme of the attraction and stop referring to "patients". There are plenty of other themes they could choose like zombies, vampires or monsters, without upsetting anyone.'

Thorpe Park bosses say the maze is for adults and the experience draws on classic horror film content

A Thorpe Park spokeswoman said: 'We have listened to the feedback and respect the opinions of everyone who has been in touch. However, these comments are not universally representative either of many of our guests who have given us very positive feedback, or of others working within the mental health sector.

'The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping. It is set within a single closed environment and is a very small element of an event aimed at adult visitors - all of whom chose to visit, and have paid for entry to the overall event.

'This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of mental health or indeed any other institution.'

Last month supermarkets Asda and Tesco came under fire for selling Halloween costumes which were said to have caused offence.

Asda withdrew its 'mental patient fancy dress costume' and Tesco took its 'psycho ward' outfit off the shelves.
