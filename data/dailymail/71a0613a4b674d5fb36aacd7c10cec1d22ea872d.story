This was the jaw dropping moment a diver came face-to-face with a behemoth of a crocodile.

Fearless John Nygren was swimming in the waters off the south-east coast of Quintana Roo in Mexico when he encountered this prehistoric creature.

The reptile seemed as interested in the swimmer as the swimmer was in him and came in really close to investigate the diver and his crew.

Touching tail: The diver reaches out and touches the tail of the creature. 'The crocs don't want to risk injury by taking us on,' Mr Nygren said of his encounter with the massive reptiles

Languidly gliding through the clear waters, the crocodile is within touching distance of Mr Ngyren, and seems more curious than threatened by the presence of human beings encroaching its natural habitat.

It opens its frightful jaws wide to snap up the bait that divers dangle in front of it, gulping it down within seconds.

But as the curios croc investigates the underwater camera, the divers stay close to the dangerous reptile, floating inches from its open mouth.

The magnificent creature seems calm and placid, blissfully unbothered by the swimmers surrounding it.

At one point the diver reaches out to touch the tail of the creature, holding on to it for a few seconds.

Head above water: The group followed safety protocols to ensure that they didn't come to any harm

The camera then pans to show another crocodile, swimming up behind the first and the two glorious crocs gracefully slice through the water as their powerful bodies sway. 

The croc couple swim close together but things start to get aggressive very swiftly when one creature opens its jaws wide and tries to bite the other. 

But before it can pierce its thick scales, the crocodile snaps back and the aggressor quickly swims away

This particular species, the American crocodile or Crocodylus acutus, is a rare sight in this particular area of Mexico.

According to crocodile website crocodilian.com, there have only been 42 American crocodile sightings in Quintana Roo. 

Mr Ngyren wrote on his Facebook page that the crocodiles would would have tried to have eaten the swimmers, if they had been given a chance

Mr Ngyren, who works for Pinnacle Adventure, wrote about the experience on his Facebook page. 

'If given the chance they would maybe try to eat us. They have existed for millions of years because of their caution, they only expel energy when energy is to be gained (prey),' he posted.

'Our posture in the water puts us above them. To them we appear larger, taller, and with our huge camera dome ports we theorise they look like a giant intimidating eye. 

'The crocs don't want to risk injury by taking us on. If you turn your back on one, put yourself at a disadvantage, stumble and make yourself an easy target, they would immediately lunge and make a meal out of you. 

'Safety protocols in the water are strictly followed to prevent such an incident.'
