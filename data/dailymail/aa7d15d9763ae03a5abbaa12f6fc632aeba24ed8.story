Novak Djokovic made short work of clearing a potentially major hurdle as he crushed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to move into the quarter-finals of the French Open.

Djokovic wants to win the Roland Garros title more than any other, and few would bet against him if he can maintain the form he showed in a 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 victory.

The second seed had dropped a set against Marin Cilic in a long match in the previous round while Tsonga had seen off Jerzy Janowicz in straight sets.

The pair 
arrived on Court Philippe Chatrier following Roger Federer's defeat by 
Ernests Gulbis but the crowd's hopes of another upset were quickly 
dampened as Djokovic raced into a 5-0 lead.

Last
 year Tsonga beat Federer but then played a horribly flat match against 
David Ferrer in the semi-finals after the epic between Djokovic and 
Rafael Nadal.

It
 was a similar story this time and the only moment of hope for the 
Frenchman came when he pulled back from 2-5 to 4-5 in the second set.

Djokovic
 snuffed out the comeback, though, and then raced through the third set 
to clinch victory after only an hour and 29 minutes.

Next
 he will play eighth seed Milos Raonic, who reached his first grand slam
 quarter-final with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Marcel Granollers.
