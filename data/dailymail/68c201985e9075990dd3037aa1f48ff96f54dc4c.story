Rise: Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty

Motorists will almost certainly have to pay 3.02p more for their fuel at the pumps to help pay-off Britain's debts, a senior minister has admitted.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty expected to come into effect in August.

It means already cash-strapped families will have to fork out more than £1.40 a litre for petrol - most of which is tax.

The move also sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel 
protests similar to those seen in September 2000 when petrol pumps ran 
dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country's motorway 
networks.

Miss Greening she said wants to focus on pushing petrol companies to slash the cost of fuel at the pumps, to bring it in line with the falling cost of oil globally.

Former Treasury minister Miss Greening told the Daily 
Telegraph said: 'The taxes that we get in fund the public services that 
we all rely on.

'Surely it’s better to challenge the petrol retailers to 
pass on reductions to motorists and actually I think that’s probably the
most important thing to do.'

At present, 57.95p is taken in fuel duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded. VAT adds another 20 per cent - around 24p at current prices.

If the fuel duty rise is rubber stamped, it will mean almost 61p out of every litre of bought will go in duty.

Fuel duty and VAT has kept petrol prices artificially high despite the falling cost of crude oil, although petrol prices have fallen this month by 4p for the second month running. 

Also, today three supermarkets, Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco vowed to 
slash the price of fuel at the forecourt passing on savings to customers
from falling oil prices.

Miss Greening said it was important 
that the Treasury focus on cutting the deficit in light of what is 
happening to some countries in Europe. Ministers will be left to find 
£1.5billion to plug the income gap if the fuel duty rise is pulled. 

However, the Prime Minister is under pressure 
to ditch the fuel price rise from senior ministers who have voiced 
concern that it will damage support for the Tories from poorer voters. 

Ideas under consideration include cutting the 3p 
rise to 1p or 2p, or deferring part or all of the rise until next 
spring.

Going up: How the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising even although for the past year the cost of brent (crude) oil has fallen, but prices have remained high

As of just a few days ago, 50 MPs, including seven Tories, 
have now signed a Commons motion calling for the price rise to be 
scrapped.

Supermarket Asda is cutting the price of petrol.

From tomorrow customers at Asda’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than 127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel.

Asda said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since February 2011.

The latest cut means Asda has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel since the end of April, reducing the cost of filling up a family car by almost £10.

Sainsbury’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too, with petrol and diesel coming down 'by up to 2p per litre' from tomorrow.

The AA said the 14p Asda reduction since April was welcome.

While Asda had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale, the UK average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-April.

Tesco is also dropping prices, with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow.

They were joined by leading businessmen, with the 
boss of Asda also demanding the tax hike is cancelled.

This week, the SNP will also try and 
force the Coalition to scrap the duty rise by forcing a vote as the UK 
budget complete the final stages of its passage through Westminster.

The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has backed cross-party action to scrap the hike.

Chief Executive Liz Cameron said it would be 'a welcome boost for 
businesses which are having to contend with high transportation and 
utility costs at a time when domestic demand remains subdued'.

But Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has played down hopes of progress.

He said last week: ‘Right now, taxation on fuel is 10p a litre less than it would have been if Labour’s plans had been in place.

'But given the huge issues we have 
with public finances, we also need to make sure  that we’ve got the 
money coming through the tax system, and the increase in fuel duty is 
part of that.'

June's AA Fuel Price Report shows that, since mid-May, average UK 
petrol prices have fallen 4.63p a litre, from 138.40 to 133.77.

This
is on top of the 4.08p-a-litre fall the previous month and is the 
biggest monthly drop since the petrol price dived 5.4p a litre between 
mid-November and mid-December 2008.

Pricey: Ministers will be left to find £1.5bnillion to plug the income gap if the fuel duty rise is pulled and Miss Greening said it was important to focus on the deficit

Even so, the overall 
8.71p-a-litre reduction in the pump price petrol since the 142.48p 
record on April 16 is still short of where it should be, the motoring 
group said.

Under government pressure to make pump prices 
transparent, the fuel industry will have to prove in the future that UK 
drivers are paying a fair price for fuel, the AA said.

In the past month, the average pump price of diesel has fallen 4.99p a litre, from 144.30p in mid May to 139.31 now.

But UK diesel costs at least 4p a litre more than in Europe.
