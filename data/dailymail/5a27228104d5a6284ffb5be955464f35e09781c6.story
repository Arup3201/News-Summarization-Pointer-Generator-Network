Flaw: Scientists have found a piece of DNA which puts men more at risk of heart attack

A heart attack gene has been discovered by scientists.

The flawed DNA, found in one in eight men, raises the odds of a patient with heart disease having a heart attack by 38 per cent.

It also raises the likelihood of them dying in the next six years by the same amount.

A small number of women – 2 to 3 per cent – are also affected by the rogue DNA.

In future, it might be possible to test heart disease patients for the gene and give them a treatment that will boost their odds of survival. US researcher Redford Williams said: ‘It is almost too good to be true.’

Dr Williams, of Duke University, in North Carolina, began by showing that people with the genetic flaw produce twice as much of the stress hormone cortisol when put under psychological pressure.

As cortisol is known to be bad for the cardiac health, he then tracked thousands of heart disease patients for six years. 

This revealed that those with the DNA that made them extra-sensitive to stress were also at higher risk of heart attacks, as well as dying from any cause over the course of the study. 

In those with heart disease, having the gene was as damaging as smoking or being obese. 

Heart attack genes have been discovered before.  But Dr Williams believes his is different because it is known how it raises the odds of problems. Plus, it should be possible to treat its effects.

For instance, if further research confirms the findings, heart disease patients could be given drugs that lower cortisol production, the journal PLoS ONE reports.

Hope: The research raises the prospect that heart disease risks could be combated in those with the faulty gene

Lead author Beverly Brummett, said: ‘The exciting part to me is that is genetic trait occurs in a significant proportion of people with heart disease. 

‘If we can replicate this and build on it, we might be able to find ways to reduce the cortisol reaction to stress – and reduce deaths from heart attack.’

 It is also possible that treating still-healthy carriers of the gene would prevent them from ever suffering a heart attack.

Scientists identified a defective gene in many of those monitored

It can lead to extra production of stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to bad cardiac health

The study was led by Dr Redford Williams of Duke University in the U.S.

It found that having the faulty gene was as bad as smoking or obesity
