A Texas man who served 25 years in jail for the killing of his wife is set to walk free, after new DNA evidence linked another man to the crime.

Michael Morton was sentenced to life in jail for beating his wife Christine to death in 1986, but has always maintained his innocence.

But prosecutors said Mr Morton is expected to have his conviction sensationally overturned after a quarter of a century, and is set for release on Tuesday afternoon.

Mr Morton was jailed in 1987 after being convicted of murder despite no evidence linking him directly to the crime and having no history of violence.

His wife was found dead at their home in Williamson County, Texas, having been beaten with a blunt wooden object which was never found.

Prosecutors at Morton's original murder trial claimed he had beaten his wife to death after becoming enraged when she wouldn't have sex with him following a dinner celebrating his 32nd birthday.

But tests performed this summer on a blood-stained, blue bandana found shortly after the crime near Morton's home revealed DNA from his wife and an unidentified man convicted in multiple states.

Authorities have withheld his identity amid ongoing investigations.

Nina Morrison, a senior staff attorney with the Innocence Project, which is representing Morton, said: 'We are relieved that his conviction is finally on the path to be overturned and hopeful that as of tomorrow night he will be out of custody and able to finally start rebuilding his life.

'This is a case that really should humble all of us about the fallibility of our justice system.'

For years, Morton's defense attorneys had tried to get DNA tests on the bloody bandana found near the scene, but the Innocence Project said Williamson County district attorney John Bradley had resisted turning it over until an appeals court ordered him to do so last year.

Bradley said tests in June revealed DNA from two people on the bandana: The victim and a man who was not her husband.

The DNA instead matched a man who had been in prison in California in 2010, and who was living in Central Texas but was not in custody on Monday afternoon, Bradley said.

Authorities were not naming the man, referring to him only as 'John Doe.'

Bradley said he had also been linked to the 1988 beating death of another woman killed after Christine Morton was found dead in her bed in Round Rock, just north of Austin.

He said that man had been tied to a hair found in the bed of the second woman in neighboring Travis County who died after Michael Morton had already begun to serve his sentence.

Attorneys for Morton said he may struggle to adapt to the modern world when he is released soon after 25 years in jail.

John Raley, Morton's Houston-based attorney, said: 'He's kind of going to be Rip Van Winkle.

'He's never held a cell phone. Reagan was president when he went in, so there's going to be a long adjustment.'
