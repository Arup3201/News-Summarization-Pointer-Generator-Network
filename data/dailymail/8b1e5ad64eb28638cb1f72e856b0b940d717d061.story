The Frenchman murdered alongside three members of a British-Iraqi family in the Alps had been involved in a 'bitter dispute' over a million pounds plus inheritance, it emerged today.

Sylvain Mollier, 45, was the lone cyclist whose dead body was found lying next to a BMW saloon close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France, on September 5th.

He was shot seven times, while the other victims were shot twice: Said Al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer from Claygate, Surrey, was killed inside the car with his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila, 74.

Now it has emerged that Mr Mollier was involved in family arguments caused by having a baby with a wealthy heiress sixteen years his junior.

Claire Schutz, the 29-year-old who shared a home with Mr Mollier, gave birth to Louis, their first child together, in June.

Just a few months before she gave birth, Claire was given a hugely lucrative business by her parents, making her a millionaire.

Court documents from October 2011 confirm the handover of the Schutz-Morange Pharmacy, in Grignon, near Annecy, which is valued at a minimum £1.1million.

The couple had been living together for around a year by this time and Claire would have been pregnant with Louis, yet she describes herself as a 'a spinster not signed up to a civil partnership'.

Despite this, Mr Mollier started to receive large amounts of cash from Claire — a development which did not go down well with her side of the family.

Just
 before his death, Mr Mollier had also won the legal right to take three
 years off from the factory where he worked to look after Louis, and his
 two teenage sons from his first marriage.

Mollier was riding a new £4,000 racing bike on the day he was murdered.

Ironically, Mollier was following a cycling route suggested to him by Thierry Schutz when he was killed, although police sources say he had deviated from that route into the forest lay-by.

'Sylvain's relationship with Claire was of growing concern to her side of the family and especially her parents,' said a senior figure on the Grignon local council, where Thierry Schutz served as a councillor for two years.

'Sylvain came from a down-to-earth family
 but had growing claims on Claire's fortune. This was something Claire's
 family was not happy about.

'They were particularly concerned 
about Sylvain's spending. There was a bitter dispute over what was going
 on and this got worse when Sylvain took three years off to effectively 
live off Claire's money.'

Speaking
 about the handover of the pharmacy, Mollier's brother Christophe told 
The Sunday Times: 'Sylvain had been through a difficult divorce and had a
 lot of financial commitments so naturally was very happy with the 
development. However, there were serious frictions between the Molliers 
and Claire Schutz's family.'

The Schutz family, who now refuse to speak about the murders, have been receiving advice from Pierre Morange, the brother of Genevieve Morange.

A political ally of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, he is the MP and town mayor for Chambourcy, near Paris.

Morange found himself drawn into another high-profile murder case five years ago when Christian Marichal, the chief of police in Chambourcy, was found stabbed to death at his home.

The murder came shortly after both men had been accused of corruption, allegations they both denied.

A year later, Morange, who said he feared for his life after Marichal's murder, was granted a special permit to carry a handgun. Mr Morange declined to comment on the latest killings.

Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor leading the investigation, confirmed he was aware of the tensions between the families, but added 'they were not something I particularly wanted to make public. The family is entitled to their private life.'

The Al-Hillis' two daughters survived the attack — the youngest, Zeena, 4, by hiding beneath her mother's body; the eldest, Zainab, 7, despite injuries from being shot in the shoulder and 'pistol whipped'.
