A call center due to open in the fall to tell the public about ObamaCare has been criticized for offering half of its employees part-time work, which will deny them the very benefits they have been hired to promote.

Staff and city officials in Contra Costa County have been left dismayed that the successful bid to run one of three Californian call centers has ended in employees being left without benefits.

More than 7,000 people applied for just 180 positions at the Concord call center, which is due to open on October 1. They believed most of the roles would be full-time and come with health insurance.

Dismay: While some Americans have objected to Obamacare, in Concord residents and officials welcomed the jobs they hoped it would create

However, according to the Contra Costa Times, half of the positions have now been made part time, meaning 90 employees, who are estimated to be paid $15 to $18 an hour, will face costs of between $600 and $2,900 a month for their healthcare.

Under Obamacare, companies with 50 or more employees are only required to offer coverage to full-time staff.

'It is very disappointing. I was under the impression these were going to be well-paying, well-compensated positions,' county supervisor Mary Piepho said.

'We were really hopeful these would be jobs meeting the unemployment needs in our county and offer them the ability to make a living and support their families,' she added.

The city had welcomed the chance to 
run one of the call centers, which will help people enroll in Obamacare,
believing it would generate jobs and better prospects, according to the New York Post.

Under the deal for setting up the center, the city had to agree to fund the operation itself.

Two
other centers, in Rancho Cordova and Fresno, are also being opened but 
the one in Concord is the only center to be contracted out to a county, 
according to Mercury News.

Concord officials have claimed that it was clear from the start that some positions would be part time but, according to the Contra Costa Times, a staff list and job advert listed nearly all the vacancies as full time.

Some employees, who asked not to be identified, claimed that they only found out they were being offered part-time positions after orientation and training. 

'What's really ironic is working for a call center and trying to help people get health care, but we can't afford it ourselves,' one employee said.

An employee claimed they were first told about the part-time hours after a training session on July 18.

'It reminded me of that George Clooney 
movie [Up In The Air] where he goes around the country firing people. The woman said, "I know you were led to believe you would be full 
time, but things have changed ... You are actually part-time 
intermittent".' the employee said.

The new recruits added that no clear reasons were given.

Another person said they had turned down another job offer to accept a role at the call center after receiving a letter in June, but have not been able to confirm their position since.

Contra Costa Deputy County Administrator Theresa Speiker said the hiring company had been clear about the types of positions available, and added that the part-time staff would be used to cover the extended hours.

Controversial: The Concord call center is being opened to help Californians enroll in President Obama's healthcare reforms

Opposition: The healthcare reforms, under which companies with 50 or more employees must offer cover to staff, have been criticized

For the first three months after it opens on October 1, the call center is due to be open for 72 hours a week. After that it is expected to drop to 59 hours.

'The battle for the call center was over jobs with good working wages and benefits; I never dreamed they would be part-time,' county supervisor Karen Mitchoff said. 

She added that several of her constituents had complained to her about the hiring process.
