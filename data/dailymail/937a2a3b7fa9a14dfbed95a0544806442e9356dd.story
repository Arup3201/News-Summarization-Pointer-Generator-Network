A Harry Potter-style rotunda, Willy Wonka glass lift and London's eye-catching skyscraper The Shard are on the shortlist for architecture's top prize.

The Riba Stirling Prize - whose nominees also include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, the London Aquatic Centre, the London School of Economics, and Manchester School of Art - is awarded annually to the best new building.

Judges praised the revolutionary design 
of the Library of Birmingham. With its 'Harry Potter rotunda' and 'Willy
 Wonka-style glass lift', it was described as a landmark that has 
'shaken the traditional perception of a library'.

The Library of Birmingham has been shortlisted for the prestigious award, with judges saying its design has 'shaken the traditional perception of a library'

The futuristic library was designed by Francine Hoube and officially opened last year - as well as lending, it houses the city's collection of archives, photography and rare books

Judges compared The Shard to the 'Gothic 
spire of a German cathedral' and said it was 'the most significant step 
forward on the London skyline since St Paul's'.

They said that making the tower, which is not yet fully occupied but houses a health clinic, offices, restaurants, hotel, apartments and public viewing gallery,Â on such a tight site was a 'rare achievement'.

'Understanding that there are many days when the London skyline reads only as a depressing grey silhouette, the architects have left a substantial part at the top open, adding further to the lightness even in these conditions, not unlike the Gothic spire of a German cathedral.'

Meanwhile, they said the Manchester School Of Art felt more as though you were 'entering a metropolitan art gallery rather
 than a university department' and would influence the design of art 
schools and other university buildings for years to come.

The London Aquatics Centre was highly praised - judges said removing the wings which had accommodated spectators during the Olympics, allowed the building to 'fly free'.

The Olympic Park's London Aquatics Centre also recieved high praise, with judges praising architect Zaha Hadid's building, which was inspired by the 'fluid geometry of water in motion', as very beautiful and 'conceptually flawless'.

Liverpool's Everyman Theatre was built on the site of the old theatre after it was deemed unsuited for productions and the audience in the 21st century. But the new build retains the ambience of an old building thanks to the use of recycled and exposed brick, judges said.

'After nine years' gestation, Liverpool has a brand new purpose-built theatre of outstanding quality. This is a building that will age gracefully, continually enriched by the patina of daily use. It will both reassure and delight its loyal audience and those discovering this gem for the first time.'

Also shortlisted is the London School of Economics Saw Swee Hock Student Centre - a 'startlingly original building', which is 'beautifully constructed' and a 'massive contribution to its townscape'.

Riba (Royal Institute Of British Architects) president Stephen Hodder said the shortlisted buildings were 'poetic'.

'The shortlist comprises no ordinary new swimming pool, office block, theatre, library or university - they are beautiful, inspiring and transformative new buildings that their communities can relish and be proud of,' he said. 'They are remarkably crafted buildings and, the closer you look at their detail, both internally and externally, and their materiality, the more impressive they become.'

The winner, picked by a team of judges, will be announced on October 16.
