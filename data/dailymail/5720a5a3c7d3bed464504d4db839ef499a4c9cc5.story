A leading French royal expert has accused Pippa Middleton of creating a 'false bottom' when she was bridesmaid of honour at the Royal Wedding.

The highly respected and influential Stephane Bern, 50, made the claim during a trip by Pippa, 30, to the vineyards of Bordeaux.

Mr Bern, who is Knight of the Order of 
Grimaldi in Monaco and an expert on etiquette, used his TV chat show to 
reveal the information.

Referring to Pippa's famous appearance in Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, when she was praised around the world for her shapely figure, Mr Bern said: 'But of course she had a false bottom.

Optical illusion? Pippa Middleton has been accused by a leading French royal expert of creating 'false bottom' when she was bridesmaid of honour at the Royal Wedding at Westminster Abbey (above)

Speculation: Mr Bern did not give details about the type of enhancement he believes Miss Middleton used, but it has previously been claimed she have worn padding of some form

'I repeat it: she had a false bottom. You take her away from that and she has normal buttocks.

'It was an optical illusion. She knew there were a billion people watching. It was the moment to show it.’

He did not give details about the type of enhancement he believes she used.

Pippa was a little-known socialite until her sister, Kate, made her bridesmaid at her wedding to Prince William.

Pippa wore a white Alexander McQueen dress and became an instant international star, with many saying that her bottom made her particularly special.

In her first public speech in February, Miss Middleton joked that the gown may have fitted 'a little too well' as she revealed how the dress had transformed her life.

'With a billion watching, it was the moment to show it': Stephane Bern 
was referring to Pippa's appearance in Westminster Abbey in April 2011 
when she was praised around the world for her shapely figure

Referring to the headlines about her 
figure-hugging dress, she joked: 'As I have found out, recognition has 
its upside, its downside and - you may say - its backside.'

Mr
 Bern, a personal friend of royalty all over Europe, made his comments 
on his own programme on the national France 2 channel on Monday.

The
 claims echo those made by a London spa owner weeks after the wedding 
who accused Miss Middleton of adding extra padding to her dress.

In
 a special episode for TV station TLC called Crazy About Pippa, Lesley 
Reynold Kahn said: 'I’m not convinced (her bottom in the wedding dress) 
is completely natural.

Complimentary: Pippa wore a white Alexander McQueen dress and became an instant international star, with many saying that her bottom made her particularly special

'Because I think if you look at other photos of her and you see her in jeans, she's got quite a flat bottom.

'But I think possibly for the day, for that gorgeous dress, she may have had some sort of pants that gave her a little bit of a lift, or even a little bit of padding.'

Pippa, a food columnist for Waitrose Kitchen magazine, travelled to south west France on Monday to visit the Médoc wine vineyards.

'Pippa loves her wine, and it’s fantastic that she’s come to visit the place where the best in France is produced,' said an industry source.

Analysed: Pippa at the Queen's Club tennis championships last year. A London spa owner once claimed that she normally has a flat bottom

Mr Bern offered no suggestion for what kind of 'false bottom' he thinks Miss Middleton may have used, but there are products available like these padded silk knickers which some use to enhance their buttocks

On Monday, she toured a series of 
country houses and their accompanying vineyards close to Bordeaux. 
Accompanied by colleagues, she dined at the Chateau Palmer estate in on 
Tuesday night. 

It is named
 after a British Army officer, Major General Palmer, who settled in 
Bordeaux in 1814. Pippa caused a stir during her last high-profile trip 
to France, in April 2012, when a friend she was travelling in a car with
 pointed a gun at a photographer.

Lawyer
 Romain Rabillard was pictured aiming what looked like a semi-automatic 
pistol as he drove his convertible Audi through Paris.

Others
 travelling in the car described the gun as a 'children's toy', claiming
 that the whole incident was a 'joke and a funny game'. Nobody was 
arrested in connection with the incident.
