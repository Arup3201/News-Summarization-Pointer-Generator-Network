Arsene Wenger would like to cure Arsenal's striker problem by bringing in PSG star Edinson Cavani.

The Gunners boss is a big fan of the Uruguayan and tried to sign him 18 months ago in January 2012.

French media reported on Friday that Olivier Giroud could be heading the other way in a £32million-plus-player, but Wenger's lack of striking options would see Giroud stay at the Emirates.

However, any deal is likely to hit a snagging point over the transfer fee.

Arsenal are unwilling to pay the French club's asking price, while Cavani's wages are also likely to price Arsenal out of a move.

Cavani plays on the right of a front three for PSG with Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a target man, although he is known to prefer a central starting role.
