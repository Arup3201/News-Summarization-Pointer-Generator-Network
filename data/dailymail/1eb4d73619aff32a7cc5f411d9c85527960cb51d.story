What a start to the season Glasgow Warriors have made. Four wins out of a possible four — including two bonus points — is better than Gregor Townsend could possibly have hoped for.

I was really interested to see how they would respond to making the Pro12 final last year because there was a chance they might have become complacent over the summer and thought they had cracked it.

What we have seen has been quite the opposite and proves what a strong club the Warriors have become both on and off the pitch.

Nearly 6,000 fans turned up at Scotstoun last Friday night to see them play Connacht (not the biggest draw in the league) which was great to see and proof that the public are buying into what the Warriors are doing.

It’s also been great to hear and see the reaction from opposition coaches, supporters and media to their performances so far this season.

All of them are saying what a quality side the Warriors are. They have earned respect from people who, not too long ago, had no respect for Scottish rugby at all.

This is especially true in Wales where they just didn’t take Glasgow seriously. That has totally changed now, not just because the Warriors have won back-to-back in South Wales already this season, but because of their consistent improvement over the last five years or so.

They have earned that respect the only way you can — by winning consistently and not just having the odd stand-out performance that wins you one-off games.

You also have to consider the number of injuries Glasgow have had to contend with to fully understand how good a start they have made. 

Ryan Grant, Jonny Gray and Sean Maitland haven’t played at all, while the likes of Al Kellock, Tom Ryder and Finn Russell were only involved for the first time last Friday.

Their impressive form has been the result of two things — good recruitment policy and good management of the players.

I’ve been very impressed with how Townsend has been able to make big changes almost every week with very little drop in performance levels and team spirit. There is a real togetherness in the squad which manifests itself on the pitch in the form of good rugby.

The strength in depth was highlighted when the Glasgow A team put 30 points on Edinburgh A last Monday and it must make Townsend’s selection meetings very tough indeed.

When his injured players are all back, Townsend might not know his best team. What he will be able to do, though, is pick the best team to play against whoever the opposition is because he has different styles of players in most positions.

One coach who would love that kind of luxury is Alan Solomons. He has real issues to deal with because I don’t think he is close to knowing what his best team is.

Like Glasgow, Edinburgh have had some injuries to deal with, especially to Dave Denton, Matt Scott and Grant Gilchrist, but there lies the gulf between the two Scottish sides.

Edinburgh have not got anywhere near the strength in depth of Glasgow and that was shown to devastating effect down at the Ospreys when they shipped 60 points. 

It was one of the worst performances I’ve seen for quite some time and took us back to a time when Scottish sides were laughing stocks in Wales.

There was a redemption of sorts with a draw against the Scarlets, but Edinburgh still have major issues and they have a tough trip to Ulster this coming Friday. 

I think Solomons needs to do the opposite of Townsend and pick a team that he believes is his best and stick with it. There have been so many new players coming in that they haven’t yet had the chance to gel together on the pitch.

Scotland has two clubs with very different problems to face. One has to find some form and a first team, while the other has become the team everyone wants to beat.
