Arsenal eased to a 2-0 away win over Manchester City on Sunday afternoon courtesy of goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud. 

NEIL ASHTON provides an assessment of each player at the Etihad Stadium.  

MANCHESTER CITY:

Joe Hart - Went the right way for Cazorla penalty, but it was struck hard and true. Appeared to have no chance with Giroud strike in second half. 6

Pablo Zabaleta - Poor in the first half, barely got forward into his customary attacking positions. 5.5 

Vincent Kompany - Could not believe he had conceded a penalty. Later booked for foul on Giroud. 5 

Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany  appeals to referee Mike Dean as he concedes a penalty

Martin Demichelis - Surrenders possession too easily when he is barely under pressure. Lost concentration. 5

Gael Clichy - Under pressure from Oxlade-Chamberlain, but combed through the Arsenal defence a couple of times. 6 

Fernandinho - Substituted and it was the right decision. Limited input, replaced by Lampard. 4 

Fernando - Could not keep pace with the constant running of Bellerin and Ramsey. Tough game for him in there. 4 

Jesus Navas - Swapped wings with Milner to try to get into the game, barely registered. 5

David Silva - The little magician flickered at times, but this was way short of his A game. 5.5

James Milner - Ineffective, couldn’t make an impression on the game. Substituted at half-time. 6 

Sergio Aguero - Is he fit? This was miles off from the hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League here. 4.5

SUBSTITUTES : 

Stevan Jovetic (for Jame Milner 46): Barely made a difference. 5

Frank Lampard (Fernandinho 63): Another body to City’s attack but he could not stop Arsenal. 6

Edin Dzeko (Jesus Navas 76): Too late to beat this stubborn Arsenal defence. 6

ARSENAL:

Ospina - A virtual spectator in the first half, excellent block from Navas at the start of the second. Some decent claims too. Arsenal’s first choice? 7 

Bellerin - Put a shift in at right back. It’s all beginning to come together for this Arsenal defence. 7 

Mertesacker - Organised, showed leadership qualities and put in a powerful performance at the back. Good on him. 7.5 

Koscielny - Ruffed by early booking, but settled in to the game. Decent clearances in each half. 7 

Arsenal defender Nacho Monreal is tracked by City winger Jesus Navas

Monreal -

In the end the game has to ask itself whether it wants honest pros or not. Mike Dean swallowed it. Other than that he was excellent. 7 

Ramsey - Missed a big chance to make it 2-0 in the second. Careless with possession too, unusual for him. 7 

Coquelin - Worked hard in the boiler room, sat in front of Arsenal back four to mop up everything. Played beyond his years. 7.5

Penalty scorer Carzloa is mobbed by the Arsenal player following his first-half penalty

Cazorla - Big penalty, hit with conviction. Lovely touches, battling qualities in the final third of the game. 7 

Oxlade-Chamberlain - Couple of lung-busting first half runs, but this game wasn’t quite for him. Replaced by Rosicky. 6

Olivier Giroud makes the game safe as he heads Arsenal's second of the game past keeper Joe Hart

Hart can only look on as Giroud's header bounces past the England keeper to double Arsenal's lead

Giroud - Towering performance, led the line brilliantly and and made City’s defence work hard. Brave header deflected wide, first chance of match. Deserved his goal. 8 

Sanchez - One decent chance in the second half, but this was one Arsenal performance where others shone. 6. 

SUBSTITUTES: 

Tomas Rosicky (Oxlade-Chamberlain 67): Added experience and game management to the team in the last 20 minutes. 7  

Kieran Gibbs (Alexis Sanchez 84): Useful addition to Arsenal’s defence for the final few minutes. 6

Mathieu Flamini (Aaron Ramsey): Cannot be happy with his new role as a substitute, but he will have to earn his place now. 7
