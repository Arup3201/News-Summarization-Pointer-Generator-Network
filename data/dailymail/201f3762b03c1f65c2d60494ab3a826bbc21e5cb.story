Vlogger-turned-author Zoella has reassured fans that she is not quitting YouTube

YouTube star Zoella has reassured fans that she is not quitting the video sharing site, despite the backlash over her debut novel.

The vlogger-turned-author, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, admitted over the weekend that she had 'help' writing  Girl Online.

The 24-year-old announced on Twitter yesterday that she was 'taking a few days out and off the internet because it's clouding up my brain'.

But her self-imposed moratorium did not last long.

Miss Sugg returned to Twitter hours later to say that she had no intention of leaving YouTube, where her video channel has won her more than six million subscribers and racked up some 300 million views.

She wrote: 'The stuff press write about it literally ridiculous! I am not quitting YouTube. Yet again, twisting stuff to gain views. Sad.'

Fans have leapt to support her.

'I am so sorry about everything happening right now zoe,' one replied, while another wrote: 'you do you Zoe, love you lots'.

Girl Online, about a teenage blogger and her relationship with an American musician, sold 78,109 copies in its first week - the highest first-week sales since Nielsen BookScan began collecting data in 1998.

Penguin has confirmed that Miss Sugg did not write the record-breaking novel on her own.

The firm said in a statement: 'As publishers our role is, and always has been, to find the very best talent and help them tell their story and connect them with readers.

'Talented YouTube entrepreneurs such as Zoe are brilliant at understanding and entertaining their audience.

Miss Sugg sent the above tweet to her followers after the back lash over her debut novel

'For her first novel, Girl Online, Zoe has worked with an expert editorial team to help her bring to life her characters and experiences in a heartwarming and compelling story.

'We are delighted that Girl Online is engaging so many young people with the pleasure of reading.

'We are proud to have been able to help Zoe tell her story and that the book is proving so successful in getting young people reading.'

Miss Sugg's ‘vlogs’, short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a ‘creative outlet’. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter.

Recently she was also invited by Sir Bob Geldof to be part of this year's Band Aid song alongside One Direction.

At the same time she announced she was taking 'a few days out' her boyfriend, fellow vlogger Alfie Deyes, announced he would also be taking a break as the couple have been so busy.

Miss Sugg's first novel was so popular that every bookseller broke the embargo in its sale, according to her publishers.

It hit number three on the Amazon bestsellers list before the book was even released.

The book's acknowledgements credit Siobhan Curham, an author, and Amy Alward, editorial director at Penguin, for being 'with me every step of the way'.
