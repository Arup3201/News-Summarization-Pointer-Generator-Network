A new app claims to be able to change the way we read - and instantly turn anyone into a speed reader.

It works by quickly flashing words onto the same part of a screen so the eyes do not need to refocus.

Its Us inventors claim anyone can reach speeds of 1000 words per minute using the app, and hopes to bring it to websites, phones and even watches.

Spritz's technology streams individual words inside of a special display called the "Redicle," which helps the eyes to position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word.

The most time-consuming part of reading is the eye movement from word to word, the firm says.

By applying their new method of word alignment that's based on the science of how people traditionally recognize words while reading, Spritz takes eye movement out of the equation, allowing much more to be read in the same amount of time.

Spritz has also developed proprietary algorithms to identify how long to display words and sentences.

Spritz's technology enhances reading on mobile and wearable devices by streaming individual words using the 'Optimal Recognition Point' (ORP) in a special display called the 'Redicle.'

This method makes communication faster, easier and more effective by removing the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading.

Developed and tested for over three years it enables the brain to focus on each word, promoting faster reading speeds and higher information retention rates.

Spritz is uniquely designed for small screens,' the firm says.

'The technology removes the inconvenience of scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices by streaming individual words, one by one, at the user's desired speed.'

The first use of Spritz will be implemented in an email application for the Samsung Gear 2 and Galaxy S5 smartphone.

Spritz is working with Samsung to develop the system for the firm's Gear 2 smartwatch, shown here running the software.

'We're reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,' said Co-Founder and CEO Frank Waldman.

'As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently.

'Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless.

'Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.'

For the past two years, Spritz has focused on development and testing of its technology for integration into mobile OS platforms, applications and webpages.

When you read normally, your brain is not only busy processing the words inside of your main vision, but also scans ahead for an indication of what is coming up.  Since your eyes do not need to move while spritzing, your brain quickly becomes comfortable with not needing the additional information.

Through testing users, it was found that new users were able to both learn how to spritz and to double their traditional reading speed within just a few minutes of starting.

In addition, it was determined that reading with Spritz also promotes increased comprehension of the material vs. traditional reading.

'When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,' said Dr. Maik Maurer, Co-Founder and CTO of Spritz.

'Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension.

'We're now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user's traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.'
