The family and friends of a mother missing for more than a week are appealing for her safe return, as search teams scour the area for clues.

Karen Johnson Swift, 44, was reported missing by her husband, who last saw her in their Dyersburg, Tennessee, home early on October 30.

The mother-of-four had just come home from a Halloween party with her daughter.

Her 2004 Nissan Murano was found about a quarter of a mile from the home with a flat tyre.

WMCTV reported over the weekend that searchers have found items believed to belong to Mrs Swift, including some clothing.

Dyer County Sheriff Jeff Box told the station that his office is waiting on DNA tests to confirm whether or not the items belong to her.

He told the Dyersburg State Gazette: 'We are searching for anything of interest. And we are still inspecting other potential evidence, which we have recovered.'

Friends of the woman have come forward, saying they suspect foul play because Mrs Swift would never voluntarily leave her family.

Carrie Engelhardt, a friend of Swift's, told FoxNews.com: 'It’s not in her nature. We’re really concerned and worried because it’s been over a week now.'

Her husband David, whom she was divorcing, told police he last saw his wife at home after she 
returned from the party to drop off their children.

Mr Swift said they spoke briefly 
before he went to bed, but he has not talked to reporters about his 
wife. She filed for divorce on October 11.

She has two sons in college and two daughters aged seven and nine. The youngest girl 'just cries' and will 'hardly eat' now, Mr Johnson told ABC.

Her cell phone is also missing. 
Police said it was last used at about 5am on Sunday when Mrs Swift 
accessed the internet on the device.

Cops are working with the phone 
company to pinpoint its last location. Her husband has not been 
named as a suspect in the case.

On Saturday, the sheriff's department arrested a neighbour who has been accused of poisoning two dogs, one of which belonged to the Swift family, in early October.

Clues? Authorities say they have found several items in their search, but cannot yet be sure whether they belong to Karen Swift

The suspect, 39-year-old John Hogshooter, was charged with animal cruelty in the case, according to the State Gazette.

The paper reported that Karen Swift had tried to speak to Hogshooter about her dog weeks before she disappeared, but he was not home.

The sheriff's office has not said whether or not he is suspected of being involved in Mrs Swift's disappearance.

The couple's 21-year-old son Preston said he has never seen them being violent towards each other, reported WPSD.

Other case: Mrs Swift's home is not far from where Holly Bobo was abducted

There are no signs of foul play and her disappearance is being treated as a missing persons case, Sheriff Box told KAIT.

Tennessee investigators are also doing a forensic analysis on the car of 5’5” Mrs Swift, who has 
blonde hair and green eyes.

In
addition, her home in Dyersburg is just 80 miles away from where 
21-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo was abducted in Darden in April.

Six
months after that disappeareance, her family are continuing their own 
searches and investigators are developing leads and working on the case 
daily.

But authorities can not yet be certain that the two cases are connected.
