Yaya Toure believes Manchester City will have to be wary of trying to 'run after the score' as they look to overturn a 2-1 Champions League last 16 aggregate deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday.

Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored twice in the first leg last month before Sergio Aguero gave City a ray of hope to take into the Nou Camp, but Toure admits his side must remain calm during the early stages.

Speaking to Nissan, the official automotive sponsor of the UEFA Champions League, Toure said: 'It is always difficult to play against Barcelona when you have to run after the score.

'But in football anything can happen, we have our chance and they have their chance as well and we will see on March 18.'

Despite the daunting task of having to beat Luis Enrique's side by two clear goals in order to qualify, Toure, who will be returning to action after a three game European suspension, insists that City have the players to pull off the feat. 

He added: 'We have got a few fantastic players at City and I think it is a 50-50 game because they won [the first leg] 2-1.'
