This playful young grey seal was pictured with a flipper raised in the air as it lay on rocks on the Isle of Man.

The shores of the island are set to become swamped with the seals over the coming weeks as this year's birthing season gets into full swing.

Britain is home to nearly half the world’s grey seal population - and the Isle of Man is one of their favourite places to rest and give birth.

Pleased to see you: This cute seal pup appeared to be waving to the camera when it was photographed on the Isle of Man. Pupping season is currently under way on the island

Cute: The pups keep their fluffy baby coats for around a month before developing waterproof adult versions

Babies: Pupping season typically runs between September and December, when pregnant females gather on the rocks surrounding the coast of the Isle of Man to give birth

Forty winks: It all seems to be too much like hard work for this seal pup, who decided to take a nap on the rocks

The seals have headed to the island for the annual birthing season this autumn and more than a dozen pups have already been born.

A large number of pregnant females lie 
on the rocks waiting to give birth - with this expected to be a 
bumper year for seal births.

Manx Wildlife Trust Marine Officer Eleanor Stone said: 'There must be something in the water.

'We’ve spotted at least 50 pregnant seals readying themselves to give birth on the Isle of Man coastline this year.'

The birthing season typically runs 
between September and December, when pregnant females gather on the 
rocks surrounding the coast to raise their young.

The pups are likely to stay on the island for up to a month while they grow strong enough to head out into the sea on their own.

Grey seals can reach up to 11 ft in length and weigh as much as 680 lb.

They live and breed in several colonies on and 
around the coasts of Britain and Ireland - including colonies in 
Lincolnshire, off the Northumberland Coast, Orkney and
North Rona off the north coast of Scotland.

During the winter months grey seals 
can often be spotted on rocks and islands just off the coast and 
sometimes come ashore to rest.

Pups born in the eastern Atlantic have soft silky white fur which they keep for about a month.

They eventually swap this for denser, waterproof adult fur, and enter the sea to learn to fish for themselves.
