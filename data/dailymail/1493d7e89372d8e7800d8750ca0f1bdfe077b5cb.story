In his 73 years behind the wheel, Dennis Garratt, who has just turned 100, has clocked well over a million miles without an accident or a traffic ticket.

The retired RAF veteran from Uppingham, Rutland, has no intention of taking his foot off the pedal and giving up his four wheels, still regularly using his red Renault Cleo to shuttle back and forth from the shops.

Mr Garratt first began driving in Italy during the Second World War aged 27 and is still enjoying being behind the wheel today.

Lifeline: Dennis Garratt has been driving for 73 years, first learning to drive in an army van in Italy during World War Two. He says those calling for pensioners to retire from driving are 'talking rubbish'

With years of driving experience he has criticised anyone who calls for pensioners to retire from the road, saying they were 'talking rubbish' because he, like many other OAPs, is still capable.

Mr Garratt explained: 'The trouble is the modern young man, they drive too fast, they like to show off. They are always in a hurry'.

He said: 'Young people are rude drivers and are not aware of their surroundings. They are the problem on the road, not pensioners.

'To me a car is a practical item, not an object to pose in... I am a confident driver and have still have quick reactions, to me driving is second nature,' Mr Garratt added.

Although technology has advanced in leaps and bounds since his first car, he still has fond memories of the MOD van he first learnt to drive in.

Mr Garratt says the trouble with driving today 'is the modern young man, they drive too fast, they like to show off. They are always in a hurry'. He thinks young people are rude drivers and not aware of their surroundings

The Driving and Vehicle Licencing Authority (DVLA) insists that all UK drivers apply to renew their license at the age of 70.

As part of the renewal process, drivers must declare any mental or physical condition that could impair their driving, although there is no legal requirement to sit a medical examination.

There is also no requirement for drivers to retake their practical driving examination.

The current law has led to concerns that elderly people could be continuing to drive despite being unfit to do so, and there have been calls to introduce a compulsory 'refresher' for those turning 70.

On the other hand, charities including Rica have come forward to voice their concerns about societal pressure causing pensioners to give up driving too early and risk losing their access to services and activities.

In September, the RAC announced that 
for the first time ever the number of UK driving license holders over 
the age of 70 had hit four million, with 191 of those over the age of 
100.

Mr Garratt's driving experience spans the world and in the 1960s he and his wife Margaret towed a caravan 12,000 miles across Europe, driving through Germany, Netherlands, France and Spain.

He said: 'I am an accomplished driver, having driven in various countries with different rules and regulations, I’ve had a lot of experience. I think having driven in different conditions, improves the way you drive and forces you to become more aware of the road and other users. I’ll know when it is time to stop driving.'With two replacement knees and a pacemaker, Mr Garratt admits that he does not expect to be driving by the time he turns 103.

The father of one doesn’t travel very far in his car anymore, using it only to travel to the supermarket and coffee shop to visit friends.

Mr Garrat’s red Renault Cleo is well know to residents in his hometown, with them all rushing to speak to him when they see him parking.

'I am well known to the local folk. They all can’t believe I’m still driving at the tender age of 100,' he joked.

Mr Garratt added: 'They all rush to help 
me load my groceries in the car and witness a 100 year old driving... I 
love still being able to drive and see my friends. The ladies are also 
impressed when I offer to give them a lift home when most other people 
my age have to rely on a taxi or bus.

'My car is pretty basic, it doesn’t have power steering, so I also get a bit of a workout when I drive it.'

Mr Garratt spent six years in the RAF and during the war served in Italy, North and sub-Saharan Africa and the middle East leaving as a squadron leader. He then worked in clothing manufacturing for 40 years.

He has lived in Uppingham in Rutland for 26 years and met his late wife Margaret when they were both teenagers.

There are 191 people allowed to drive on UK roads who, like Dennis Garratt (left), are aged 100 or over. He first learned to drive in a MoD van (right) during the Second World War, although his was a 1940s version

Sadly she died five years ago and Mr Garratt now lives alone but still has a busy social life, keeping active by using his car.

He hopes to hold his licence for longer than his son Colin, who is 73.

There are 191 people aged 100 or over who are still legally allowed to drive on UK roads, according to figures.

The RAC Foundation said the UK’s oldest licence holder was a 107 year old woman and the oldest man is 106.

Mr Garratt said: 'None of my friends drive or have cars anymore, so I wouldn’t see anyone if I didn’t drive. I would spend my days at home alone.'

He added: 'If I didn’t have a car, being able to lead a full life would be finished. It’s my lifeline.'
