A female adventurer has spoken out about sexism after she was turned down for a BBC show because of her gender.

Sophie Radcliffe, who has cycled from London to Paris in 24 hours, participated in Iron Man and completed the Three Peak Cycle Challenge, applied for a new show, World’s Toughest Army, but was rejected based on her sex.

Sophie, originally from Windsor and now living in Chamonix, applied for the show, which  specifies it is  looking for the 'toughest men in the country to tackle some of the hardest military courses in the world'.

However, according to The Telegraph, she received a reply explaining that in keeping with the selection criteria of the special forces, only men could apply.

The letter explained: ‘The idea is we want to keep it as "real" as possible and in the special forces we are featuring, women are not currently eligible unfortunately.'

On BBC's website, the show's blurb reads: 'Over days of intense physical and mental endurance, our candidates will attempt a uniquely constructed programme based on real techniques used by Special Forces from around the world.

'Bodies and brains will be stretched to the limit as staff sergeants from around the world push our hopefuls to the maximum of their capacity... and beyond.'

Sophie, who wants to inspire women to believe in themselves the way she does, told the paper how disappointed she was by the incident.

'TV programmes like this, make all our hard work to encourage women seem like a waste of time,' she said.

'Everybody knows men are strong. Everybody knows men can join the army. I feel women are going to watch programmes like this and think "the BBC says women can’t do this, so what’s the point?".'

Sophie speaks from authority. At the end of last year, she completed the world's first Alpine Coast to Coast in which she cycled 1669km and climbed 141km by foot.

She became interested in the show after hearing her army friends' tales and completing British Military Fitness training.

She added: 'I would love women to be given a chance to show the world and themselves what they are capable of. The BBC opening up opportunities for women to do that would encourage more of us to believe in ourselves and achieve across all areas of life: jobs, relationships and sport.'

A BBC Spokesperson said: 'This series applies the same selection criteria as the United Kingdom's SAS, but that does not necessarily rule out an all-female follow up series.' 

Sophie's story comes at the same time as recent research  that revealed women are failing to exercise for fear of being judged over their appearance and ability at the gym.

It found that across the UK two million fewer women than men take part in sport and regularly exercise. 

They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles.

The study has prompted a new campaign by Sport England to empower women, encouraging more to get active and improve their health.

The campaign, This Girl Can, encourages women to join local sports clubs, gyms, and exercise at home.
