A mother whose daughter suffered nappy burns had her children taken into care because social services wrongly thought she had scalded her deliberately.

Natalie Tung, 25, found three-year-old Adelle with injuries after her nappy burst and leaked water-absorbing crystals on to her legs.

She took her to hospital, but when doctors examined her, they called police and Miss Tung was arrested on suspicion of abusing the little girl by scalding her with hot water.

Reunited: Natalie Tung with her children Daniel and Adelle who were taken into care for eight months

Adelle and her six-year-old brother 
Daniel were taken into care while the false allegations were 
investigated, and pregnant Miss Tung was warned she could also lose her 
unborn son Kaiden, who is now six months old.

The nightmare only came to an end 
eight months later after an independent medical expert finally proved 
Adelle’s injuries were caused by a chemical burn from the crystals in 
the burst nappy.

The family have now been reunited, but Miss Tung believes her children are still affected by ‘the worst time in my whole life’.

The nightmare began in May last year 
when full-time mother Miss Tung woke to find Adelle’s nappy had burst, 
spilling chemical crystals on to her skin.

Natalie said she was told doctors were fearful of missing another case 'like Baby P'

Miss Tung treated the area with 
Sudocrem nappy rash cream, but when it had not healed days later, she 
took Adelle to Alder Hey children’s hospital.

Within hours, Miss Tung and partner Brendan Vevine, 23, were arrested. Adelle’s biological father was arrested the next day.

Miss Tung said: ‘They said they were trying to protect Adelle and did not want another Baby P case. It was heartbreaking.’

Miss Tung protested her innocence, 
claiming she had changed from Pampers nappies to a supermarket own-brand
which were prone to leaking and must have caused the painful burns.

But social services placed her 
children with their paternal grandmother, and Miss Tung’s contact with 
them was restricted under her bail conditions.

When the case came before Liverpool 
County Court, Catherine Raraty, a specialist in burns and plastic 
surgery at Alder Hey, said she believed the injury was ‘most probably a 
scald’.

However, Miss Tung secured a review 
and an independent expert, retired forensic burns consultant Colin 
Rayner, confirmed the injury was a ‘chemical burn’ due to the burst 
nappy.

In his report, he said the rash was a
reaction to ‘prolonged contact on a flat surface with a relatively weak
chemical . . . exacerbated by soakage due to a large amount of urine or
faeces’.

Miss Tung was released from her bail 
conditions last November and no charges were brought. She was finally 
allowed to take her children home in January.

She said: ‘We are trying to have some sort of normal life now but Daniel is still affected by it.’

A spokesman for Alder Hey children’s 
hospital said: ‘Patient safety is the number one priority and we have a 
legal obligation  to follow safeguarding policies and procedures.’

A spokesman for Liverpool social 
services said: ‘When concerns are raised by clinicians, we have to carry
out a full and detailed investigation.’
