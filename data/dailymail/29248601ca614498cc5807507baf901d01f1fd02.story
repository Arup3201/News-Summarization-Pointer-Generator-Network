A former staffer for a high-profile congressional candidate claims he was fired for complaining about the politician's aggressive sexual behavior.

Todd Bosnich said he last year joined the campaign for former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, an openly gay Republican, who has won acclaim for representing a new generation of American politics.

However, it wasn't long before DeMaio started making unwanted advances toward his campaign policy director, Bosnich claims, including allegedly masturbating in front of him.

Bosnich also said he was offered a $50,000 bribe to but didn't accept it, CNN reported.

Allegations: Republican congressional candidate Carl DeMaio has been accused of displaying aggressive sexual behavior toward former campaign director Todd Bosnich

Claims: Todd Bosnich, a former campaign director for Carl DeMaio, claims the politician masturbated in front of him and touched and kissed him inappropriately 

The alleged harassment started after some work drinks, when DeMaio was driving Bosnich back to his car.

Bosnich claims DeMaio grabbed his crotch when they pulled up.

What followed was a series of innapropriate behavior, Bosnich said, including kissing on the neck and groping.

That behavior culminated in April with Bosnich arrived at work earlier and was called into DeMaio's office.

'I came over to his office, door was open,' Bosnich told CNN.

'And he was masturbating," Bosnich said.

'I saw his hand, his penis in his hand and he had a smile on his face.

'And as soon as I came over he was looking at me.'

Bosnich said he confronted DeMaio about the masturbation a few weeks later.

'It was the very next day, in the morning, that the campaign manager called me into his office and said that Carl lost his trust in me and that he'd terminated me,' Bosnich said.

'He offered me a position in the county Republican Party and also told me to sign a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for $50,000.'

Bosnich said he felt like DeMaio was trying to his silence and didn't accept the money.

However DeMaio said the claims were 'outrageous'.

He told CNN that Bosnich was fired for plagiarism and, days after his termination, broke into the campaign office and damaged computers and phone lines.

DeMaio said the San Diego police department were invesitgating the break-in.

This is not the first time sexual harassment complaint to have been leveled against DeMaio.

Ben Hueso, a fellow city coucilman, said last year that he twice caught Demaio masturbating in a city hall restroom in 2009.

The restroom was only accessible by city officials.

Hueso did not report the incident.
