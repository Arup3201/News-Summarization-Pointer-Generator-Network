Two MPs nearly came to blows in the Commons in a row over a 'bitch' jibe aimed at Employment Minister Esther McVey.

Tory Andrew Griffiths, 44, and Labour's Ronnie Campbell, 71, squared up to each other – with Mr Campbell challenging Mr Griffiths to 'get outside'.

The row came after Tory Ms McVey was targeted by Labour over her role in welfare cuts. 

She accused Labour's John McDonnell of having asked people in her Merseyside constituency to 'lynch the bitch'.

As Labour MPs mocked Ms McVey, Mr Griffiths demanded that Mr Campbell stop laughing at her. 

Then they left their seats and confronted each other, resulting in Serjeant-at-Arms Lawrence Ward, the sword-carrying official in charge of Commons security, ordering them to leave the chamber. 

They continued their feud in the Members' Lobby before going their separate ways.

Last night Mr Campbell said: 'He [Griffiths] was shouting at me and pointing. I told him to get outside and we had a bit of an altercation. He said, 'Go on, hit me, I'll call the police and have you in court'.'

Mr Griffiths said: 'It was handbags. I was defending Esther's honour. I am gentleman.'

The row was sparked after Speaker John Bercow had taunted Ms McVey during a debate, saying she sounded like 'a washing machine that does not stop'.
