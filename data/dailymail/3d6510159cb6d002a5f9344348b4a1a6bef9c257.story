When Daly River Mango Farm owner Margaret Ray arrived to work on Tuesday, she wasn't expecting to be greeted by a mammoth saltwater crocodile.

The 4.7 metre animal, which was caught in a trap near the boathouse of the farm, had been attacking local dogs and menacing the community.

Ms Ray called the crocodile catchers at the Parks and Wildlife Commission, who escorted the colossal croc out of harms way.

Northern Territory croc-catcher Tommy Nichols, who has been working with salt water crocodiles for over 32 years, told Daily Mail Australia it was among the largest he had ever come across.

‘It was certainly up there. It was almost five metres, even with 25 cm of it’s tail missing. We didn't get a chance to weigh it, but it would have been easily over 500kg,’ Mr Nichols said. 

Daly River, which is about bout 240 kilometres south-west of Darwin, is a popular recreational fishing area that is also inhabited by a vast number of crocodiles.

‘It’s a high density area. There have been a number of fatalities there in recent years. The local police set up traps because it’s wet season and the flooding brings them in.’

The Parks and Wildlife team tied the animals jaws up, gave it some sedatives and drove it to a crocodile farm in Darwin.

Parks and Wildlife received a call from local police, who were told the trap had been sprung by workers in the Daly River Mango Farm.

‘They said they had found a big one, and the cage was sitting quite low in the water, but I was still surprised when we towed it up,' he said.

'He was enormous, and he had no scars on his body, which shows he was a dominant male. The crocodile had been taking dogs and posing a threat to the community, so we needed to take care of him as soon as possible.’

Mr Nichols advised locals to only swim in designated areas, and to camp at least 50 metres from the water

The team tied the animals jaws up, gave it some sedatives and drove it to a crocodile farm in Darwin.

‘This is the worst time of year for crocs. I advise you to only go swimming in designated areas, don’t stand too close to the water and always camp at least 50 metres from the water.’

Mr Nichols also recommended keeping a torch at hand when camping, since the light will flash brightly on the animals eyes and allow you to spot them in the dark.
