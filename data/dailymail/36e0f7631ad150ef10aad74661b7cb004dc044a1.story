John Carver admits he is aware of interest in striker Ayoze Perez from Premier League champions Manchester City – but believes he should remain at Newcastle beyond this season.

The Magpies paid just £1.6million for the Spain Under-21 starlet last summer. He is now rated in the £15m bracket and City have spoken to Carver about the former Tenerife frontman, who they also tracked before his move to Tyneside.

But it was Newcastle who moved fastest to secure his signature in June, also beating off competition from the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Carver concedes they had anticipated Perez would spend the majority of the season with Peter Beardsley’s development squad.

On Sunday, however, he will lead the line at Everton as United begin the first of seven matches without top goalscorer Papiss Cisse, banned for his part in the shameful spitting incident with Manchester United’s Jonny Evans.

But Carver is confident five-goal Perez can carry the scoring burden in Cisse’s absence and says he is not surprised by admiring eyes being cast from the Etihad.

‘I know for a fact there is interest in him,’ said Carver. ‘You go in coaches’ rooms after games and have a chat. A few people have spoken very highly of him, which is good. I had a good chat with Brian Kidd at Man City about him. ‘I’m not surprised by that. He’s a young lad and an exciting talent.

‘When we signed him we thought he would have a full season in the under-21 team developing. But he was thrown in at the deep end and he dealt with it.’ Perez was named Tenerife Sportsman of the Year this week having also collected best breakthrough player in Spain following his 16 goals in their second tier last term. But the frontman – who is being touted for a call-up to the senior Spain squad – is not concerned about the fuss surrounding his future.

‘It would be a mistake to start thinking about that now, it is too early. I’ve only been at Newcastle a few months and I am very happy. I continue to work as usual and I am in no rush,’ he said.

‘I just think about helping the team and returning all the trust they have put in me. Everything else? If you keep working hard, sooner or later it will end up coming.’ Carver agrees. ‘I think it is best he stays here, absolutely,’ said the head coach.

‘He’s made the next step in his career and this is a fantastic place to continue that development.

‘I took him out of the firing line recently and I thought it was right to do so. ‘It has helped him having a bit of a break. There was an awful lot of pressure on this young lad coming from Tenerife and being thrown into our cauldron, as we know it is. ‘But I thought he dealt with it well and it's part of my job to deal with him and make sure he doesn't disappear into the wilderness.’
