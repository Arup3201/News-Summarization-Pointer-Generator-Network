Still smiling? An upstate New York school board president will soon be asked to step down after he was caught calling a parent 'chubby wubby' on an open mic last night during a board meeting

Parents of school children in a tiny New York State town are calling for the resignation of a school board president after he described one parent as a fat 'chubby wubby' on an open mike.

The remark by Ray Cote, who's led the board since 2011, was made during a Mahopac school board meeting last month. It was videotaped and broadcast on a local cable access station and live-streamed via the Internet.

Now parents plan to call for Cote's resignation at a board meeting Tuesday night, whether he apologizes or not.

'It 
totally tells us the he cares nothing for the community that he says he 
upholds. Nothing,' Deena Bell, who has two high schoolers in the 
district, told WABC.

The
 Journal News says Cote is a member of a diversity and sensitivity initiative
 created in March following racist tweets posted by some Mahopac 
students during a basketball game.

Former school board member John Molloy has already taken steps to try and unseat Cote.

As it happens: Ray Cote, pictured sitting at top in the center of the dais, was aired live and streamed online as he made the comment during the April meeting. He's been school board president since he was elected in 2011

Officials refused to ID the mother he targeted, at left, however they did say she'd been volunteering on the school board for a decade. President Cote, right, had yet to comment on the debacle by Tuesday evening.

'I've
 contacted the State Education department,' said Molloy. 'We're filing a
 formal complaint. I'm waiting to take their lead but we'll file a 
formal complaint and ask to have him removed.'

Cote's full comment in reference to the mother of six and 10-year school board volunteer was:

'A chubby wubby, she keeps getting fatter at every meeting, she really does.'

The school didn't respond to requests seeking comment.

WABC-TV says Cote was in a meeting Monday and unavailable for comment.

'He doesn't care about the community': Mahopac parents Deena Bell (left), who first posted the footage online, and Roger Garcia, right, are both supporting Cote's removal as school board president

Taking steps: 'I've contacted the State Education department,' said former school board member John Molloy. 'We're filing a formal complaint. I'm waiting to take their lead but we'll file a formal complaint and ask to have him removed'
