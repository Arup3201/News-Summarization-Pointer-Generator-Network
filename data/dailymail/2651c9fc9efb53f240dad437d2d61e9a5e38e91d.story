It is the key sign of American presidency and power.

And it's fair to say, some pretty important pre-conference deliberations have taken place on board high above the clouds.

Air Force One is the aircraft that transports Barack Obama to meetings throughout the world, and the highly-customised Boeing 747-200B has even been enjoyed by British Prime Minister David Cameron.

With 4,000 sq ft of floor space over three levels, it certainly doesn't lack n space, and includes an extensive suite for the president with a large office, lavatory, and a conference room.

But it's not just the space and facilities that make the plane so ideal, it is also stacked with the latest safety equipment. 

According to White House information the onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse - such as a nuclear explosion - and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a 'mobile command centre'.

The plane can reach speeds up to 620 miles per hour, 40 miles per hour faster than their commercial counterparts. And, according to Business Insider, there are also mirror ball missile deflectors embedded in the wings of the plane should the aircraft come under attack. 

Interestingly, there are two identical planes used by the President and they are referred to as SAM 28000 and SAM 29000 when they are flying without the President on board.

The cost an estimated $330million each when bought in the early 1990s for the first President Bush. 

There is no chance the leader of the free world will go hungry on board - the plane also has two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time.

Although the plane is popularly known as Air Force One, this is technically the call sign of any Air Force aircraft carrying the President.

Capable of refuelling midair - as seen in the Harrison Ford film, Air Force One - the Boeing 747-200B aircrafts have unlimited range and don't need to land for days at a time.

The planes are a powerful symbol of American power and a presidential aircraft was first used by President Kennedy. 

The US military has recently chosen a new Boeing model to replace its current fleet of Air Force One presidential aircrafts. The new Air Force One planes will be Boeing's commercial 747-8 airliner, replacing the old Boeing 747-200Bs.

The Pentagon had considered the A380 made by European aerospace giant Airbus, but opted for home-grown talent.

There appear to be plenty of meeting rooms on board so that business can continue as usual despite travelling at 35,000ft

The jet can cater for 100 people, whether they want to relax back with snacks and a drink, or perhaps a more formal meal

'The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that) when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission,' said Air Force secretary Deborah James in a statement.

Boeing welcomed the Air Force's decision to skip a competition and opt for the 747-8, citing its 50-year history of building presidential aircraft.

The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs. It said it planned to purchase enough of the technical baseline to permit competition for maintenance during the plane's planned 30-year life.

James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable.

The president's plane has long been a symbol of American power and the setting for historic moments, including the somber 1963 ceremony when Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office on board -- hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

The plane is equipped with the latest in communications and security systems, and is capable of functioning as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US

The plane is often portrayed in Hollywood films and inspired a 1997 thriller titled 'Air Force One' in which the US president, played by Harrison Ford, fought off hijackers.

Outfitted with secure communications equipment and other gear, Air Force One is designed to serve as a 'mobile command center' and served that role briefly after the attacks of September 11, 2001.

It also features a suite for the commander-in-chief that includes a large office, a conference room as well as a medical area that can function as an operating room.

The body of the plane is said to be able to withstand a nuclear blast from the ground and has a number of emergency exits

The plane's galley can feed up to 100 people and there are additional quarters for senior aides, Secret Service agents and other staff.

Air Force One is technically the radio call sign adopted by any aircraft with the president on board but it has become identified with certain planes reserved for the president's air travel.
