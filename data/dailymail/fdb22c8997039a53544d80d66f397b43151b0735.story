Millions of households are missing out on the £50 cut to their energy bills promised by David Cameron because their supplier has not passed it on.

Four of the Big Six power firms have failed to pass on the full  saving from the reduction in green levies announced last year, latest figures show.

E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power have offered 3.7million of their customers just £12 off. However,  British Gas and SSE gave their  customers the full saving.

Critics said the failure to pass on the 
full sum hands a £140million windfall to the energy giants, which had 
fought hard for a drop in green levies.

Last year, Mr Cameron promised he would ‘roll back’ the toll of the taxes which pay to insulate homes.

In February, after the deal was sealed, he told the Commons: ‘It is on this side of the House that we have delivered the £50 off bills by rolling back the cost of the green levies.’

But E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power did not pass this on to customers on fixed price deals, insisting these households were protected from Christmas price hikes.

E.ON and Scottish Power each have a million who received £12, EDF has 1.2million and npower has 500,000.

Labour, which carried out the analysis, said a one-off rebate affects everyone equally and should have been offered across the board.

A spokesman for uswitch, the price comparison website, said suppliers ‘lobbied hard’ for relief from green policies which make up £112 of the average annual energy bill.

‘They made a big point that this is why they had to hike  up prices last year,’ he said. ‘All customers are hit equally by the green levies, and if there is a reduction, there is no reason fixed rate customers should miss out. Those customers should vote with their feet and switch.’

Electricity suppliers were offered a cut to the cost of the Energy Company Obligation, an insulation scheme, by slowing down its progress, shaving £30 to £35 off bills.

Caroline Flint MP, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'The companies were meant to cut everyone¿s bills in return for changes to green levies'

Another £12 was cut from the Warm Front Scheme, which helps pensioners, and will now be funded by general taxation.

The suppliers also promised to reduce network costs to fund a one-off reduction of £5.

British Gas said it would pass a £53 cut to all customers in January. SSE followed suit with a £50 cut in March.

Last autumn, the Big Six were heavily criticised after again pushing up prices well above inflation.

Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘The companies were meant to cut everyone’s bills in return for changes to green levies.

‘Instead, they have been allowed to pocket the savings and millions won’t see the benefit. Yet again David Cameron has let the energy companies off the hook.’

An npower spokesman said all dual fuel customers whose bills rose in December received the full £50 cut.

EDF said that it had raised prices by only 3.9 per cent, which will have saved customers money.

Scottish Power said customers on most tariffs got £54 off.

E.ON said most of its customers were given the full saving.
