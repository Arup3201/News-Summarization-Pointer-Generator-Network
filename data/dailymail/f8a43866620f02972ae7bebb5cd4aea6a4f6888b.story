A federal prison guard allegedly had an affair with an inmate convicted in one of New York's most notorious police killings and became pregnant with his child in an attempt to save him from the death penalty.

Nancy Gonzalez, 29, was arrested Tuesday on charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, according to court papers.

Wilson was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry.

Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope'

‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers.

Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court.

A new jury must decide his fate. But replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty because he is mentally disabled.

On Tuesday, Gonzales, who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island home, New York Daily News reported. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted.

According to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants.

According to one inmate, he witnessed the 29-year-old female guard moving away from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down.

Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer

The complaint made public Tuesday and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen.

The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison.

Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope.

'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?'

It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection.

'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.'

Insanity claim: Wilson's defense attorney argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped

Wilson was found guilty in December 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island.

The following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954.

However, an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to be a villain. 

Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.
