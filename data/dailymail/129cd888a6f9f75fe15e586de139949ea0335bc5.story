An Iowa businessman posed as a homeless person Christmas Eve and gave money to people who handed him donations on the side of a snowy road.

Jonnie Wright stood on a bitterly cold street corner in the Des Moines suburb of Johnston handing sealed envelopes to people who gave him money. He handed out roughly $1,000 dollars in the 50 envelopes he gave away.

The envelopes were stuffed with a letter and either a $10 or $100 bill, according to pictures posted on his Facebook page. He told KCCI he did the giveaway because it was on his bucket list.

Not as he seemed: Jonnie Wright handed envelopes containing $10 or $100 bills to people who donated money to him while he was dressed as a homeless beggar

The letter inside the envelopes surprised Des Moines resident Rob Taylor when he finally opened it.It said that the ‘bum’ he just handed money wasn’t homeless, and was a successful business man giving back to people who do good.

‘I thought this was also a way to acknowledge those who give, who do so anonymously,’ Mr Wright told the station.

Mr Taylor was in shock.

‘I was blown away,’ he recalled. ‘The first thing that I did was call my wife on the phone and I could hardly talk to her on the phone. I said, 'You wouldn't believe what just happened to me.’

Joyous scene: This is the ice cold street corner Mr Wright stood on for over an hour

Twice as nice: Mr Wright then took what he was given, doubled it, and donated that sum to the Bethel Mission homeless shelter

Mr Taylor said it reminded him about the meaning of Christmas, that ‘it wasn't about gifts, it's about giving back.’

Mr Wright then took the money he was given, doubled it and gave it to Bethel Mission, a local homeless shelter.

He then told KCCI he had been planning to do this for a long time. The successful man earned his money as CEO of The Buyosphere, a sales consulting firm he founded.

‘This has been a bucket-list thing for me for some time,’ Mr Wright explained. ‘I always knew I wanted to give back.’
