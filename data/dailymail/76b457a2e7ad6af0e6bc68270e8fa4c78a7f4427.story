Notts County striker Kwame Thomas was sent off in his team's goalless draw at Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night - for walking off the pitch too slowly.

Thomas, who is on loan from Derby County, was being replaced by Billy Daniels in the 87th minute at the Keepmoat Stadium but took his time leaving the field.

It was not initially clear that referee Richard Clark had issued Thomas a second yellow card, leading to confusion on the touchline.

Notts County manager Shaun Derry was sent to the stands for protesting after Thomas was dismissed

Daniels had already taken the field and had to be recalled to the bench and, in the subsequent arguments, County manager Shaun Derry was sent to the stands for protesting.

The 10-men visitors then had to withstand a late Doncaster onslaught but held on for a point against their fellow League One play-off contenders.

Derry's assistant Greg Abbott afterwards condemned the farcical end to the game, saying: 'I've never seen a sending-off like that.

The decision led to confusion and confrontation on the touchline at the Keepmoat Stadium 

Derry argues with the fourth official after the farcical decision to send Thomas off

'We couldn't put the sub on because you can't do that for somebody who has been sent off. The game could have done without it because it got a bit messy after that.'

It appeared the official had forgotten he had already booked Thomas and Abbott had some sympathy. 

'I think, to be fair, in defence of the referee, if he'd have realised it was his second one he would have rushed over and ushered him off without doing the card.'

It was only Thomas's second appearance for the Magpies, having joined on loan from Derby last week.
