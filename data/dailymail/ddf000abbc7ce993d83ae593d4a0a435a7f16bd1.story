Victoria Knowles' self-published book The PA uses pseudonyms to lift the lid on the huge egos in the City

A trusted PA has sparked unease among City workers with her exposé off sordid affairs and 'manipulative' egos which she says exist in the iconic Square Mile.

Victoria Knowles' self-published book The PA uses pseudonyms to lift the lid on the huge egos, alleged romances and ungentlemanly behaviour which she says routinely goes on at some of the world's biggest firms.

The writer - who worked as a extra in soaps such as Brookside and Hollyoaks before her PA career - has used her time working in three City firms to inspire her tell-all book.

She has been employed at construction
 company Sir Robert McAlpine, corporate communications firm DF King 
Worldwide and the now defunct M: Communications, a public relations 
consultancy.

Ms Knowles, 38, told The Times: 'I can't speak for everybody - I've got to go on what I've experienced. Everything I have put in there is true.'

The
 book has set tongues wagging in the City, with whispers circulating 
about which real-life characters are behind the pseudonyms.

In
 the book which is available to download for £3.99, Ms Knowles criticises several of her bosses, calling some 
'shouters and throwers', while describing others as those who prefer to 
play 'manipulative mind games'.

Two of the most notable characters 
are her two former bosses 'Rich' and 'Dick' - one of whom she said is 
the 'biggest game player and most insincere person' she had ever met.

In the book, Ms Knowles also accuses one of her managers of watching hardcore porn while pleasuring himself at his desk.

She says another was spotted on an 
empty office floor in a 'very compromising position' with a fellow 
colleague along with 'his tongue down her throat and his hand up her 
skirt'.

While it has caused
 excitement for some, the book has caused concern, particularly among 
those who fear they could be implicated.

One former colleague told The Times it was so 'off-the-wall' that it was completely made-up.

But
 Ms Knowles defended the book, saying it was completely true and that it
 had been meant as a tool for other PAs or anyone that has been bullied 
in school.
