Tips: Géraldine Lepère teaches British ladies how to be a French mademoiselle

With their reputation for being perfectly preened, primped and poised at all times, it’s no wonder French women tend to intimidate the British.

But according to one, the Gallic approach to life can be learned – just as long as you’re not too bothered about being punctual.

Géraldine Lepère is determined to dispel the myth that Frenchwomen are perfect and to teach British expatriates how to avoid embarrassment in social situations across the Channel.

She has written a book called Comme 
une Française – Like a Frenchwoman – which was inspired by her own 
experiences of struggling to fit in during two years living and working 
in Leeds.

Miss Lepère 
realised that many Brits are daunted by the formidable reputation of 
the French, especially after a torrent of publications – with titles 
such as French Women Don’t Get Fat and French Children Don’t Throw Food –
telling them how their continental counterparts do things better.

But Miss Lepère, 27, from Grenoble, 
said: ‘Our reputation is such that [British women] get the impression 
they’re doing it all wrong.

‘We daunt them, so I break down the clichés and explain without taboos our codes – ones we don’t even know we have.’

Arriving on time for dinner in France, for example, is a cardinal sin.

‘You British are so punctual, but in France if you arrive bang on time you are likely to be met by someone without make-up and an uncooked dinner,’ Miss Lepère warned. She said she always tells her foreign friends to be 15 to 20 minutes late, but no more as this would be ‘impolite’.

The non-initiated should also brush up on current affairs as the French love to debate, she added.

British
women – and those from America – are also advised to learn to take 
compliments in their stride, and make sure they do not interpret them as
a come-on or even as sexual harassment.

‘How many foreign married women are 
thunderstruck to hear their French friend’s husband tell them “You look 
ravishing this evening”?’ she asked. ‘We ﬂirt all the time.

‘If
a man in the street tells you “You are very pretty mademoiselle”, this 
doesn’t mean he wants to sleep with you, it just means he thinks you are
attractive so he tells you.

‘My advice is say “Thank you”, take it as a free pick-me-up, like a sunny day.’

Miss Lepère found said she found people to be very ‘warm and open’ during her time in Britain – but admitted she was perplexed by conversations that revolved around TV and popular culture, and shocked to see colleagues go out wearing miniskirts in subzero temperatures and drink her under the table.

She found she only began to understand British culture when she began to join her colleagues on their Friday lunchtime pub outings.

Realising many of the women among the 150,000 British expatriates in France must be going through similar issues, she decided to write her book and launch an online course.

She admitted French women do have high standards, but added: ‘If you start going toward them, you’ll find they love foreign culture and the British have a very good reputation in France.’

Mais non: In France, wine always accompanies a meal, so do not serve wine otherwise - and avoid the cardinal sin of bringing bad wine to a party
