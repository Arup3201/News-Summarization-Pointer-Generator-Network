A 28-year-old blonde woman from Maryland is creating a stir on YouTube with her  videos that can create strange sensations for viewers.

Maria, as she is known, has been making her soft and sensual videos for three years and has accumulated hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Perhaps more surprisingly, she isn't even providing viewers with any useful information - all she does is smile sweetly and whispers sweet nothings.

Doctors say her videos are an example of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) which results in a distinct, pleasurable tingling in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual or audio stimuli.

Despite the complex-sounding official term ASMR, reactions to her videos are are split with some falling into mesmerized state as they hang on each and every word of her soft-spoken subtle tones.

Others have reported becoming fast-irritated at her 'torturous gentle whispers.'

The videos play upon the brains' senses using clever, but simple audio and visual techniques.

Maria, who was born in Russia will often speak to her viewers in her native tongue.

She addresses viewers and listeners wearing headphones to specific ears by using stereo microphones which make her appear as though she is switching sides.

Props are then brought out which continue to create sounds that some say they find wildly addictive. 

Love her or hate her? Maria's voice and movements hold a certain magic: They can instill tranquility and even overcome insomnia 

Feeling good: ASMR is widely described as a pleasurable tingling that begins in the head and scalp, shimmies down the spine and relaxes the entire body

Scientists say the videos induce a physical sensation known as autonomous sensory meridian response which feels good.

It is a phenomenon characterized as a distinct, pleasurable tingling in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or cognitive stimuli. 

However,The nature and classification of the ASMR phenomenon is controversial. Although there is strong anecdotal evidence to support the phenomenon, there is also little or no scientific explanation or verified data.

Whether it be tapping her fingernails on the wooden handle of a hairbrush or pretending to dust your face by using one of her makeup brushes, Maria appears to be enticing viewers to experience something known as autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR).

Speaking to the Washington Post, Maria says that listening to her will 'flood your body with warm tingles' and feels like 'sand being poured all over you' or 'goosebumps on the brain.' 

Once someone has tuned in to hear her, the sensations can become addictive.

Maria says that ASMR helped her through depression and she believes that her videos can help others feel better too.

Maria credits whispering videos to her own continued good mental health.

The videos appear to illicit a love-it or hate-it response depending on people's tolerance levels. 

Some have said that her videos have been transformative. 

One commentator spoke of how his insomnia was cured after listening to Maria, whilst others were moved to tears.
