A senior teacher who had  sex with a 16-year-old pupil has been jailed.

Janette Kilner, 33, pursued a relationship with the pupil, who is described as ‘bright’, after he gave her a bracelet as a Christmas gift.

In her position as her school’s deputy head of drama, she arranged for him to have extra tuition after classes and at weekends before exchanging explicit text messages and emails.

Kilner then cavorted with the boy in  her car and took him back to her home for unprotected sex.

During
 this period she was also using the internet to meet women and men for 
night-time trysts in their vehicles in car parks – a practice known as 
dogging.

Snaresbrook 
Crown Court in East London heard that at the time of the boy giving her 
the gift Kilner was going  through a difficult time. She had broken up 
with a boyfriend and her father was terminally ill.

She started spending more time with the pupil, who was studying for his GCSEs, after being flattered by his attention.

Prosecutor Gary Pons said Kilner taught the boy during his final year at St Thomas the Apostle College in Nunhead, South London.

‘It
 was during 2013 that their relationship developed beyond a 
teacher-pupil relationship and it did so gradually,’ he said. ‘First, it
 was with him among other children on a Saturday when they began to talk
 to each other and they became more and more personal.

‘They
 exchanged private email addresses and phone numbers in and around June 
2013 and they began sending each other text messages clearly sexual in 
nature. She made arrangements to pick him up and it was improper 
behaviour during these car journeys.

‘Matters
 progressed to kissing as they would drive around the neighbourhood. On 
July 10 the defendant picked up the victim by a park and drove him to 
her house where they began to kiss.’

Mr
 Pons said Kilner began removing his clothes as they watched television.
 ‘She wanted him to go upstairs and he at first said no but eventually 
they do go upstairs and have full intercourse,’ he added.

Mr
 Pons said they had unprotected sex and that Kilner was meeting unknown 
men and women in car parks for sex during this time. The relationship 
came to light when the boy told two of his friends, who reported the 
incident to another teacher at the college.

The
 teacher informed the police and Kilner was arrested. She was suspended 
from the school on July 27. She made full admissions in police 
interviews but said the boy was not forced into anything.

Kilner, who lived in Dagenham, Essex, pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual activity with a child by an adult in a position of trust. Sentencing her to 14 months imprisonment, Judge Judith Hughes QC, said: ‘This is a tragic case, having read the reports about you.

‘Clearly this is an offence of a serious breach of trust as you were his teacher.

‘It must be noted that the boy was a willing participant but that does not excuse the behaviour.

‘You are now barred from teaching children or vulnerable adults but you can apply to be taken off this list in the future.’
