Parents are outraged after an elementary school took away meals from 40 children and threw them away because their families were behind on payments.

The affected children at Uintah Elementary School in Salt Lake City had already filled up their trays on Tuesday and were at the payment counter when staff notified them that their parents were in debt.

The trays were taken from them and the food was thrown away. The children instead received a piece of fruit and milk for lunch, staff said.

'My daughter called me from the 
school and was crying that they weren't going to give her lunch because 
she didn't have any money,' Kevin Conway, whose daughter is in the third grade, told MailOnline.

Upset: Kevin Conway said his daughter (both pictured) called him crying to say that the school had refused to give her lunch because their account was in debt. He had never been told about the negative balance

He said that she had been refused lunch because the account was just $4 in debt - and the system had failed to notify him.

'The first notification was from my daughter, when she called me crying,' he said. 'I'd understand if it was $50, but this was just a few dollars. One parent was negative $2.'

Jason Olsen, a Salt Lake City District
 spokesman, said that the child-nutrition department had realized some 
students' families had outstanding balances on Monday.

School
 authorities tried to contact parents about the debt on Monday and 
Tuesday morning, Olsen said, but all of the families could not be 
reached before Tuesday's lunch.

Anger: Erica Lukes' 11-year-old daughter had her lunch taken away and thrown in the trash at school because she was unknowingly behind on payments. Up to 40 children were affected at a Utah school

'Something's not working, and that's what
 the school and child-nutrition department are going to work on 
together,' Olsen told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'This can be easily prevented.'

Mr Olsen said he did not receive a call or email from the school ahead of the incident.

Another parent, Erica Lukes, said she did not receive any notification either, and said the experience was 'traumatic and humiliating' for her 11-year-old child and others.

'I 
think it's despicable,' she said. 'These are young children that shouldn't be 
punished or humiliated for something the parents obviously need to clear
 up.'

Some 
parents said that they had never received a call from the school to let 
them know they were in debt, while others suggested they had continued
 paying but that the school district had changed its vendor. They said 
they never received a notification of the change.

Scene: Staff at Uintah Elementary School has apologized for its treatment of the children

The school district posted a lengthy explanation and apology to Facebook.

'This
 situation could have and should have been handled in a different 
manner. We apologize,' the post read. 'We understand the feelings of 
upset parents and students who say this was an embarrassing and 
humiliating situation.'

But Mr Conway said the apology was not enough.

'I'd like them to apologize to the kids,' he said. 'They are the ones who had to be embarrassed.'
