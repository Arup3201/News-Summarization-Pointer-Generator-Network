He might only be a tiny puppy, but when little Dexter became trapped in a garden gate he needed a crew of four burly firefighters to cut him free.

The shih-tzu toy poodle cross had only been at home in Nottingham with his new owners for seven weeks when he managed to squeeze into the tiny gap in the gate to their front garden.

Maria Nolan, 27, arrived home to find the 16-week-old puppy with his head and front paws stuck poking through the gate.

Her mother Anna Nolan had called the fire brigade as a last resort when neither greasing Dexter’s coat with oil and water nor the efforts of two neighbours helped to free him.

She was washing her front door, with Dexter and her other dog Evie in the front garden, when suddenly they went quiet. On investigation, Anna Nolan found Dexter stuck in the gate.

While he was squealing for help, she called the fire bridgade, and four firefighters soon arrived - managing to pull Dexter from the gate within a few minutes.

Anna Nolan said: ‘He’s still a pup and such a friendly dog. When I looked round I could see Evie and I thought “Where’s Dex?”

‘I just kept looking round and there he was, stuck halfway through the railings. There was no way of moving the bars and I tried water and oil but that didn’t work.

‘He was very, very lucky to escape but he’s back to his naughty self now.’

When Maria Nolan arrived home she got quite a shock. She said: ‘I got back when the fire crew were opening the bars of the gate - I couldn’t believe he had got himself trapped.

'They did a great job keeping him calm and it was such a relief to see him out. I picked him up straight away and gave him cuddles. He really loved the firefighters, and he kept trying to lick them'

‘They did a great job keeping him calm and it was such a relief to see him out. I picked him up straight away and gave him cuddles. He really loved the firefighters, and he kept trying to lick them. I’m just so grateful to the fire brigade. It was such a relief to know he was okay. I can’t thank them enough.’

Tim Marston, watch manager at Eastwood Fire Station in Nottinghamshire, used a manually-operated cutter spreader to free Dexter.

He said: ‘This was the typical action of a mischievous puppy although it’s not an everyday occurrence for us. We are very pleased they called us when they did because it reduced the distress for Dexter.’
