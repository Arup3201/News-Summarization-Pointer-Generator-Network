CIA Director John Brennan apologized to Senate intelligence committee leaders on Thursday after his inspector general found that CIA employees improperly searched Senate computers this year.

The mea culpa comes as a sharp about-face for Brennan, who denied in March that anyone in his agency was unconstitutionally spying on legislators or their staff.

'Nothing could be further from the truth,' he said then, after California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused the CIA of hacking into computers to track whether Senate aides had improperly accessed classified documents.

'We wouldn’t do that,' he had said. 'That’s just beyond the scope of reason in terms of what we’d do.'

When the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong,' he added.

Sorry: CIA Director John Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after agency employees snooped on the committee's computers

But Feinsten released a statement Thursday saying that the CIA's inspector general 'confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March – CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate Intelligence Committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers.'

'Director Brennan apologized for these actions and submitted the IG report to an accountability board. These are positive first steps. This IG report corrects the record and it is my understanding that a declassified report will be made available to the public shortly.;

Agency spokesman Dean Boyd said in a statement on Thursday that Brennan has convened an 
accountability board that will investigate the conduct of the CIA 
officers and discipline them, if need be.

He has asked former Sen. Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat, to advise him about the results of the inspector general inquiry. Boyd said that advice might include recommendations for 'potential disciplinary measures and/or steps to address systemic issues.'

The
 Justice Department has so far declined to pursue criminal charges 
against the employees, who searched the computers for information 
gathered in the course of a Senate investigation into the CIA's 
interrogation techniques.

The CIA inspector general concluded 'that some CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between' the committee and the CIA in 2009 regarding access to a shared classified computer network, Boyd said.

Brennan informed Senate intelligence committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican on the committee, 'and apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the (inspector general's) report,' Boyd said.

The development was the subject of wildly different characterizations by sources on either side of the dispute, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to go beyond official statements.

Feinstein charged in March that her staffers' computer security was breached by CIA hackers, but Brennan flatly denied it at the time

Senate aides familiar with the matter say the CIA used classified 'hacking tools' and created a fake user account in an effort to retrieve documents the CIA believed the Senate staffers had improperly accessed.

A U.S. official familiar with the inspector general report told the Associated Press that no hacking tools were used, and said that there was no malicious intent behind the CIA actions, but simply an effort to account for documents believed to have been improperly accessed.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Wednesday in a statement that Brennan should issue 'a public apology ... to staff and the committee, a full accounting of how this occurred and a commitment there will be no further attempts to undermine Congressional oversight of CIA activities.'
