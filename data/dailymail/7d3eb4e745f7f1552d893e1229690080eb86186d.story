When a pregnant woman took a look at her ultrasound scan, she got a shock no expectant mother should ever encounter.

The face of her dead mother-in-law was staring back at her.

Now, the family believe she has come back to watch over them and the new baby.

The next generation: A pregnant mother from Brazil spotted her dead mother-in-law, left, in her ultrasound, right, after a ten-week scan at a hospital in the country's capital Brasilia

Things that go bump in the night: Marcelo and Phamela de Souza, pictured, were shocked to see the apparition of the baby's dead grandmother

Brazilian Phamela de Souza spotted the spooky image after having her ten-week scan.

She took it home to show her husband Marcelo, and he immediately recognised the ghostly face of his mother in the top left hand corner.

The elderly woman had died just four months before her daughter-in-law's trip to a hospital in the capital city of Brasilia.

'I noticed the face when they were doing the ultrasound but I didn't say anything,' the mother-to-be told R7 DF.

'But when we started looking at photos of her just before she died, I was convinced it was her. It looks too much like her to be a coincidence.'

Her hairdresser husband admitted that the family and their friends have been haunted by the sight ever since. Their daughter is now three, and he believes his mother still watches over her.

'As soon as I saw it I knew it was my mother,' said Mr de Souza. 'It's her face, no doubt about it at all. She had come back to tell us she was taking care of us.

'I showed it to the rest of the family and friends, and they also believed. My friend was so shocked by the similarity he hasn't slept properly since he saw it.'
