A hospital  under investigation by police and the NHS has suspended ten nurses – three of whom have been arrested over tampering with medication and falsifying records.

Last night campaigners fighting for a full public inquiry into deaths and poor care at the hospital in South Wales, said the problem was bigger than the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Gareth Williams, who set up a support group for families of patients who have suffered at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, said: ‘The suspension of ten nurses is shocking news.'

He added: ‘I have always said the scale of the scandal at the hospital is enormous. But people have been slow to listen.’

His mother Lillian, an 82-year-old amputee, died at the hospital in 2012. She was starved and neglected by staff for days and died a ‘horrible death’, Mr Williams said.

Hospital sources said five of the suspended nurses were responsible for Lillian Williams’ care. The three arrested nurses have been released on bail.

The Welsh Government ordered an inquiry into the scandal, due to report soon, but Mr Williams called for a full public inquiry into all hospitals run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU).

‘The problems are throughout the health board, not just at Bridgend Hospital, but at Morriston and Singleton,’ he said.

‘I am getting told about two or three suspicious deaths a month at the three hospitals and we know that this neglect stretches back at least four to five years.’

Mr Williams alleges his mother’s medication was tampered with and that she was given the wrong insulin doses. Others claim relatives were given the drug when it had not been prescribed.

Last night it emerged the hospital had agreed compensation with the family of Basil Hewins, who died after being treated there two years ago.

ABMU admitted there was a ‘breach of duty’ which ‘on the balance of probabilities resulted in Mr Hewins contracting peritonitis which led to septicaemia and ultimately his death’. His son Clive Hewins said the 84-year-old had suffered a ‘fortnight from hell’. The patient, who had dialysis for a kidney problem, was admitted to the Princess of Wales Hospital on July 6, 2012, with suspected shingles.

His son was told it was not a dialysis hospital so had to perform the procedure himself. He added: ‘Our concerns … grew when one nurse said she didn’t know what she was doing regarding dialysis.’

The family also reported finding waste water running through a corridor from a wet room towards Mr Hewins’ room.

On July 20, he was diagnosed with peritonitis and septicaemia. He died soon after an operation at another hospital. An ABMU spokesman apologised for ‘failings’ in Mr Hewins’ care and expressed ‘sincere condolences’.
