Missing: Heather Bird, 28, pictured, was last seen three weeks ago with an unidentified man at the Florida strip club she works at

Police are searching for a 28-year-old stripper who was last seen three weeks ago leaving a Florida gentlemen's club with an unidentified man.

Heather Bird, who goes by the stage name of 'Kat,' disappeared on August 28 after finishing her shift at Cheaters strip club in Ormond Beach.

Co-workers spotted the Holly Hill woman leaving the establishment with an unknown customer, according to Ormond Beach Police Department Lt Kenny Hayes.

But they said they didn't report Bird's disappearance right away because turnover for dancers at the club is high and they thought she'd quit.

Bird's mother Susan Bird finally called police on September 14.

The two women live together, but Mrs Bird claims she initially thought her daughter was staying with friends, which she regularly did for days at a time.

But she said she has always kept in contact.

'They don't know who she left with,' Susan Bird told Wesh.com.

'They said it was just a regular customer because people come and go there on the highway, so they didn't really get a view of him because they have no cameras inside.'

Police do not currently suspect foul 
play in Bird's disappearance but they are growing increasingly concerned
for her safety given how much time has passed.

Worried: Her mother, Susan Bird, reported Heather Bird, pictured, missing on September 14

No contact: Bird, pictured, hasn't used her phone or contacted anyone in three weeks

Bird hasn't used her phone in the three weeks since her disappearance.

'We have a feeling that Heather may have gotten into something over her head and she doesn't know how to get out of it,' her mother told the TV station, adding that her daughter has no history of drug abuse or depression.

'She just simply hasn't shown up at home or at work and has not contacted anyone.'

There is no surveillance video of Bird and the man leaving the club, according to Hayes.

Dancer: Bird was an exotic dancer at Cheaters Gentlemen's Club in Ormond Beach, Florida

He said the club never reported Bird missing because it claimed it 'doesn't keep track of its dancers or put them on any kind of schedule.'

On its website, Cheaters boasts of featuring 'the hottest girls in Florida with over 40 women ready to cater to your every desire.'

One-on-one dances cost as little as $10 at the club, which prides itself on having the 'largest multi-spinning pole stage in central Florida.'
