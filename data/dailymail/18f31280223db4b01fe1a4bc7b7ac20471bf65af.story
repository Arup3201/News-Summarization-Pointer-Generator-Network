Bill Maher might have made the most costly joke of his career after Donald Trump called the liberal comedian out on a challenge to release his birth certificate.

On Monday's 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno', Maher, 56, said that he would donate $5 million to the charity of Trump's choice if the 'Celebrity Apprentice' host was able to prove that he is not the 'spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan.'

However, on Tuesday, Scott S. Balber, a lawyer for Trump, 66, sent the host of HBO's 'Real Time with Bill Maher' a letter with the property magnate's birth certificate attached and asked the comedian who is estimated to be worth $40 million to come up with the cash and honor his ultimatum.

The letter came with a birth certificate attached 'demonstrating that he is the son of Fred Trump, not an orangutan. Please remit the $5 million to Mr. Trump immediately,' according to Yahoo News.

Rather than choosing to donate the money to 'Hair Club for Men' or 'The Institute for Incorrigible Douchebaggery' as Maher suggested, Trump indicated he wants to give $1 million each to charities for the Hurricane Sandy Victims, The Police Athletic League, The American Cancer Society, The March of Dimes and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Maher was of course mocking Trump's much maligned YouTube announcement in October that he would donate $5 million of his own money to charity if President Obama would release his college records.

Creating feverish anticipation in October, Trump declared that he had 'something very, very, big concerning the president of the United States' that could 'possibly' change the election.

Evidence: Lawyers for Donald Trump were swift to issue the property billionaire's birth certificate - releasing it the day after Maher's challenge

Speculation in the hours before Trump revealed his challenge was rife that he may indeed have discovered scandalous information about Barack Obama, who released his own birth certificate to the public following massive media pressure led by Trump himself.

'Barack Obama is the least transparent president in the history of this country,' said Trump in his YouTube video released in October.

'I'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long-form birth certificate or whatever it may be.

'If Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and application and if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a charity of his choice - inner-city children in Chicago, American Cancer Society, AIDS research, anything he wants - a check immediately for $5 million.'

At the time, Barack Obama was not concerned and joked to Jay Leno himself on the 'Tonight Show' that the bad blood between himself and Trump stems back to an argument 'when we were growing up together in Kenya.'

On Monday night though, firebrand Maher was massively outspoken about Trump while appearing on Leno's show.

Comparing Trump to an orangutan, Maher was drawing a comparison between the famously sandy hair of the New York billionaire and the great ape that roams the jungles of South East Asia.

In addition to calling Trump the son of an orangutan, Maher labeled Trump a 'liar' and a 'racist' and a 'douche bag' as he reacted to some derogatory tweets that Trump had posted online about him.
