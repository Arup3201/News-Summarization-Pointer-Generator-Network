The family of Malcolm X have criticized singer Nicki Minaj for disrespecting the civil rights leader by putting an image of him next to a racial slur on her album's artwork.

A famed picture of Malcolm X holding a rifle appeared on the unofficial artwork for her latest single, which has the N word in the title.

The civil rights leader's family described the artwork as tasteless and said they had not endorsed the use of the picture.

'Tasteless': The family of Malcolm X complained about the use of his photo on a Nicki Minaj single

In an exclusive statement with AP on Friday, Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, said 
Minaj's use of the picture 'in no way is endorsed by our family'.

'Ms Minaj's artwork for her single does not depict the truth of Malcolm X's legacy,' Ms Shabazz said.

Minaj apologized on Thursday and the artwork for her single Lookin A** N**** was pulled after being heavily criticized on social media networks. She said the single cover was 'never the official artwork'.

Mark Roesler, chief executive of CMG Worldwide, which is the business representative for the Malcolm X estate, called Minaj's use of the photo 'dehumanizing'.

'This is a family photo that was taken out of context in a totally inaccurate and tasteless way,' he said in a statement made on behalf of the family.

L. Londell McMillan, the attorney for Malcolm X's family, said in a statement Friday that those using the famous photo of Malcolm X need to remove it immediately.

'Failure to do so within the next 24 hours shall result in legal action,' Mr McMillian said. 'The initial act and subsequent acts of distribution were improper and ill-advised.

'Any disparagement, infringement or disrespect of Malcolm X, and his name, image, likeness and proprietary rights will not be tolerated.'

Minaj's representatives didn't return emails seeking comment.

Minaj posted the artwork on her Instagram page and website on Wednesday. The photo showed Malcolm X holding a rifle during a time when he was trying to protect his family from death threats after their home had been firebombed.

Apology: Nicki Minaj removed the artwork and told the family she didn't mean to offend after receiving a barrage of criticism this week

'I apologize to the Malcolm X estate 
if the meaning of the photo was misconstrued ... I have nothing but 
respect [and] adoration for u,' Minaj said on her Instagram page 
following the criticism.

The
 31-year-old rapper-singer said on Thursday, in an interview with radio 
station Hot 97, that she wrote the song to empower women because there 
are too many songs that attack females.

'It
 was almost parallel in my opinion because he has this big gun ready to 
shoot at a lookin' (expletive) bleep, and that's how I looked at it,' 
she said.

'I looked at it as this is one of the most memorable people in
 our history, in black history, who voiced his opinion no matter what, 
and I understand how my intent was overlooked and I definitely didn't 
want to offend his family or his legacy.'

In the song's music video, Minaj is shooting guns.

Ilyasah Shabazz said Minaj's use of her father's photo is part of a larger problem in today's culture.

'Situations
 like the recent portrayal of our father on the album cover for Ms 
Minaj's new single only highlight the fact that we as a society need to 
take more responsibility for what we're teaching our children,' her 
statement said.

'It is 
our family's hope that the true legacy and context of Malcolm X's life 
continues to be shared with people from all walks of life in a positive 
manner that helps promote the goals and ideals for which Malcolm X so 
passionately advocated.'

Malcolm X was killed 49 years ago this month when he was 39.
