Women have been paying the price of wearing high heels for years suffering from sore feet, aching legs and a bad back for a height and style boost.

But now a brand say they can offer a three-and-a-half-inch shoe that is both comfortable and stylish. 

British brand Hotter have created the Boutique by Hotter collection which they describe as fashionable and elegant - but best of all comfy.

Impressed: Podiatrist Emma Supple put different styles of Hotter's 'most comfortable shoes you'll ever wear' to the test

Founder of the Lancashire-based company, Stewart Houlgrave, said he's always strived to 'create and design shoes as comfortable as slippers'.

Doing this when it comes to heels is no mean feat but they say they have achieved it thanks to using a stable block heel, flexible sole, soft leather linings and cushioning at ball and heel of the foot.

But this is no ordinary cushioning - it's Egyptian-inspired cushioning made with a 'pyramid construction'.

A spokesman for the brand explains: 'Pyramid technology puts science into comfort. Hidden deep inside the shoe sole is a pyramid-shaped foam pad which contracts and traps air as you walk, acting as a cushion to the balls of your feet where pressure can be constant.

'Placed directly above the flexi grooves of the shoes' sole, the special pads enhance flexibility and soften this part of the insole.

'In Boutique by Hotter, styles are enhanced with an added layer of foam at the heel to making them the most comfortable fashion styles you'll ever wear.'

The claims will be welcome news to the thousands of women who suffer from foot, leg and back pain thanks to their love of high heels.

Happy feet: Hotter's Boutique collection comes in styles for work and play and use pyramid cushioning for a comfortable fit. The buckle style called 'glamour', far left, is £95, while the red and silver glitter 'admire' shoes are £85 each

The dangers of high heels include compression of the spine, damage to the joints and developing bunions and blisters from the way the toes are pushed forward into the end of the shoe. 

But are Hotter's claims that they've designed comfortable heels too good to be true?

Femail asked podiatrist Emma Supple to put them to the test.

She said: When I wore them I immediately felt the 
comfort of the cushioning. The stacked, blocked - yet elegant - heel was 
noticeably effective. No rubbing, full cushioning and easy to walk on.'

The foot expert said she was 'very impressed' with the fit and feel of the shoe - and was especially pleased they they are available in half sizes.

She said: 'They fit really well with that all important half size. It will be a pleasure to add Hotter shoes to the list of where to get shoes that really fit to those of us with half sizes. M&S and some specialist areas seemed to be the last to maintain this British sizing.'

Emma wore the shoes to a recent world conference in podiatry in Rome where she said had the opportunity to test the comfort of the shoes and see what her podiatrist peers thought of them.

After putting them to the test, she concluded: 'This is a well made, accessible, flexible high heel shoe.

'The attention to detail in the placement of the heel, flexibility at the forefoot and additional forefoot padding make for a comfortable, elegant and wearable high heel shoe.'

The Boutique collection is available at www.hotter.com, 50 Hotter stores nationwide or via their mail order catalogue.
