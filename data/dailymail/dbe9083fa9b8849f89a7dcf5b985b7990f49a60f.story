Tiquie the Brazilian Tapir soaked up the attention at Taronga Zoo this week as keepers treated her to a luxurious pampering session to slough off those winter blues.

She was given a hands-on health check and grooming session: a full body massage with oil to prevent her skin from drying and a good brush of her wiry mane.

But Tiquie is no stranger to being primped and preened. Although Tapirs are normally solitary, elusive creatures in the wild, keeper Nat Dunn says Tiquie loves the interaction of her daily grooming sessions.

'She’ll close her eyes and tilt her head back when we’re rubbing the oil onto her skin and often roll onto her back for a tummy tickle,” said Dunn. “We also brush her hair and skin to bring out its natural oils and because of her relaxed nature; we’re able to perform a hands-on health check of her feet, ears, eyes and body.'

Tapirs have survived for millions of years but their future in the wild is under threat due to extensive hunting,  logging and clearing of their jungle and forest habitats for agriculture.

Taronga Zoo is helping to protect Tapirs in the wild by supporting research and conservation efforts in Brazil through the Lowland Tapir Conservation Initiative.
