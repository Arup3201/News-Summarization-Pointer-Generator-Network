Swansea have appealed against defender Federico Fernandez's red card in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup defeat to Liverpool.

The Argentinian was dismissed by referee Keith Stroud in stoppage time for a challenge on Philippe Coutinho and faces a three-match suspension.

A statement issued on the club's website read: 'Swansea City can confirm that the club will be appealing the red card issued to defender Federico Fernandez against Liverpool last night.

'The club officially informed the Football Association by today's 1pm deadline.

'The FA will make a decision on the appeal ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton.'

Swansea had led through Marvin Emnes' goal but Mario Balotelli equalised and, after Fernandez was dismissed, Dejan Lovren's header snatched a 2-1 win to send the Reds through to the quarter-finals.
