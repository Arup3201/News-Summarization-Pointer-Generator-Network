Gruesome discovery: A severed head was found in the East London canal where Gemma McCluskie's dismembered, decapitated body was discovered

A severed head was yesterday recovered from the canal where the decapitated body of Eastenders actress Gemma McCluskie was found.

The grim discovery comes seven months 
after the 29-year-old's headless and limbless body was discovered 
floating in the Regent’s Canal in Hackney, east London, in March.

Police would this morning not be drawn
on whether the head belonged to the murdered actress, whose brother 
Tony, 35, is currently on remand waiting to stand trial accused of her 
murder.

Miss McCluskie vanished after attending the £650million opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, East London.

She was last seen returning to her 
home that she shared with her brother and her sick mother.

A week later 
her butchered torso was found floating in the Regent's Canal, close to 
Hackney's famous Broadway Market.

It was a member of the public who made the call to police yesterday at 1.15pm alerting them to the severed head.

'Officers will not speculate on the 
fact that it may be related to the Gemma McCluskie case,' a Scotland 
Yard spokesman told MailOnline.

Miss McCluskie appeared in more than 30 episodes of BBC soap opera Eastenders as teenage temptress Kerry Skinner in 2001.

The part was her only high-profile 
acting role and it is thought more recently she may have been acting as a
carer for her elderly mother, who lived with her and her ex-builder 
brother.

When she went missing friends launched
extensive searches across east London in a bid to find her.

Former 
EastEnders co-stars Natalie Cassidy and Brooke Kinsella both appealed 
for help on Twitter.

Her body was found when a member of 
the public reported a suspicious object floating close to Hackney's 
famous Broadway Market near her home.

A distinctive tattoo led detectives to believe the body might be that of the former soap star.
