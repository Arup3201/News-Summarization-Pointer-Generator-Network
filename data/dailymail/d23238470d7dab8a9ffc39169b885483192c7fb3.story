More than 100 City bankers today won 
their High Court battle for £42million in unpaid bonuses from the 
German banking giant Commerzbank AG.

They had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a 
guaranteed bonus pool announced by Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd (DKL) in August 2008.

The case comes at a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses.

But Mr Justice Owen said while the 
subject of such bonuses was a matter of public interest, these 
claims depended on a contractual clause and did not
involve the wider concerns in the banking industry today.

More than 100 London investment bankers today won their High Court battle for £42m in unpaid bonuses from Commerzbank

The individual claims brought by 104 former DKL employees against the company and its new owner - which bought it in 2009 - ranged from £12,000 to £1.6milion.

In January, Andrew Hochhauser QC told Mr Justice Owen the bonuses should have been paid for the year ending December 31, 2008, from a guaranteed minimum bonus pool of £320million because of 'binding and enforceable contractual promises' made between August and December 2008.

They were to be allocated to front- and middle-office employees in the usual way, taking into account individual performance, and paid in full in cash in January 2009.

'Put briefly, those promises have not been honoured and that is why we are here today,' he said.

'Although the defendants accept that the statements which we rely upon were made, they deny that they amounted to contractual obligations.'

Mr Hochhauser said the pool was created in August 2008 in order to retain staff in the face of a mass exodus, and was formally communicated to them by Dr Stefan Jentzsch, then chief executive of Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank.

Martin Blessing, CEO of Commerzbank, said: 'If the court rules that it was contractually binding, of course I will accept it and pay'

Dr Jentzsch said the pool would remain 'no matter what', irrespective of financial performance.

Mr Hochhauser said the promises made by 
Dr Jentzsch were aimed at stabilising the investment banking division 
and had that effect - all of the claimant bankers did stay and continued
to work hard.

But, having allocated discretionary bonuses from the pool in December 
2008, the bank subsequently decided to 'move the goalposts' and 
introduce a material adverse change (MAC) clause.

Commerzbank vigorously defended the claims, saying that Dresdner Bank 
was entitled to reduce the bonuses in the light of the significant 
deterioration in the investment bank's performance in late 2008.

It said that the August announcement was
neither intended to have contractual effect - nor had such effect - but
amounted to no more than the provision of information as to the bank's 
genuine intentions, while the claimants merely continued to do the jobs 
they were well paid to do.

The judge said that he was satisfied that the promise made by Dr Jentzsch gave rise to a contractual obligation.

The average pay of bosses at 
Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to 
£3.65million, according to research published yesterday.

The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to 
shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the
FTSE 100 index.

On 
average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a 
long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus 
several other lucrative perks, according to the research.

But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services.

The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers
between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time 
when inflation is 3.5 per cent.

The report found that 8 per cent of 
workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or 
the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen.

If the claimants had not won on that point, they would have succeeded on
the MAC clause issue which, he added, was introduced in breach of the 
implied terms of the contracts of employment.

Today, the judge said: 'I have come to the conclusion that the claimants are entitled to payment of bonuses provisionally awarded to them.

'I would simply add 
that, whilst these claims arose in 2008 against the background of the 
major crisis in the international banking industry and whilst the 
subject of bonuses paid to those employed in the banking sector remains a
subject of intense public interest, the issues to which these claims 
gave rise arose within a narrow ambit and concern the nature and 
existence of contractual obligations owed to the claimants by their 
employer.

'They did not concern wider issues as to the structure of remuneration within the banking industry.'

During the hearing, Commerzbank CEO 
Martin Blessing said: 'If the court rules that it was contractually 
binding, of course I will accept it and pay.'

However, a spokesman for the bank said later: 'We are disappointed with the court’s decision and will seek leave to appeal.

'The bank believes that the decision to reduce discretionary bonuses in light of £5.2billion of losses at Dresdner Kleinwort for 2008 was responsible and justified.

'The main argument revolves around whether the announcement on August 18 amounted to a legally binding agreement.

'It is the Bank’s submission that there is every prospect that the Court of Appeal would come to a different view on this matter.'

As well as being ordered to pay the 
bonuses, Commerzbank could face a legal bill of up to £20million for a 
hearing lasting more than three weeks.

But they immediately announced 
plans to appeal.

Later, Mark Levine, a partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represented 21 of the claimant bankers, said: 'We welcome the High Court's decision today confirming the Bank's contractual obligation to pay retention awards promised to our clients in exceptional circumstances in 2008.

'Dresdner made repeated promises to employees prior to its sale to Commerzbank in an attempt to avoid a mass exodus of staff - namely that they would be financially rewarded from a guaranteed retention pool for remaining at the bank and performing well.

'We welcome the High Court ruling that these promises constituted a binding contract and, with the staff having performed their side of the contract, that the bank breached it by refusing to honour the payments it had promised.

'This case is likely to have significance whenever employment contracts are varied, particularly on the basis of verbal commitments or actions.
