Helen Green, 43, is accused of pouring either petrol or lighter fuel over Robert McAlees (pictured) then setting him on fire after a row at their home in Stockport, Greater Manchester

A woman set fire to her boyfriend as he lay on a bed following a drunken row, a court heard.

Helen Green, 43, is accused of pouring white spirits on his clothes to start the blaze that killed Robert McAlees, her partner of ten years.

The jury was played chilling 999 calls where a man screams 'I'm burning'.

Neighbours saw him screaming and engulfed in flames outside the house they shared in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in February.

Paramedics
took him to Wythenshawe Hospital where he died an 'agonising death' the
following morning with burns to up to 90 per cent of his body, a murder
trial jury at Manchester Crown Court was told.

Miss Green, who has two children from a different relationship, denies murder.

Stephen
Roirdan QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution say that his partner 
Helen Green caused these injuries at the home which they shared in 
Stockport.

'Whilst he was on or close to the bed in the main bedroom of that house, she poured white spirit on his clothing and the bed and set fire to it.

'At the time that she did this, the prosecution say, she intended either to cause him serious injury or to kill him, and is therefore guilty of his murder.'

Police were called to this house in Carlingford Close, Adswood following reports 41-year-old Robert McAlees was in the street suffering from serious burns. He died later in hospital from his injuries

A jury at Manchester Crown Court was played chilling 999 calls where a man screams 'I'm burning'

Members of the public gallery wept and a juror held a hand to her face as two horrific 999 calls were played in court.

Chilling screams could be heard in the first of the two tapes.

A man could be heard to say 'I'm burning' as an off-duty police officer said 'You're not dying, love' and 'Who's done this to you, Rob?'

In the second call, a neighbour was heard to say: 'He's screaming; he's smouldering. I think there is a girl with him who is hysterical.'

The court heard Mr McAlees and Miss Green were heavy drinkers.

'He's screaming; he's smouldering. I think there is a girl with him who is hysterical.'

Neighbour's 999 call

A next-door neighbour heard them rowing at 10.40pm after they returned from a night out at his sister's house, where they had been drinking Stella, cider and Jagermeister, the court heard.

The court heard that off-duty officer Alison Greenwood, who lives a few doors away, ran to help.

It is claimed Miss Green walked up and was told to throw her coat over Mr McAlees, which she did and also threw her handbag, which landed in his groin. It is alleged Miss Green then ran away.

Ms Greenwood noticed that Mr McAlees's groin was black, the court heard. She threw the bag and coat away and tried to put out the flames with water.

The jury was told fire crews arrived and discovered a blaze inside the couple's house.

They found three small fires in the kitchen, small areas of burned carpet and fabric in the hallway.

There was also a fire in the bedroom, where a clear plastic bottle containing a hazard warning label was found.

Mr Roirdan said: 'This bottle, which had no cap, was lying on its side next to the wardrobe at the base of the bed. The cap was removed from the work surface to the right of the sink in the kitchen.'
