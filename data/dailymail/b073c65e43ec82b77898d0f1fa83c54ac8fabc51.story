Turkish soldiers appear to have fired tear gas at citizens who were watching another day of bloody fighting in the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane.

Scores of observers retreated from hillsides just a mile from the town - where the death toll in six weeks is said to have topped 800 - after military vehicles swept in earlier today in what Turkey claimed was a bid to ensure their safety.

Onlookers were seeing rubbing their eyes as canisters landed in between their vans and motorbikes on the rocky outcrop, which had afforded the best views of the fighting from a distance.

Staying put: The Rudaw news agency reported journalists retreated but citizens remained on the rocky outcrop as the military arrived

According to the Kurdish news agency Rudaw, soldiers in military vehicles ordered the citizens and journalists to retreat to other hills further from Kobane, which had a poorer view of the fighting.

While the journalists complied, some of the residents remained and had the gas fired on them in an attempt to make them disperse. A military spokesman told Rudaw the move was to ensure the onlookers' safety, but did not elaborate any further.

It is not the first time Turkey has tear-gassed citizens watching the bloody conflict in Kobane. Clashes erupted earlier this month between armed Turkish police and Kurdish refugees as they tried to march back to the border and stage a protest about the conflict.

Guards in body-armour and helmets used tear gas to drive a group of around 200 desperate demonstrators back behind Turkish lines.

The scenes came on another day of fierce fighting between Kurdish forces and ISIS extremists, who have been battling to capture the strategic stronghold of Kobane for more than a month. 

ISIS militants - also called ISIL or Islamic State - tried to seize a post on the border between Kobane and Turkey last night but were repelled once more by Kurdish fighters, who have held them at bay for weeks after the West feared the town would fall.

Kurdish official Idris Nassan said the militants shelled a border gate before being pushed back, adding: 'Of course they will try again tonight. Last night they brought new reinforcements, new supplies, and they are pushing hard'.

To lose the border gate -- the only official way for the Kurdish fighters in Kobane to cross into Turkey -- would be a major blow to the fighters defending the town as well as the civilians who still remain. Iraqi Kurdish reinforcements are expected to arrive in Kobane but it is not clear how soon.

The U.S. launched five fresh air strikes around the town today alongside 12 separate strikes in Iraq.

The U.S. Central Command said the strikes destroyed seven vehicles and one building belonging to the militants near Kobane - while in Iraq, forces concentrated on the area around the strategic Mosul Dam and near Fallujah.

Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain have all aided the assault, the U.S. officials added.

Today one of the few groups which claims to monitor the situation on the ground in Syria said the death toll in Kobane had reached 851 - including almost 500 ISIS extremists.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said 302 fighters from the Kurdish YPG group had so killed so far, compared to 481 from ISIS.

The Observatory's list also included ten fighters from other groups, 21 civilians, and one volunteer bringing ammunition to the Kurds.
