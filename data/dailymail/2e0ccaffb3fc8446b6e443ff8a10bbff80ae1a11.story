Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had said he wanted to broaden the social mix of students at top universities by forcing them to take more pupils from state schools

Rules which force top universities to take more students from state schools could be scrapped, it has emerged.

The coalition introduced reforms last year which allowed universities to charge fees of up to £9,000 a year in return for recruiting more low-income pupils.

The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said he wants to broaden the social mix of students at Britain's leading universities.

But the move provoked a backlash from leading private schools who accused the Government of 'social engineering' and discriminating against some of their well-qualified students.

Around half of the country's elite universities also boycotted the state school target this year.

A senior government source told told the Daily Telegraph the quota system could now be axed.

Critics said the reform has been made ineffective because an increasing number of middle-class families are now sending their children to top state schools because of the recession.

It has also been argued that assuming poorer pupils always attend state schools while the richest are privately educated is too simplistic.

'It's a fair criticism and we probably need to look at it,' the source told the Telegraph.

It would be another damaging compromise for Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg who faced criticism after he backed down on a manifesto commitment by allowing tuition fees to be increased in the first place.

He has also had to concede ambitions for a so-called 'mansion tax' in the latest budget and reform to the House of Lords.

The share of private school places at Cambridge plunged to a 30-year low this year with 63 per cent of freshers coming from state schools.

The heads of leading private schools have fiercely protested against Government plans to force universities to take more pupils from state schools

It meant the university had already surpassed the Government's target of a 38/62 split by 2016/17.

Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of the Commons skills select committee, said the quota system is 'too crude'.

'It is much more complicated than that. It would be right to review the target,' he said.
