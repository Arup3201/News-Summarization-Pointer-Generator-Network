Tragic: Tameria Greene, pictured, was stabbed to death in January 2013. Her mother has now been jailed for her murder

A Detroit woman was sentenced Monday to at least 23 years in prison for fatally stabbing her 8-year-old daughter whom a court had refused to remove from the home despite allegations of abuse.

The system failed Tameria Greene, Wayne County Judge Margaret Van Houten said as she sentenced Semeria Greene under a plea deal between prosecutors and defense lawyers.

Greene, 27, apologized for killing her daughter, telling the judge in a soft voice that her death was an accident. Assistant Prosecutor Carin Goldfarb, however, said Greene had choices and made the wrong one.

'This is just further evidence of Ms. 
Greene's manipulation. ... Tameria was 8 years old. She was a 
chronically abused child,' Goldfarb said.

The
 Michigan Department of Human Services tried to immediately remove 
Tameria and four siblings from the home in November 2012. But Family 
Court Referee Richard Smart declined, suggesting instead that their 
mother should move out in the short term or place the children 
elsewhere.

The detailed 
petition presented to Smart said Tameria had been bitten by her mother 
on her hand, forearm and face. The agency said there were multiple marks
 and bruises elsewhere

Drawn-out: The trial of Semeria Greene took more than a year after multiple delays because of her mental health

The state didn't appeal Smart's decision, and more court hearings were planned. Tameria was killed five weeks later.

Greene
 pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder. She'll be eligible for
 parole after 23 years in prison; her maximum stay is 50 years.

The
 case has lasted more than a year, mostly because of delays related to 
Greene's mental health. The judge noted that experts found depression 
but not bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.

'Mental illness does not cause child abuse or child murder,' Goldfarb told Van Houten.

Defense
 attorney Cornelius Pitts didn't refer to specific mental conditions but
 said Greene was "born with a deficit that cannot be overcome.

'Ms. Greene is the victim of the system,' he said.
