Is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley swapping her Victoria's Secret lingerie sets for Victorian corsets?

The supermodel has revealed an unlikely ambition in a new interview for net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit.

Laughing about her sex bomb status the 26-year-old claims that she doesn't want to be wearing hot pants forever: 'I’d love to do a period drama, or make a 
quintessentially British comedy,’ she says.

Today blonde Rosie, who posed on a Californian beach for the shoot, is famous for her amazing curves and 
bee stung pout but reveals in the interview that as a young model she felt constant 
pressure to lose weight: 'It was only puppy fat, which melted away as I grew up.'

There is no sign of any puppy fat on Devon-born Rosie as she smoulders in the latest summer designs on the shoot, including a retro Dolce & Gabbana swimsuit and gypsy-inspired skirt.

When she's not modelling Rosie spends her time jetting between London and LA, where she shares a home with her handsome actor boyfriend Jason Statham, 45.

Talking about their 19 year age difference she says: 'I’m not interested in hanging out with boys. I have all the man I 
need!'

Rosie likes to considers herself a woman’s woman too, and is often spotted out on the town with her gal pals. She says: 'I have my small 
group of girls and that’s it. I am very pro-women. I love seeing 
successful women who are living their dreams. I have so much respect for
them.'

Life in Hollywood is good for the 
model-turned-actress-turned-designer, but she admits to the magazine that she has had 
to change her lifestyle due the constant paparazzi attention: 'There
are between three and 10 cameras waiting for me. It’s bizarre. I do the majority of my 
shopping in the UK or online. NET-A-PORTER is my best friend.'

The year is a landmark for the esteemed model as it now means she has been in the industry for a full decade.

During her already impressive career in the fashion industry, Rosie has famously modeled for Burberry and Victoria's Secrets.

She has also hit the catwalks for fashion houses including Valentino, Oscar de la Renta, Moschino and Elie Saab and will be seen beefing up her acting credentials next summer in Mad 
Max: Fury Road alongside fellow Brits Tom Hardy and Nicholas Holt, as 
well as Oscar winner Charlize Theron.
