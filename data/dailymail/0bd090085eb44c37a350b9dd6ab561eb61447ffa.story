An unlicensed drunk driver who killed a 16-year-old boy in a horror crash last week posted a picture of his totaled vehicle with a smiley face on Facebook, just days after the tragic accident.Â 

Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, of Coon Rapids, caused not one but two crashes on July 22 along Hwy. 252 in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, according to the State Patrol.

After fleeing the first, the 24-year-old ran into Jason McCarthy's car moments later, authorities said. The teen was rushed to North Memorial Medical Center where he clung to life for days before dying on Tuesday.

On the 
Saturday before McCarthy died, Vanwagner posted the insensitive photo of
 his car on his Facebook page with the caption 'That's her front end 
after I got done with her lol.'

Under a second photo, he commented: 'I'm all good slept a day in the hospital then came home and did yard work lol.'

On Wednesday, he acknowledged posting the picture but said he didn't even know he hit somebody.

'I just thought I hit something,' he told the Star Tribune.

He said he had learned about the death earlier Wednesday as he was heading to a friend's home in north Minneapolis.

'Police came and arrested me [Wednesday] morning and let me out because the charges won't be coming for months,' he said, according to the Star Tribune.

Over the weekend, McCarthy's family posted on CaringBridge that 'the injuries to Jason during the impact of the accident were too much for him to survive.

'Jason is currently on life support so family can get here and say goodbye.'

He would have been a junior at Champlin Park High School. He was an honors student and played bass guitar in the high school band and with friends in a rock band called the Crak Pots, his aunt Brigid Klaysmat told the Star Tribune.

'He loved trying everything and had a very adventurous spirit and a wonderful sense of humor,' Klaysmat said.

Vanwagner sideswiped a vehicle at Hwy. 252 and 73rd Avenue before continuing south where he struck McCarthy's car from behind, leaving both cars totaled.

State Patrol Sgt. Jesse Grabow said the 'odor of alcoholic beverage was noticed' on his breath.

Results of a blood alchohol test are pending, as are the charges against the driver, who according to state records had a revoked license.

Vanwagner is on probation for a felony conviction in April for terroristic threats. He is required to abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs and remain law-abiding under the conditions of his sentence.
