A dog found frozen to the ground in Ecorse, Michigan, last Tuesday is lucky to be alive but may yet loose a leg or two due to her owner's cruelty

Elsa, a 10-year-old chow mix, was rushed to Healthy Paws Medical Center  after a Good Samaritan spotted the poor animal suffering in freezing conditions and called for help.

According to rescuers from the local animal shelter it took them 30 minutes to free Elsa from the icy ground.

'They had to pour warm water on her. Her two legs were frozen. The side of her face and her side, she was literally laying [sic] frozen to the ground,' Patricia Trevino of the River Rouge Animal Shelter told FOX 2.

The temperature was five degrees with a windchill of -10 on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. when the rescuers arrived, but they don't know how long the animal was left outside.

Elsa's owners had cruelly wrapped her leash around her which had prevented her from being able to reach either food, water or shelter.

'The dog was incoherent, was not responsive. She didn't start crying until the water was poured on her,' said Trevino.

Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived

Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived.

According to Trevino, Elsa isn't out of the woods just yet and could lose a leg or two. FOX 2 reports that the veterinarian who had been working to save Elsa was too overwhelmed to speak on camera about what the dog had suffered. 

Healthy Paws are taking donations over the phone as they battle to save Else. 

'It's going to pay her bill so she can be treated and stay here as long as she needs to stay until she recovers,' said Trevino.

The dog's owners have been charged with cruelty and are due to appear in court.
