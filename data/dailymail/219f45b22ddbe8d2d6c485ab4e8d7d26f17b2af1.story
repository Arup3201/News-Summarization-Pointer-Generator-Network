Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez has written a letter to a fan from his prison cell, stating his innocence and claiming the murder charges are just part of God's plan.

The letter was a reply to a note of support written by a former inmate of the Bristol County Jail, where the New England Patriots player is being held.

In it, the 23-year-old claims that he is a victim of false accusations and writes of his ambition to get back on the playing field, according to TMZ.

Law enforcement officials have verified the authenticity of the letter to TMZ.

Written on a sheet of lined paper, Hernandez, who is accused of murdering semi-professional footballer Odin Lloyd in June, said: 'The world just makes things out of false accusations ... and it will all die down, especially when they say NOT GUILTY.'

He added that the people who had turned on him would feel like c***, and said he believed God had put him in this position for a reason.

Admitting that he has been humbled by his experiences during the arrest, Hernandez added that his earnings as a professional player had damaged his relationship with God.

'I will figure it out through my 
relationship with the Lord. I fell off especially after making all that 
money but when its [sic] all said and done 'GOD' put me in the situation
for a reason!' the letter said.

The player, who was arrested at his $1.3 million North Attleborough mansion, was reportedly on a $40 million five-year contract with the Patriots.

Hernandez is currently being held in a 7ft by 10ft cell, where he spends 21 hours a day in solitary confinement and is allowed out for only an hour of exercise each day.

Guards have been told to treat Hernandez, now known as prisoner 174594 the same as the other inmates. 

It must be a stark change for Hernandez who, after signing the letter, wrote that he looked forward to being able to sign autographs again.

The letter, addressed to a former inmate named only as Karl, signs off with a thank you for the gift of some pictures for his cell wall, and highlights the sportsman's desire to return to a life of football and signing autographs.

Hernandez, who was dropped by the Patriots after being charged with murder, has denied being a killer.

At the end of July police divers in Connecticut have begun searching a lake in his hometown of Bristol for the .45 Glock semi-automatic pistol prosecutors said was used to kill Mr Lloyd on June 17.

He was shot five times at an industrial park close to Hernandez's home. Surveillance video taken from Hernandez's home shortly after the shooting showed the professional footballer holding a gun, according to documents released by Attleboro District Court.

He is suspected of killing Mr Lloyd because he knew about Hernandez's alleged involvement in a 2012 double murder, according to the New York Daily News.

Your letter meant a lot and was very true!

I know everything happens for a reason and I know 'God' has a plan for me and something good will come out of this. The world just makes things out of false accusations and it will all die down especially when they say NOT GUILTY and all the people who turned on me will feel like crap. I've always been a great person an [sic] known for having an amazing heart! I am a strong person and nothing will break me! A CO. will never nor can they say now for one day have I been down or not with a smile on my face. I known there is a reason I'm going thru this and I will figure it out through my relationship with the Lord. I fell off especially after making all that money but when its [sic] all said and done 'GOD' put me in the situation for a reason! I'm humbled by this ALREADY and this will change me forever. Atleast I'll know my true supporters. Thanks for being one of them.

Thanks

Aaron 81
