Amazon’s new Kindle Fire tablet device that started shipping this week is reportedly selling for almost three dollars less than it costs to manufacture.

The online retailer is initially selling the tablet at a loss that it hopes to cover through sales of books and films for the device, research suggests.

The Kindle Fire costs $201.70 to make, research firm IHS said, but it has attracted a warm industry reception after being priced at only $199.

Manufacturing costs of new gadgets usually come down as chips become cheaper, so Amazon should eventually make a profit at the same price.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in September that the company's goal was to make a small profit from the hardware.

But he added that as a retail company, Amazon was willing to live with a smaller margin than most electronics companies would.

‘We want the hardware device to be profitable and the content to be profitable,' he said. 'We really don't want to subsidise one with the other.'

IHS's estimate includes the cost of components and assembly, but not the costs of development, marketing or packaging.

The most expensive part of the Kindle Fire is the seven-inch colour touch screen, which costs $87.

Amazon kept the cost of the tablet low compared to Apple’ s iPad and similar tablets by making it smaller.

The screen is half the size of that for the iPad, the amount of memory is low and it does not have a camera or microphone.

But the difference in manufacturing cost is much smaller than retail price.

IHS estimates the cost of the basic iPad 2 model at just under $300, while Apple sells it for $499.

The Kindle Fire measures 7.5" x 4.7" x 0.45", weighs 14.6 oz, has 8GB storage and holds a battery life of eight hours.

Amazon’s basic Kindle is used for eBooks but the Kindle Fire will combine this with the ability to play music, films and games and surf the internet.

Users will be able to access more than 18 million films, television shows, songs, apps, games, books and magazines via the Amazon website.
