A boy who stabbed a teenager to death on a bus on his 16th birthday has today been jailed for at least 12 years.

Shawn Green, 16, was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey for a 'senseless act of violence' after he attacked Derek Boateng in broad daylight.

Derek, who was on his way home Hackney, died after being stabbed in the heart on the 393 bus in Highbury New Park at around 3pm on April 23.

The incident happened as Green was coming home from Highbury Grove School and saw Derek, a former pupil at the same school, sitting at the back of the bus.

Green, from Romford, Essex, admitted stabbing Mr Boateng but denied murder on the grounds that he had acted in self defence.

Prosecutor Tom Kark QC said there appeared to have been some 'previous dispute' between the boys.

'The specific circumstances of that may not be very clear and may not matter very much.

'Whatever had gone on before, we say this act was a senseless act of violence. It resulted in the tragic and untimely death of a young boy.

'Furthermore is the sad fact that both the defendant and the victim Derek Boateng were carrying knives and both produced them.

'But the prosecution suggest that it’s clear who was the aggressor in this incident, and that was the defendant.'

The jury were shown CCTV footage of the moment Green pulled a knife from his waistband before attacking Derek.

After being stabbed Derek remained 
standing for a few moments before collapsing from massive internal 
bleeding. He was airlifted to hospital but died the next day.

After the clip was shown the trail had to be halted for 10 minutes as one juror burst into tears.

Mr
Kark told jurors that Green, who has no previous convictions, 
'aggressively' moved past other passengers towards the teenager and 
asked 'something of the nature of ‘do you remember me’?'

He
said the defendant then produced what was described by witnesses as a 
six to eight inch kitchen knife from his clothes and was seen to push it
towards Derek 'two or three times'.

'There was panic, there was shouting and screaming on the bus as the passengers started to realise what was happening,' he said.

The fatal stabbing happened at around 3pm as Green boarded the 393 bus outside his school. He saw Derek, a former pupil of the school, sitting at the back and attacked him in front of other passengers

The barrister said Derek was 'very much hemmed in' where he was sitting, but witnesses told of how he tried to move back towards the window in an attempt to get away from his attacker.

Judge Peter Thornton QC sentenced Green to detention during Her Majesty’s Pleasure with a minimum of 12 years before parole.

The judge said: ‘You were just 15 years old, a schoolboy in uniform, when you stabbed another boy to death on his 16th birthday.

‘With that single blow you took the life of Derek Boateng on his 16th birthday. He had his whole life to look forward to.

‘I have seen no remorse, no expression of regret on your part for the loss of Derek’s life.’

Judge Thornton also lifted a reporting restriction on naming Green, saying that it was in the public interest to know, given that it was a knife crime in a public place.

In an impact statement, Derek’s parents Davis and Comfort, who are originally from Ghana, said: ‘The death of Derek has left our whole family devastated completely. Our world has collapsed right in front of us.’

Following the verdict, detective chief inspector Chris Jones, from Scotland Yard’s homicide and major crime command, said: 'It is dreadful to think that Derek, who was celebrating his 16th birthday, lost his life over nothing more than a brief clash with another teenager.

'This dreadful tragedy has left a family grieving for a much-loved son, brother and friend who had everything to live for.

'The incident has also wrecked another teenager’s life and Derek’s 16-year-old attacker will now spend many years behind bars.

'It demonstrates the devastating consequences of carrying knives and the serious harm it has on our communities.'
