Police are hunting for vandals who wrecked more than a dozen graves at a city cemetery over the New Year.

The thugs did thousands of pounds of damage at Earlham Cemetery in Norwich, which had been left unlocked so that members of the public could visit and mourn their relatives over the festive period.

One man was devastated to discover that three memorials to members of his family had been smashed up - and said the attack had brought him 'heartache and grief'.

A total of 17 headstones - including that of a nine-year-old child - were targeted at the cemetery and the neighbouring crematorium.

The city council had asked the contractor which manages the site to keep it open over Christmas and the New Year so it was accessible to the families of those buried there.

But at some time between Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning, a group of yobs started pulling headstones down and kicking them to break them up.

Joseph Smith drove from Cambridge to Norwich after a cousin told him that three of their family graves had been attacked.

Shattered stones, a broken angel's head and a smashed figure of Jesus now lay where flowers and figurines once stood in memory of his father, grandfather and uncle.

'I don't know what we are going to do,' the 56-year-old said. 'The damage is several thousand pounds.'

Three marble statues of angels, between 4ft and 6ft tall, were pushed over and broken at the Smith family plot.

'What enjoyment can you get out of doing something like that?', Mr Smith added. 'They just cause heartache and grief for the family.'

Mr Smith's father and grandfather, both also called Joseph, were buried in the plot in 1984 and 1968.

His grandmother Violet was added to his grandfather's plot in 1991 and his uncle Levi, whose grave cost £17,000, was laid to rest in 2008.

Mr Smith's wife Elizabeth, 55, said: 'They've been up all these years and you don't expect anything to happen.'

A Norwich City Council spokesman said: 'We find it very sad that a minority of people took it upon themselves to vandalise some of the memorials and show such careless disregard for all that cemeteries stand for and we sympathise with the families involved.

Destroyed: Jason Griffiths went on a bizarre spree ripping up gravestones to the devastation of families

'We asked our contractor to leave the
cemetery gates open over the New Year period so that people could pay 
their respects at any time.

'But by their very nature, cemeteries
are not created to be fortresses. Instead, they are designed to be 
accessible, dignified and peaceful places for anyone who has lost a 
loved one and wants to pay their respects.'

A stonemason was set to visit the cemetery today to start repairing the damage. The contractor said that it would pay the costs of restoring the memorials.

Paul Sanford, of Norfolk Police, branded the yobs 'heartless', saying: 'We take these types of offences extremely seriously and in each case will make every effort to find those responsible.

'We need the public's help in order to do this and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed people acting suspiciously in the area to come forward.'

The attack is reminiscent of a rampage in 2011 which saw Jason Griffiths wreak £100,000 worth of damage at a cemetery in Birmingham.
