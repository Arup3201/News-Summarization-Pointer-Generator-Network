An elderly man broke down in tears on Monday as a jury heard how he was almost carved in half by a mentally-ill man with two power saws on a New York City subway platform.

Michael Steinberg, 70, choked on his emotions at the first day of trial in his suit against an MTA contractor - whom he blames for leaving the power tools unattended - at Manhattan Supreme Court.

He was attacked by  Tareyton Williams as he stood on the platform at 110th Street and Broadway in the early hours of July 6, 2006. He has said he does not blame Williams  for the attack.

Instead, he holds Five Star Electric 
Corp. responsible for failing to lock down the tools and for its staff 
for not coming to help him during the bloody attack.

Victim: Michael Steinberg, pictured recovering in hospital after he was attacked by a saw-wielding madman on a subway platform in 2006, has sobbed in court as the jury heard the details of the horror

'I almost died,' Steinberg told the New York Post outside the court. 'I don't want to live through this 
again. It's just because they don't 
want to reach a settlement of any kind.'

His lawyer, Ronald Landau, added: 'There was nobody and nothing to prevent anybody - crazy person, 
sane person, thief, nonthief - from walking over to those power tools 
and just lifting them off.'

Landau added that Williams had been acting bizarrely before the attack, yelling and pacing.

At court on Monday, the contractor's 
attorney, Barbara Sheehan, said a worker was just two or three feet of 
the tools, when Williams grabbed two saws and unleashed his attack.

'What we have is an unexpected, 
unforeseeable action by somebody who did something that really none of 
us could really conceive of,' Sheehan said.

Locked up: Tareyton Williams, pictured, apologized to Steinberg before he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The victim said he does not blame Williams - rather the MTA contractor for leaving the tools unguarded

Weapon: Police remove one of two sawzall saws from a garbage can after they were ditched Williams

Williams was sentenced to 18 years in
prison for the attack and, before he was locked up, he apologized to 
his victim. Steinberg said he forgave him.

Mr Steinberg said he must now take Valium pills before using the subway to calm him.

On the night of the attack, Mr 
Williams calmly walked towards the 4-foot-11 Mr Steinberg with the two 
chainsaws and began cutting into his chest. The two power saws, called Sawzalls, sliced through his ribs and punctured his lung. 

The elderly New York native begged his attacker to stop carving, offering him cash and credit cards, but he ignored the pleas.

Finally he stopped, said 'now I will take your credit cards and your money' and walked calmly away.

At the time, Mr Steinberg told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help.

Scene: The former postal worker was in the 110th and Broadway station on his way to work when he was attacked with the two saws, and he said contractors just stood back and failed to help him

'I screamed for help. 'Please help! Please help me!' The ... people (construction workers) heard me. They just looked. They never stopped to help me, and that disturbed me more than anything else. I begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me,' he explained to the Post.

Doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper, the postal worker would have been dead.

Williams was arrested after punching a man walking his dog later that day and pleaded guilty to senseless assault.

Steinberg, who was forced to quit his job, said the Transit Authority or Five Star Electric Corp.
have never apologized for allowing the near fatal attack to take place.
