Lukas Podolski says Germany want to win the World Cup to bring 'some joy' to Michael Schumacher.

The stricken F1 legend spent the last six months in intensive care after a skiing accident in December, but it was revealed Schumacher had come out of his coma and left the Grenoble hospital.

That has added extra motivation for Germany to go out and win their Group G opener, as they kick off their World Cup campaign against Portugal on Monday evening.

'Michael Schumacher is as crazy about football as we all are,' said Podolski, speaking to German newspaper Bild.

'Unfortunately he is not doing so well. The DFB (German FA), the team and I continue to wish his family strength.

'We hope he will be back on his feet soon and eventually he will be able to see one of our matches.

'If we win the World Cup then it is something which could give him some joy.'

Podolski, hoping to be part of the action against Portugal in the highly-anticipated clash, thinks Germany are now at a point where they can't not contemplate winning the world's greatest footballing tournament.

'We have reached a point where we can seriously talk about the title,' added Podolski.
