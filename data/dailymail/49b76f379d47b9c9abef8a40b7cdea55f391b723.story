The firm making the sapphire glass integral to Apple's watch has filed for bankruptcy

GT Advanced Technologies was Apple's partner in a sapphire glass plant in
Arizona.

It's 'unscratchable' glass had been rumoured to have been planned for the iPhone 6 - but failed to appear.

Apple's watch was unveiled last month - but now the firm making the glass for it has gone bust

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. 

'It's unbelievable ... I don't think anyone expected this,'
said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in
Las Vegas.

'I can't remember the last time ... well Bear Stearns was
probably the last time, but we were in a financial crisis then.
This was completely out of the blue.'

The stock had more than doubled in the nine months between
November's announcement of the new Arizona plant and the launch
of Apple's new large-screen iPhones on Sept. 9 as investors
hoped GT would replicate Corning Inc's success with
Gorilla Glass.

Since then the stock had slumped 36 percent after GT's
sapphire glass was left out of the new iPhones. 

GT had said a
month earlier that the Arizona plant would not be fully
operational until early 2015.

'It would appear that something very fundamentally broke
down in the relationship between Apple and GT Advanced,' Raymond
James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email.

GT said on Aug. 5 it was expecting Apple to pay it $139
million in connection with the plant. Apple had paid it $439
million totally as of that date.

The company had warned then that costs related to the plant
had a 'significant impact' on its liquidity and results. Still,
it forecast revenue of $600-$700 million for the full year, more
than double the $299 million it reported in 2013.

According to data from Markit, which tracks short interest,
43 percent of GT's shares outstanding were being loaned out for
short bets, a very high level that indicates there were plenty
of investors who thought this stock was headed lower. 

IDC analyst Danielle Levitas told VentureBeat that recent supplier checks spotted ‘several reports of the sapphire failures' ahead of the iPhone launch.

During standard drop tests, the screen was said to have repeatedly cracked, forcing Apple to resort to another method.

VentureBeat additionally reports that the decision to switch screens was made just weeks before the launch event. 

Apple will use a sapphire screen for two of the three
versions of its Apple Watch, which will be available early next
year. It also uses the material on the camera cover and touch
sensor button on its iPhones.

The deal with Apple placed restrictions on GT selling the
sapphire screens for use in certain applications, according to
the company's regulatory filings.

GT gave Apple an exclusive license for certain applicationsof its sapphire glass technology, but the iPad maker had noobligation to buy the glass, according to the filings.

GT, whose subsidiaries also filed for bankruptcy, said it
had $85 million of cash as of Sept. 29. The company had cash and
cash equivalents of $333.1 million as of June 28.

The company has reported a loss for the last four quarters,
but raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted profit
forecast in August, citing higher margins.

GT, which also makes equipment for consumer electronics,
power electronics, solar and LED products, said in its Chapter
11 petition that it had assets of $1.5 billion and liabilities 
of $1.3 billion as of June 28.

The company filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court
in the District of New Hampshire and said it was seeking
debtor-in-possession financing to get access to additional
funds.

GT said it expected the court to authorize it to continue to
conduct business as usual while it reorganized.

By 1:30 p.m. ET, more than 115 million shares had changed
hands, making it the most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq,
despite being halted five times due to excessive volatility.
