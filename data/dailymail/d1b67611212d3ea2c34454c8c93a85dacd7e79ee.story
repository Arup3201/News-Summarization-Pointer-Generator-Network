Actor Damian Lewis has revealed that he dedicated a DVD box set of his hit show Homeland to President Obama with the words: 'From one Muslim to another.'

The actor made the poor taste gag on a British chat-show on Saturday night where he discussed his role ofÂ  Sgt. Nicholas Brody in the popular drama series.

In the drama/thriller, his character Brody is an American prisoner-of-war who converted to Islam and is believed to have been turned by al-Qaeda by one CIA officer.

The Emmy-award winning actor told chat 
show host Jonathan Ross about being invited to a White House dinner in honor of British prime minister David Cameron - and being seated opposite the President.

Obama revealed at the table that Homeland was his favorite TV show. Lewis was then asked to sign a Homeland box set along with co-star Clare Danes, who plays CIA officer Carrie Mathison, by White House staffers.

Lewis said: 'I had to sign a box set of Homeland...apparently the President
 wanted a signed box set. Clare Danes had written on it [to Obama]: ''I was a 
fan of yours long before you were a fan of ours.''

'I
 tried to think of something classy and wrote: ''From one Muslim to 
another'' in an inedible Sharpie. And I couldn't take it back.'

The actor added: 'I was then writing emails for the whole of the next week saying: ''I do hope he understands irony.'''

Spielberg's series Band of Brothers, scooped the Best Actor Emmy for his
 portrayal of Sgt Brody in the first series of Homeland.

After
 President Obama revealed the series was his favorite show, Lewis and his
 actress wife Helen McCrory were invited to the glamorous White House dinner in a marquee on the South Lawn.

Lewis said the President told him that he watched Homeland on Saturday 
afternoons in the Oval Office while Michelle, Sasha and Malia went to 
play tennis and the President was 'pretending to work'.
