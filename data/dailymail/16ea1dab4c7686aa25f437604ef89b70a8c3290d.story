Roland Mouret earned himself the much coveted title of 'King of the dress' after his Galaxy frock was named the ‘garment 
of the decade’ and worn by every A-lister in tinsel town in the Noughties.

But after selling his eponymous label at the height of his success the French designer decided to take a few years out of the spotlight.

Now Roland, whose fans include the Duchess of Cambridge, Victoria Beckham and Cameron Diaz, has returned with an elegant and stylish Resort 2015 collection which he showed in London on Wednesday to a 'FROW' of fashionable friends.

Roland returns: After a few years out of the glare of the spotlight designer Roland Mouret is back and showed a brand new collection on Thursday in London

Sitting pretty on his front row were Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who shot to fame as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish film adaptations of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as well as British actress Sharon Maughan, Sophie Turner, best known for her role as Sansa Stark on the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones, and actress Alice Eve.

Speaking to Vogue.co.uk ahead of his show, he said he absolutely loves being in London.

Giving his reasons why, he said: 'The fact that it pushes me to think outside of the box. I always have to work hard. If not London then Suffolk. There, I can just be Roland.'

Loved by celebrities including Blake 
Lively and Halle Berry, Mr Mouret, 52, has long been in 
the business of designing dresses for real women.

Using an hourglass silhouette, his dresses fit women, regardless of weight or size, like a glove.

Clearly confident in the power of his designs, he said: 'I'm very lucky - my glass is always half full and not half empty. I have seen so many people wearing it that I don't feel I'm chasing anyone.'

If you can't afford his designer designs, he also has a purse-friendly collection of figure-hugging dresses for Banana Republic.

Bringing
 his high-end graphic tailoring to to fast fashion, the 25-piece 
collection, which is set to launch worldwide in August, will range from £29 for belts to £99 for a dress; a far cry from the designer's usual £1,000 price tags.

The 25-piece Banana Republic collection, which is set to launch 
worldwide in August, will range from $49.50 for belts to $165 for a 
dress; a far cry from the designer's usual $1,500 price tags

'Roland is famous for his dresses and we
have a very successful dress business,' Banana Republic's vice 
president of women’s design, Melloney Birkett, told WWD.

But the French fashion designer emphasized that his collection for Banana Republic, which will also include skirts, tops, pants and sweaters, is 'not a copy of my clothes in a less expensive [version], but the 
experience of a fitted dress for the Banana Republic customer.'

Famous fans: The designer's dresses have
 been worn by a host of A-list celebrities and are known for their 
flattering shape and design
