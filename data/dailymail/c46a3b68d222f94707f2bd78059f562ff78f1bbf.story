For most fathers, today is about spending time with their children and enjoying the influx of gifts and cards, but for one parent, Father's Day is one he thought he would never get to celebrate at all.

Kevin Byrne, from Soham in Cambridgeshire, was diagnosed with non-Hogkin's lymphoma aged four and was told at 16 that he would never be a father.

Today, however, Mr Byrne, 38, is celebrating his first Father's Day as a parent after a pioneering fertility treatment led to the birth of his baby son.

Kevin Byrne, centre, had been told that he would never be a father, but today he proudly shows his son Arthur, right, with wife Natalie, after he underwent pioneering fertility treatment

Now enjoying life with baby Arthur and wife Natalie, Mr Byrne says he hoped his decision to seek treatment might help others.

'He's a very special little boy,' said the overjoyed father. 'I was concerned my family line would stop with me, but now Arthur is here, he can go on to have a family of his own.

'Being a parent - something I never thought would happen for me - is simply incredible.'

And it's all the more so given the hurdles Mr and Mrs Byrne have had to overcome. Although Mr Byrne's sperm was all but destroyed during treatment for cancer - leaving him infertile.

'I knew it was unlikely that I would be producing sperm but the 
results still come as a blow,' he says of the moment he was given the bad news. 'I was disappointed but not surprised.

'I
 felt particularly bad for Natalie, as she was more hopeful then I was 
about the result and was quite upset.

'We talked about adoption but 
decided we wanted to try IVF with a sperm donor first so went to our 
local hospital for further fertility testing.'

Although the couple were resigned to using donor sperm but experts at Bourn Hall, a fertility clinic near Cambridge, suggested they try a new procedure known as testicular sperm extraction.

Kevin Byrne, right, developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a four year old and was told he would never be a father as a result, however, Dr Oliver Wiseman, left, was able to use a new technique to make his dream true

There are 
several methods of surgical sperm retrieval, which is used when there 
are no sperm in the ejaculate - this includes removing sperm from liquid
 in the epididymis where it is stored, or by extracting immature sperm 
from tiny pieces of testicular tissue where it is made.

Incredibly, much to their delight, an operation 18 months ago, doctors successfully found sperm, which was then frozen until the Byrnes were ready to start a family

'I was worried Kevin might not bond with a child that wasn't his
 own,' adds Mrs Byrne. 'He was realistic and stoical about the whole thing - but I was 
disappointed for him.'

Happily for the Byrnes, the treatment worked and baby Arthur was born by caesarian section in November last year.

The couple's consultant, Oliver Wiseman, said the case illustrated how difficult men found it to confront the issue of infertility.

He added: 'For many, an appointment with me is the first time they've been able to freely ask questions without embarrassment and often don't realise just how common the problems are.'

Mr Wiseman said couples struggling to conceive should take an equal role investigating the causes of infertility.

'Boosting fertility with good diet and improving general health can increase the chances of natural conception,' he added.

'Couples should also consider having a semen analysis as this can identify or eliminate issues early on and determine if further medical help may be required.

'If there is a problem with the sperm count, then patients should be seen by a male fertility specialist.'
