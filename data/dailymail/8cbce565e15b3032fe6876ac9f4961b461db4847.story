West Brom are leading the chase for Wolves winger Bakary Sako whose contract at Molineux runs out in the summer and is regarded as being among the most attractive Bosman signings in the next transfer window.

Albion are already looking towards next season with their Premier League status virtually assured under Tony Pulis and have put the 26-year-old Mali international winger top of their wish-list.

The traditional rivalry between Wolves and West Brom is not seen as an issue with Sako undergoing his footballing development at French club St Etienne before arriving in the west Midlands in 2012.

The 26-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and will be available on a free transfer

In addition to blistering pace and quick footwork, Sako is a regular goalscorer and had found the net 12 times this season as Wolves have enjoyed an impressive return to the Championship after being relegated two seasons ago.

Wolves have accepted they are unlikely to be able to persuade Sako to stay given that there is Premier League interest in him - unless they make a late run into the play-offs and are promoted themselves.

Albion are clear favourites to land the player if he decides to stay in England but there could also be rival interest from abroad.
