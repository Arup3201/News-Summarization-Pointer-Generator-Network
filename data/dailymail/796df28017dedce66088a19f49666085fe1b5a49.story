Johnny Football is moving on to the National Football League, according to a Texas A&M teammate.

Aggies wide receiver Ricky Seals-Jones said star quarterback Johnny Manziel is ‘gone’ while talking during a Friday evening high school basketball broadcast.

Mr Manziel has not publicly commented on whether he plans to declare for the NFL Draft, and even deflected questions about his intentions after a thrilling win over Duke in the Chick-Fil-A bowl earlier this week.

King of the hill: Johnny Manziel's final college game may have been the thrilling 21 point comeback win over Duke in the Chick-Fil-A Bowl on New Year's Eve

Mr Seals-Jones was asked about Texas A&M quarterbacks next season during Friday’s Sealy High School (TX) boys’ basketball broadcast – he did not mention Johnny football.

‘Do we have a scoop?’ One of the broadcasters asked, noticing the former Heisman winner wasn’t mentioned. ‘Did I just hear Johnny Manziel not being mentioned for next year?’

‘Johnny’s gone,’ the wide receiver said, according to the Houston Chronicle. ‘He’s gone.’

Mr Seals-Jones starred for Sealy prior to college, and was visiting the Houston-area high school and even laughed when he made the off-the-cuff remark.

The star player declined to comment about his future in the locker room after leading the Aggies to a 21 point comeback New Year’s Eve win over Duke.

‘I can’t even think about anything other than this game right now,’ Mr Manziel said when asked if he would leave college for the NFL. ‘It’s unreal. I love Texas A&M. I love my teammates. I love ‘em more than anything on the face of this earth.’

Mr Manziel has not publicly commented, nor has anyone else close to him or within the Texas A&M football program.

When asked December 11 if he thought he was ready for the pros, Mr Manziel said ‘I think I am,’ according to an NFL.com report.

‘All the draft stuff will come eventually,’ the star player added. ‘It's something I'm trying to push off for a while.’

He has until January 15 to decide.
