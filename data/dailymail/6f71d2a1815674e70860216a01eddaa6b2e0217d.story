Young mother: Janine Mallett was discovered on Saturday morning by the main beach of San Antonio, Ibiza

A British mother of two who drowned after going for a late night swim in Ibiza had taken a cocktail of illegal drugs, it has emerged.

The body of Janine Mallett, 31, was found washed up on S’Arenal - the main beach of party resort San Antonio - at 11am on Saturday.

Preliminary autopsy results published by the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ibiza revealed the cause of death as drowning.

But a urine sample also revealed she had taken four different drugs - cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines and methamphetamine -  in the preceding hours.

Blood and urine samples are now being sent to the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Science in Barcelona to confirm the findings.

Police initially launched an investigation into Mrs Mallet's death at the weekend.

But it is understood they have since ruled out foul play.

The Diario de Ibiza website reports that Mallett, from Stockton-on-Tees, was staying with friends in a holiday apartment in San Antonio.

For reasons currently unknown, Mallet became separated from the group and ended up on the beach alone.

She is believed to have gone into the sea for a swim at around 4am. She was found seven hours later at 11am.

Previous reports revealed that Mrs Mallett lived with electrician husband Iain, 30, and her two children - a three-year-old boy and six-year-old girl.

Her mother, Colleen Hadfield, 62, said: ‘She was the most lovely person. She was beautiful. We are just waiting to see when we can bring her home.’

Neighbour Pauline Kelsey, 61, who lives two doors down said: ‘I have known Iain and his family since he was a kid. Janine has got two children - a boy and a girl.

‘They are beautiful. She would do anything for anyone. She is beautiful, she has always been really nice. There is nothing you can say, is there. It is total devastation.’

She said: ‘They are a young family - I can’t believe it. She would help anybody, she was that kind of young lady. She was always very smart.’

Her husband Bob Kelsey, 63, a professional driver, said: ‘You couldn’t ask for better neighbours. We are totally shocked. She is only a young girl. You don’t expect things like this.’

A female friend of married Janine, who had flown to Ibiza with her on Thursday, has told police she lost sight of her during the night while they were out partying.

Her body was discovered on Saturday morning just before 11am off S’Arenal beach, the main beach of party resort San Antonio.

A source said: ‘Janine was with a female friend. They went out and got separated from each other and the friend went back to the hotel alone just before 1am on Saturday morning with no idea where Janine was.

‘They hadn’t spoken about going swimming as far as I know so it’s a mystery as to how Janine’s body came to be in the sea. The friend is obviously devastated.’

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza .We are offering consular assistance to the family.’
