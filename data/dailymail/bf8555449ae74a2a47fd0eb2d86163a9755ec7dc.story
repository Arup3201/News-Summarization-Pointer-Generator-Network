If there is anywhere in Spanish football where faith alone can move mountains it's at Atletico Madrid.

And when Real Madrid take on their city neighbours in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey they will face a club riding a wave of Fernando Torres euphoria, convinced he can roll back the years on a dramatic home debut.

They know deep down that four years have passed since Torres was at anywhere near his best and in the long run he is likely to be the club's first reserve behind Mario Mandzukic.

But with the Croatian striker rested and the 30-year Spain international they are still calling 'The Kid' not looking all that different to the boy wonder that left them in 2007, they are backing him to help them roll over Real for a third time this season. 

Fernando Torres will make his second debut for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey

Torres has returned to the club following a disappointing spell in Serie A with AC Milan

Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gamez, Godin, Gimenez, Juanfran; Raul Garcia, Mario Suarez, Gabi, Saul; Torres, Griezmann

Real Madrid: Navas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Khedira, Kroos, James; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo 

Atletico have already beaten Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup and in the league and Diego Simeone has thrust Torres straight into his starting line-up knowing that leaving him on the bench might have broken the momentum built up around his arrival.

'If he didn't think he was ready I wouldn't put him in,' he said, suggesting that Torres will give Atletico back the option of that long pass over the top of a defence that they have lost since the departure of Diego Costa.

Torres spent seven years with Atletico before leaving to join Liverpool in the Premier League in 2007

Torres scored 91 goals for the club and became a fans' favourite before leaving for England

Torres does have 10 Serie A games under his belt this season but he only scored once for Milan and they were as happy to let him leave as Chelsea were. None of that is bothering Simeone who has seen how his arrival has lifted everyone at the club.

Over 2,000 No 19 replica shirts were sold on Sunday when 45,000 people packed into the Calderon to see him run back out on to the pitch where he made his debut while Simeone was still an Atletico player. 

The Argentine coach said: 'I have good memories of him. When we were both players we got on very well. So much happened to him at a very young age, now he is 30 but he still has the desire and the enthusiasm.'

Those at the club slightly distanced from the euphoria see Torres serving an important purpose even if he doesn't hit the highs of his first period at the Calderon. In last season's Champions League final against Real Madrid, Atletico played an unfit Diego Costa and paid the price when he hobbled off no sooner had the game started.

Gareth Bale will also feature as Real Madrid  look to bounce back from their defeat by Valencia

That left them a substitute short in extra-time when they ran out of energy and were well beaten by Real. Torres gives them experience and goals – although he has only ever scored twice against the old enemy and one of those goals came when he was  at Liverpool.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has only got the better of Simeone three times in eight meetings since arriving in Spain and will stick with his tried and trusted BBC front three of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite criticism of Bale after Sunday's defeat to Valencia when he failed to play in a team-mate and ended up missing the perfect chance to score. 

Sami Khedira looks set to be drafted into midfield to strengthen a side that broke a run of 22 straight wins with that reverse at Mestalla.

There is no Sergio Ramos so Pepe and Raphael Varane will be waiting for Torres. 

Atletico's prodigal son is back. The club's famed fitness coach Oscar Ortega has not had long to work with Torres but has already drilled him on the runs his team-mates will be expecting from him tonight. All that remains is to test the nostalgia against the reality. 

'He has not come as the saviour,' said Simeone when he signed. 

That maybe true in the long run but tonight, Atletico expects.
