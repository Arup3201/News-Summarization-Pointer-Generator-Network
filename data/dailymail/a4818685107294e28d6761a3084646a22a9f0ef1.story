A woman died after her hijab caught fire on a gas cooker - and she had accidentally set her clothes alight in similar situations three times before, an inquest heard yesterday.

Surayya Khan's family has helped to launch a safety campaign urging the importance of being aware of fire risk in the kitchen.

The mother of three fought for life for nearly two weeks before dying of multiple organ failure at a Manchester hospital in October last year.

Death: The street in Burton, Staffordshire where Surayya Khan set herself alight while cooking in her kitchen

Mrs Khan, 67, was cooking at her home in Burton, Staffordshire on September 23 when the headscarf she wore as a Muslim woman came into contact with a gas hob.

Her husband Mohammed struggled frantically to save her life, but she suffered severe burns to her head and neck.

The fire victim was taken to Burton Queen's Hospital by paramedics, but later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester for specialist treatment.

Mrs Khan was placed in an induced coma and died on October 5.

Fire investigator Lee Dugmore told the inquest into her death: 'Mr Khan found his wife with her clothes on fire. He removed his pullover and used it to smother the fire.

'Mrs Khan had a history of lapses in concentration. She would place her hands on the cooker for support. The most likely cause is the transfer of the naked flame from the gas hob to her clothing.'

Mr Khan burnt both his hands attempting to smother the flames, and one of couple's daughters applied water to Mrs Khan's burns as they waited for an ambulance to arrive.

Mr Dugmore revealed that it was thought Mrs Khan's headscarf had caught fire three times while she was cooking during the two years before her death. 'She would extinguish it with her hands or by moving to the sink,' he said.

South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: 'Despite treatment she did not recover. This death resulted from a genuine tragic accident.'

He praised Mr Khan's efforts to save his wife, putting himself in danger and sustaining 'serious burns' himself.

Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service this week returned to the family's home to fit specialist smoke alarms, as Mr Khan suffers from hearing difficulties.

Mrs Khan's death led to a campaign by fire safety officials warning people of the dangers of cooking while wearing loose clothing.

As part of the campaign, her daughter Rukhsana said last October: We are devastated by the loss of our mother, but if we can help to prevent any other family from going through what we are it will be worth it.

'Saris and headscarves are loose items of clothing which could catch fire if you get too close so I would just like to remind people to take extra care in the kitchen, make sure your personal safety is your priority.'
