Microsoft's Surface tablet will cost between £399 and £559 ($499 to $699 in the US) when it goes on sale on October 26th, the firm said today.

The price is the same as the cheapest third generation iPad, and will put the two firms into a head to head battle.

The Surface will go on sale the same day Microsoft releases Windows 8, the new version of its desktop computer software - and three days after Apple is expected to introduce a cheaper, mini version of its iPad.

Microsoft's Surface will cost between £399 and £559 when it goes on sale in the UK later this month

The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware.

Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM 
Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is
not compatible with old Microsoft applications.

However,
the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such
as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and 
music apps.

The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only.

Microsoft has made no mention of a wireless-enabled version.

It will also launch just a day after Amazon launches it popular range of Fire tablets in the UK for the first time.

Experts say the price could lead to major problems for Microsoft.

The firm waited until today to reveal it, despite having unveiled the tablet last month.

'It is priced the same as the iPad 3, even though the Surface has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the iPad's 16gb,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint.

'However, the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it's a straight choice between an iPad and Surface, and I think the majority of people will choose an iPad - they just won't be aware of a spec fight.'

'If you've used Windows Phone the Surface is easier to use, but not many people have - and people love or hate it.' 

The software giant also showed the first TV ad for its tablet, heralding the start of what some believe could be a $400m ad push for Surface and Windows 8.

The dancing based ad was shown in a prime TV slot during the US version of Dancing With The Stars.

The advert begins with a single user snapping on the keyboard to a Surface tablet.

It
then sees dozens of dancers creating a complex dance routine using the 
gadgets, with everyone from families to dancing schoolgirls using them.

The first advert focuses on the surface tablet's keyboard, which Microsoft believes will give it an advantage over the iPad

The latest adverts are expected to be the first of many as the firm makes final preparations for the launches of Windows 8 and the Surface tablet.

Some US experts believe the firm could have an advertising budget of up to $400m for the launch.

Yesterday the firm announced details of the music service the tablet will have, Xbox Music.

Although access to Microsoft's Surface tablet has been tightly controlled, we were able to try the software it will run on a Samsung tablet.

The biggest problem Microsoft faces is, without doubt, first impressions.

While everyone from toddlers to grannies can instantly use an iPad without being taught, the Windows software we used was a different story. 

It was confusing and unintuitive at first - with even the simplest task not easy to do without being shown how.

It is, like Microsoft's mobile phone software, extremely slick and well though out once you get used to it - but the problem Microsoft faces is how to get consumers to give it a go, when the alternative is an iPad the entire family can instantly pick up and use.

It boasts 30 million songs, with a free ad version and a paid £8.99 ($9.99) version being available when Windows 8 launches.

The paid subscription is also 
required if you want to use Xbox Music on the Xbox 360 game console or 
on smartphones that use Windows Phone.

On the game console, an Xbox Live Gold membership is also required.

Current
users of the Xbox - about 66 million worldwide - will gradually be 
introduced to the service with a 30-day free trial starting today.

The ad is expected to be the first of many promoting the Surface tablet
