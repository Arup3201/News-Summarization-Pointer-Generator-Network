This is the touching moment a NASCAR driver kissed his girlfriend who is battling Stage III ovarian cancer just seconds before competing in a race.

Martin Truex Jr, 34, was captured embracing his long-time partner, Sherry Pollex, in glorious sunshine before the green flag dropped at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia.

It was just the third time Miss Pollex had been at a race track since she underwent life-saving surgery on August 15 following months of doctors visits with no answers.

Donning a large hat to protect her head from the sun, the 35-year-old beamed as she greeted friends, some of whom she was seeing for the first time since her devastating diagnosis.

Before her boyfriend of eight years took to the track, she also joined him in singing along to the national anthem, and offered him a final word of support.

Truex and his Furniture Row Racing Sprint Cup team placed 26th in the Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500 on Sunday, which was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr, his 23rd NASCAR Sprint Cup victory.

Later in the day, Miss Pollex, who was wearing a blonde wig, tweeted about the day's events, saying: 'What a beautiful day for a race! I'm SO happy to be here in Martinsville!'

Miss Pollex, from North Carolina, who runs the popular Mooresville boutique shop, Lavendar, and whose father, Greg, owned a NASCAR team from 1993 to 2006, started feeling ill in mid-summer.

In good spirits: Later in the day, Miss Pollex took to Twitter to express her delight at being able to witness the event, saying: 'What a beautiful day for a race! I'm SO happy to be here in Martinsville!'

Thankful: A week earlier, while at Talladega Superspeedway, Miss Pollex tweeted: 'Feels SO good to be back at the track to see all my friends. God is good.' She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment

She and Truex had just started thinking about having their first child, so she initially thought she might be pregnant. But after visiting a number of doctors, she still had no definitive answer.

'She had gone to three or four doctors, and they couldn't figure out what was going on,' Truex, a two-time Nationwide Series champion (in 2004 and 2005), told USA Today.

"This went on for a couple of months. Finally, we got her to a surgeon - a friend of a friend - in Lake Norman. He said right away, "Let's do a CT scan". 

Two hours after the scan in early August, the surgeon called the couple and asked them to come to his office. He then delivered the shocking blow - Miss Pollex had ovarian cancer.

Together: Miss Pollex is one of around 22,000 U.S. women to be struck down with ovarian cancer annually, according to the American Cancer Society. Above, the businesswoman and Truex are pictured in 2007

Miss Pollex - one of around 22,000 U.S. women to be struck down with the disease annually, according to the American Cancer Society - immediately asked doctors if she could save her eggs.

However, she was told she would die if her surgery was delayed

'I don't know what hit me worse – the devastation that I couldn't carry my own child or the devastation that I had Stage III cancer. To hear all that in a matter of five minutes - it was so hard,' she said.

During the lengthy operation, Miss Pollex's appendix, spleen, ovaries, Fallopian tubes and parts of her stomach were removed. It was eight days before she was well enough to leave hospital.

Four weeks later, she started weekly chemotherapy treatments, that will last until January. These involve receiving medicine through a port in her stomach.

Miss Pollex, a native of Michigan, told the newspaper her reaction to the treatment has been relatively mild, but she has lost her hair, dropped in weight and tires easily. 

She said the slower lifestyle was a huge contrast from her previous way of living life 'in fourth gear', co-founding and running the Martin Truex Jr Foundation alongside her own business.

Over the past seven years, the Foundation has assisted many children who have been affected by pediatric cancer, as well as their families.

Miss Pollex is now working closely with the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance to promote awareness of the deadly disease, which is not often spoken about. 

'I don't know if I'm going to be here in five years. I don't know if I'm going to be here in two years,' she said.

'All I can do right now is fight and try to help other women so they don't make the same mistake.'

Symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full quickly, fatigue and the need to urinate urgently or more often.

Miss Pollex and Truex, who met around eight years ago when she was working in racing public relations and he was trying to build his career on-track, live in Mooresville.
