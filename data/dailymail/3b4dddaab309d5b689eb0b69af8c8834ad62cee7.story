When it comes to pelting food at one another, the Spanish are the most experienced.

In a similar tradition to the tomato throwing festival in August, revelers in the south-eastern town of Ibis, dress in mock military uniforms to take part in the battle of 'Enfarinats' - a flour fight.

The citizens annually celebrate the Els Enfarinats, a 200-year-old traditional festival part of the celebrations of the Day of the Innocents, with a battle using flour, eggs and firecrackers outside the city town hall.

Battle: The bizarre celebrations took place in the Spanish town of Ibi

Recipe: The tradition sees citizens pelt each other with flour and eggs

Prepared: A man protected by goggles and a helmet takes his weapon - a box of eggs - into battle 

The fight, where 'soldiers' also spray fire extinguishers, is accompanied by a day of celebrations including fireworks and a mock election.

At 8am, the Els Enfarinats take the city under the slogan 'New Justice', and an hour later the 'Race for Mayor' takes place in which they decide who will be the 'leader; of the Els Enfarinats.

Then, the act of L'Aixavegó is carried out in the Plaça de l'Església (Church Square), where the Els Enfarinats reside.

Here, it is decided that those who do not pay the fine will go to jail. At midday, a collection called the Arreplegada dels Enfarinats takes place through the streets of the old quarter and of the city centre of Ibi, terminating in the Sant Joaquim Sanctuary.

Chaos: It is a 200-year-old tradition and is accompanied by a day of celebrations

Alight: The revellers also set boxes on fire during the celebrations

Covered: The participants leave the fight covered in the mixture of flour and eggs

Not holding back: One fighter smashes a whole box of eggs over another participant

They exercise their authority under a blaze of fireworks, flour bombs and eggs. At 5pm the authority of Els Enfarinats comes to an end giving way to the celebration of the traditional Dansà.

The Spanish are known for their bizarre food-throwing traditions.

Every year they launch tomatoes at each other during the Tomatina Festival which takes place in the town of Bunol in August every year.

Colours: Face paint and hats are also part of the celebratory outfits

Hiding: One man in a helmet sneaks away from the action and leans against a wall

Safety: A firefighter assists the revellers as they start use a fire cracker

Rest: The 'soliders' take a break from the throwing and try to clean themselves off

Bit too far? One of the participants sprays a fire extinguisher at another holding a box of eggs

Assessing the damage: This man lifts the hat and sunglasses of his head to survey the battle scene

Improvisation: A man wearing a balaclava and military uniform takes his flour from a coffee cup

Signal: A smoke bomb is ignited as the battle in the Spanish town heats up

Can't escape: A solider is it in the back by clumps of flour

Secure: A man wearing a tie and smart coat holds his hat on as a smoke bomb is set off next to him

Balance: This man falls to floor next to another participant who looks surprisingly clean

Keeled over: This man appears to be hurt and is comforted by another reveller

No stopping me: Even the town's citizens who are confined to wheelchairs take part

Injury: This man seems to have been cut in the face during the festivities

Hosed down: Another man takes out a fire-extinguisher and sprays a fellow reveler

Fog: The scene around the town square's fountain is blurred by the fire extinguisher

In flight: A man launches some eggs into the air during the fight

Surrounded: A man stands in the centre of the town square with an egg in hand, ready to throw

Wheeled away: A man takes one of the revellers away from the battle scene
