Former guards at the death camp that has become the most enduring symbol of the Holocaust could face prosecution almost seven decades after the fall of the Nazi regime.

Germany’s Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist (Nazi) Crimes is set to begin proceedings against 50 former guards at the notorious concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.

Kurt Schrimm, the head of the office, says staff scoured records and documents from the horrific era and travelled to Poland to create the list of living guards, reports the New York Times.

The investigators now have to cross-reference the list against those who were tried by the Allies or the German legal system.

'We have to determine now whether or not these 50 people that we found on this list can be legally prosecuted,' Mr. Schrimm said yesterday.

One of the driving influences behind the list was the case of Nazi concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk, who was found guilty of 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder two years ago and sentenced to five years in jail.

Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was a guard at Sobibor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.

The retired car-plant worker from Ohio was deported to Germany and convicted in Munich in May last year of 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder and sentenced to five years in jail. He died last year.

Mr Schrimm added that the list includes some new names, as well as a number that have been known to his office since the Auschwitz trials in the 1960s.

The move has been applauded by Efraim Zuroff at the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center.

He said: 'We’re very happy that this thing is happening.'

'It’s definitely the right thing to do. But the real test of the initiative will come when these cases are turned over to the prosecutors.'

Some have called for a different, softer approach to the remaining, elderly, supporters of the Nazis, something similar to South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which probed Apartheid in South Africa after it fell.

Such a move is not acceptable to Mr Zuroff. 'It’s good for countries where there’s apartheid,' Mr. Zuroff said. 'Not where there’s genocide.'

Nearly a million people were estimated to have died at Auschwitz, and between 15 and 20 million died as a result of the Holocaust.
