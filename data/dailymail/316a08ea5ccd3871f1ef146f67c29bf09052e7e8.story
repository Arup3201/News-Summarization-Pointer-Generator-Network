Tragic: Schoolboy Shane Jeavons was killed when he played a game of chicken on a busy road after drinking with friends

A teenager was hit by a car and killed after playing a drunken game of chicken on a busy road.

Shane Jeavons, 14, had been drinking lager with friends in a park before he was knocked down in September last year, an inquest has heard.

The schoolboy, who suffered from an eye condition but was not wearing his glasses at the time of the incident, was fatally injured when he sprinted into the road in Solihull, West Midlands.

He was taken to Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham but later died.

The court heard that Shane, a pupil at Lode Heath Secondary School, had been drinking with friends in Hermitage Park in the town and decided to play chicken on the road as the group left the park at around 9.45pm.

West Midlands Police Detective Constable Amy Walker told the inquest Shane's friends told her he was 'drunk' when they left the park.

Asked by the coroner to recount what she was told by Shane's friends, Det Con Walker said: 'He was running from one side of the road to another on his own while the cars were coming.

'He ran around a tree and didn't look when he ran across the road.'

Blood tests revealed that Shane was over the drink drive limit when he was injured.

Driver Jermaine Willmott was travelling below the 30mph speed limit but had been unable to avoid hitting Shane.

He told Birmingham Coroner's Court: 'All of a sudden a shadow came from my right and, boom, something hit my car.

Deadly game: The teenager is said to have 'sprinted' into this busy road by crash investigators

'I pulled over, got out and saw the situation I was in. I just remember a girl asking me to call his dad.

'I said: "No, we need to call an ambulance".'

Crash investigator PC Mark Weaver said it appeared Shane had left his friends on the pavement, 'sprinted' across the road and was returning to the group when he was hit by Mr Willmott's car.

When asked about youngsters playing 'chicken', PC Weaver said: 'I have heard of the game and, sadly, have dealt with some deaths, with the last one being in 2012.

'The majority of people who play this game are children.'

PC Christopher Blout added: 'It has occurred all through my career and is mainly played by youths.

'We have been in touch with Solihull local authority and have a meeting set up to discuss the education of youths and children in schools.'

Deputy Coroner Sarah Ormond Walshe recorded a verdict of accidental death and said that Shane's alcohol consumption and failure to wear his glasses had contributed to his death.
