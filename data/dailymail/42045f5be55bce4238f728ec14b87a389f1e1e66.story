He may have been living in Mark Wright's perma-tanned shadow when he first found fame on TOWIE but Joey Essex has become a star in his own right.

The 23-year-old star of The Only Way Is Essex, whose penchant for the phrase 'reem' and inability to tell the time won over the nation, is ready to be taken seriously.

Joey has landed his first-ever modelling contract with top agency Select Model Management, who represent David Gandy - the highest earning male model in the world.

Looking reem! Joey Essex has landed himself a modelling contract with prestigious Select Model Management, who also represent the likes of David Gandy and Jamie Dornan

Joey has ditched the fake tan, teeth whitener and bouffant hair for his new photoshoot within the Select Special Division.

His debut shoot was captured by Elliott Morgan, who has worked with Daniel Radcliffe, Professor Green and One Direction, and styled by Kyran Low, who has dressed X Factor stars and Douglas Booth. 

Joey is in good company. Select represent the likes of David 
Gandy, Fifty Shades Of Grey hunk Jamie Dornan, Pixie Lott's boyfriend and M&S stalwart Oliver Cheshire, and Sacha M’baye - the first ever black male model to shoot for Burberry.

Check out that bone structure! Joey, 23, may have been the brunt of jokes on TOWIE but who's laughing now?

You could grate cheese on those: Joey has clearly been taking his exercise regime a lot more seriously since leaving the show. Here, he displays his killer abs

Speaking 
about their latest signing, a spokesperson for Select Men told 
MailOnline: 'We are really happy about having Joey Essex on board .

'We
 are a tough agency and are renowned for creating stars. As an agency, 
our reputation for booking fragrances/campaigns and film has created 
the biggest names in the industry.

'We
 saw Joey's potential for world domination with his huge UK following. Select Men will take him to the next level and make him a global star.'

Joey's agent, who commented on his behalf, said: 'We have a finely tuned business plan for Joey and the modelling is the next step on his wish list of things to do.' 

Stylish: Joey, who is a big fan of fashion, models seasonal trends including the coveted bucket hat, which is set to make a comeback this season (you heard it here first!)

Joey, 
known in Romford for his impeccable style, is no stranger to the world 
fashion. This is the man who even goes so far as to wear shoes two sizes
 too small because he doesn't want people to think he has feet like a 
clown, after all.

Despite leaving the ITV2 show, Joey's career is going from strength to strength and this campaign is a case in point.

He's
 also made a foray into the beauty world by creating a haircare range 
called A-Lister Locks For Her and D’Reem For Him available at Tesco.

Big year ahead: The star of I'm A Celebrity looks set to have a lucrative year with his autobiography coming out

His agent today confirmed that ITV bosses have given the go 
ahead to film a second series of Educating Joey Essex, which will take 
place in Brazil alongside the World Cup.

'Joey has always been very passionate 
about his fashion and he is very happy to have a modelling agent on 
board. This will run parallel with other projects this year including 
filming his new show Educating Joey Essex for ITV2,' he told MailOnline.

The I'm A Celebrity contestant has a 
busy summer coming up if that is the case, as his first book is due to 
hit bookshelves in the spring, too.

Joey's
autobiography is out on the 22nd of May. Entitled Being Reem, of course, the £6.99 tome 
will document his life up until now, including his time on The Only Way 
Is Essex, inside the I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here jungle and 
making his own show, Educating Joey Essex.

He's on a roll: It is also rumoured that ITV bosses have given the go ahead to film a second series of Educating Joey Essex, which will take place in Brazil alongside the world cup

Is that the same guy? Joey has been treated to a style overhaul in his new shoot, left, a far cry from when he started out on TOWIE a few short years ago, right

Watch out, David Gandy! Joey could well be following in the footsteps of the world's best paid male model after joining his agency
