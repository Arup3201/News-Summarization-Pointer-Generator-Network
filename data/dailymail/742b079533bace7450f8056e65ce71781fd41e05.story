As the White House sews together a patchwork of agency responses to the Ebola epidemic, Sen. John McCain and other Republican lawmakers are demanding that President Obama appoint a single 'Ebola czar' to oversee the government's efforts to contain the virus.

'From spending time here in Arizona, my constituents are not comforted,' McCain, an Arizona Republican, said Sunday on CNN. 'There has to be more reassurance given to them. I would say we don't know exactly who's in charge. There has to be some kind of czar.'

That represents a 180-degree turn from McCain's view in 2009, when he lambasted the administration for taking a 'czar' approach to everything from drugs and green jobs to the Great Lakes and California's water supply.

'Obama has more czars than the Romanovs – who ruled Russia for 3 centuries,' he tweeted during Obama's first year in office. 'Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20.'

President Barack Obama and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell participated in a conference call with CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden on Monday as media and Congress alike wondered who's calling the shots

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain insisted on Sunday that he would 'like to know who's in charge' of the White House's Ebola plan

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Thomas Frieden gave an Ebola briefing on Monday but offered little new information as America's first native Ebola victim was named publicly

From a distance: President Barack Obama spoke with his Health and Human Services secretary on Sunday but journalists were only allowed to photograph him from outside the Oval Office for about 40 seconds

The White House has described its Ebola efforts as a 'whole-government approach,' relying alternatively on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Council, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and the Pentagon for strategic advice and tactical options.

Obama took a Sunday conference call with HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who moved over from the White House budget director post in June and is seen as three-parts administrator, zero-parts public health expert.

On Monday he will meet with 'senior members of his administration,' according to the White House, 'to receive an update on the Administration’s response to the Ebola case in Dallas and broader efforts to ensure the preparedness of our national health infrastructure.'

He last convened that group a week ago. 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Oct. 6 that Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco is 'the point person here at the White House who is coordinating the interagency response to this effort.'

'But again,' he said in his next breath, 'it’s USAID that is the point on the ground.'

The Department of Defense, Earnest added, is in charge of 'logistical infrastructure' in Liberia.

And 'HHS and the Centers for Disease Control are the lead in communicating with state and local officials and with public health officials in states all across the country.'

Reporters covering the White House can find it challenging to get answers. Members of Congress, Rep. Jack Kingston suggested Saturday, are in the same boat as constituents pepper them with questions in the final few weeks before Election Day.

Abe's not the czar: Obama faces tough questions about how he's cobbling together an Ebola response without a single point-person to answer questions and move the ball forward

McCain wasn't always a fan of naming 'czars' – point-people – to consolidate the government's responses to a crisis

TALK SOUP: (left to right) US Africa Command commander Gen. David Rodriguez, Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco, USAID Administrator Raj Shah, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell all took their turns at the microphone on October 3

Speaking to The Washington Examiner, he said that while he 'hate[s] to invoke the term "czar",' Obama needs a 'central office that’s a clearinghouse' helmed by 'a command and control general, a strategic guy.'

Kingston doubled down in an interview with WBS-TV in Atlanta, saying that 'they need to have one person in charge, because you have about seven different federal agencies that are involved in this. We need to have a schematic saying who's responsible.'

'Czar' positions at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are generally created inside the White House and given to unelected bureaucrats who don't report to cabinet agencies.

That situation has historically made members of Congress uneasy and brought howls from whichever party is out of power.

Kingston himself tried to defund all of Obama's czars in 2009 with a bill that gathered 123 so-cosponsors  – all Republicans – when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. The legislation died in committee.

The one federal government agency that might logically weigh in on Ebola – but hasn't – is the Office of the Surgeon General. That post is vacant.

Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy to fill it a year ago, but his statements in favor of doctors inquiring into their patients' gun ownership proved too toxic. 

Still, Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak is that acting surgeon general, and he's been silent.

AWOL? Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak (left), the acting US Surgeon General, has focused on preventative public health like anti-obesity measures more than disease response efforts

Who's in charge? Leaders of 10 separate government agencies gathered to brief the president on Oct. 6 

Three other potential Ebola czars identified by Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, both Republicans, would all come from outside the Obama administration.

In an Oct. 6 letter to the president, the two lawmakers suggested former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates or and Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt. All three served under President George W. Bush.

'This requires a global response and the U.S. needs to provide the necessary leadership to control and eliminate this outbreak,' Maron and Wolf wrote. 

'We believe it is imperative that you designate a single senior advisor who will be responsible for coordination all U.S. agencies and policies involving the international and domestic response to Ebola.'
