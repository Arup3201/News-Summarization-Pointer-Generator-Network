West Ham fell to their second defeat of their pre-season tour of New Zealand as the Hammers were beaten 3-1 by Sydney.

Sam Allardyce's side were 2-0 down at half-time before wideman Matt Jarvis saw his left-wing cross deflect off Sydney captain Nikola Petkovic and into the net five minutes after the restart.

‘The football was not good enough to get results, but we’re experimenting and working on more open attacking play and it hasn’t worked well from a defensive point of view,’ said Allardyce.

The A-League side controversially 
extended their lead on 64 minutes as Corey Gameiro netted after the 
referee failed to spot a handball.

West Ham had gone behind after just four minutes when Sydney broke on the counter following a Hammers free-kick.

Ali Abbas found Gameiro in space down the left and the Australian frontman slotted the ball past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian to net his first of the game.

The Sky Blues doubled their advantage on 25 minutes as Alex Brosque converted Bernie Ibini's forward ball.

However, West Ham replied soon after the interval as Jarvis' cross from the left deflected off Petkovic and over the head of goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic.

Meanwhile, Hammers defender Guy Demel was forced off 13 minutes into the match after tweaking his hamstring and was replaced by summer signing Aaron Cresswell.
