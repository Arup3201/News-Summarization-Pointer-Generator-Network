A British man has been killed in a snowboarding accident in the French Alps.

The 38-year-old fell 16ft down a crevasse on a glacier in Chamonix. Emergency services were called at 2.15pm yesterday after a skier spotted the man.

A helicopter immediately flew over the scene of the accident at Grand Montets and two rescuers were winched down into the crevasse.

But the man was already dead.

It is believed the man had snowboarded over a snow bridge on the Rognon glacier and it had collapsed under his weight.

The man lived in Passy, 10 miles from Chamonix, and was snowboarding alone but had been due to meet friends later that day.

A police spokesman said: 'When we arrived the victim was already dead. He probably died instantly from the fall.'

A snow bridge is formed by a snow drift. It is an arc that can grow to join the sides of a crevasse crating an illusion of a solid surface. It hides the opening under a layer of snow of unknown thickness.

A snow bridge is thicker and stronger at the edge of a crevasse meaning that a fall though a bridge usually happens at some distance from the crevasse edge.

The accident is the latest tragedy involving a Briton in the Alps.

Earlier this month, in the same resort, a father and son died after falling down a steep gully. Peter Saunders, 48, and his 12-year-old son Charlie were hiking in Chamonix.

Police believe Mr Saunders fell to his death while trying to rescue his son who had fallen 1000 feet.

Last week another Briton died in the French Alps. Louis Roberton, 26, was found dead in an icy stream after a night out drinking in La Plagne.
