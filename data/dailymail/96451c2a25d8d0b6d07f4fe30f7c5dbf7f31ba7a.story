An independent review is set to be carried out into the Food Standards Agency's response to the horse meat scandal.

The review board, headed by Professor Pat Troop will have unrestricted access to all relevant documents held by the body.

The move follows criticism of the FSA's handling of the horse meat scandal with Labour's shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh branding the FSAÂ  'unfit for purpose'.

The project will feed into a larger Government review of the scandal which forced supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Waitrose to clear their shelves.

The news comes just days after Dutch 
authorities announced they would recall 50,000 tons of meat sold as beef
across Europe that may contain horse meat.

The FSA later confirmed that the meat did come to factories supplying supermarkets in the UK.

It is believed that the much of the suspected horse meat originated in countries such as Romania before being packaged elsewhere in Europe and sold on as ready meals in the UK.

Ms Creagh said: 'The Government's fragmentation of the FSA in 2010 has left our food regulatory system unfit for purpose.

'The FSA knew that the Irish were 
testing for horse meat last November, yet did nothing until positive 
results came back. The FSA also needs to explain why 14 horses that 
tested positive for bute entered the human food chain before the FSA 
issued a recall notice.'

The fiasco caused shockwaves across the UK supermarket industry with giant Tesco announced their first fall in profits for 20 years following the scandal.

Meanwhile Co-op, Asda, Sainsburys and 
Waitrose also also suffered thanks to the fallout from the scandal which
was first unearthed by Irish food safety chiefs.

Professor Troop previously served as 
chief executive of the Health Protection Agency for five years and 
deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health between 1999 
and 2003.

Europe's horsemeat scandal erupted in
January, when testing in Ireland revealed that some beef products also 
contained equine DNA, and the problems then spread across the continent.

The scandal ensnared numerous 
well-known brands, prompting product withdrawals, consumer concerns and 
government investigations into the region's complex food-processing 
chains.

In the Commons last month, 
Environment Secretary Owen Paterson described the adulteration of food 
products with horsemeat as a 'criminal conspiracy which covers 23 
countries'.
