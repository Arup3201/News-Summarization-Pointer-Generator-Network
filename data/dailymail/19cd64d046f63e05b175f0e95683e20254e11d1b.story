Feeling confident?

RJ: Extremely. After the catastrophe that was New Year’s Day we owe Tottenham massively. Combine that with the fact that they  played in Italy on Thursday night in a huge match while we have had over a week off, and Matic’s ban aside, we couldn’t really ask for much more going into the game.

DK: Yeah, weirdly I'm very confident, perhaps because I can't bring myself to contemplate defeat.

There’s plenty of history between the two teams – what is it that make this rivalry intense?

RJ: Its very tricky to put a finger on exactly why the rivalry is so venomous. From their perspective I assume it’s the fact that they couldn’t beat us for years even when they had a superior team. Or the fact that they haven’t won a league match at Stamford Bridge for 25 years. Or the fact that we knocked them out of the Champions League by becoming the first London club to win it. For us I think its more to do with the hatred we receive from them. It's responsive.

DK: I hate Arsenal for who they are but I hate Chelsea for what they are – a morally bankrupt, jammy, despicable club, with some of the most dislikable personnel in the game. The majority of their fans are in the same vein. Our terrible record against them, plus the Champions League fiasco, also contributes to the recent bad feeling but the rivalry dates back decades.

Tottenham fans generally don't have fun at Stamford Bridge, and that may be a reason for the rivalry

Spurs were underdogs in the 2008 final but beat Chelsea 2-1, will lightning strike twice?  

RJ: The Chelsea team of 2008 were not a team of winners. It had all the hallmarks of an Avram Grant team, who I believe has just taken his side to second in the Africa Cup of Nations. Under Grant we came out second best in the Carling Cup, second in the Premier League and second in the Champions League. And we were knocked out of the FA Cup by Barnsley. You say they were underdogs but I don’t think too many Chelsea fans were surprised that Grant managed to steer us to defeat that day.

DK: Yeah, we'd love a 2-1 this season, and I think we're more closely matched now than then.

What are your memories of that day?

RJ: The overriding memory of the day is the pain and torture as Woodgate got to the ball ahead of Cech right in front of us. And then being soaking wet at Wembley listening to endless renditions of 'Oh When The Spurs'... it was agony but it Tottenham deserved it. They were excellent. It takes huge character to come back from a goal down in a cup final.

DK: I had a ticket but in the corporate seats at Wembley. There were more Chelsea fans and neutrals around me than Spurs fans but it was stunning looking across at the Spurs end and the noise was incredible. I can't remember much of the game but Berbatov's cool penalty obviously stands out and I went crazy when Woodgate scored. A couple of the Chelsea fans shook my hand at the final whistle, which was a touch.·

Which of your players will make the difference this time around?

RJ: I think the only bright spot when Tottenham destroyed us on New Years Day was the performance of Eden Hazard. He seemed to really understand the rivalry and how desperate Chelsea fans were to get something from the game. If he plays to a similar level and those around him raise their game, I think that he could be too much for Spurs to deal with.

DK: Kane and Eriksen are the obvious ones but I've got a good feeling about Lamela too.

That 5-3 game is still fresh in the memory – how will that affect this game?

RJ: I think it will affect the game positively for everybody. It will definitely inspire Tottenham, they scored five goals against us. However, I also think it will inspire Chelsea. There isn’t a better way to get back at a team to whom you feel you owe one, by beating them at a final at Wembley.

DK: On the one hand, it will give Spurs belief they can outplay and beat Chelsea, which is crucial. On the other, it will make the Chelsea players (who must be prioritising the Premier League and Champions League) extra motivated to exact revenge. So, it could be beneficial for both teams.

And what of Nemanja Matic's ban?

RJ: Huge. Disastrous. Close to being irreplaceable. But I think that Mourinho will opt for Ramires. Now I concede that Ramires doesn’t have the presence of Matic but he is a wonderful player, capable of chipping Valdes in the Nou Camp or scoring in the FA Cup final against Liverpool. I have full faith in him.

DK: He's a good player and hopefully Eriksen can exploit the space created by his absence. But it shouldn't make too much difference. If Chelsea – one of the richest clubs in the world, who routinely buy players to stop them joining rivals – can't cope without one midfielder, then their squad isn't nearly as strong as everyone thinks.

Nemanja Matic was sent off against Burnley and will miss the final - his absence is a huge loss for Chelsea

Generally, Spurs don't beat Chelsea that often, do they?

RJ: Well over the course of my lifetime generally not. However, we have never beaten them in a cup final which is slightly worrying. Third time lucky I hope.

DK: No but I'm happy with Spurs' record against Chelsea in cup finals.

What are your plans on the day of the game?

RJ: A pint of Guinness around Great Portland Street to ease the nerves before Met-lining it into Wembley. There isn’t a better feeling in football.

DK: I haven't got a ticket (yet) so I'm going to watch at home with some mates and try to write a few articles, then go out to celebrate our victory afterwards.

Finally, your predictions, please.

RJ: 3-1 Chelsea.

DK: There's been lots of goals when we've played Chelsea this season, so I'll go 3-2 Spurs after extra time.
