More than 2,000 gravestones in Hawaii's Punchbowl Cemetery are marked 'Unknown' - signifying unidentified soldiers who perished in World War II.

When historian Rick Stone was hired by the agency tasked with identifying these soldiers in 2011, he was eager to provide peace for the families with a grave marker of their own to visit.

Stone spoke with NBC News about his one year at the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Command (JPAC) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where he was only met with resistance as he tried to do his job.

The departed: Over 2,000 grave sites in Hawaii's Punchbowl cemetery remain unmarked despite the advances of DNA testing to identify the lost WWII soldiers

Now the organization is facing 
criticism from congress after a Government Accountability Office report 
found that the effort to identify the 83,000 unknown World War II 
soldiers worldwide is 'acutely dysfunctional.'

Commander of JPAC Major General Kelly McKeague will testify before congress today in a hearing on agency mismanagement.

In one case, Stone is '100 per cent' sure who the man is below the unknown grave marker.

Stone
was reviewing a 70-year-old case on 'Seaman Elm' a man who was killed 
in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

The
sailor had gone down with the USS Arizona, and authorities believes his
last name was Elm since he had a lighter in his pocket with an engraving of that name.

That's when Stone realized that the engraving wasn't a name, but initials - E.L.M.

Day of infamy: Many of the unknown soldiers were lost in the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor

Stone turned his attention to the missing who had those exact initials.

Only two servicemen met that description, and one of them was already identified. That left Earl Leroy Morrison, a first-class seaman from Montana who was on the Arizona.Â 

Stone reported his find to the JPAC Central Identification Lab in April 2012 to disinter the body for DNA testing, but the lab still hasn't responded to the request.

They told him to try and get DNA from the family.

'It's a Catch-22. You can't talk to the families until you're sure, but how do you become sure until you talk with the families and get the DNA?' Stone said.

Waiting for IDs: Stone believes he can identify the bodies of First-Class Seaman Morrison, left, and Second Lt. Aleneir, right, but the lab in Hawaii has not been helpful

He was met with even more outright hostility when he tried to identify soldiers lost on the island of Tarawa. Of the 513 presumed dead from that island, 103 are unknown.

So he organized the unknowns by physical description: race, age, height, weight, hair color.

One of the bodies stuck out to Stone because he was short. Anthropologists estimated the soldier was 5 feet 1.4 inches tall, between 23 and 24, Caucasian and 115 pounds with medium ash-brown hair. His pants also showed that he was a second lieutenant.

Only two men could possibly match that height description, and one of them was only a private first class.

The other, Second Lt Stanley Aleneir of New York was strikingly similar in physical description: 5 foot 3 and a half, Caucasian, 23, medium brown hair.

There was no way to be as sure as he was with Seaman Morrison, but it was close enough to confirm with DNA evidence.

Again the lab rejected his proposal. The first time he submitted his request it was denied for petty mistakes like a comma in the wrong place or because he used footnotes instead of end notes.

The second time, lab officials said he was 'out of lane' by using biometrics to narrow down results.

'We're in no hurry to identify these individuals. They're not going anywhere,' was one response Stone received.

An interesting comment considering JPAC made a goal to crank up identifications to 200 a year by 2015. The agency has been averaging 80 or fewer IDs in recent years.

A Pentagon spokesman would not speak about the specific cases of Seaman Morrison or 2nd Lt Alenier with NBC News, but they did say that the agency has identified seven servicemen in 2013 and has approved all requests by staff this year.
