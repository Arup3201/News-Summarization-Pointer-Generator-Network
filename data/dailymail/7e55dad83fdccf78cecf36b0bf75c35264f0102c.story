He may be 37 years old in real life, but Jamie Oliver has proved he's still just a big kid at heart.

The celebrity chef today tweeted an adorable family photograph of his whole brood wearing matching stripey pyjamas, designed by wife Jools for Mothercare.

And since Jools' Little Bird range is usually only large enough for children aged up to five years old, the pyjamas worn by Jamie, Jools and their two eldest daughters - Poppy Honey Rosie, 10, and Daisy Boo Pamela, nine - were specially customised by the brand.

Taken in a cosy playroom decked out with colourful bunting and toys, the soft-focus photo resembles a family Christmas card shot, and perfectly captures the fun and happiness of the Oliver household.

The famous foodie took the photograph on Instagram alongside the caption: 'Haha the whole family in Jools PJ's ...I can't believe Mother Care actually mad me a pair of her toddler Jim-Jams !! Very funny if not slightly strange. Although one little purple princes had hers in the wash & wasn't very happy bless her .......big love to all you guys #jamie x x. X x xx x x. Xx x. X xx x x x x.'

The couple's youngest child and only son, two-year-old Buddy Bear Maurice is also wearing the pyjamas in the photo, but youngest daughter Petal Blossom Rainbow, three, is wearing a bright purple party dress and crown, because her pyjamas were in the wash.

Original size: The Little Bird By Jools jersey rainbpow pyjamas usually fit children aged 0-5 years old and cost £12-£14

Model and mother-of-four Jools Oliver, 37, designed the Little Bird line for Mothercare in August, aiming to create an 'eclectic and affordable' collection of classic clothes, toys and bedding suitable for babies and children up to five years old.
