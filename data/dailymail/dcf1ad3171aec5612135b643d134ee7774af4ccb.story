The father of a South Carolina woman missing since December 18 has begged for the public's help to find his daughter after hundreds of volunteers turned up no sign of her during a weekend search.

Terry Elvis along with about 300 people scoured the woods, swamps and beaches of Horry County for 10 hours on Saturday looking for Heather Elvis, 20.

She was last seen in the early hours of December 18 after a date. Her abandoned car was found the next day at a boat landing spot in Horry County.

Gone: Heather Elvis disappeared without trace on December 18

It’s a living nightmare,' Elvis' father, Terry, told FoxNews.com on Monday. 'I can't beg enough for information. If you've seen anything, if you've heard anything, if you have a friend, family member or acquaintance who acted differently on that day, I beg you to come forward.'

'Any information - as trivial as it may seem - helps us,' he said. 'This could be anybody's child.'

Fox News reports that Heather Elvis' date is not considered a suspect.

Last week, police discovered human skeletal remains while searching for the missing woman. They initially thought the bones could be those of Brittanee Drexel, 17, who was last seen four years ago just 25 miles from where the remains were found.

Desperate: Heather Elvis' father is pleading anyone with information to come forward

It has since been revealed that the bones were male and had been there for at least 20 years. They have been sent for DNA testing.

There is now a $25,000 reward for information about Heather Elvis' disappearance.

Her father, Terry Elvis, told FoxNews.com: ‘To not hear from her for more than 24 hours is way out of character.’

He last heard from her about 10:45pm the evening she went missing when she sent him a text message.

According to My Horry News, Elvis was dropped off from her date sometime between 2am and 2:30am at her River Oaks apartment.

Despite efforts by the Horry County Police and members of the community to find Ms Elvis, she remains gone without a trace. 

Brittanee Drexel, a high school junior from Rochester, New York was last seen in 
April 2009 leaving a popular Myrtle Beach hotel along Ocean Boulevard.

She had traveled to South Carolina with 
friends but without her mother's permission and a camera at the Bluwater
 Resort videoed her leaving the hotel on April 25th, at close to 9 p.m.

After sneaking away with friends on a
 Spring Break holiday, Drexel left a group of male friends from the
 Blue Water Resort to walk back to the Bar Harbor Hotel, where she was 
staying with other girlfriends.

The pretty blonde texted her boyfriend on the walk to the hotel, but security footage confirmed that she never made it inside.

The
 police in Myrtle Beach have said they believe that Drexel was 
abducted as she walked the one-mile stretch of Ocean Boulevard that lies
 between the two hotels and is most likely dead.

Last seen: Brittanee was shown on the security footage of the Blue Water Resort in Myrtle Beach as she left the room of a group of her male friends and headed to the nearby hotel where she and some girlfriends were staying back in 2009

Terry Elvis posted a heartfelt message on the Facebook page Find Heather Elvis, saying, 'My life is being torn slowly into unrecognized bits that I can no longer understand. So many try to comfort us but I can find no comfort with Heather still missing.'

The page has more than 27,000 'likes.'

Lieutenant Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department told FoxNews.com that 'several people' are being interviewed in connection with Heather Elvis' disappearance. 'Some are cooperative, some are not,' he said, describing the case as 'very active.'

'No matter how small a tip it is, it can be of use. It may lead to what they need to know to bring Heather home. We've been 17 days into this nightmare trying to find her. It's hard, it's very hard. So, anyone, if you know anything, help us put this nightmare to bed. Please help us find our daughter,' Terry Elvis told ABC 15.

Anyone with information on the case is urged to call investigators at 843-915-TIPS.
