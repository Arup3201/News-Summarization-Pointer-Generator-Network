Female high school students from Darwin have hit out at teachers after claiming they were told not to wear clothes that were 'distracting to a lot of the boys'.

Students at Casuarina Senior College say they were sent home from school for wearing tights, leggings and bike shorts in hot weather, the NT News reported.

The students posted signs on Facebook and Instagram in protest of the rules, after they were taken down from a reception area in the school on Tuesday.

But CSC principal Paul Mathews denied that staff had said any female student's clothing was 'distracting', and said teachers were simply enforcing the school's uniform code.

The students' signs read: 'Don't stop girls from wearing tights, legging, shorts and skirts in hot weather,' the posters read.

'Instead teach male faculty and students to not over-sexualise female body parts. I don't think my thighs, legs and a** should be distracting.

'Dress code only enforces the idea that girls should cover up because 'boys will be boys'.

'What a girl wears has nothing to do with her intelligence of self respect.

'I refuse to obey rules that enforce rape culture and sl*t shaming and keep our sexist society in place.'

Images of the signs were again shared on social media, with students saying that boys at school were allowed to wear shorts of any length while female students had to wear shorts and skirts that measured below the knee.

But CSC principal Paul Mathews said tights, leggings and bike shorts were not part of the school's uniform code, and denied that staff said any female student's clothing was 'distracting'.

'Yesterday was the end of a very long communication process with students and parents reminding them about the CSC dress code,' Mr Mathews said.

'If you look at the dress code policy it doesn't at all talk about boys or girls – it says no bike pants or leggings and that shorts need to be of appropriate length

'Can I really state that this is not an issue of gender, this is about the high standards and expectations the college has in all areas.

'My view is that a very small number of girls have chosen this method to communicate their displeasure about something they don't agree with.'
