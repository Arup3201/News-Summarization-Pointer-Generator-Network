She has turned her work with crime into sexually explicit novels with a dark twist.

Former Sydney police officer, Trish Ingham switched her career path around to do quite the opposite – she is now an international best-selling author of ‘mummy porn’ romance novels.

From a Russian ballerina working as a sex slave to escorts and prostitutes falling in love, the 34-year-old writes hardcore sex scenes but leaves her readers at the edge of their seats.

Written under the pen name T.J Hamilton, the mother of two has published five novels after her first release in April last year.

‘When I worked with the police force, I wrote a lot of stories every day and I usually don't see crime but I had to collect a lot of evidence and present them in court,’ Ingham told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I had a lot of contact with women escorts and prostitutes so I guess that's how my novels  unfolded.

‘My first three novels were inspired by true events that I thought were interesting. It’s an insight into a world that not many people know about, and it’s definitely a story to be told.'

Her latest novel, which debuted at No.2 on Amazon, Death’s Shadow, tells a story about a young Russian ballerina, who is owned by the mafia and abused and used as a sex slave.

‘It’s a cross between Kill Bill with a mix of romance involved. It’s a dark  read but I’ve included a warning at the front because it’s quite detailed and graphic - it's a romantic thriller,’ she said.

The stay-at-home mother from Hervey Bay, north of Brisbane said she is quite open and honest about her career choice.

'I’m not afraid to tell people I am a writer of smut,' she laughed.

‘It’s not something I find embarrassing because I’m proud of writing raunchy sex scenes in my novels. It doesn’t faze me and sex happens all the time and I’ve embraced that in my novels.

But Ingham does admit she kept her book career under wraps when she first started.

‘I didn’t really tell many people because it’s an avenue that not many women go down but after my first release, I have had a huge amount of support from my family and friends.

‘It’s funny because when I wrote my first book, I put on the acknowledgement “I hope mum never reads this” but now she’s one of my biggest fans.

‘Some of my 11-year-old son’s teachers at the school all know what I do so it’s certainly not something I’m hiding. And Declan is at an age where he’s aware of the content and knows that they’re for adults.

While her novels are soaring in popularity with women who want to indulge in the saucy content, Ingham's female readers range from all ages.

‘I had a 70-year-old woman, who is married for 40 odd years, contact me to say that my books put a spark back into her marriage. It’s delightful when people reach out to me and tell how my novels have affected them,’ she said.

‘My books are targeted for women – for the average mum at home with kids who are searching for that escapism in my books.

‘These books go to another place – It’s that little bit of escape and daily grind for the readers who normally wouldn’t imagine these fantasies in their own mind.’

As she continues exploring the world of writing, Ingham is set to release new and exciting novels in 2015

Ingham, who has worked with the intelligence and the Middle Eastern crime squad, said the best part about writing a novel is the moment she pens ‘the end’.

‘It’s the best part but it is a flood of emotions when I get to the end of the book. I don’t like to say goodbye because the characters become a part of my life and I’ve also cried at the end.

As she continues to explore the world of writing and is set to release new novels in 2015, Ingham said she doesn't plan on returning to the police force any time soon.

'There have been many days where I've missed the police force and just seeing the events unfolding in Sydney recently and my workmates on TV - it's different watching it from the outside,’ she said.

'Parts of me want to be there again to help but I think my family comes first and I've found a passion in writing so I couldn't imagine doing anything else but this.’
