BP has pulled its entire fleet of trucks off the road in Victoria after three people were killed in an accident involving one of their vehicles on Thursday morning.

Around 9am one of its tankers was travelling down Wodonga-Yakandanda Road in north-east Victoria when it lost its trailer.

The trailer is said to have hit one car killing a woman in her 60s, before it rolled into a second car crushing a woman in her 30s and a young child, according to Sky News.

BP has now pulled all its trucks from Victorian roads to check them over

In a statement released on Thursday afternoon BP confirmed it was one of their tankers involved and said no fuel was spilled from the tanker during the accident.

'We are deeply saddened that there have been loss of life,' the statement read.

'We can confirm that the incident did not result in the release of any fuel from the product tanker.

The tankers have been brought in as a precaution and will all be assessed

'In addition to fully supporting external investigations being conducted by the authorities as a matter of precaution, we have today recalled all of our Victorian trucking fleet.'

BP spokesman Peter Metcalfe told Daily Mail Australia they have pulled the fleet as a precaution.

'We're bringing them in for a check over,' he said.

Mr Metcalfe said this would only be for the 20 tankers on Victorian roads, and would not apply to other parts of Australia.

When emergency crews arrived at the scene the driver was found to be uninjured.
