Almost 60 Australians are fighting for the Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria, according to the Federal Government.

Attorney-General George Brandis has warned radical Australians fighting abroad is the greatest domestic security problem in many years.

'This is the government's number-one national security priority,' he told Sky News on Tuesday night.

Senator George Brandis says there are 58 Australians fighting for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria

Senator Brandis said the latest intelligence reports indicate about 58 Australians were fighting in Syria and Iraq.

But he said about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight.

Senator Brandis will meet with six imams on Wednesday morning to discuss cooperation on curbing the radicalisation of young men.

His comments come just days after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir disappeared, believed to be on his way to Iraq.

About 150 Australians were also being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight

It is thought he had been brainwashed into making the trip after watching Jihadist recruitment videos posted online.

One such video was released almost two weeks ago by the extreme terrorist group, Insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) - also known as ISIS.

It featured Australians calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq.

About two weeks ago, Abdullah told his parents he was going fishing, but never returned.

The 17-year-old is the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family this month bound for Iraq.

So far, 10 Australians have died in Syria and Iraq. The latest being a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for terrorist group The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) shortly before being ambushed in Syria.

Australians involved in extremist activity have been warned by Prime Minister Tony Abbott that the Government would crackdown on home-grown terrorists.

'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said.

Mr Abbott said while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in the country's north, Australia would re-double its efforts to protect its national security.
