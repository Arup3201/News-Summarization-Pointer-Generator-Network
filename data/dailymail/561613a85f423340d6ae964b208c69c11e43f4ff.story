Tributes poured in last night for ‘astute, forward-thinking and passionate’ former Scottish FA chief executive David Taylor, who died on Tuesday.

European football’s governing body UEFA, where Taylor served as general secretary and then executive director after leaving the SFA in 2007, confirmed the news that he had died aged just 60 after taking ill.

A passionate Scotland fan, Taylor became the first chief executive of the SFA in 1999, succeeding long-serving secretary Jim Farry.

Last night, Campbell Ogilvie, president of Scottish football’s governing body, paid warm tribute.

‘On behalf of his friends and former colleagues at the SFA, and throughout Scottish football in general, I would like to express our profound sadness at the tragic news of David’s death,’ said Ogilvie.

‘I would also wish to send our deepest condolences to his wife Cathy, and their children  James and Alan, at this  dreadful time.

‘David was a solicitor to trade but it was his love of Scottish football and, in particular, the Scotland national team that stirred his passion during his tenure as chief executive.

‘He was great company, had an astute business mind and a forward-thinking approach to the game that, allied to his patriotism as a member of the Scotland Supporters Club, helped take the SFA forward administratively.

Dearly missed: SFA President Campbell Ogilvie was one of many to pay tribute to his former colleague

‘It was no surprise to any of us who witnessed his work at close hand when UEFA came calling for his services as general secretary in 2007.

‘He has remained a friend and  supporter of the SFA and the game in general in this country and he will be dearly missed by all of us.’

In September, 2011, he collapsed while participating in a football match between UEFA and FIFA.

It was reported at the time Taylor stopped breathing for a period before medics managed to revive him with a defibrillator machine.

The match was abandoned and the 57-year-old Taylor was rushed to a nearby hospital in Zurich, where he spent several days in intensive care.

More tributes were paid from across Scottish football last night, with current SFA chief executive Stewart Regan Tweeting: ‘So sorry to hear that my predecessor, David Taylor, has died today aged 60.

‘A top bloke. Really feel for Cathy, James and Alan. RIP David.’

Great contribution:  Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell extended his condolences on behalf of the club

Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell added: ‘This is devastating news and our thoughts and prayers are with David’s wife, Cathy, and their children, James and Alan.

‘David was a fine man, a personal friend of mine and someone who made a great contribution to the game of football, both in Scotland and across Europe.

‘He will be very sadly missed by everyone who knew him.

‘On behalf of everyone at Celtic Football Club, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to David’s family and friends at this very sad time.’
