Valentine's Day is almost upon us and, while hearts and flowers help, nothing says romance quite like a glass or two of champagne.

And while we all like a sip of Taittinger, Mumm or Moët, their hefty price tags put them out of reach for the more cash-strapped.

But having a less-than-royal bank balance doesn't mean you can't enjoy a glass or two of champagne, thanks to the wealth of cut-price options being offered by supermarkets. 

Cheers! Stick to supermarket champagnes this Valentine's Day to make big savings 

Top on the affordable list is Asda's Louvel Fontaine Champagne that comes in at a very reasonable £10 per bottle.

Well balanced and fruity, Louvel Fontaine is a blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier grapes and offers lingering flavours of fresh citrus and hints of vanilla.

Slightly more expensive is Lidl's Valentine's Day offering, the Comte De Brismand (£11.99, 75cl), a dry, well-balanced and classy tipple.

According to wine experts, the blend looks set to be as popular as their £17.99 Comte de Senneval Grand Cru champagne which beat Harrods version in the One Show's blind taste test last year.

Aldi's excellent Champagne Veuve Monsigny (£11.99) is golden-hued with small bubbles that go up in a perfect upward spiral, and a nice crisp flavour.

Daily Mail expert wine Olly Smith said: 'With its upbeat intensity and truffly scent, this champagne is so keenly priced it'll sell out fast. Seize it.'

For those who prefer their bubbles a little sweeter, the supermarket also offers Pink Champagne Brut NV at £15.99 for 75cl.

Sainsbury's Blanc de Blanc is made from 100% Chardonnay grapes and is perfect to serve with sweet dessert nibbles Morrison's Signature Brut Champagne has lemon and floral aromas and creamy, toasty flavours

Tesco's Louis Delaunay Champagne, which comes from the town of Dizy in Champagne, has gorgeous floral aromas and elegant citrus fruit flavours.

The £25.99 bottle is currently being sold at half price for £12.99, with the offer running until the 17th February.

Marks & Spencer's Abel Charlot NV is also being sold at half price and costs £16 - down from the usual price of £32.

The supermarket is also running a buy six, save 25 per cent special offer, resulting in a £24 saving for those who want to bulk buy.

With fine bubbles, creamy lemon shortbread aromas and smooth, lush caramelised hazelnut flavours, this a powerful dry champagne.

Morrisons Signature Brut Champagne, NV ( £18.99, 75cl) is slightly more expensive but has lovely  lemon and floral aromas and classic creamy, toasty flavours, which make it worth the price tag.  

Sainsbury's Blanc de Blanc Champagne (£20.00) is slightly more expensive but it did top the charts as the the highest scoring own label champagne in the Best Buy category in a recent Which? December 14' survey.

An elegant champagne, made from 100 per cent Chardonnay grapes, has delicate floral aromas and citrus notes – perfect to serve with sweet dessert nibbles.

Anne Jones, Wine, Beer and Spirits category manager at Waitrose, reveals which Valentine's Day champagnes are worth splashing out on.

Which champagne would you recommend for Valentine's Day? 

'Definitely the Pol Roger Brut NV, £39.99, it has a rich flavourful style. For those on a tighter budget the Waitrose Brut NV, £19.99, which is exceptional value and tastes great. 

Alternatively a style called Crémant is made in a similar way but with a gentler fizz - try the Cave de Lugny Crémant de Bourgogne, £13.99.

Are there any champagne alternatives you would recommend?

'For Prosecco-lovers, the Waitrose NV Italian Prosecco, £8.99, is a classic, crisp fizz. Cava is also hugely under-rated and improving in quality all the time, and is made by using the same method as champagne. 

'You can get great examples for under £10 such as the Waitrose Brut NV Spanish Cava, £6.99.

In the spirit of Valentine's Day, which pink fizz would you select? 

'Pink fizz is an obvious choice for Valentine's Day, and it can also be a great way to be creative as well as save some money. If you want champagne, the Alexandre Bonnet Brut Rose (£26.99) is superb.

What would you recommend to those who are looking for a low-alcohol option? 

'Prosecco usually has slightly lower alcohol than champagne or Cava, but if you really want to pace yourself, the soft, fruity, slightly sweet style of Asti is only seven per cent.

'I would recommend the San Leo Asti, £9.99 – it's also delicious with puddings!'
