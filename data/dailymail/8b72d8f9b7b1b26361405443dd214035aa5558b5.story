As the four remaining teams in this year’s World Cup prepare for battle with a place in the final at stake, there is one war that has already been won... by adidas.

More than half of the players expected to start in the semi-finals will be wearing boots made by the German sportswear giant. Those adidas players include Lionel Messi, Arjen Robben, Thomas Muller and Oscar. 

Adidas and their 26 players lead rivals Nike, who have 15 sporting the famous swoosh, while only two players will walk out in Puma boots at the semi-final stage. And one, Brazil's Hulk, wearing Mizuno.

Adidas’ Battle Pack range seem to be the most popular among the world’s elite. Mesut Ozil, Robben and Robin van Persie will all take to the field in adidas’ new World Cup range.

Messi even has his own design - the F50 Adizero Messi. Wearing the same boots as the four-time Ballon D’or doesn’t come cheap, though, at the cost of £170.

Brazil’s quarter-final hero David Luiz leads the way for Nike along with team-mates Willian and Luis Gustavo.

The centre-half, whose boot took the hosts to the last four with a spectacular 30-yard free-kick, will be lacing up his Nike Magista Obras once again in Tuesday's clash with Germany in Belo Horizonte.

Nike’s newest boot, developed especially for the World Cup, has a sock-like second skin to improve durability and provide an almost barefoot feel.

Emulating the former Chelsea man’s choice of footwear will set you back £255, though.

Eight of Germany’s expected starting line-up will be wearing adidas, including Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Mats Hummels, Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

In the other semi-final, six of the eleven players for Argentina will be wearing adidas boots.

Amid the players wearing adidas is 
acrobatic goalkeeper Romero, energetic winger Lavezzi and, of course, 
arguably one of the finest players to have ever graced the game, Messi.

Four of the 11 players for the South American giants will be wearing
 Nike, including world-class full-back Pablo Zabaleta and midfield 
maestro Javier Mascherano.

Puma icon Sergio Aguero will be wearing the 
rather vibrant EvoSpeed boots which have unsurprisingly caught the eye of many 
football fans.

The two super-brands have been going head-to-head for nearly 60 years, and are the equivalent of Argentina vs Brazil.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale may be team-mates at Real Madrid but they are enemies in terms of branding. Ronaldo being with Nike, and Bale with adidas.

Adidas, though, also have Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi on their side.

In this particular squad, Nike have been
 overshadowed by the new batch of boots made by adidas - in fact, four of
 the players likely to start will be wearing boots inside the 
Battle Pack Range.

This connotes that the new range of adidas boots is 
more successful than the new Nike Magista’s, both of which were 
previously unveiled before the World Cup commenced.

The boot encounter concerning the 
Holland squad conveys a very comparable story. Although this time it is
 even more disproportionate as eight of the expected 
starting eleven will be wearing adidas boots on the fateful night.

This 
includes the likes of the outstanding Robben and the magnificent Van Persie both having used their flamboyant footwear to help 
their team progress. The two stars both wear the adidas f50 AdiZero 
boots - part of the Battle Pack range.

Just three of the Holland expected 
line-up will be wearing Nike, which is a very disappointing statistic for the 
company. Wesley Sneijder will be showing off his Nike Hypervenom’s as 
well as Ron Vlaar and Stefan de Vrij, who will be wearing their Nike Tiempo’s, 
but adidas is sure to gain more publicity with eight out of the 11 
players wearing their boots. 

That leaves Bayern defender
 Dante, one of the few who will be wearing Puma, and powerful winger Hulk, who represents the Mizuno brand.
