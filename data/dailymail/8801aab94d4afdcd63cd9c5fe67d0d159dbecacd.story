Agatha Christie took revenge on Bletchley after she got stuck there on a train journey

Agatha Christie found herself at the centre of a mystery of her own making when she appeared to give away one of Britain’s biggest wartime secrets in a thriller.

MI5 got into a panic after her 1941 novel N or M? featured a character called ‘Major Bletchley’ – a fact that seemed to reveal the existence of codebreaking centre Bletchley Park.

Christie was a close friend of Alfred Dilwyn Knox, a leading codebreaker, so the secret service was very concerned at the apparent give-away.

The novel featured Christie’s detective duo Tommy and Tuppence – married couple Thomas and Prudence Beresford – who fearlessly tracked down German spies in Britain.

In the novel they met Major Bletchley, an old Indian Army major who claimed to know everything about what was really going on in the war.

MI5 believed that the character’s inside knowledge of the progress of the war was based on the Bletchley codebreakers’ knowledge of German plans.

Codebreakers at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, had broken the German Enigma machine ciphers, allowing British commanders to intercept Nazi messages.

The Germans believed their Enigma code was completely unbreakable, so it was vital to ensure only a very few people knew what was going on at Bletchley.

Christie’s novels sold tens of thousands at the time so MI5 was anxious to ﬁnd out exactly what she might know.

They questioned Knox, who insisted that she could not possibly know about Enigma.

Investigators were afraid that if they questioned Christie it was bound to get out, so Knox agreed to ask her himself.

He had to be careful what he said to avoid giving anything away, but he invited her to his home at Courn’s Wood, Naphill, Buckinghamshire.

Over tea and scones he asked her why she had chosen to name her character Major Bletchley. She replied: ‘Bletchley? My dear, I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.’

It seemed MI5 had panicked over nothing. The story is told in a new book, The Codebreakers of Station X.
