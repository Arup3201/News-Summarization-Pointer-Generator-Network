Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has damaged his ankle ligaments.

Manager Louis van Gaal is expected to confirm the injury at his lunchtime press conference on Friday.

United are still to establish how long the striker will be out for although it may be around three to four weeks.

Van Persie left Swansea's Liberty Stadium on crutches last Saturday with his right ankle in a protective boot and had scans at the start of the week.

The 30-year-old picked up the injury as he fell awkwardly while putting over a cross late in the 2-1 defeat.

United had used all three substitutes and Van Persie was reduced to a walking role around the pitch as United pushed for a late equaliser.

Van Persie had a poor game, but remains United's leading scorer with 10 goals. He has suffered already this season with other ankle injuries.

Radamel Falcao and James Wilson will vie for a starting place against Sunderland on Saturday.

Wilson picked up a dead leg in Monday's U21 game at Sunderland and came off after 39 minutes but is fit to play.
