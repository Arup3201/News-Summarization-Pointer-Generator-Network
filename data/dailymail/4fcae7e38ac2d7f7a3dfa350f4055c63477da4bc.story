He divides opinion, but that's what makes Zlatan, Zlatan.

Love him, loathe him; you cannot escape him. But how has this bona-fide world superstar evolved over the years?

You first impression of Ibrahimovic is that he's an egotist. Hugely self-confident, in similar realms to fellow Scandinavian Nicklas Bendtner, only with the ability to back-up his big talk.

Ibrahimovic celebrated his goal against Caen at the weekend by showing off his many tattoos 

You only need to Google 'best ever Ibrahimovic quotes' for a sense of how highly the Swede rates himself.

Here are three highlights:

1. 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' - Ibrahimovich's views after failing to make the shortlist for the 2012 award.

2. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' The striker's views after Sweden missed out on qualifying for World Cup 2014.

3. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was like "No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions".' - Revealing why he turned down a trial at Arsenal.

Ibrahimovic scored a spectacular propeller kick for Sweden against England

At the age of 33, his cockiness hasn't waned. He knows he's good, and isn't afraid to tell people.

Perhaps that's why he has such a close bond with Jose Mourinho. They're like two peas in pod.

Like, the Special One, the Paris St Germain striker is box office.

But, on these shores at least, Ibrahimovic's talents have always been under scrutiny somewhat.

We know the potential is there - but his poor record against English clubs has always left some unanswered questions.

Of course, scoring against English opposition isn't the be all and end all of what makes a successful footballer - to suggest so would be nonsensical. 

Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring for AC Milan against Arsenal in 2012

Ibrahimovic has scored three goals against Arsenal - the only English side he has scored against

Ibrahimovic first came up against Arsenal back in 2006 while playing for Juventus

But for those who do not follow the European leagues would have found it hard to give credence to Ibrahimovic's reputation having not seen first-hand evidence.

In 16 games against English opposition, Ibrahimovic has found the back of net just three times - all of them against Arsenal in the Champions League.

But then came November 14, 2012.

England, who brought them a largely experimental squad, travelled to Stockholm for a friendly.

What followed was a Zlatan master class. Four goals - including one outrageous 30-yard propeller kick.

If the preceding hat-trick wasn't enough to convince the most staunch Ibrahimovic sceptics, then THAT goal would have won them over.

If an Englishman even questioned his top-level credentials, Ibrahimovic has his defence ready to go.

Indeed, that strike has certainly changed the perception of the Super Swede in England.

There's nothing we hate more than a loudmouth who cannot justify his words. Now, in Ibrahimovic, we see a man that can.

His record against English clubs still leaves a lot to be desired, however.

He drew another blank against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final last season, but he missed the second leg at Stamford Bridge with a hamstring injury.

Ibrahimovic failed to score in two games against Tottenham back in 2011

The striker will have another opportunity to improve his record against Premier League opposition tonight when PSG welcome the Blues to the Parc de Prince.

In addition to his lack of goals, the former Barcelona striker has only once finished on the winning team against an English club: in AC Milan's 4-0 win over Arsenal in 2012.

That won't be of any comfort to Mourinho, though. He knows Ibra's capabilities.

So does Ibra, of course.
