Thigh society: This week, 58-year-old Carole Middleton decided to wear a short skirt - and it looks wonderful

Long, shapely and with curves in all the right places, these are a pair of pins that any 20-something would kill for. But allow your eye to drift a little further up and you'll see this is no spring chicken.

This is Carole Middleton, the 58-year-old mother of our future Queen.

Doesn't she look wonderful? Foxy even. But what's that? Too short a skirt for a woman of her vintage you say? Poppycock! For as elegant women like Carole - and me - know, age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt. If you've got legs as lovely as Carole's, it's a sin not to show them off. In fact, I wear skirts shorter than her and I'm six years older than she is.

But, sadly, Carole's decision to wear a short skirt this week opened a rich seam of vitriol.

If some of the insults I've read online are anything to go by, older women who bare their legs do so at their peril, as poor Carole is discovering to her cost.

From the she-should-put-them-away brigade to the nice-legs-shame-about-the-face crowd, that A-line skirt cut a mere two inches above her finely shaped knees has placed Carole firmly in the stocks.

One Mail Online reader - Marian Brookes from Flitwick - said: 'This lady ought to dress with the appropriate decorum befitting her age; after the age of 50, ladies should wear clothes to the knee or just below. I am much more elegant, of a similar age and build and would never contemplate being seen in that apparel. What has happened to elegance and dignity?'

And another reader was even more scathing, saying: 'This would not even look good on someone half her age. She is a deluded woman living in the past.'

How sad. But surely bruising commentary like this says more about the critics than its target.

This extraordinary flowering of prejudice that blossoms whenever older women show off their legs is notable for two things - how often it happens and the depth of hypocrisy exposed.

While younger women with terrible legs - and I've seen some shockers, including 20-somethings in tiny denim shorts exposing mountainous thighs bearing glaciers of cellulite - can run around baring all without as much as a raised eyebrow, things are very different for ladies like me.

Foxy lady: For elegant women like Carole, age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt

Any woman who reaches her 50s, however svelte or beguiling, seems to be precluded from even so much as suggesting a knee.

What century do these people live in? It would seem that young women inhabit a world of the Miley Cyrus nude-coloured bikini exposing acres of flesh, while older women are expected to all but return to the Victorian age, complete with floor-sweeping dresses to disguise any semblance of curve. The hypocrisy is particularly interesting since there is a constant and deafening chorus of complaints from women as they age that they become invisible.

Yet when a woman in her 50s dares to hint at her sex appeal, she is victimised.

We should cheer her from the rooftops. Why? After all, sexuality is important to us all. Granted, any sensible woman knows we can't hold on to the allure we had in our 20s and 30s, but turning 50 doesn't mean we do not long for the turn of a head or a too-lingering glance.

Becoming a middle-aged woman doesn't mean the glint in your eye is deadened for ever.

Certainly, at some point during these years, we hand over the torch of sexuality to our daughters, but still that does not mean we have to become sexually redundant. We can all see Carole is a vivacious woman. Lucky Michael Middleton, I say.

But as Carole is discovering to her cost, she is at a dangerous juncture in the evolution of her sexuality.

I know - aged 64, I've been through those rocky years. Every woman in her late 50s enjoys being admired, but you tread on a hair's breadth of propriety.

Those who sashay into middle age are accused of being muttony; those who surrender to middle age are accused of giving up.

But I believe Carole is neither. She is an unapologetic cheerleader for the elegant older lady who refuses to give in to convention.

Far from being denigrated, she should be applauded as a torchbearer for women who do not wish to define themselves by their birthdate. She is perennially well-appointed, well turned out and always appropriate. All of us who aspire to something other than a lifetime in midi-length skirts and bootleg trousers should cheer her.

Just because you can doesn't mean you should!

Skirt
 length is far too short. Seems the Middleton ladies share a wardrobe! 
Carole needs to go for softer colours and not try to dress as a  
30-year-old.

Those tights are ridiculous on a woman of Carole's age. They scream: 'Look at me, look at me!!!'

Wearing such a short coat and skirt, how old does she think she is: 25?

BUT AT LEAST SHE HAS ONE FAN. . .

Fashion
 should be worn to suit the body, no matter what the age. An in shape 
and toned 58-year-old looks much better in a short skirt with 
eye-catching, patterned tights and on-trend ankle boots than an 
out-of-shape 20-year-old with no muscle tone would look in the same 
style. Mrs Middleton looks great!

So why does her look work? Carole follows the golden rule of short skirts: avoid nude tights.

While her daughters Kate and Pippa can certainly get away with flesh-coloured stockings, they're a big no-no for women like Carole.

Wearing short skirts with nude tights does not work for older women, however good our legs. It looks ageing and would show up all manner of thread veins and bumps on the upper leg if you got too close.  So Carole's black patterned tights under a warm black coat allowed her to flawlessly dart about town while probably turning a few heads.  What woman of any age will complain about that ?

As I said, I am blessed with good legs and still wear short skirts, but with care. Yes, I wear a skirt three or four inches above my knee, but only with tights that are patterned or 40 denier.

When the weather heats up and I am forced into flesh-coloured tights to let my pins breathe, my skirt lengths descend to nearer the knee, just as Carole's do.

Too many inches of flesh-coloured thigh, however toned and slim, make the sheep start bleating. It screams that the wearer is trying to look young, as opposed to smart.

Surely this is what these bitchy commentators believe Carole is trying to be: youthful, rather than sprightly.  But she's not clinging to youth. She's displaying her glamorous side. What's wrong with that?

The prejudice that says an older woman can't display her legs, even if they are supermodel-worthy, is not just cruel, but way past its sell-by date. It is hypocritical to insist 50-somethings aren't 'old' then criticise them for not conforming to an old-fashioned stereotype.

Instead of denigrating and criticising women like Carole Middleton, we should get behind her. All power to those knees I say.
