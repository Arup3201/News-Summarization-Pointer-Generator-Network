Swansea manager Garry Monk has accused television of adding to Alan Pardew's misery at Stoke on Monday night, claiming there was an agenda against the under-fire Newcastle boss.

Pardew will be in the spotlight at Swansea again on Saturday with Newcastle one place off the bottom of the  Premier League and his job said to be still very much in the balance.

The Newcastle manager's job prospects looked bleak after Monday's 1-0 defeat to the Potters, but Pardew remains in charge for the trip to south Wales and Swansea counterpart Monk admitted he felt sympathy for him while watching the game on television at home.

Monk believes the television coverage of Newcastle's defeat by Stoke was not fair to Pardew

'I don't like seeing the agenda in the televised game at Stoke the other night,' Monk said.

'Every time there was a bad mistake or some sort of attack against Newcastle they'd pan to the manager and the chairman.

'It was a bit of a farce for me and I thought there was an agenda behind it.

'But Alan's an experienced manager, he's in a difficult moment and he's been through the mill but he's a very good manager. 

'He's got a very talented squad of players and it's a case of pulling together as quickly as possible and move on.

Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke

'You have sympathy with all managers in those situations but with the players they have they'll fight and scrap for every point and I think they'll do well this season.'

Swansea were boosted on Thursday by Jonjo Shelvey being called into the England squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, the 22-year-old midfielder having won his solitary cap two years ago while he was a Liverpool player.

Shelvey's inclusion marks the first time that a player has been named in an England squad while representing Swansea, and Monk said it was a huge boost for the club even if highly-rated wide men Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge missed out on a place in Roy Hodgson's squad.

Magpies owner Mike Ashley reportedly told a journalist Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke

'It's excellent news for the player and for the club,' Monk said.

'It's a great example, a way of showing a pathway to international teams.

'We have a lot of international players but in terms of England it's a pathway for others here.

'We've worked hard with Jonjo, how he can contribute and improve and he's making a conscious effort to do that.

'He's not quite all the way there yet but he's improving and this will give him another boost in confidence.

Monk hailed midfielder Jonjo Shelvey, who was called up to the England squad by Roy Hodgson on Thursday

'His quality is there for everyone to see - his passing, the way he moves the ball, how he offers good angles and movements and fits into a defensive shape.

'I hope it opens the door for others.'

Swansea's confidence levels are at the opposite end to Newcastle as they lie fifth in the league table following last weekend's goalless draw at Sunderland.

But Monk insists they can do even better after what has been an impressive start to the season.

'I know what the players can do and we've been working very hard putting stuff into place,' Monk said.

'Where we are now is at a good level but we can show more.

'As a whole over all the games we can be better and that's what we're all striving for.'
