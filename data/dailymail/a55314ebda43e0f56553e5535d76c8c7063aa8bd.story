A Chicago sandwich shop has fired all of its 20 staff over email just two days before Christmas.

Staff at Snarf's Sub Shop in River North received the bad news on Sunday night in a group email notifying them that the drastic action was effective immediately.

The company blamed 'increased competition and losses' for the firings.

Director of operations Doug Besant said in the email the restaurant will likely close for a month as they remodel and reconcept the business into a burger joint.

But the move comes less than a month after Snarf's workers rallied for higher wages.

The email, obtained by ChicagoGrid.com, read: 'Due to increased competition and losses, ownership has decided to consider remodeling and reconcepting the store at 600 West Chicago Ave.

'The store is closing, effective tomorrow, December 23, 2013 for an unknown period of time for this remodeling and reconcepting. All staff is terminated, effective Monday, December 23, 2013.'

Jill Preston, Snarf's director of marketing, told the Huffington Post on Monday: 'We really regret our employees were given last-minute notice, but they were aware of the loss of business during the past year.'

The note encouraged staff to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible and told them to return any keys and company property by today.

Signing off, Besant said in the note: 'Keep an eye out for the grand opening of the new store. Ownership appreciates your service and wish you well in your new endeavors.'

The River North Snarf's shop was closed for four days, from December 5 until December 8, as employees went on striking for higher wages and better benefits.

They joined workers of fast-food 
chains like McDonald's, Subway, Potbelly and others in a broader strike 
orchestrated by the Worker's Organizing Committee of Chicago.

But
 the restaurant's director of marketing Jill Preston denied the mass 
firings were linked to the protests. She said it was due to the slow 
Christmas season.

'During the Christmas holiday we're pretty slow,' she told ChicagoGrid.com. 'The restaurant's usually three quarters closed. This does happen to coincide, but this is something we've had planned for awhile.'

Furious members of the Worker's Organizing Committee of Chicago gathered outside the store Monday morning demanding severance pay and re-employment for the fired staff.

Communications director Deivid Rojas told the website: 'Three days before Christmas and not even a call. It's not fair that management and the corporation is treating (employees) this way.'

Preston added that fired staff will be allowed to reapply for their jobs when the restaurant reopens in the new year.
