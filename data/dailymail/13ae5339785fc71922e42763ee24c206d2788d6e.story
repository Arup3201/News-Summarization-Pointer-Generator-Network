Muntzair and Kiran Younis who flipped a coin to decide who would donate the kidney that would save their son Adam's life

The parents of a seriously ill boy were both so desperate to donate him a kidney they decided which one would save his life by tossing a coin.

Adam Younis, now four, was born with
Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome, meaning his kidneys were unable to 
filter fluids properly, and urgently needed a transplant or he may not 
have lived to 18 months old.

But when both his father Muntzair Younis, 28, and mother Kiran, 25, from Sparkhill, Birmingham, turned out to be a perfect match - neither could agree who would be the one to undergo the operation.

They decided the only fair solution was to flip a coin to decide.

Muntzair won after correctly choosing 'heads' and father and son underwent a successful transplant operation in December 2011.

'Both of us decided that 
whoever was the match would go for it,' said Kiran.

'What we didn't expect was that it
would be both of us.

'We were equally as desperate to save
his life as we had been through so much. I wanted to save him because I
had carried him for nine months and given birth to him.

'But my husband wanted to be the one to save him as he had given up work in a restaurant to look after him.

'We argued over it and called my mum who said to flip a coin. So that's what we did and how we decided who would donate.

'I'll never forget that day, we were 
stood outside the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and the doctors
had given us a deadline to decide who would donate.

'My husband flipped the coin, it was like slow motion, I was thinking 'please God let it be me'.

'I was gutted when it was my husband - 
for us whoever got to donate the kidney was the lucky one as it's such a
special gift to your son.

Happy ending: Adam Younis in hospital before the transplant, left, and now after making a full recovery, right

'Even though I wasn't able to donate 
this time, we have been told that Adam will need a transplant in the 
future, so at least I know I am a match.'

The operation was a success and Adam - who has two brothers Ishah, six and three-year-old Ibrahim - was well enough to start school last September.

But his situation had looked much more bleak when he was born with the kidney condition.

As a baby it made him swell up due to excess water leaking into his body and doctors removed his left kidney removed at just nine months old.

'We were told at one point that he would probably die at 18 months old,' said Kiran.

'The symptoms he suffered were horrendous. He was unable to eat and was on a lot of medication.

'Adam is a lot better now and even though he struggles with his eating, he is much stronger.'

Muntzair said: 'I was so happy I won because I wanted to help my son. Kiran and I argued about it a lot but we decided the only way to settle it was to flip a coin.

'As a father, I wanted to be the one to help him. I'm very proud of him and I'm so grateful we were both a match.'
