An eight-year-old boy needed 30 stitches on his face and limbs after being mauled by a two-year-old pit bull while riding his bike near his home.

Nicholas Garvey, of Deerfield Beach, Florida, ran to neighbour Sharon Haynes's home and she eventually managed to get 'Jada' the dog off him.

She used his bike and a cast-iron object to beat off the pit bull, which left Nicholas with a broken arm and horrific wounds all over his body.

‘If the animal tasted human blood, I believe it should be put to sleep,’ the boy’s mother Teresa Rose told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

Ms Haynes said that when she opened her front door on Sunday she saw the pit bull grabbing onto the boy’s right hand.

‘The first thing I grab was his bike - I start beating the dog with the bike, telling the dog to get off him,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

Ms Haynes also used a cast-iron object as she successfully got the dog off Nicholas, but described him as in ‘pretty bad shape’ after the attack.

Broward County police then caught Jada and took her to a shelter, but said she did not have a history of biting anyone else in the past.

Jeanette Peterson, of Pompano Beach, Florida, owns Jada and was fined $648 for the bite and not registering and vaccinating her pet.

But she claimed local children have shot Jada with a B.B. gun in the past.

‘If you do something to a dog, they're going to remember,’ she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ‘She's a lover, not a fighter. She's innocent.’

‘I'm sure there are good pit bulls,’ Deerfield Beach Mayor Peggy Noland said. ‘But they are temperamental and can turn on people, especially kids.’
