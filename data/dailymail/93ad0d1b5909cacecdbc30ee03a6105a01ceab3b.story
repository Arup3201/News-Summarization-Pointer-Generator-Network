The bitter row over allowing unqualified teachers today after it emerged the number of untrained staff in classrooms was higher under Labour.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is allowing academy schools to employ people with no formal teacher training but his Labour opponent Stephen Twigg has warned it risks damaging the quality of lessons.

But new figures released in parliament show there were more unqualified teachers in England and Wales when Mr Twigg was schools minister under Tony Blair.

The two parties have been locked in an increasingly angry dispute over whether good teachers need to pass exams before being allowed into schools.

Last year Mr Gove announced academies could employ staff without formal teaching qualifications, in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector.

The Department for Education said the flexibility would more schools to hire ‘great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before’.

Labour opposes the plan, even though Mr Twigg and his colleague Tristram Hunt have boasted of ‘teaching’ in schools in their constituencies.

However, official figures show that the number of unqualified teachers in schools in England has fallen dramatically since the coalition was formed.

Embarrassingly, the data was requested by Labour frontbencher Kevin Brennan.

Data: Despite the pledge, the number of unqualified teachers in England has fallen from more than 18,000 in 2005 to just over 14,000 in 2012

In 2005 there were 18,800 unqualified teachers in publicly-funded schools, accounting for 4.5 per cent of all teaching staff.

Mr Twigg was schools minister in Mr Blair’s government until he lost his seat at the May 2005 general election.

By 2010 there were 17,800 unqualified teachers, falling in 2012 to 14,800.

Mr Gove now believes 'Labour's 
education policy is a joke’ after attacking free schools but backing 
parent and teacher led academies and regularly teaching in schools.

A source close to the Education 
Secretary added: ‘Now it is revealed that when Labour was in Government 
and Stephen Twigg was education minister there were thousands more 
teachers without the certificate than there are now.

‘Every policy announcement from 
Stephen Twigg blows up in his face. It is madness to want to fire great 
teachers just because they don't have a union approved certificate or to
 stop brilliant teachers from private schools switching to state 
schools.'

However, Labour said the total number of teachers rose under Labour from almost 400,000 in 1997 to 448,000 in 2010, and has fallen by 6,000 since then.

Unqualified teachers were not allowed to be employed permanently in state-funded schools under Labour.

Mr Twigg said: ‘‘When Labour was in government, all teachers in state funded school had to become qualified. Michael Gove scrapped this rule.

‘Michael Gove is damaging school standards by allowing unqualified teachers to teach on a permanent basis in academies and Free Schools.

‘This means that there are now more than 5,300 unqualified teachers- an increase of more than 3,000 since November 2010- in academies and Free Schools. At the next General Election, Labour will offer a guarantee that all teachers in all state funded schools will in future have to have or work towards qualified status’.
