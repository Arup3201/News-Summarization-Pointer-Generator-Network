He may only work part time, but Bill Gates has become the world's richest man for a second time thanks to a nest egg of shrewd financial investments - and a little help from the Mexican government.

The software mogul snatched the title from Mexican mobile phone tycoon Carlos Slim yesterday after Bloomberg revealed his personal fortune had blossomed to an eye-watering $72.7billion.

Gates, who has spent his life at the vanguard of computer innovation since he founded Microsoft in 1976, last wore the crown in 2007 but was usurped by Slim three years later.

But a bill passed by the Mexican congress aimed at breaking up Slim's near monopoly on the country's telecom industry, through flagship firm American Movil SAB, saw his net wealth plummet by 14 per cent, erasing nearly $3billion from his accounts.

Meanwhile, Gates watched his riches soar by 15 per cent after his investment portfolio, which includes a large stake in Microsoft, enjoyed a bumper few years.

Most of Gates’s fortune, however, lies in Cascade Investment LLC - a holding company through which he owns portions of more than a dozen publicly-traded
 companies and other operations, including Four Seasons 
hotels.

The Bloomberg Billionaire's Index ranked famous investor Warren Buffet in third place with a personal net wealth of $59.7 billion.

He came out $3.7 billion richer than Amancio Ortega Gaona, Europe's wealthiest person, whose Spanish clothing company Inditex group owns high-street chain Zara.

Philanthropists: Since retiring from full-time work with Microsoft, Gates and wife Melinda (pictured) has thrown himself into his philanthropy through his charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which gives aid to some of the most underprivileged countries in the world

Since retiring as chairman of Microsoft in 2008, Gates has thrown himself into his philanthropy after setting up charity the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which gives aid to some of the most underprivileged countries in the world.

The Microsoft founder has dedicated 
much of his time in the past five years to charitable causes through the foundation, 
spearheading African aid projects and encouraging others to spread their
 wealth.

Last year, the multi-billionaire donated $750million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria on the fund's tenth anniversary. He had already contributed $650million to the charity.

‘These are tough economic times, but that is no excuse for cutting aid to the world’s poorest,’ Mr Gates said at the time, adding: 'The United States has a huge budget 
deficit so taxes are going to have to go up.

'I certainly agree that they should go up more on the rich than everyone else. That's just justice.'
