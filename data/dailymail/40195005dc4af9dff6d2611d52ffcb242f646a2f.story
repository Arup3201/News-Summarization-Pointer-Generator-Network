The Obama administration's decision to place restrictions on travelers coming from Ebola-plagued countries is a step in the right direction, but there's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect Americans from  Ebola, Sen. Rand Paul said in a recent interview with MailOnline.

'It's good that they're admitting they were wrong,' Paul said. 'They've now changed their protocol.

'Perhaps it's also a problem to have people commercially traveling into the country with it,' though, he added.

Paul, a physician by trade, has been especially critical of the Obama administration's approach to containing Ebola. He has suggested several times over the last month that the virus is 'incredibly contagious', and the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention is downplaying the threat it poses to Americans.

There's still more precautions the federal government can and should be taking to protect Americans from Ebola, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told MailOnline during a trip to Atlanta, Georgia, this weekend

In his interview with MailOnline from Atlanta, Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered, the Kentucky senator and possible 2016 presidential candidate again chided the government agency for failing to explain to Americans how easily Ebola can be caught.

As in recent remarks, Paul chalked the move up to over eagerness by the government agency to be politically correct. 

Even so, the CDC needs to be 'forthright' about how easily transmittable the disease is, he said.

'I think we have the greatest healthcare system in the world and in all likelihood we can contain this and, so, I believe It's important not to spread panic,' he said. 'But I think sometimes people panic more if you're not honest with them.'

Paul has challenged the CDC's assertion that Americans are not in danger of contracting Ebola unless they come in direct contract with a carrier's bodily fluids.  

'You know how they define direct contact? Being within three feet of someone,' Paul has said.

The CDC's explanation for how the disease is transmitted makes it sound like it's passed on in a manner similar to AIDS, Paul contends.

But 'you're not going to get AIDS at a cocktail party. No one's going to cough on you, and you're going to get AIDS. Everybody knows that,' Paul recently told a group of college students.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that it would require passengers whose travel originated in West Africa to fly through five international airports in the U.S. that have heightened security measures in place in order to reduce the likelihood that Ebola carriers will be able to enter the U.S.

Yet. a second person who arrived from West Africa has been diagnosed with Ebola since the new travel restrictions were put in place. Because the man, a doctor who had just finished treating Ebola patients in West Africa, was not showing symptoms of the disease at the airport, he was allowed to pass into the country through New York.

As a result both New York and nearby New Jersey had independently announced that they would quarantine all persons who have recently traveled to an Ebola hot spot until the 21-day incubation period for the virus has expired.

Already one woman who was quarantined under the new rules has fallen ill with Ebola-like symptoms. She tested negative for the disease, however.

President Barack Obama has defied calls from more than 100 Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to temporarily close the country's borders to travelers from West Africa, even as the number of people worldwide who have been diagnosed with Ebola has climbed to more than 10,000 people.

The World Health Organization said Saturday that nearly half of people who tested positive for Ebola have died. And WHO said the infection rate could actually be higher - those are just the known cases.

Only 27 of those cases have been outside West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Still federal lawmakers worry that the virus could become spread en mass in the United States.

Georgia politicians who represent the Atlanta area, home to the CDC, expressed worry of a potential Ebola epidemic, but they were careful not to conflate the government agency's response to the potential crisis with the president's or to affirm Paul's allegations.

'I think Tom Frieden, the CDC director is a good man, is a good doctor, and I think basically has done a good job,' Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey told MailOnline.

'Sometimes I wonder if he's actually calling the shots. I would say the same thing for Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, who I have a lot of respect for as the [National Institute of Health] director of allergy and infectious diseases,' Gingrey said. 

The seven-term Republican congressman suggested that the Ebola response coordinators may just be figureheads.

'The American people have so little confidence now in this administration, they're thinking well, who is making these decisions? Is it the medical experts like Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci? Or is it somebody in the administration who is telling them what to do?' he said.

Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, who has represented the Peach State in Congress since 1999, also refused to bad-mouth the CDC or its leader.

'I have a high regard and respect for Tom Frieden. Tom Frieden admitted when he made a mistake in terms of the Dallas situation, quickly corrected it,' Isakson told MailOnline during an interview at a campaign rally over the weekend.

'All four patients at Atlanta University have been cured. I think the CDC has done an excellent job, and I support Tom Frieden,' Isakson, a member of the Senate's Health committee said.

In an interview with MailOnline after an early vote rally with Paul this weekend, the GOP nominee for Georgia's soon to be open Senate seat, David Perdue, abstained support for his campaign surrogate's claims about Ebola.

'I'm not a scientist or a doctor. He's a physician,' the businessman said. But if he's is right, Perdue added, 'then it's...a major...potentially a very large crisis, and we need to treat it as such.

'And that means that we've got to set up the right protocols, the right controls, with the right leadership,' he noted. 

'What I'm concerned about right now is we're not seeing strong leadership out of the White House' on the issue.'

Gingrey, who is a doctor, also demurred when asked for his opinion of Paul's suspicions.

Isakson was more candid about in his assessment of colleague's theories.

'I'm a member of the Health committee, and I've been a supporter of CDC for the last 16 years in Congress,' he said told MailOnline in an interview outside the Paul event. 'They don't put out false and misleading information when it comes to a disease that's life threatening.'

While hesitant to comment on Paul's allegations, Gingrey, an OB/GYN who has served in Congress for more than a decade, had no reservations about criticizing the president's reaction to Ebola when he talked to MailOnline at a get out the vote event on Friday night.

Asked for his thoughts on the administration's decision to enact travel restrictions on plane passengers coming from West Africa, Gingrey said it's 'too little too late.'

'It is woefully inadequate to do that,' he said.

Gingrey, a member of the House Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on health, said the federal government ought to mandate that travelers coming from West Africa, including doctors, nurses and military service men and women, be quarantined inside the region for 21 days before they are allowed to proceed to the U.S.

'I don't think that's that big a burden,' he said.

The GOP congressman commended all the medical professionals who have relocated to Ebola-ravaged countries to treat victims of the virus.

'They need to understand, though, with a disease like this that has a mortality rate of 75 percent, you just can't take any chances,' he said.

If not an outright travel ban, Ginrgrey said, then the U.S. should at least institute a quarantine period. 

'We don't want [Ebola] to turn into a pandemic, as these cases accumulate,' he said. 'That should be done in another continent. We shouldn't bring them to this continent and run the risk of going from an epidemic in West Africa to a pandemic in the world.

'So I think that not nearly enough has been done,' Gingery said. 

New Jersey and New York have set a new standard by instating their own quarantines, he said. 

'But I'd like to see this be done in West Africa.'
