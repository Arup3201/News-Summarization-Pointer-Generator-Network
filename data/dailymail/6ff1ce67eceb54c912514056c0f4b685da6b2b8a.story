While you might think being called Taylor or Jones isn't much to write home about, spare a thought for those saddled with Swetinbedde.

And it could be worse because you could going through life as Mr Crakpot, Mrs Drunkard or even Miss Gyldenbollokes.

Now the story of those names - and many 
others - has been brought to life by author David McKie in his new book,
What's In A Surname? A Journey From Abercrombie To Zwicker.

Geography: Many of the UK's surnames, including Bolton and Bradford, derive from place names

While the unfortunately named Crappers, Chaceporcs and Scrapetroughs are the most eye-catching, McKie also offers an insight into better-known names that have made it into the modern period.

British names, he explains, fall roughly into four categories: those derived from occupation (Butcher), those handed down by fathers (Watson), those that come from place names (Bolton) and nicknames such as Short or Brown.

'Occupational names are full of 
hazards,' writes McKie in the Guardian. 'Farmer? That sounds easy 
enough. A man who owns or runs a farm. But farmer used also to mean tax 
collector.

'Rymer? A 
peripatetic poet, possibly; but also a man who made rims for wheels. 
Reader is not just someone who reads (when many couldn't); it may well 
mean thatcher.

Roots: Names that end with -s (Styles) originate in Wales but that end in -thwaite come from the East Midlands

'Walker 
wasn't a name for someone who walked. Everyone walked. A Walker carried 
out the same work – treading or crushing cloth – as a Fuller elsewhere.'

Interestingly, McKie also discovered that many names also have geographical origins, with those that end in -son indicating northern roots, while names that end with -s - Styles for instance - have Welsh origins.

Those whose names end in -by, -thwaite, -wick and -dale tend to originate in the East Midlands, while names that are prefixed by Tre-, Pol- and Pen- come from Cornwall.

The UK's most common name Smith, although often thought to be English, actually originates in Scotland, while surnames beginning with P - Parry, Price, Pratt - are overwhelmingly Welsh in origin.
