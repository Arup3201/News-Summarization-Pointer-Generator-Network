A toddler was nearly blinded after a pet hawk ripped his face with its  talons as he played in a park.

Two-year-old Alfie Hall was in a playground with relatives when a Harris hawk named Bonnie swooped on to his head.

Her razor-sharp talons cut his cheek,  narrowly missing his eye, and severed part of his left ear. Alfie’s mother Elysia, 23, said  doctors had to glue the ear back together.

Terrible: Covered in blood with scratches and tears all over his face, brave Alfie Hall just after being attacked by a hawk as he played

Recovery: Still bearing the scars of the attack, Alfie is beginning to get over the attack

She said: ‘There was blood everywhere.
 The bird ripped several chunks out of his head, including a big gash 
right next to his eye which needed stitches.

'The doctors told us he was 
lucky not to lose his sight.

‘Alfie was totally shocked, his eye was swollen and I could see his ear was badly injured too.

‘We called an ambulance and they whisked Alfie off to the hospital, where he was given anaesthetic and kept in overnight.’

Miss Hall, from Church Crookham, 
Hampshire, said Bonnie ignored the calls of her teenage owner and 
‘dive-bombed’ Alfie as he stood in the park in a council estate in 
Farnborough.

But the hawk’s owner, Scott Brewer, 
18,  yesterday denied the bird had deliberately attacked Alfie and 
insisted she was safe around children.

He said: ‘If she had meant to attack 
him, the extent of his injuries would have been a lot worse.

'Their 
talons lock into place, so she could have ripped his face off if she 
meant to.’

Mr Brewer said he had twice warned a 
group of children, including Alfie, not to bother Bonnie while she was 
feeding minutes before the incident.

‘She can get a bit grumpy and try and nip you, but she would never draw blood,’ he said.

He believes the two-year-old hawk caught the toddler with her talons accidentally after mistaking his head for a landing post.

Attacker: A teenager lost control of his Harris Hawk (pictured in the wild), which then went for the toddler's face and ears

Innocent: Alfie and mum Elysia were at this Hampshire play area when the devastating attack happened

He said: ‘He was the same height as 
the railings where she normally sits.

'She does land on people’s heads 
sometimes. It’s something birds do because it’s the highest point.’

Bonnie, who has a wingspan of 3.5ft and can fly at 45mph, has been raised from 16 weeks old by Mr Brewer.

Named after 19th-century  US naturalist Edward Harris, the hawks can have a  wingspan of up to 5ft, with the females about a third larger than males.

They are nicknamed the wolves of the sky because they hunt in ‘packs’

They eat rabbits, rats and birds but are themselves hunted by great horned owls

The oldest recorded life  span of a wild Harris hawk is 12 years and seven months.

But this can increase to 25 years in captivity.

Until the incident in September, he 
exercised her for an hour every day at the park.

He added: ‘Kids would 
come out every day when I was in the park with her and I’d have 30 
children around me.

'I’ve had really young children, even babies, stroke 
her. She’s never attacked anyone before.’

Mr Brewer, who is unemployed but 
dreams of opening a sanctuary for birds of prey, has had an obsession 
with birds all his life.

His family have three European eagle owls, a 
barn owl and another Harris hawk, which they keep in aviaries in their 
large garden.

Mr Brewer was arrested for assault two days after the incident but released without charge.

He has been banned from flying Bonnie 
on council land, so now takes her to private woodland where she is free 
to hunt for rabbits and pheasants.

An RSPCA spokesman said there was no law governing where pet birds of prey can be flown.

He added: ‘Any wild animal kept as a 
pet is a challenge and owners have a responsibility to ensure they can 
provide for their needs.

'Hawks are wild animals and not domesticated. They have a very specific diet of raw meat and need to be given lots of space.’
