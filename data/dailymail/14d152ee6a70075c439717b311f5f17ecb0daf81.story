She has already sold four ringside seats to the birth of her third child.

Now, controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham is offering fans the chance to watch her give birth live on Skype.

The 24-year-old mother of two, whose baby son is due in October, is selling £10,000 worth of tickets to people who missed out on the opportunity to attend the event at her home in Leeds.

At a cost of £200 each, 50 fans will be able to log on to the video chat service and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

Miss Cunningham, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, has already scooped a staggering £30,000 for the four VIP bedside seats.

Last night, she told The Sun her latest offer to watch her give birth live on Skype would be a 'magical experience' for her fans.

'I'm annoyed at how cheap I sold the first four tickets,' she said. 'I think £200 to see such a magical experience is a bargain.'

Cashing in: It comes just two days after Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she plans to sell her placenta to the highest bidder. She asked her fans: 'Any legal boffs wanna give me some free advic? (sic)?'

It comes just two days after Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she plans to sell her placenta to the highest bidder.

The wannabe model, who was recently spotted shopping at exclusive baby store Blue Almonds, where Kate Middleton bought items for Prince George before his birth, asked her followers: 'Selling your placenta... is it legal? Any legal boffs wanna give me some free advic? (sic)'.

As well as the NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Surprised: Last month, Miss Cunningham announced to her Twitter fans that the ringside seats for her home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes, tweeting: 'WOW!' Just been told all 4 tickets have sold out in 14 minutes!'

Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

Shocked: However, Twitter users were less than impressed with the wannabe model's money-making scheme

She later added: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each.

Miss Cunningham, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000 prostitute, said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos.

She formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes selling DVDs of the birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through.

It comes just days after Miss Cunningham declared she was 'genuinely gutted' to discover she was expecting a third boy, not the little girl she had hoped for.

The wannabe model, who already has two boys, aged six and three, said she smoked a whole packed of cigarettes and drowned her sorrows with a glass of wine after finding out her baby's sex.

She told the Mirror: 'The evening I found out the sex of the baby was when I lit up my first cigarette.

'I knew it could harm my child but it didn't stop me.  Deep down I know I wouldn't be smoking or drinking if I knew I was having a girl.'

Her controversial comments came after she said she wanted to pay the NHS back for her boob job, not out of a sense of duty but in an attempt to stop people confronting her.

Miss
 Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 
worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust
 from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She
 courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting 
the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the 
Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show. 

Confident: Not one to shy away from controvery, Miss Cunningham has built her career on winding people up

 Cunningham later said she was receiving negative attention on public 
transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi
 to take her children to school.
