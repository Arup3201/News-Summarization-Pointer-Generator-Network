North Korean soldiers danced in the streets and shopping centres of Pyongyang yesterday after it was announced that leader Kim Jong Un was named as head of the reclusive nation’s military.

State media said in a special noon bulletin that North Korea’s military, government and political leadership had decided to award the top title to Kim, who already is supreme commander of the Korean People’s Army.

It solidifies his standing seven months into Kim’s rule and follows several days of reshuffling at the highest levels of the military.

The announcement of Kim Jong Un’s title as marshal and the presentation of the new military leadership comes just three days after the dismissal of army chief Ri Yong Ho, a high-ranking figure in both political and military circles and seen as a close adviser to Kim.

The government said Ri was ill, but there was widespread speculation abroad of a military reshuffle at the top levels.

The title of marshal - held previously by Kim’s father and grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung - is 'another brick in the wall of consolidating Kim Jong Un’s power, across party, state and military institutions,' said John Delury, a North Korea analyst at Yonsei University in South Korea.

'In the wake of Ri’s stepping down, it takes on added significance,' he said. 'Titles, of course, do not ensure authority. But the regime would appear to be closing ranks around their young leader.'

Members of the military in North Korea had gathered to offer their new leader 'their highest glory and congratulations'

Soldiers and students in uniform filled the streets of the capital to celebrate, dancing and singing patriotic songs despite the rain.  

'I am pleased that our cherished desire came into reality,' Kim Jong Gum, a student at the Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School dressed in a military uniform, told The Associated Press. 'July 18th: This day will be remembered in our hearts as another meaningful and auspicious day.'

One by one, Kim Jong Un has collected top posts in the military and party, including first chairman of the National Defense Commission, first secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party, chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission and member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau.

He was made supreme commander of the army in December, just days after his father’s death from a heart attack.
