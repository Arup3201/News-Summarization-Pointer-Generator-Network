Death: Sabrina Moss had been with friends celebrating her 24th birthday when she was shot

A mother of one was caught in a hail of bullets from a shotgun and machine gun when she was killed outside a takeaway, a court heard today.

Nursery teacher Sabrina Moss had been celebrating her 24th birthday with friends last month when she was shot in the chest in Kilburn, north-west London.

Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was wounded in the incident - along with two other men - but is recovering from her injuries in hospital. Martell Warren, 22, has been charged with murder.

Warren, of Willesden, north-west London, today appeared at the Old Bailey in Central London via video link from HMP Belmarsh in Thamesmead, south-east London, for a brief hearing.

He is charged with Miss Moss’s murder and the attempted murders of Miss Gachette, Mahod Ahmed and Edson Da-Silva on August 25.

He is also charged with two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. The court was told that a shotgun and a Mac 10 machine gun were used in the attack.

Prosecutor Julian Evans said: ‘Mr Warren is charged with six matters in relation to the incident. Two firearms were discharged at the scene, the first a Mac 10 machine gun and the second a shotgun.’

Warren spoke to confirm his name and that he understood the proceedings. No bail application was made and he was remanded into custody by judge John Bevan QC until a hearing on November 19.

He was arrested by officers from the British Transport Police at St Pancras International train station in Central London two days after the shootings.
