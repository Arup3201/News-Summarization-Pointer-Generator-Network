The drink drive limit in Scotland will be significantly lowered tonight while the law in England stays the same. 

From one minute past midnight tonight, motorists crossing the border must not have more than 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, thirty milligrams less than the limit in England.  

While the change has been welcomed by anti-drink driving campaigners, an overwhelming majority of drivers said having different limits across the UK was a bad idea.

Eighty-one per cent of those polled said they would rather see the same laws apply across Britain, according to the motor services company RAC, with forty per cent calling for the limit in England to be reduced. 

Almost a quarter of the 2,607 asked suggested a blanket ban on drink-driving as a whole, no matter how much alcohol drivers had consumed, while 92 per cent added having different limits in England and Scotland will be confusing for motorists. 

Electronic signs and posters have been put up at service stations and on roads across England in a bid to let drivers know about the change. 

Scotland's Justice Secretary Michael Matheson welcomed the change today. 

'Alcohol at any level will impair your ability to drive - even at the new limit you are three times more likely to die in a crash than with no alcohol in your system.

'This will bring Scotland into line with most of Europe. The evidence from the Republic of Ireland, which has brought in the same lower limit, suggests we will see convictions go down, reductions in drink-driving and lower blood alcohol counts.

'We are leading the way across the UK - the new limit has backing from experts, road safety campaigners and the majority of the public north and south of the border.

'When it comes to drinking and driving our advice is simple - it’s just not worth it. Don’t put lives at risk, the best approach is to have no alcohol at all.' 

Figures released by Transport Scotland earlier this year revealed there had been 440 alcohol related roadside accidents in 2012.

More than 500 casualties were a result of such incidents, with 10 people dying in drink-fuelled collisions. 

Tennent's, Scotland's largest brewer, is supporting the new laws in the run up to Christmas.

'Tennent’s takes its position on alcohol responsibility very, very seriously.

'We’re completely aligned with the Government’s position in terms of drink-driving and the alcohol limits that are being introduced.

'The industry as a whole takes the position with regard to alcohol responsibility very, very seriously. 

'In reality we’ve been preparing for this measure over a couple of years.

'You will have seen a growth in the no- and low-alcohol categories, not as a direct consequence of the drink-driving legislation but just in terms of brewers and alcohol producers producing new categories to broaden choice on behalf of consumers.' 

Last week Sussex and Surrey Police announced they would reveal the details of drivers who failed the 'walk the line' drink drive test on Twitter. 

Those charged with alcohol related offences will be 'named and shamed' by the forces in a joint campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of driving while under the influence.
