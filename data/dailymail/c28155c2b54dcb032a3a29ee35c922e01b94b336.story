A stunning photograph captures the moment a striped marlin spotted its lunch and went straight for the kill - spearing a helpless sardine with its huge, needle-like snout.

Swimming in the waters off Mexico's Baja California peninsula, the carnivorous fish attacked a large shoal, forcing them to scatter and leaving a handful of weaker sardines isolated and vulnerable.

It was then able to swoop again, using its spear-like snout to puncture a hole in the side of a prone sardine at a speed of 50mph, before using its small, file-like teeth to finish off the dying fish.

The incredible underwater photographs were taken by American wildlife photographer Doug Perrine, who was free diving off the Mexican coast when he spotted the striped marlin hunting.

Speared: This stunning photograph captures the moment a striped marlin spotted its lunch and went straight for the kill - spearing a helpless sardine with its huge, needle-like snout

Charge: Swimming in the waters off Mexico's Baja California peninsula, the carnivorous fish attacked a large shoal, forcing them to scatter and leaving a handful of weaker sardines isolated and vulnerable

Hunting: With the sardines scattering, the marlin was then able swoop on the shoal again, using its spear-like snout to puncture a hole in the side of a prone sardine at a speed of 50mph

Mr Perrine, 62, lives in Kailua Kona, Hawaii and is one of very few people to have taken a photograph of a striped marlin hunting sardines in its natural environment.

Describing the experience he said: 'The striped marlins have broken these sardines off from a giant shoal deep below, and forced them upwards to trap them against the surface of the water.'

'Then they break the school apart, charging through it and first picking off the weakest fish or the ones that get confused and don't move with the rest of the bait,' he added.

'The striped marlins sometimes strike the fish with their bills, using a slashing motion, to injure them before swallowing them. Other times they just swallow them directly,' Mr Perrine went on to say.

''They rarely impale a sardine on their bill, however I was lucky enough to capture this,' he added.

In the deep: Doug Perrine was free diving five metres below the water when he saw the marlin reach speeds of up to 50mph, charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter

Striped marlins are rarely seen, and very rarely photographed underwater in their natural habitat.

However, free diving five metres below the water, Mr Perrine was able to watch as the fish reached speeds of up to 50mph, charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter.

With most photographs taken at a distance of around three metres from the fish, he was lucky enough to touch the marlins at times. 

'Most people ask how it was possible for me to capture these photographs...Some ask if they are paintings, or were created with computer wizardry,' Mr Perrine said.

'I wanted to show the beauty of these magnificent apex predators to the 99.999 per cent of people who will never themselves see a free-swimming marlin underwater,' he added.

Not common: Striped marlins are rarely seen, and hardly ever photographed underwater in the wild

Danger: Photographing powerful predators up close is a potentially dangerous activity and Mr Perrine is keen to point out that he doesn't want to give the impression that he considers his hobby safe

Lucky man: Doug Perrine, 62, lives in Kailua Kona, Hawaii and is one of very few people to have taken a photograph of a striped marlin hunting sardines in its natural environment

Photographing large, powerful predators at close range in the open ocean is a potentially dangerous activity and Mr Perrine is keen to point out that he doesn't want to give the impression that he considers his hobby safe, or is encouraging aspiring wildlife photographers to copy him.

'Marlins are being over-harvested in much of the world's oceans, and most people don't pay much attention because this happens so far out of sight of land,' he said.

'However, apex predators exert a controlling influence on the food web beneath them, and their removal can reverberate throughout the ocean's ecosystem,' he added.
