GMail appeared to go dark for millions of users of Google email service today, causing widespread pandemonium among users across North America and Europe for about an hour.

The trouble began at about noon Eastern Time, but Google did not confirm there was a 'service disruption' until 12:30.

The internet search giant did not specify how many users were affected, or where.

Reports of a GMail outage were reported in the U.S., as well as Great Britain and Brazil.

The email service returned just before 1pm.

'We're investigating reports of an issue with Google Mail. We will provide more information shortly,' Google said on the Google Apps Dashboard, a website that provides status updates for the company's various Web products.

Before it was restored, the outage caused panic across cyberspace, with many Gmail users taking to Twitter to clear up their confusion.

'Is GMail down, or is it just me?' was a common tweet.

Others blamed the looming Mayan apocalypse for the disruption.

Dateline NBC correspondent Josh Mankiewicz saw the humor in the situation, tweeting: 'Gmail is down. In a related story, David Petraeus is available for lunch.'

Firmly entrenched in the consumer market, GMail is one of Google's most popular and important product offerings.

Gmail has just under 500 million customers worldwide.

The search giant has been pushing a corporate version of the email service to businesses as part of its Google Apps software suite, which competes with Microsoft Office.
