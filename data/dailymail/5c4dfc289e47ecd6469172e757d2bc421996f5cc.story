A teenage thug who savagely beat a great-grandmother with a crowbar in her own home has seen his sentence halved - because of his age.

Frail Jean McDougall, 89, was smashed in the face with a crowbar by 18-year-old Aaron Davis last October.

She was beaten so hard her false teeth came out and her glasses were left in pieces.

Davis repeatedly kicked her and left her with a broken nose, broken eye socket and a fractured spine.

Injuries: Jean McDougall suffered serious bruising around her eyes, face and upper arm, a laceration to her lip, bleeding on her brain and a compression fracture to the top of her spine - which still causes her pain

Her husband John, 84, was also clubbed with his wife’s walking stick by Davis who was raiding their home in Hextable, Kent.

He was jailed for ten years at Maidstone Crown Court on May 6 and told he would have to serve seven years before being released on parole.

But he appealed and two weeks later Judge David Griffiths QC cut his sentence to just five years because of his age

Mrs McDougall said: 'I’m a bit upset. I don’t think he should have had it reduced.

'We thought the sentence was quite fair, considering what he’s done. It’s dreadful really. He’s been very vicious.

'My husband is still getting terrible headaches. He has vascular dementia which means that his brain is collapsing and this attack didn’t help things - his head is really aching.'

Davis stole £40 and a watch in the burglary last October and was linked to another violent beating a month earlier in the same road when he snatched £150.

At his sentencing in May, Judge David Griffiths QC ordered him to serve ten and a half years in a young offenders’ institution, also imposing an extended five-year licence period for the protection of the public.

He told Davis: ‘Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you wanted to show off to your friends.

‘It is quite clear that these were to some extent premeditated, targeted offences - targeted, in that you chose vulnerable, elderly victims.

‘On such victims you didn’t need to use violence at all because of their frailty, but you chose to do so as you went about pursuing your intention of relieving them of various items - cash and other personal belongings.

'The use of violence against such victims was cowardly and likely to cause them serious injury.’

The court heard how Davis knocked on the couple's front door and spoke to Mrs McDougall, asking her the time, before leaving.

Later, having established his targets were elderly and vulnerable, he returned and this time demanded money.

Mr and Mrs McDougall were found by a neighbour, covered in blood and seriously injured. The woman asked police that images of her injuries be shown to show the full severity of the attack.

Jean, 89 and John McDougall, 84, at home. They say the teenagers vicious attack has had a lasting impact on their quality

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs McDougall said: ‘I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep.

‘I would say I now feel 90 years, whereas before I felt about 60. My comfortable existence has been shot to pieces. If I hear a noise when I’m in bed I lie there terrified.

‘John is not well at all. He has lost about a stone in weight. He complains about his head being sore. He suffers terrible headaches. John and I are prisoners in our own home now.

‘I feel as if my life stopped on that day in October and now I have a new life which is full of worry and anxiety and difficulties.'
