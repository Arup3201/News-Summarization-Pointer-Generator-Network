According to Chinese tradition the panda represents peace and stress-free living. But two four-year-old bears are flying straight into a political storm when they land in Belgium tomorrow. Male panda Xing Hui (which means Twinkling Star) and female Hao Hao (Cute) are to receive a red-carpet welcome when their chartered Boeing 747 touches down at Brussels airport.

Among those waiting on the tarmac to receive the pair - who are celebrities at home in China - will be Prime Minister, Elio Di Rupo.

Arrival: Male giant panda Xing Hui and female Hao Hao land in Brussels tomorrow

The bears have their own Twitter feed and Hao Hao was named China's favourite panda at the international Giant Panda Zoo Awards last year.

But their forthcoming arrival has inflamed old tensions between Belgium's Walloon (French-speaking) and Flemish populations.

French-speaking Mr Di Rupo has been accused by Flemish politicians of snubbing the country's oldest and most famous zoo, in Antwerp, when he helped to secure the pandas' visit to Belgium. 

Borrowed: with only 2,000 pandas left in the wild, China has lent the two bears to Belgium, which is paying ¿10m (£8.2m) for their visit

Instead the pandas are to stay in the Pairi Daiza animal park near the city of Mons, where the mayor is none other than Mr Di Rupo.  

The 170-year-old Antwerp zoo insists its pedigree and prestige should have made it the first choice.

A zoo spokesman told the Guardian it was better equipped to host the two four-year-olds, having accommodated two other pandas in 1987. 

All in all we are rather surprised that the prime minister did not think of us,' a spokesman said.

Zuhal Demir, an MP with the Flemish separatist N-VA party, has accused the prime minister of outright favouritism.  

'Di Rupo made a political choice,' Ms Demir said. 'He was not acting as prime minister of all Belgians.' 

However, Pairi Daiza's founder and owner, Eric Domb, insists the zoo was scrupulous in its application for the pandas. 'The pandas are Chinese, not Walloon or Flemish,' he said.

Pairi Daiza, set up just 20 years ago, is Belgium's most popular zoo, with 1.25 million visitors last year. Antwerp zoo, meanwhile, saw its visitor numbers stagnate at 840,000.

A shrewd commercial deal lies behind the pandas' visit. Belgium will pay an estimated €10m (£8.2m) to host the duo but they should more than pay for themselves. Visitors numbers to Edinburgh zoo leapt 51 per cent in 2012, the year after they began hosting pandas. 

With only around 2,000 pandas left in the wild, China is sparing about renting them out: Pairi Daiza is one of just 17 zoos worldwide hosting the bears.

Pairi Daiza is spending €8m (£6.61m) on a special 300 sq metre Chinese garden to make the pandas feel at home, and it will include separate 120 sq m residences for each. 

Hao Hao: the cost of having the two pandas on loan is high but visitor numbers could soar once the celebrity bears have arrived
