The Football Association has scrapped plans to field Great Britain men's and women's football teams at the 2016 Rio Olympics, according to reports.

The FA reportedly wrote to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations on Monday to inform them of the decision after failing to gain their support.

FIFA had confirmed that all four home nations would have to support a Team GB, and the Football Association of Wales especially has been vehemently opposed to the idea.

The FA wrote to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations in January telling them of its intent to enter men's and women's teams for Rio, but FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce confirmed earlier this month all home nations would have to consent.

Boyce said: 'I was given an absolute categorical reassurance from FIFA that unless full agreement could be reached between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there would be no GB team participating at next year's Olympics.'
