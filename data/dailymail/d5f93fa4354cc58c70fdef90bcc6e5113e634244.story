The polygamous king of Swaziland has kicked his twelfth wife out of his royal palace following claims she cheated on him with one of his friends, it was reported today (sun).

Officials working for King Mswati III, 43, ordered Nothando Dube, 23, to vacate her official residence last week, according to a report in South Africa's Sunday Times.

The eviction comes after the Queen, the twelfth of the monarch's 14 current wives, claimed she was being held as a prisoner in the palace following allegations made last year that she had cheated on her husband with the country's justice minister.

Shunned: King Mswati III has ordered his 12th wife to leave the royal residence over allegations she was unfaithful

The Sunday Times today reported how the dispute came to a head when Mrs Dube tried to leave her residence to visit a hospital after one of her children injured herself while playing.

The Queen claimed she was physically prevented from leaving the royal palace by a security guard whom she later attacked with pepper spray.

She told the newspaper: 'He threatened to hit me, saying I am not going anywhere with my child, who was bleeding from a deep wound.

'I had to protect myself so I sprayed him in the eyes.'

The violent altercation happened on November 12 at the secluded palace where Mrs Dube claims she had been held prisoner for more than a year.

The wife has previously spoken about how she had been prevented from seeing her husband since it was claimed last August that she had been caught having an affair.

King Mswati, Africa's last remaining 
absolute monarch, was said to be furious after the mother of three of 
his children was found in bed with Ndumiso Mamba, his close friend and 
the country's then justice minister.

Evicted: Nothando Dube claims that she was banned from leaving the palace or seeing her husband as punishment for the alleged betrayal

Queen Dube was placed under house arrest and Mr Mamba was sacked from the cabinet following the scandal, which was made public after pictures emerged of the bashful minister hiding in the base of her royal bed.

Since then, the wife had been held at the royal palace where she was allegedly banned from leaving or seeing her husband as punishment for the betrayal.

But Mrs Dube, a former Miss Swaziland who married the king when she was 16, was finally forced to leave the royal household following last week's row.

The Sunday Times reported that the matter was reported to the landlocked southern African state's Queen Mother, who decided she had been disrespectful by attacking the guard and should be kicked out.

The Queen told the newspaper her children remained at the palace following her eviction.

She said: 'I couldn't even take all my stuff, because they just said 'you have to pack and leave now'.

The Queen's sudden departure from the royal household has been condemned by human rights campaigners.

Lucky Lukhele, spokesman for the Swaziland Solidarity Network, criticised the king for LaDube's 'brutal eviction'.

Under Swazi tradition the monarch goes into 'seclusion' away from public view each spring before a ceremony to mark the first fruits of the year.

Mr Lukhele said royal sources claimed he had informed his mother he wanted his twelfth wife to have been removed this year by the time he returned.

Mr Kuhele, whose campaigning organisation is based in neighbouring South Africa, said: 'The ill-treatment that Mrs Dube has endured and the subsequent separation from her children is a very inhumane act'

Last week's eviction is reportedly the third time a Swazi queen has been forced to leave the royal household since 2004.

King Mswati is known to have at least 14 current wives and scores of children.

Under Swazi tradition the polygamous monarch is permitted to choose a new bride each year from a selection of the country's prettiest virgins who dance topless for him at the annual 'Reed Dance' festival.

His wives are each given homes within the king's string of official residences located around the tiny landlocked kingdom, which lies between South Africa and Mozambique.

However the royal family's lavish lifestyle has come under fire in recent months from campaigners who have demanded democracy in Swaziland.

King Mswati currently rules his 1.2 million subjects through informal discussion with the country's cabinet, whom he appoints himself.

But this year the authorities have been forced to quell a string of protest against his autocratic rule.

The monarch, who was educated at Britain's Sherborne School, has repeatedly refused to consider reform.

Political opposition parties in the country are banned and activists are routinely arrested or assaulted.

Despite the criticism of his rule, Mswati enjoys backing from neighbouring South Africa, who recently propped up the economy of its junior neighbour with a POUNDS 215m loan.

Swaziland is a former British protectorate which gained independence in 1968. The vast majority of its citizens live in poverty.

The population has also been ravaged by Aids and has one of the highest rates of infection in the world.

Some studies have suggested that up to 40 percent of the population could be living with the disease.
