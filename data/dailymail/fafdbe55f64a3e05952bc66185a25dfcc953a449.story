National Football League owners unanimously voted for a new personal conduct policy to be put in place in the wake of scandals involving players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. 

The league has been heavily criticized over the last six months as it struggled with a policy widely seen as too lenient. 

Commissioner Roger Goodell came under fire over his handling of the high-profile domestic violence cases involving Rice and Peterson with the players' union demanding Mr Goodell be removed entirely from the disciplinary process.

But a new 'comprehensive' policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas on Wednesday.  

Mr Goodell said: 'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL.'

Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, he said. 

He added: 'I have stated it many times: Being part of the NFL is a privilege. It is not a right. The measures adopted today uphold that principle.' 

He announced the league will hire a special counsel for investigations and conduct to oversee initial discipline, but Mr Goodell will retain authority to rule on appeals.

The commissioner may also appoint a panel of independent experts to participate in appeals.   

A nine-member committee that includes owners and their wives (the addition of female voices on the committee is new) and former players will oversee the implementation of the policy. 

Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of the committee, which has been brought in after a series of incidents saw players accused of domestic violence or child abuse. 

Last month, an arbitrator threw out Rice's indefinite suspension by the NFL for hitting his then-fiancee Janay in a hotel elevator, freeing him to play again.

Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones said Mr Goodell's decision in September to change Rice's original suspension from two games to indefinite was 'arbitrary' and an 'abuse of discretion.'

After noting the two-game suspension given to Rice was insufficient, Mr Goodell had changed the minimum punishment under the personal conduct policy to six games. 

But after a video of the punch became public, Rice was released by the Ravens and Goodell suspended him indefinitely.

Rice and the union contended he was essentially sentenced twice, and Jones agreed, saying Rice 'did not lie to or mislead the NFL.'

Peterson's appeal of a league suspension lasting until next April 15 was heard by Harold Henderson last week. Henderson, a former NFL executive, was appointed by Goodell to rule on the appeal and is expected to do so soon.

Peterson is seeking reinstatement, something Goodell said he would not consider before April 15.

The 2012 NFL MVP hasn't played for the Minnesota Vikings since Week 1 after he was charged with child abuse in Texas. 

He was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out, and he pleaded no contest on November 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault for injuring his four-year-old son with a wooden switch.

The league added the policy was developed after an extensive series of meetings and discussions over the past four months with a wide range of experts and others inside and outside the NFL.

These include current and former players, the NFL Players Association, domestic violence and sexual assault experts and advocates, law enforcement officials, academic experts and business leaders. 

Asked whether he anticipated a challenge from the union, Mr Goodell deferred to NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, who said the owners' decision was 'entirely consistent with the collective bargaining agreement.'

'I don't know whether the union will challenge it or not, but we've given it a lot of thought,' Pash said. 

'And I would hope they don't challenge. We'd be happy to sit down with them again tomorrow if they wanted to have some further conversations about it. I don't think there's any need for legal challenges.'
