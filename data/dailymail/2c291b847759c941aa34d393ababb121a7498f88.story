Fall: 21-year-old  Cameron Smook fell off the Carnival Glory cruise ship Sunday near the Bahamas. He was a senior at Virginia Tech university

A Virginia Tech student's spring break cruise of the Bahamas turned dark this weekend when he fell off the ship and disappeared in the tropical waters.

Engineering student Cameron Smook was caught on cameras falling off the Carnival Glory ship Sunday morning and he hasn't been seen since. 

His family from Glen Allen, Virginia authorized the university to release his name on Wednesday, and said he was on the cruise with a group of friends.

The U.S. Coast Guard spent three days searching for Smook near Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, but suspended the search Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday, Virginia Tech confirmed Smook attends the school, which is currently on spring break until March 15.

He was in his senior year, studying  mining and minerals engineering in the school's College of Engineering, and was scheduled to graduate this spring. 

Smook's parents say he had already accepted a job offer and 'was looking forward to a very bright future'.

Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen says no foul play is suspected in Smook's disappearance.

The Miami-based Carnival Glory departed Saturday on a seven-day Caribbean Cruise. On Sunday, Carnival informed Smook's family that he was missing at sea on the first leg of the journey.

The ship was diverted back to the spot where it's believed Smook went missing, and helped search the area with other boats and the Coast Guard, including fellow Carnival ship Ecstasy. 

Both ships have since been released from search duty and have continued with their planned journey. 

Carnival's CareTeam is currently providing support for the missing student's traveling companions and family. 

'We extend our heartfelt sympathy and concern for the family and loved ones of our missing guest,' the company said in a statement.   

In a statement, his family thanked the cruise line 'for their outstanding service and for keeping us informed throughout this ordeal'. 

Before attending Virginia Tech, Smook graduated from Deep Run High School in Glen Allen. 

Our son, Cameron Smook, and several of his friends departed from Miami on Saturday, March 7 aboard the Carnival Glory for a Caribbean cruise.

On Sunday morning, March 8 we were notified by Carnival Cruise Line officials that Cameron had accidentally fallen overboard during the night and was missing at sea.

The United States Coast Guard was notified and began search and rescue efforts. After conducting an extensive air and sea search these efforts were suspended last evening pending further developments. We thank the Coast Guard for their outstanding service and for keeping us informed throughout this ordeal.

Cameron, 21 years of age, is a graduate of Deep Run High School in Glen Allen, Virginia, and was scheduled to graduate from Virginia Tech this spring with a degree in Mining Engineering. He thoroughly enjoyed his experiences at Virginia Tech, had just accepted an employment offer, and was looking forward to a very bright future.

Our family sincerely appreciates your continued prayers and support at this most difficult time. We also request privacy and ask not to be contacted by members of the media.

Memorial service details will be shared at a later date.
