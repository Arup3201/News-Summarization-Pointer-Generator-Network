The home of the Minnesota Vikings has been demolished using controlled explosives.

A series of dynamite charges were set off at the Metrodome Stadium on Sunday. Within seconds, the roof ring fell and several walls collapsed in a cloud of dust at the stadium, long considered one of the worst  sporting venues.

The 32-year-old facility in downtown Minneapolis was being demolished last week but officials halted work after one part of the ring beam fell out of sequence.

Parts of the Metrodome stadium fall on Sunday in Minneapolis. Crews are planning to use controlled explosive charges as they continue to demolish the roof structure

After consulting with structural and 
demolition experts, the Minnesota Sports Facility Authority recommended 
bringing down the remaining portion of the ring beam with controlled 
explosives.

Contractors did so using 84 charges of dynamite in 24 columns of the upper concourse.

The public were kept 250 feet from the site, and the nearby light-rail station was closed during the demolition.

The explosion went off without a hitch and no one was injured during the controlled event.

Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome is still on schedule. It is expected to be completely torn down by the end of April 2014.

The stadium opened in 1982 and was home to the NFL team Minnesota Vikings until the end of the last season.

Teams moved in to demolish the Metrodome the day after the Vikings last game on December 29, 2013. 

The
 Vikings new stadium, which is being built nearby, will be ready by the 
2016 season. They are temporarily being housed at TCF Bank Stadium - 
home to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.

The Metrodome was the ninth-oldest stadium in the NFL and known locally as 'The Dome' and 'The Thunderdome'.

The Metrodome cost $55 million to build - coming in under budget. It is the only venue in the world which has hosted a MLB All-Star Game (1985), a Super Bowl (1992), an NCAA Final Four (1992 & 2001) and a World Series (1987 & 1991).

One major criticism of the stadium was that it was incredibly loud to watch a game due to the fabric-domed roof which amplified the sound.

The
 Metrodome's air-supported roof collapsed under the weight of snow from a
 severe winter storm in early December 2010 when more than 17 inches 
fell.

Many games in the
 sports calendar were forced to be canceled until the roof was finally 
replaced in August 2011 at a cost of $18million. 

The MLB's Minnesota Twins played at the Metrodome between 1982 - 2009 before moving to Target Field. 

It was considered one of the worst venues for baseball in an ESPN survey of fans in 2001 because the shape of the stadium made it near impossible to see the pitcher's mound and home plate from some seats.
