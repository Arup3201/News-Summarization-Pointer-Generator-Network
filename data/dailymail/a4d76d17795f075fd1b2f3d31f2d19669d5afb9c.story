An epic, multimillion-dollar divorce case which dealt with allegations of everything from infidelity to bugging to drug use has finally come to a close after a whopping five years.

Ex-Yahoo boss Susan Decker, 49, and husband Michael Dovey, 52, reached a settlement Monday in the California case involving some $71million in real estate, stock, cash and other assets.

Marin County Superior Court Judge Verna Adams approved the settlement presented by the former couple's attorneys Monday morning, just before a trial in the case was set to begin.

Decker and Dovey met at Harvard Business School and married in 1992. They have three children.

They filed for divorce in 2007 - the same year Decker was promoted to president of Yahoo - after about 15 years of marriage.

She resigned in 2009 following a tumultuous period for the company.

Also that year, a confidential letter from Dovey's attorneys to Decker's became public alleging she had extramarital affairs, bugged the couple's condo in Laguna Beach to spy on her husband and used illegal drugs.

Decker's lawyers called those claims reckless and inaccurate. 

Dovey's attorneys claimed Decker had similarly accused him of infidelity and drug use.

In a joint statement to the San Jose Mercury News, Decker and Dovey said: "As in any acrimonious divorce, certain statements were made by the parties in the process of litigation that were reckless and inaccurate. We deeply regret this'.

The statement went on: 'We have three amazing children and we share the important task of raising them responsibly and lovingly. For their sake, we want to put this matter to rest once and for all and have settled all matters in this case'.

The properties involved in the divorce negotiations included the family's five-bedroom home in Belvedere, a wealthy Marin County enclave along San Francisco Bay.

The former couple also owned the $6million Laguna Beach condo, two Lake Tahoe condos worth a combined $2million and a $1million parcel of land in Napa.

None of the properties carried mortgages.

Dovey had earned up to $1.5million as an investment banker at Montgomery Securities but stopped working in his 30s, according to court filings.

He had about $13million in savings when he left his job.

During the protracted court battle, Dovey's attorneys issued multiple subpoenas to officials at Yahoo demanding emails and records. 

Yahoo's head of corporate security was among the witnesses scheduled to testify.
