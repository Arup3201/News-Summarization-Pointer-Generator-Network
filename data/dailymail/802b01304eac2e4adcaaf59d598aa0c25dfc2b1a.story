Key Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene will miss the third one-day international against England in Hambantota on Wednesday for personal reasons.

A Sri Lanka Cricket team spokesman confirmed Jayawardene's absence, and the call-up of Ashan Priyanjan as his replacement.

'He asked to miss the match, for personal reasons, and permission was granted by the board,' the spokesman said.

Jayawardene made an unbeaten half-century against England in the second ODI on Saturday

Veteran Jayawardene made an unbeaten half-century as Sri Lanka beat England by eight wickets in Colombo on Saturday to go 2-0 up in the seven-match series. 

Meanwhile, England will begin their competitive preparations for next year's World Cup slightly earlier than planned, after Cricket Australia amended the tri-series programme.

Alastair Cook's team were scheduled to play their first match on Sunday, January 18 in Sydney, against Australia, after the hosts had opened the tournament by facing India two days earlier.

But the new schedule means England will play Australia first, still at the SCG, on January 16 - with India then taking on the home team in Melbourne two days later.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has updated its warm-up schedule in Australia, before the first one-day international, and voiced understanding of why the changes have been made following the death of Phillip Hughes.

England will begin their tour against an Australian Capital Territory XI at Canberra's Manuka Oval on January 12, and then face a PM's XI at the same venue on January 14, before moving on to Sydney.

The ECB's acting chief executive Brian Havill said: 'I am grateful to the England players and management for agreeing to this switch, which allows Cricket Australia to rearrange their international summer following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.

'ECB recognise that these are extremely difficult times for the Australian cricket community - and we were determined to help Cricket Australia, if at all possible, with their scheduling issues.'
