Thomas Muller wants clarification over his future at Bayern Munich.

The Germany international is interested in talking to Manchester United if Bayern can not assure him of a greater role.

Champion player: Tomas Muller helped Bayern Munich win a league and cup double this term

On the radar: Kevin Strootman has emerged as a target for Louis van Gaal once he takes over at United

He said: 'I have reached the point where I want to know if I am an essential component of the Bayern Munich first XI for the new season and if the club has plans for me. Thatâ€™s why I will be out to have a meeting.'

United remain keen on a deal for Roma's Kevin Strootman also but that may wait until January.
