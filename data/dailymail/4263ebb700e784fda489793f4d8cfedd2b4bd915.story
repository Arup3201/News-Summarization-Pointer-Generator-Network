So Everton continue to fly England’s flag in Europe and there is no sense they are ready for this adventure to end.

This has been a hugely frustrating domestic campaign, one in which Everton have lurched to the brink of calamity. But the Europa League has provided excitement and opportunity and did so again, with Everton now 90 minutes away from the last eight.

True, it will be difficult to get there. Allowing Dynamo Kiev to score an away goal means Everton will require a performance of strength and discipline in Ukraine next week but at least they can travel with confidence thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s 82nd-minute penalty.

Steven Naismith’s goal had dented Kiev’s hopes of a first win in England in 12 visits but, more importantly, it showed Everton’s appetite to fight. On a filthy night when the rain tumbled relentlessly, it would have been easy for them to buckle.

As it was, they kept going. There were excellent performances, not least from captain Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry, and there was also courage, not least from Lukaku. His seventh European goal of the campaign may just be the one Roberto Martinez needs to turn things around.

‘It has to be a turning point,’ said the Everton manager. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team.

‘You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know we have a good side.’

Usually for such contests, there is a crackle of anticipation around Goodison Park but things were markedly different.

Everton’s dreadful form through a bleak midwinter has left many fans sceptical and miserable performances have sapped their energy.

A positive start would have quelled anxieties but Everton, playing in all blue on orders from UEFA to avoid a clash with Dynamo, were sluggish and horribly short of confidence. No one was prepared to take charge or provide a run to open gaps for others.

Sensing they could profit, Dynamo began to venture forward with increased purpose, and after 14 minutes they inflicted the kind of blow that Martinez had spoken of with dread in the build-up, a goal to complicate an already difficult task.

In many ways, it highlighted Everton’s current ills. Andriy Yarmolenko flung in a corner, James McCarthy was too slow to react and Oleg Gusev nipped in to direct a volley into the roof of the Gwladys Street net. Standing on the touchline in the downpour, Martinez looked shell-shocked.

When Sergei Sydorchuk then tested Tim Howard with a shot from 20 yards that skidded off the greasy surface, the groans were becoming louder and there was a definite sense that rebellion was in the air.

Naismith finished off some wonderful work from Lukaku to give Everton a foothold in the game. Check out more from Match Zone

Then, from nowhere, Everton started to play. ‘We gave a cheap goal away but I could not be more proud of our reaction,’ said Martinez. 

The momentum shifted when Jagielka charged down a loose ball and surged upfield, passing to Lukaku with Dynamo keeper Olexandr Shovkovskiy stranded outside his area. Had Lukaku returned the pass, Jagielka would have had an open goal to aim at but instead the Belgian shot horribly wide.

No matter. Everton had a spark and in the next attack, after 37 minutes, Luke Garbutt’s inswinging corner was met flush by Jagielka but the England defender’s header was cleared from under the bar by Danilo Silva.

Antolin Alcaraz then smashed the rebound over the bar.

This was a significant improvement and soon Everton were level. Lukaku can infuriate with his ability to make the wrong call but his play to create the equaliser for Naismith was outstanding, bull-dozing his way past three challenges before slipping in the Scot, whose finish was admirably cool.

As he wheeled away to celebrate, Naismith made a point of signalling to Jagielka and for good reason. He had played a captain’s role, taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving his team forward. His input was crucial. Half-time came but it did not check Everton’s impetus. They came out of the blocks for the second period with purpose and Lukaku’s hulking presence continually unsettled Silva and forced him to make mistakes. One such error led to a corner from which Naismith almost scored with a header.

That Naismith missed was not a problem. The mood around the stadium had completely changed. Everton looked dangerous every time they attacked and the suspicion was that Shovkovskiy would buckle if they kept testing him, as the impressive Garbutt did with a fizzing free-kick.

Each raid forward attracted encouragement from the stands and aware of the difference the crowd could make, Lukaku urged them to keep making a noise. Suddenly it felt like Everton could pinch a lead and so it proved with eight minutes remaining.

When Silva handled substitute Leon Osman’s cross, referee Carlos Carballo had no hesitation pointing to the spot. Lukaku did the rest, firing his penalty straight down the middle.

Warsaw on May 27, for the moment, remains an aspiration.Lukaku said: ‘The team reacted well after the first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top-class players. It’s up there with my best performances. If we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this.’
