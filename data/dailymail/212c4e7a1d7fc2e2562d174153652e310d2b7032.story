A magnificent Caribbean-style beach villa has gone on the market for £3.5m - but there’s just one hitch for a millionaire buyer seeking a sun-soaked paradise home.

The dream property is thousands of miles away from the Caribbean sun - at Abersoch on the North Wales coast, one of the rainiest places in Britain.

The award-winning house dubbed the 'James Bond House' looks as if it should be on the palm fringed shores of St Lucia in the West Indies.

Magnificent: The Caribbean-style villa is on the market for £3.5million and is known as the James Bond House. It has beautiful views over Cardigan Bay

Average temperatures in St Lucia are in the high eighties compared to 50F of North Wales.

While St Lucia gets eight hours of sunshine every day the resort of Abersoch gets just a fraction of that. And this summer the sun has hardly peeped behind the clouds.

The owner, chartered accountant Stuart Sim, 60, said: 'It’s quite a place. When the weather is sunny it’s just like being in the Caribbean.

Stunning: The panoramic views of blue sea can be seen for miles through the toughened glass windows from the comfort of the sofa

Al fresco: The desk area outside the house is a spacious spot for entertaining and is just yards from the sandy beach below

Views: The brand new stylish kitchen also has remarkable views of the beach, the harbour and Cardigan bay

'The views are quite remarkable, taking in the beach, the harbour, Cardigan Bay and the mountains.'

Mr Sim built the house, called Cilgeraint, three years ago and it won a local authority award for building excellence.

Now he is retiring and giving someone the chance to take in the panoramic sea views through its huge toughened-glass windows.

Modern: The house was built three years ago and it won a local authority award for building excellence

Spacious: The 3,700 sq ft villa has four en suite bedrooms, floor to ceiling glazing, a sun deck leading to a private access to the beach

Luxury: Two of the bathrooms in the house look like they should belong in a luxury hotel rather than a beach house in Wales

Design features: The villas has its own car parking deck, a living grass roof, Italian porcelain tiles and American walnut flooring

It has its own car parking deck, a living grass roof which is currently in flower, Italian porcelain tiles and American walnut flooring and staircases.

Estate agent Beresford Adams said: 'It is a stunning state-of-the-art beach side home with spectacular panoramic views.

Bargain: Estate agents are describing the property as a 'state-of-the-art beach side home with spectacular panoramic views

Leisure time: Near the villa whoever becomes the new owner can enjoy facilities at the nearby yacht club and an 18 hole golf course

'There are boat launching facilities just down the hill from the property. Close by on the headland lies the South Caernarfonshire yacht club together with a challenging 18-hole golf course.'

Locals say the property is way out of their price range and are expecting it to be snapped up by someone wealthy from outside the area.

One Abersoch resident said: 'The house is absolutely stunning - it has been nicknamed the James Bond House ever since it was built. It wouldn’t look out of place on some tropical beach in the Caribbean.

'It’s just a pity that it’s in one of the wettest and windiest places in Britain.'

Weather: Abersoch is one of the windiest and wettest places in Britain so the new owners must be able to deal with the changeable weather
