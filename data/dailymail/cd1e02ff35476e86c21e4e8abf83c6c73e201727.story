A movie trailer masquerading as a Russian tampon advert that features a brutal shark attack has sparked controversy following its release.

Playing on the fact that sharks can detect blood in the water, the ad, apparently created for Tampax, shows two glamorous women enjoying the beach.

But when they decide to go for a swim, one is savagely attacked by a shark just moments after entering the water.

Scroll down for video

Beach life: The advert opens with a beautiful brunette woman making her way to the sea for a quick cool down

Lurking danger: The brunette and her blonde friend are seen cooling off in the water

The gory scene sees the model's blood and limbs explode from the water as she is devoured by the ravenous shark.

A message then pops up on the screen reading: 'Tampax: Now Leak-Proof'.

While it is only being shown on Russian screens for now, the advert is in English, leading many viewers to presume it will hit British screens soon.

Shark attack: Whilst she is swimming, the dark-haired woman is viciously attacked by a ravenous shark

Gory: The woman's blood and limbs can be seen flying out of the water in the spoof tampon advert, a promotional video for upcoming film Movie 43

Unsurprisingly, the ad has sparked a strong reaction on social media.

One Twitter use wrote: 'Not your usual girly ad, this Russian Tampax commercial is way cooler + involves a shark attack.'

But another failed to see the funny side, reading: 'Enough with the Russian Tampax commercial, everyone. A woman being 
attacked by a shark for not using the right Tampax isn't funny.'

Warning: After the brutal attack, a message pops up on the screen which states: 'Tampax: Now Leak-Proof'

Controversy: Twitter users have been confused as to whether the YouTube video is a genuine ad or a spoof. In fact, it is the latter - a promo for new film Movie 43

According to the advert's YouTube 
'about' section, it isn't actually an official advert for Tampax at all 
but rather a promotional video for upcoming film Movie 43.

Movie
43 is a series of interconnected short films following a washed-up 
producer and features some of the biggest stars in Hollywood like 
Richard Gere, Elizabeth Banks and Emma Stone.

One
Twitter user added: 'Surprised at the amount of people believing the 
"Tampax Shark" ad from "Movie 43" is a real commercial from Russian TV. I
wish it was.'

The 'ad' is not actually promoting Tampax, rather a promotional video for upcoming film Movie 43
