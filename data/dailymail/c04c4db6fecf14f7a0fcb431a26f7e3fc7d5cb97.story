They say that Christmas is a time for giving - and that's a motto that dog lover Stephanie Mariam takes very seriously.

The animal fanatic spends a staggering £4,000 on presents for her pet pooches over the festive season.

Her pint-sized Pomeranians, Harvey Moon, age 3, and Connie, age 2, could be Britain's most pampered pets.

Dog lover: Stephanie Mariam splashes out £2,000 on presents for her pet pooches, Harvey Moon, age 3, and Connie, age 2, every Christmas

On December 25, they are lavished with gifts from crystal dog collars and luxury beds to the ultimate dog's Christmas dinner.

While most people break the bank buying presents for loved ones at Christmas, dog lover Stephanie, 21, reveals she's not as generous when it comes to other gifts and has spent more on her dogs than she did on her own family.

The extravagant Christmas wish list, of which Stephanie has already purchased and lovingly wrapped, includes two £700 doggie beds, two £200 Swarovski crystal collars and leads.

There's also £450 worth of clothing, £250 worth of toys, two £230 dog-friendly bags and £170 worth of accessories including hair bows, brushes and bowls under the tree.

At home, it's become a family tradition on Christmas day for Stephanie to present her dogs with extra-large bones while they lay in their new luxury beds.

The dogs, who usually start their day by opening the last window of their advent calendar, even join the family for Christmas dinner complete with all the doggy trimmings.

Stephanie, who lives with her parents in Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'Harvey Moon and Connie will spend every waking hour with us at Christmas because they are a part of the family.

Best friends: Steph said of her pooches: 'My dogs are part of my family and I'd do anything for them'

'They both love Christmas - especially the food and the cuddles. They will have their own stocking, which we open whilst in bed, and they will join us for present opening in the morning in their doggy onesies.

'We give them just what every dog wants on Christmas, love, food and cuddles, with a bit of extra pampering diva style, of course.

'I don't really spend much money on myself, I'm a fairly easy going person, but my dogs take first priority.

'At the end of the day, I look after my money, I don't go out partying or drinking, so ultimately, it's up to me if I want to spoil my dogs.'

Proud: Speaking about her expenditure, Steph said: 'People might say that spending this much on my dogs is excessive, but I think it's justified'

But for Stephanie, her dogs are for life not just for Christmas and she spoils them with fancy clothes, gifts and presents all year round.

She works over 52 hours a week as a mental health nursing assistant and dance instructor to fund her pampered pooch's lavish lifestyles.

Lunch: Dog friendly turkey, chicken, potatoes, vegetables, pigs in blankets, special gravy made for dogs, Christmas doggy biscuits

Dinner: Lilly's kitchen special Christmas dinner which is an organic beef, potato and vegetable dog food dish 

Earlier this year, canine crazy Stephanie splashed out £10,000 on a party for her four legged friends to celebrate Connie becoming a new member of her family.

The £10,000 sum went towards a fire dancer, customised doggie outfits, a party planner and a red carpet for a party to match the decadence of a celebrity's.

She said: 'People might say that spending this much on my dogs is excessive, but I think it's justified.

'My parents are happy with the way I spend my money, they know I work two jobs, one of which is full-time and they know I'm saving for my future.

'I'm living within my means so the number of hours I work justifies the money I spend on my doggies.'

Steph said: 'My dogs are part of my family and I'd do anything for them.'
