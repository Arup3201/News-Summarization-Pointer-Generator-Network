Tyson Fury put tape over his mouth to ensure that he gave the first silent press conference in the loud mouthed history of boxing.

So determined was the giant 26-year-old not to cause further offence in the build-up to his heavwyeight battle of Britain with Dereck Chisora that he uttered not one word as the two came face to face in London.

Fury has been fined £15,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control for the four-letter outburst at their previous head-to-head confrontation.

Tyson Fury taped up his mouth and wouldn't speak to the press ahead of his fight with Dereck Chiso 

Tyson Fury promised to maintain his silence until the Chisora fight is over

Peter Fury, his uncle and trainer, did have something to say: 'The Board wanted us to tone it down a bit so here's Tyson... the Board dummy.'

Fury was prepared to respond to questions with gestures and indicated that he will knockout Chisora in one or two rounds at the ExCeL arena in London's Docklands on November 29.

That is the rescheduled date for a world title eliminator which was postponed when Chisora cracked his hand in sparring.

Fury, who had the initial letters BBBC written on his mouth tape, stripped off his shirt to reveal a torso well-honed with the fight still two months away.

When asked if he would maintain his vow of silence throughout those eight weeks he nodded in the affirmative.

Muhammad Ali – not only the greatest but the most voluble of all boxers - famously taped over his mouth after being pilloried for speaking too much. 

He ripped away the gag after a few minutes, unable to contain himself any longer.

Promoter Mick Hennessy made it clear how seriously the Board viewed Fury's previous rant when he said: 'This fight could be in jeopardy. If anything else happened, we could be looking at a year's ban.'

Frank Warren, the lead promoter, made his own apology for the outrageous uproar which went before when he said: 'I should have controlled that press conference better. I hold my hands up. I share some of the blame for what went on. Fortunately there was nothing physical.'

Peter Fury and Hennessy revealed that they were upset at being excluded from the Board of Control hearing.

Hennessy said: 'We need characters in boxing. Sometimes Tyson is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself.' 

The irony, of course, is that this impersonation of Marcel Marceau will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto. 

Muhammad Ali once taped his mouth shut but only kept up the appearance for a matter of minutes

Dereck Chisora will take on Fury in six weeks and promised to knock the silent fighter out

Fury was fined £15,000 for his four-letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year

Chisora was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that Fury was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage, he said simply: 'I will knock him out.'

Boxing now holds its breath, waiting to see if Tyson will be able to hold his peace until the end of November.

Tyson Fury v Dereck Chisora will be live on BoxNation on Saturday 29 November. 

Smith in with a sniff of world title against Abraham

Paul Smith, at 31 the eldest of the four boxing brothers from Liverpool, becomes the first of the family to fight for a world title when he challenges Arthur Abraham for the WBO super-middleweight belt in Germany on Saturday night.

He will have the support of 2,000 travelling fans on what will be a tough assignment. But he believes the veteran Abraham has slipped into decline since his Super Six loss to Carl Froch four years ago.

Paul, Stephen and Liam Smith have all won British titles. Their youngest brother Callum is unbeaten and widely predicted to become the most successful.

While Paul realises that the odds are against him, he expects all his siblings to become world champions.

Smith, having been stopped by both Carl Froch and George Groves, has been selected for this fight as a warm-up for bigger things for Abraham. But if he is at his very best it might not be beyond him to spring the upset.

Wilson showing signs of recovery 

Sheffield boxer Jerome Wilson is showing signs of recovery from brain surgery following a devastating knock-out in his home town.

Wilson, in an induced coma for more than a week, has opened his eyes, squeezed his mother’s hand and is reported to be breathing 90 per cent independently.

A Jerome Wilson Rehabilitation Fund has been opened to help pay for the long and complex treatment ahead. Donations are being accepted at: Barclays Bank, Sort Code 20-76-92, Account number 63868354.

Stars turn out for Astaire 

Michael Watson, Dave Boy Green, Maurice Hope, Billy Schwer and Colin McMillan were among many champions guided down the years by Jarvis Astaire who have turned out to support the 90-year-old boxing grandee at a nostalgic occasion in east London.

Astaire had a Variety Sunshine Coach named after him. The fleet of £30,000 buses are purpose designed for taking physically challenged children on holidays and outings.

In addition to his partnership with Mickey Duff which controlled British boxing for decades, Astaire is a long-time luminary of the Variety charity.
