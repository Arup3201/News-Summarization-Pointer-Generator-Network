A US airline has become a laughing stock on Twitter after it repeatedly addressed an unhappy customer as ‘Mr Human’ in a letter of apology.

Florida journalist Chris Chmura exposed United Airlines’ embarrassing gaffe after the Chicago-based carrier responded to his complaint with a standard template email that they had failed to personalize.

The airline’s customer care department did not  address Mr Chmura by his name and instead referred to him as ‘Mr Human’ on three separate occasions.

Mr Chmura wrote the letter because he claims he turned up for a flight home to Houston and it had left without him despite him arriving at the gate on time. 

He told MyFoxTampaBay.com: 'They left me behind, and I wanted to know why'.

He claims to have showed up at the gate at 7:12pm for a 7:32pm flight but the flight had already left. United's records show that the flight left the gate at 7:32pm.

Mr Chmura, who works for a Fox News affiliate in Tampa, shared a screen grab of the email with his Twitter followers and the image soon went viral.

The email read: ‘Mr Human, your email clearly expresses your disappointment and I would like to extend a sincere apology for any negative impression that may have been created. 

‘While my reply is brief and not as detailed as I would like, please be assured that we do understand your concerns, and they have been documented for review and appropriate internal action.’ 

United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart said Mr. Chmura was addressed incorrectly due to a spell check error. 

The airline promised to follow up with an electronic travel certificate as a gesture of goodwill.

After posting a screen grab of the email, Mr Chmura was flooded with tweets from people ridiculing the airline and poking fun at the journalist.

Several users pointed out that the airline’s failure to refer to Mr Chmura by name and its use of a standard template undermined its attempt at sincerity.

This is the second time in three months United Airlines has faced embarrassment for a customer care email

Twitter user Kristen Hicks wrote: ‘That doesn’t read like a generic form letter at all.’

Another user, Chris Boex, said: ‘Sincerely, Mr Robot’.

While a user named Pete added: ‘Sincerely, Mr Auto Reply’. 

The nature of Mr Chmura's  complaint is unknown. 

One Twitter user 'Consumerist' took things one step further and emailed United and a number of other airlines asking them to confirm that they hadn't been taken over by robots. 

The American Airlines account replied, with a hint of humour: 'We assure you there has been no #robot takeover here! We're human and here to help 24/7.'

United Airlines faced similar embarrassment last August when it sent a boiler plate apology to a customer but forgot to fill in the blanks and addressed the person as 'Customer Name'. 

American Airlines couldn't resist a dig and insisted: 'We're human and here to help 24/7'
