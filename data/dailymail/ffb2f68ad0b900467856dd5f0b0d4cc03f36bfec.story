These shocking images show the moment a man apparently helped lift a young girl over the barriers at a dangerous tombstoning spot before she leapt about 30ft into the water.

CCTV footage of the dangerous incident shows the man apparently lowering the girl over jetty railings at Langstone Harbour, in the Eastney area of Portsmouth, Hampshire, before she daringly jumps off into the treacherous sea below.

The harbour, where tombstoning is a known problem, is just a couple of hundred yards from South Parade Pier where 27-year-old Sonny Wells was left paralysed after jumping into the sea in 2008.

After being helped over the jetty railings, the girl flings herself from the pier and falls 30ft to the sea below

Bob Evans, sailing secretary of the Eastney Cruising Association which captured the latest incident on CCTV, said he was stunned by the footage.

He said: 'I always thought this sort of thing was a problem with unsupervised kids.

'But as you can see, the photos show a man who appears to help a girl over the railings before she throws herself off.

'You can also see how close the boats can get to these kids in the water and that particular spot has a very strong tide especially on the ebb.

'Kids' heads and boat propellers need to be kept far apart.'

Tombstoning was a common problem in the area last summer, and already this year boys have been seen jumping off Eastney's jetty.

Six years ago, Mr Wells from Havant, Hampshire, was left paralysed after jumping 30ft from the nearby South Parade Pier.

The keen footballer was just 20-years-old when he jumped from the pier in a 'moment of madness'.

He had to be dragged from the water unconscious and airlifted by helicopter to Southampton General Neurological Unit.

He was left paralysed from the chest down and will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life after he broke his neck in the terrifying jump.

After viewing the latest images of teenager's tombstoning, his mother Jacqui Unal, 49, said: 'You only have to look at what happened to Sonny.

'I'm speechless.'

Councillor Neil Young, in charge of children's services in Portsmouth, said that youngsters were risking life and limb by tombstoning.

He also expressed concerns that they were jumping into water close to a sewage outlet.

Louise MacCallum, from the Langstone Harbour Board, which manages the stretch of water, said: 'I can totally understand why people want to cool off by going in the sea.

'But I know all too well that the sea can be a very dangerous place.

'You should always treat the coast with respect - it's easy to forget that when the sea is blue and everyone is eating ice creams.

'There are currents out there that are very strong, and if you are jumping into the sea, you don't know what's underneath - you could be injured or worse.

'We also have some big ships coming in and out. To spot a person in the sea is not always easy from a boat.'
