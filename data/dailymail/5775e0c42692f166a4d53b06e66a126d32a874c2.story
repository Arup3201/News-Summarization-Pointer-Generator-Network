Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe said it was time for the police to get a pay rise

Britain's top cop Bernard Hogan Howe has said it is time for the police to get a pay rise.

The Scotland Yard chief said police officers had been hit by years of pay freezes and had seen their standard of living deteriorate 'like everybody else'.

His remarks came in response to David Cameron's call for businesses to hand their staff a pay rise in a major speech today.

Sir Bernard, appearing on LBC radio this morning, was also grilled on Scotland Yard's  battle to combat terrorism.

But the Scotland Yard chief was left red-faced after forgetting the number of the anti-terror hotline set up for people to report their concerns about extremism.

It came after he was asked by a caller what he made of the Prime Minister's urge for pay rises.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said: 'I think it's a very good idea, particularly for police officers.'

He added: 'I think the point he is making … is that as business costs reduce through fuel and other things, our interest rates down that some of the profits that have been made should be shared with their staff.

'Well I don't suppose that applies to the police but it's certainly true that our officers and staff have seen fixed salaries now for a number of years and like everyone else has seen their standard of living deteriorate.

'So anything that would help them I support. And if that, if it's possible to get a pay rise of course we'd support it.'

Sir Bernard said the police had only received a below-inflation 1 per cent pay rise last year after 'two to three years of a pay freeze' following the 2008 recession.

He added: 'I think it would be helpful, particularly with the London property market, to make sure that you know our officers are properly rewarded.'

The police chief's intervention came after Mr Cameron urged booming businesses to pass on their profits in bigger pay cheques to their staff.

In an attempt to create an election feed-good factor, the Prime Minister insisted trading conditions in Britain have 'not been this good for a long time', and it is time employees saw wage rises after years of a squeeze living conditions.

It comes as a sharp fall in oil prices is helping to fuel the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis.

The Prime Minister was accused of hypocrisy after calling for a pay rise for private sector workers, while overseeing continuing wage restraint in the public sector

Bernard Hogan Howe was left red-faced this morning after admitting he could not remember the anti-terrorism hotline number he has urged Londoners to use.

The Metropolitan Police commissioner  was asked to repeat the freephone number by LBC host Nick Ferrari after a former serviceman called in to say he had not seen it publicised.

Sir Bernard said: 'At this second I must admit I haven't got it with me - it's an 0800 number, so it's free ... Every other time I've been in (to the LBC phone-in) I think I have actually mentioned it.

'You could argue it's an unmemorable number.'

The commissioner was later informed the hotline number is 0800 789 321.

He added: 'It's ascending and descending numbers. It is probably not that easy to remember - as I've just highlighted.'

Latest figures show that average wages rose by 1.8 per cent in the year to November, while the CPI rate of inflation stands at just 0.5 per cent.

Mr Cameron said: 'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.'

But it comes after years of prices rising faster than pay, leaving families worse off each month.

Critics accused the government of double standards, because pay in the public sector has been frozen or slated to rise by just 1 per cent.

Unions claim the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year as a result of pay failing to keep pace with inflation.

The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady dismissed Mr Cameron's call as 'no more than pre-election mood music'.

She said: 'Since David Cameron became Prime Minister, the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year, the worst fall in living standards since Queen Victoria was on the throne.

'Saying it would be nice if wages went up is no more than pre-election mood music. If elected again his policies would do the opposite.

'Huge cuts would take spending back to the same share of the economy as in the 1930s. This would depress the economy and mean public sector wages would fall every year. On top of that he would make strikes almost impossible, holding back pay across every sector.'

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey added: 'If Cameron was serious about giving Britain a pay rise then he'd put his money where his mouth is and immediately boost the minimum wage by at least £1.50 an hour with the promise of a living wage. Instead we have empty words, which don't put food on the table or pay the rent.'

Unison's general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'If Jeremy Hunt was following David Cameron's lead, he would have implemented the NHS pay review body's recommendations in full last month.'

The round-the-clock police operation to guard fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a drain on taxpayers' money and is being reviewed, the UK's most senior officer has said.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC radio that the force is assessing its options due to the pressure the operation at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is putting on resources.

He said: 'We won't talk about tactics but we are reviewing what options we have. It is sucking our resources.'

Mr Assange has been at the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults, which he denies.

Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the cost of the operation was around the £10 million mark.

Australian Mr Assange came under intense scrutiny after WikiLeaks began releasing a selection of more than 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables passed to the whistle-blowing website back in 2010.

Mr Assange's supporters last year pondered whether he was to end his self-imposed embassy stay amid concerns over his long-term health.
