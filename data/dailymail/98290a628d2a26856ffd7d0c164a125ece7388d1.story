Having increased security on phones is a comfort if it’s lost or stolen - but having to add fingerprints, passwords and PINs does make accessing these devices a drawn-out process. 

Thankfully, Apple appears to be working on a way to make this process a lot easier, without compromising on high security levels. 

The firm’s latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options, based on the user’s location, meaning the phone would automatically unlock when in a ‘safe’ location.

Apple is planning to put some muscle behind its future iPhones - literally.

The
 Cupertino-based company published a patent last month to use
 an ‘artificial muscle system’ for focusing cameras in devices such as 
its iPhone and iPad.

The patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move, to focus the lens and take images.

The system could allow for much slimmer 
mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera 
components, the company said.

For example, if the device is connected to the user’s home Wi-Fi network, or the network inside their office, the phone will not ask for the security code or fingerprint scan, and will keep the screen unlocked.

Additionally, the patent describes how the 'location' doesn't need to refer to a fixed location, and could also include a user's car.

To verify the location, the phone could connect to the car's Bluetooth, navigation systems or audio displays.

Alternatively, if the phone is on a mobile or public network, in a pub or café, security levels could be increased. 

This could add extra security levels, in addition to the PIN, passcode or fingerprint scan.

The patent, titled ‘Location-sensitive security levels and setting profiles based on detected location’ was filed in December 2012 and awarded earlier this month.

‘To provide a reliably pleasant and secure experience for a user operating a mobile device, it can be desirable to modify security settings or other device behaviour based on a detected location,’ explained the patent.

‘Mobile devices often have security requirements, such as passwords or passcodes. 

‘Security requirements help ensure that a mobile device is in the hands of the appropriate party, [but] often the security level remains the same regardless of the location of the mobile device. 

‘Because some locations may be inherently more secure, such as a user's home or office, these locations may be considered ‘safe’ and require less stringent security. 

‘Conversely, some locations may be considered higher risk or ‘unsecure.’ In these locations, it can be desirable to implement stronger security protections.'

As with all patents, this technology may not end up on a device.
