A pensioner whose aunt met Hitler and a second married a fascist leader is living in a beach tent with his piano after being kicked out of his house by his wife.

Ben Treuhaft, 66, whose mother Jessica was one of the infamous Mitford sisters has set up on the beach after the row with his 39-year-old wife.

Mr Treuhaft is now facing a court battle with Edinburgh City Council after erecting his new tent on Portobello beach.

Soon after pitching his tent, council officials served Mr Treuhaft with an eviction notice ordering to leave the area.

However, the American born musician, who has since moved in with his new girlfriend Mirka Rdzak, 31, has vowed to fight the council.

Mr Treuhaft has said he will now install a bigger piano that will be harder for the council to shift.

He said: 'It's an escalation of the piano war. The council escalated the situation by threatening me with a notice of eviction, so my response is to put a bigger piano on the beach.

'They have no shame whatsoever in pursuing this ridiculous claim and I'm not going to make it easy for them.

'I'm selling the old piano for £3.99. The new one is a 600-pound pianola - it's much wider and heavier and will be harder to move.

'The movers barely got the sucker into the tent.

'I'm going to fight the eviction notice. It's all 'pi-anarchy'. The piano needs to stay there because the people of Portobello love it.'

Mr Treuhaft keeps a close eye on the removal men as they take away his smaller piano which he is going to sell for just £3.99

Just one more push and Ben Treuhaft will have his new larger piano delivered

The father-of-two walked out of his home in Morningside in Edinburgh after a row with his wife.

His mother Jessica rebelled against her privileged aristocratic upbringing by running away from home and marrying a communist nephew of former prime minister Winston Churchill.

Meanwhile, two of her sisters Unity and Diana were die-hard fascists - even meeting with Adolf Hitler. 

Mr Treuhaft is a trained piano tuner and moved to Edinburgh last year to set up a shop.

Edinburgh City Council say his tent breaches management rules which prohibit camping within one mile of a public road.

Ben Treuhaft has an interesting history according to his colourful family tree

They are now pursuing action through the courts with a notice of intent to evict.Mr Treuhaft said: 'I'm going to take legal advice. They are giving me half a week before they serve me with an eviction notice.

'Once they do it, I will have 48 hours to move the tent. I will do whatever they want, but I'm not moving it myself.

'It's a good thing for Portobello, because people can use it as a shelter and play music.

'I'm trying to get the community to support me so we can keep playing the piano.'

Mr Treuhaft's sixth aunt was novelist Nancy Mitford who died in June 1973

A council spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Treuhaft has been served with court papers and that they would remove his piano tent if he did not.

She said: 'We have received complaints from members of the public and we have growing concerns about the safety of the tent and its contents.

'Court papers have been served on Mr Treuhaft; if he does not remove the tent and contents voluntarily, we will remove them in the coming days.'

The Mitford sisters were raised in the Cotswolds to Lord and Lady Redesdale. They had one brother Tom who was educated at Eton. But despite their privileged upbringing as members of the aristocracy, the six daughters went on to shock polite society with their impulsive, hedonistic lifestyles.

Nancy Miford

Nancy was educated at home by a governess along with her sister Jessica. Despite the lack of formal schooling, she became a successful novelist with a string of books. Her most successful books were The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. 

She also wrote for Vogue when she moved in with author Evelyn Waugh and his wife, before marrying Peter Rodd. That relationship was a disaster, ending in divorce.

She moved to Paris after the war and died aged 69.

Pamela Mitford

She was the least 'newsworthy' of the girls known as 'the quiet sister' who married Derek Ainslie Jackson.

Diana Mitford

Diana would not have been out of place if she was appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show, such was her unconventional lifestyle.

She married Bryan Guinness, heir to the brewing fortune and had two children. However, domesticity was not in her DNA and divorced him, before marrying Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.

Both Diana and Mosley were jailed during World War II because of their strong fascist beliefs.

Unity Mitford

Unity was an ardent fascist like her elder sister and traveled to Germany in the 1930s, where she was a personal friend of Adolf Hitler.

When war broke out in 1939, Unity shot herself in the head but was saved by surgeons. She returned to Britain but had suffered brain damage. 

Jessica Mitford

Unlike Diana and Unity, Jessica was a firm communist and ran off to Spain with Winston Churchill's socialist nephew Esmond Romily.

Romily was shot down during WWII while fighting for the allies. Jessica left Britain and moved to the United States where she married Robert Treuhaft - Ben's father.

Deborah Mitford

The youngest sister, Deborah met Andrew Cavendish at the outbreak of WWII. They married soon afterwards. After the death of Cavendish's father, her husband inherited the title 11th Duke of Devonshire and the family's home of Chatsworth House.
