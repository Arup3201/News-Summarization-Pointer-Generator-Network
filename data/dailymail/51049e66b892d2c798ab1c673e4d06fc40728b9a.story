CBS News' Lara Logan is back to work at '60 Minutes' more than six 
months after being ordered to take a leave of absence for her role in a 
disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, 
Libya.

CBS News spokeswoman Sonya McNair said Wednesday that Logan has 
returned.

She had no details on when the correspondent resumed work and 
what type of stories she is working on.

Logan did not immediately return
 a telephone message for comment.

Her October report on the CBS newsmagazine was quickly criticized and
 became the subject of an internal CBS investigation.

The story relied 
on the testimony by Dylan Davies, a security contractor who said he was 
at the scene of the raid that since then has become a key Republican 
criticism of the Obama administration.

But his story fell apart and it 
turned out there was no evidence he was there, and CBS issued a 
correction.

Logan was placed on a leave of absence for her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.

The internal CBS review of the incident concluded Logan and her '60 
Minutes' colleagues should have done a better job checking out Davies' 
story before it went on the air.

The internal review also said that a speech Logan made in urging the 
U.S. to take action in response to the Benghazi raid represented a 
conflict of interest for a reporter later doing a story on the incident.

She was ordered to take the leave of absence in late November 2013.

The liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, a sharp critic of the
 Benghazi report from the beginning, had harsh words for CBS News for 
bringing Logan back.

'CBS indicated that they were serious about rebuilding its brand and 
taking accountability,' said David Brock, Media Matters founder. 'Having
 Logan back on '60 Minutes' shows the exact opposite.'

There was some question whether Logan would return to '60 Minutes,' 
although CBS never deviated from the story that she was on a leave of 
absence.

'60 Minutes' is heading into its summer vacation season and 
will be dominated by reruns in the summer months, so it's not likely a 
Logan story will be on the air soon.
