After the identity of Jihadi John was finally revealed, disturbing links between the former London student and other known extremists across the UK and abroad have emerged.

The 26-year-old, who fled his family in west London to join extremists in Syria in 2012, has been named as the executioner of Britons Alan Henning and David Haines. 

He is also responsible for the deaths of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers, having appeared in sadistic films in which he slit victims throats after preaching on behalf of terrorists with his face by a sinister black mask.

As Jihadi John is unmasked as former computing student Mohammed Emwazi, his connections to terror suspects across London and abroad have been revealed  

Yesterday the Mail revealed Emwazi attended a Church of England school in north London before studying computing at the University of Westminster.  

Scotland Yard is refusing to answer questions about his identity after claims he was known to police before fleeing the country.  

But as it's revealed the man was picked up by authorities trying to enter Tanzania in 2009, more chilling links between Emwazi and a London underworld of terrorist activity have emerged.

The most concerning are Emwazi's connections to a hub of fanatics reportedly known to the authorities as 'the London Boys'.

Alongside a handful of others he was named in 2011 court documents in which the group is described as 'members of a network of United Kingdom and East African based Islamist extremists'. 

A number of the group, thought to have been trained in Somalia, have travelled to Syria with at least one now dead. 

Most of the men are thought to have grown up in north and north west London, engaging in gang activity to fund extremist tendencies.

They are thought to include Bilal Berjawi, Mohamed Sakr and Choukri Ellekhlifi, all of whom died have been killed in war zones, the Times reports.

Berjawi fled St John's Wood, where Emrazi is thought to have attended school, to join jihadis in Somalia. He was killed in an airstrike in 2013 while Sakr died the previous year. 

Ellekhlifi, from Paddington, died in an attack in Aleppo in 2013.  

The  home Emwazi shared with his family before travelling to Syria is less than two miles from where failed bombers Muktar Said Ibrahim and Ramzi Mohammed were found in 2005.

The pair were convicted of involvement in an attempted attack on London's public transport system. 

And in chillingly similar circumstances to his own family, Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a former rapper previously fingered as the man behind Jihadi John's mask, grew up in a council house in Maida Vale.

The extremist lived in the same area as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary who was previously named as the man behind Jihadi John's mask. Bary is also in Syria

Emwazi graduated from the University of Westminster (pictured) in 2009 with a degree in computing. The university has been described as a 'hotbed' for radicalism in the past but denies inciting extremism in any form 

Haitham al-Haddad, an anti-gay Muslim preacher, was due to speak at the University of Westminster where Emwazi was a student

Bary, who became the focus of rife speculation over the jihadi's identity, also appears on the social media accounts of Emwazi's brother's friends. 

The youngster's Facebook page revealed he was friends with a handful of people to have supported Islamic preachers. 

There is no suggestion Emwazi's brother has engaged in any form of extremist or terrorist activity. 

Among preachers mentioned in the profiles of his friends however are some to have appeared at Westminster University. 

It has in the past been accused of inciting Islamic extremism among students after a range of controversial religious figures were invited to speak at its events.

Yesterday former student Raheem Kassam said: 'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11.  

‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised.'

Westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006, and just days before Emwazi's identity was revealed, thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak.

Students previously expressed fears over the election of a former student union president  and vice president alleged to have been connected to the group Hizb ut-Tahrir. 

Tarik Mahri and Jamal Achchi were elected in 2011 after sharing their support of the pro-Islamic state group online.

Neither former student has responded to MailOnline's request for comment.  

Since news of Emwazi's connection with ISIS in Syria broke, the university's Islamic Society has distanced itself from having any involvement.

This week a petition attracted more than 3,000 signatures calling for a controversial Muslim preacher not to be allowed to give a talk

Haitham al-Haddad, who has spoken against homosexuality in the past, was due to speak at an event titled 'Who is Muhammed'.

Members of the university's LGBT community protested against the visit scheduled just days before a Pride event.

It was cancelled as Westminster alumnus Emwazi was named as jihadi seen in ISIS propaganda videos.

'The ISOC would like to clarify it has nothing to do with an individual who has come to be known as "Jihadi John" who was recently identified as Mohammed Emwazi,' a statement on the organisation's Facebook page said last night.

Students at the university however claimed the society guarded the identity of the society's president. When contacted by MailOnline the society did not respond. 

In a separate statement the university said it was offering support to students and took the allegations 'very seriously'.

Emwazi's parents have been reported by neighbours as being too upset to speak. It is understood they thought their son had travelled to the Middle East to carry out aid work.  

He was also named alongside other terror suspects thought to have been trained by al-Shabaab militants in Somalia. Above, a member of the Islamic extremist group in Mogadishu
