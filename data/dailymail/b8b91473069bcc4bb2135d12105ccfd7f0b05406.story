A Premier League footballer who fled the scene of a motorway drink-drive smash by running through fields was today fined £4,500 - the equivalent of just three days' pay.

Aston Villa midfielder Barry Bannan admitted ditching his Range Rover Sport and three other offences including driving under the influence of alcohol.

The 21-year-old Scotland international, who earns an estimated £10,000-a-week, was also banned for 18 months at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

Bannan crashed his car on the southbound carriageway of the M1 near Watnall, Nottinghamshire, at around 5.30am on October 23.

The footballer, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was charged with drink-driving, failing to stop after a road accident, driving without due care and attention and driving on a provisional licence.

The court heard that the footballer was almost twice the legal limit.

Bannan had been on a night out with friends in Leeds following Villa's 2-1 home defeat at the hands of local rivals West Brom.

A friend collected Bannan and they left for Leeds at 6.30pm.

Bannan drank two cans of beer on the journey then drank more at a nightclub, magistrates heard.

He got a taxi to his hotel at 3am and waited for his friends to return.

When they failed to return, Bannan decided to get changed and drive back to Birmingham as he feared he would miss a meeting with a youth football team coach who he had known for 11 years.

Bannan said he took the decision to drive as he felt 'alert, in control and clear-headed', the court heard.

Bannan had been driving for about an hour when he failed to make a bend and hit the central reservation, the court heard.

The car span and came to a stop 1,000ft away in the fourth lane.

After getting the car to the hard shoulder, the footballer saw a motorway worker on his mobile phone.

Fearing he was calling the police, Bannan panicked and fled over fields to a taxi office in Bulwell. It was here that he was arrested.

Bannan, who has held a provisional licence for three years, was found to have 61mg of alcohol to 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35.

He believed himself to be 'a safe and confident driver' who practised regularly with his girlfriend, who had a licence and was insured on his car, Adrian Darbishire, representing Bannan, said.

Bannan was sorry for what he had done and had admitted it was 'foolish and immature'.

He said he had never driven under the influence of alcohol before and 'never would do again'.

'It was foolish and I am sorry.'

In mitigation, Mr Darbishire said of Bannan: 'He is a young man in the public eye. He views these proceedings very seriously and his actions were out of character.'

The Range Rover was found to have no mechanical defects.

The footballer was fined £2,200 for driving with excess alcohol and a further £2,200 for the charge of failing to stop after a road accident.

He was also ordered to pay costs of £85 and a surcharge of £15.

He was disqualified from driving for 18 months, but was told this would be reduced by four months and two weeks on completion of a drink-driving rehabilitation course.

Magistrates said they would impose no further penalty for the further two charges.

A passenger in the car, Shrewsbury striker James Collins, was also arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident following the incident.

He was subsequently released without charge, Nottinghamshire Police confirmed.

Villa manager Alex McLeish said: 'As a club and as the manager of the club, we take a very dim view of the incident in which Barry was involved.

'He has been deservedly punished and we have also taken action internally, at the time of the incident when he was suspended and he will now be disciplined in line with the Club’s own disciplinary procedure, which will remain internal.

'Barry has shown contrition, he’s very ashamed of what’s happened and his attitude is very much to get on now with his life and his career as a footballer.'
