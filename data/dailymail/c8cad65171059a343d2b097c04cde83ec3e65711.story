Jeremy Clarkson's comments last night have got the presenter in hot water again

Jeremy Clarkson is being investigated over his comments about striking public sector workers.

The Top Gear presenter was forced to apologise after saying all striking workers 'should be shot'.

TV watchdog Ofcom has now launched an investigation after the comments - made during The One Show on November 30 - led to more than 21,000 complaints to the BBC and almost 800 to Ofcom itself.

The watchdog is looking at whether he breached broadcasting rules on 'generally accepted standards'.

'Ofcom has taken the decision to investigate comments made by Jeremy Clarkson on BBC1’s The One Show,' it said.

'We will make the outcome of the investigation known in due course.'

The
TV regulator is also investigating other comments Clarkson made on The 
One Show describing people who kill themselves at railway stations as 
causing 'immense' disruption to commuters.

The
remarks about strikers led to condemnation by union leaders and 
politicians. Prime Minister David Cameron branded Clarkson’s comments as
'silly'.

His gaffe came as he appeared on the BBC1 show on the evening of Britain’s biggest public sector strikes for 30 years.

Speaking
about the strikers, he said: 'I’d have them all shot. I would take them
outside and execute them in front of their families.

'I mean, how dare they go on strike 
when they’ve got these gilt-edged pensions that are going to be 
guaranteed while the rest of us have to work for a living?'

Clarkson later said in a statement that his comments were not meant to have been taken seriously.

'I didn’t for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously - as I believe is clear if they’re seen in context,' he said.

'If the BBC and I have caused any offence, I’m quite happy to apologise for it alongside them.'

But in a later interview he appeared to be taking the matter less seriously, when he also apologised to sparrows, after saying he did not like them during The One Show.

The BBC said the item 'wasn’t perfectly judged'.

Earlier this year the BBC apologised about an item on BBC2’s Top Gear which led to the Mexican ambassador complaining about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' made about Mexicans by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.

The BBC’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes.

In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.
