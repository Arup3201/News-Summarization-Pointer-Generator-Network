A former German footballer has revealed how he gave up a promising career because he was too afraid to admit he is gay.

As a young midfielder, Marcus Urban was seen as a rising star of the game when he played for the East German national youth team in the 1980s.

But he was constantly terrified of being 'outed' as homosexual and decided not to pursue the profession any further.

'Painful': Marcus Urban said he felt unable to continue his career as a footballer because he felt under constant pressure to hide the fact he was gay

Urban described the experience of living a double life as 'unbearable'.

'I hid 24 hours a day, I 
adjusted,' he told CNN.

'It was an almost unbearable pain,
a great sacrifice, a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of 
becoming a professional footballer.'

Urban began playing football in 1978, when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven before moving to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984.

He trained twice a day with his new team and was being talked up as potential player for the German national team, winning a youth championship with Rot-Weiss in 1985.

He was called up to East Germany's youth team in 1986 and played alongside or against 
future German national team stars including Robert Enke, Bernd Schneider and 
Thomas Linke.

Urban went on to make over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss' senior team in the German second division.

But his spell in Erfurt proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear and insecurity.

'By my early 20s I was burned out,' he said.

'I realized that if I became a professional footballer, I would suffer as a man. I chose freedom over a constructed prison.

'Talent is not enough. You need the will, physical fitness, good luck and a tough mentality. But what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay?'

Urban finally told his story in the book 'Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban' - 'Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban'.

The biography, written by Ronny Blaschke, is in the process of being turned into a feature film.

In contrast, to many other sports, there are currently no openly gay footballers in British football leagues.

But the tide is beginning to change and many believe it is only a matter of time before a player comes out.

In February, former Leeds United winger Robbie Rogers became the first British professional footballer since Justin Fashanu in 1990 to reveal he is gay.

Writing on his blog he revealed his sexuality but also announced his retirement from the game.

The
25-year-old, who played for the U.S. international team 18 times, including all three of their games at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

Justin Fashanu, who became the first black footballer to command a £1million transfer free, was the first footballer in England to come out but faced real hardship following the announcement and committed suicide in 1998.

In March 2011 Anton Hysen, who plays for third division team Utsiktens BK, became the first Swedish footballer to announce he is gay.
