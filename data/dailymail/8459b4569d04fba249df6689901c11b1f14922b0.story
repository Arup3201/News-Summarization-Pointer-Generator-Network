For more than 60 years, residents along The Boulevard in Ivanhoe, Melbourne, have tried to outdo their neighbours in a friendly competition for the best Christmas lights.

It's a scene reminiscent of the Clark Griswold character's light display in the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation comedy movie.

As many as 6000 people a night wander the street that is lit by thousands of twinkling fairy lights, flashing signs and inflatable Santas.

For more than 60 years, residents along The Boulevard in Ivanhoe, northeast of Melbourne, have tried to outdo their neighbours in a friendly competition for the best Christmas lights

Neighbours first started decorating their houses in the Melbourne street in the 1950s

'The Boulevard lights are the most traditional lights in Melbourne,' former Ivanhoe MP and now Banyule council mayor Craig Langdon said.

'Often it's a family tradition to walk or drive along and look at the lights together.'

On the 12 nights before Christmas the street is alive with food stalls and pop-up shops selling light-up toys.

Mr Langdon said while original residents had moved on, the display still lived up to expectations.

'New residents feel honour bound to do it and they say if they're going to do it then let's do it properly,' he said.

'This is what Christmas is all about.'

The council estimates as many as 60,000 people walk or drive past the light in the 12 days before Christmas, with Christmas Eve the busiest night of all.

Heidelberg police Sergeant Matt Harris said despite the large crowds there had been no major issues.

'Everyone's there for a good time,' he said.
