Three rare albino hedgehog babies who born on the same day as Prince George have moved into a regal place of their own - a miniature castle at a Moscow zoo.

George, Alexander and Louis are named after the Prince of Cambridge's three first names.Â 

When the hedgehogs turned one month old on Thursday, they were shown into their new royal residence at the All-Russia Exhibition Center.

The tiny month-old albino hedgehogs in a private zoo in Moscow were a big hit with the children

The lucky hedgehogs live in a wooden castle with carefully carved windows, dark velvet curtains and a plush bed.

A red carpet was rolled out to welcome the family into the new home and they were a big hit with the crowd.

Zoo spokeswoman Yevgeniya Polonskaya manager hopes the Prince of Cambridge himself would one day visit the hedgehogs.

She said that they 'have a couple of invitations set aside for him'.

Their colouring is down to a rare 
genetic defect which affects just one in 100,000 hedgehogs who are born without pigment.

The siblings are lucky that they were born in captivity as it is difficult for albino hedgehogs to survive in the wild.

Their coats makes it hard for them to camouflage themselves so they are easy targets for enemies as well as other hedgehogs.

On average, albino hedgehogs live for two to three years compared to the three to four year lifespan of a normal hedgehog.
