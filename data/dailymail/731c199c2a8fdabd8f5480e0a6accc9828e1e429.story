Stag party: Aidan Burley and his fiancée Helen Boyle

A Tory MP who attended a stag party where guests chanted Nazi slogans has issued a second apology in a desperate bid to save his career.

Aidan Burley was with 12 Oxford-educated friends, some of whom chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, Hitler’, at a restaurant in a French ski resort.

The ‘stag’, who was seated next to the MP, wore an SS uniform and later posed giving the Nazi salute – illegal in France.

Labour last night called for David Cameron to sack Mr Burley, a senior aide to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, for bringing ‘shame on the country’.

Mr Burley, the MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was filmed by journalists from the Mail on Sunday raising his glass before a fellow guest made a speech saying: ‘Let’s raise a toast to Tom for organising the stag do, and if we’re perfectly honest, to the ideology and thought process of the Third Reich.’

The MP did not raise his glass during the speech. He did appear to pay the bill for the meal, although he later said he had paid only his share.

Yesterday Mr Burley said on Twitter: ‘Deeply regret inappropriate behaviour by some guests at stag party I attended and I am extremely sorry for any offence caused.’

It followed a similar statement he had made on Saturday.

But
 his apologies were denounced as ‘too little, too late’ by Twitter users
 who called for him to be sacked. Downing Street made no comment but 
Tory sources said they were ‘investigating’ the allegations.

SS uniform: Accountant Mark Fournier gives a Nazi salute, which is illegal in France

Members of the stag party may face prosecution in France, where it is a crime to wear Nazi uniform in public except in a film or play.

Mr Burley, 32, has known the Prime Minister for at least five years and the pair ‘high five’ when they meet, according to Mr Burley’s friends on the stag night, who joked the MP was ‘the candidate for Berlin East’.

The Nazi incident happened on December 3 in Restaurant La Fondue, an upmarket venue in the centre of the ski resort of Val Thorens.

The MP, elected in 2010, sipped wine as one of the group taunted a waiter for being French.

The man in the Nazi uniform was accountant Mark Fournier, 34, who was frequently addressed by the others as ‘Himmler!’ It was his businessman brother John Fournier, 37, who gave the toast celebrating the Nazis.

At various points through the evening, members of the group were chanting, typically two or three of them. At no stage did the journalists – who were in the resort researching a different story – witness all 12 chanting the names of Nazi leaders or other slogans at the same time.

As they left the restaurant, Mark and John Fournier agreed to be photographed and, without prompting, performed Nazi salutes.

Asked why he was dressed as he was, Mark Fournier said: ‘We wanted to see how a Nazi outfit in the middle of France would go down. The answer is not that well at all.’

Another said: ‘We are trying to intimidate as many people as possible. A lot have been quite offended, especially one guy who was both Jewish and gay.’

The group moved on to the British-themed Frog and Roast beef pub, where some put on German accents and started chanting: ‘Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer!’, ‘Himmler! Himmler! Himmler!’ and ‘Eichmann! Eichmann! Eichmann!’  Himmler and Eichmann were senior SS officers directly responsible for the Holocaust. The MP did not join in with this chanting.

In his initial apology on Saturday Mr Burley, who is engaged to TV fashion presenter Helen Boyle, said: ‘There was clearly inappropriate behaviour by some of the other guests and I deeply regret that this happened. I am extremely sorry for any offence that will undoubtedly have been caused.’

Mark Fournier has not responded to requests for comment, but his brother John told the Mail on Sunday: ‘[Mark] was dressed up in an outfit as a tongue-in-cheek laugh and there was nothing more to it than that. It was just a bunch of lads having a good evening.’ He denied raising a toast to the ideology of the Third Reich.
