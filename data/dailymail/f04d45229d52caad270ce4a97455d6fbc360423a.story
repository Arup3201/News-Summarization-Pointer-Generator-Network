The former nanny to Fred and Rose West has told of her ordeal at the hands of two of Britain's worst serial killers.

Caroline Roberts was just 17 when, in 1972, she went to work at the Wests' infamous 25 Cromwell Street home in Gloucester, where nine bodies were discovered more than 20 years later.

What she witnessed and went through at their hands was to serve as a chilling prelude to the series of at least 12 murders the couple would go on to commit.

Ms Roberts - called Caroline Owens in 1972 - was abducted and raped by the Wests but managed to escape.

She went to the police but the couple ended up getting off with a fine for indecent assault because Ms Roberts was too scared to face them in court.

Caroline Roberts was abducted by Rose and Fred West in 1972 before they went on their killing spree

Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is still serving life in prison. Fred West was charged with 12 murders, but committed suicide at Winson Green jail in Birmingham before his trial

The then-teenager was picked up by the Wests while hitch-hiking and they later offered her a job looking after their three children.

Soon after she started work at their home, she picked up on the couple's warped attitudes and Fred West's obsession with sex.

In a new interview to be broadcast on Channel 5 tomorrow night, she recalls Fred West saying: 'I've performed these abortions on girls before and they turn around and they're so grateful they just have sex with me straight after.'

Ms Roberts said: 'I thought - that's not right that's weird.'

The Wests later invited Ms Roberts to join their sex circle but she declined and left her job with them.

She said: 'I knew that was something I didn't want to be a part of.'

But weeks later, the teenager was walking home and was offered a lift by Fred West, who pulled up alongside her. Moments later, the killer hit her over the head.

Ms Roberts - pictured around the time she was abducted - says she now feels guilty she didn't do more to alert police to the danger the couple posed

She said: 'I blacked out. When I came back round my hands were already tied behind my back and there was Fred wrapping tape around my mouth.'

In a apparent warning of what the couple would later do to their victims, they told her: 'We are going to keep you in the cellar and let our friends use you and, when they have finished with you, we will kill you and bury you under the paving stones of Gloucester. There are hundreds of girls there... the police haven't found them and they won't find you!'

Ms Roberts, who feared the couple would try and 'operate' on her, was raped by Fred West, but later managed to escape.

She told the police, but the charge against the Wests was dropped to indecent assault after Ms Roberts decided she did not want to be questioned in court.

In the new TV documentary, she says she now feels guilty about the decision, which may have allowed the couple to go free to commit their murders.

The new documentary also features what is believed to be the last interview given by the lesbian lover of both Fred and Rose West, Kathryn Halliday.

Ms Halliday was a neighbour who was invited to the couple's home after telling Fred West she was a lesbian.

She said she liked the husband - who she met after the couple had killed all their known victims - but found Rose West 'very cold'.

In the interview, given before her recent death from liver cancer, said: 'She was very, very domineering and she was quite domineering over Fred.

'He only ever touched me once. We only ever had sex once but he was a wee bit more gentle. She was very cold.'

The couple then showed Ms Halliday their bondage equipment and sexual torture instruments, causing her break off their friendship.

She turned down an invitation to spend Christmas with them, a decision she believes saved her life.

She said: 'I think this is what saved my life. Rose went ballistic when I said I wasn't going to stay there. I, for one, just hope she rots in hell.'

Fred West was charged with 12 murders, but committed suicide at Winson Green jail in Birmingham before his trial. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is still serving life in prison.

Their house was later demolished and turned into a public walkway.

When Fred Met Rose will be broadcast at 10pm tomorrow night on Channel 5.
