Dusan Tadic came over all Cristiano Ronaldo after stripping off to strike a musclebound pose following his winning goal in Southampton's 1-0 defeat of Manchester United.

The Saints moved above United to third in the  table after Tadic's late strike gave them their first ever Premier League victory at Old Trafford, prompting Tadic's shirtless celebration.

The Serbian star's muscle flexing pose mirrored that pulled by Ronaldo after the Portuguese scored in Real Madrid's 2014 Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid.

Despite earning a caution from referee Phil Dowd for removing his shirt in line with Premier League regulations, Tadic did not seem to regret getting carried away in the moment.

After the game, the 26-year-old creator said: 'You don’t think about celebration. Normally I never put my shirt out but in that moment I feel that I do that.

'I don’t know why. It is always interesting, when you score a goal you don’t think about what you're going to do and this is nice about football.'

Ripping off a shirt in celebration is nothing new, although flexing in the form of a green skinned superhero was started by another player plying his trade in the Premier League.

Liverpool striker (of sorts) Mario Balotelli was arguably the first player to flex his pecs in a Hulk pose after scoring for Italy against Germany in the semi-finals of the 2012 European Championships.
