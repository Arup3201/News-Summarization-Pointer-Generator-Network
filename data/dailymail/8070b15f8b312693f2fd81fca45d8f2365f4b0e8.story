Proud dad Brian Williams took a moment while anchoring NBC Nightly News to reveal his actress daughter's newest role, and the way he did it couldn't have been funnier.

Allison Williams, 26, won the lead in Peter Pan in NBC's holiday live telecast of the children's favorite and appears to have been born for the part.

Dad Brian deadpanned the news Wednesday evening, telling viewers, 'Family members confirm she's been rehearsing for this role since the age of 3 and they look forward to seeing her fly.'

Proud dad: NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams on Wednesday proudly announced the casting of his own daughter as Peter Pan in December's live telecast of the play

'Thrilled to be playing Peter Pan live on NBC in December,' Williams wrote with an adorable Instagram shot from her childhood. 'I've been rehearsing for a REALLY long time'

The hilarious reveal from the newsman came just hours after Williams herself told fans how thrilled she was to have won the role she's wanted since childhood.

'I have wanted to play Peter Pan since I was about three years old, so this is a dream come true,' Allison said in a statement. 

As proof, she shared an Instagram photo of herself as a little girl dressed in full Peter Pan costume.

'Thrilled to be playing Peter Pan live on NBC in December,' she wrote with the photo. 'I’ve been rehearsing for a REALLY long time.'

The production, which airs on December 4, will also star Christopher Walken as Pan's nemesis Captain Hook.

Alison has never made a secret of her love of musical theatre, describing herself as 'obsessive' about the genre in an interview with UK GQ last year.

'Eventually I'd like to do more performing of my own kinds of music,' she added.

The TV spectacular will be based on the original 1954 Broadway musical which includes songs Never Never Land and Hook's Tango.

NBC will be hoping for another hit following last year's success of The Sound of Music Live which featured Carrie Underwood as Maria Von Trapp.

Casting has yet to be announced for other key roles including Smee, Wendy Darling and Tinkerbell - after Miley Cyrus shot down reports she was being lined up for the fairy role.

Big rollout: NBC even tweeted the news of Williams' casting. Captain Hook, it was previously announced, will be played by Christopher Walken
