Best-selling author Hilary Mantel becomes a dame for a lifetime of service to literature.

The popular writer, 61, whose novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies about the life of Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell have been critical and commercial hits, already has a CBE.

She has also been controversial, once claiming the Duchess of Cambridge was portrayed as a ‘shop window mannequin’ whose only purpose was to breed.

Awards: Critically acclaimed author Hilary Mantel will be made a dame for a lifetime of service to literature

Accolade: Oscar-winning actress Dame Maggie Smith, 79, has been elevated to Companion of Honour

During a lecture at the British Museum last year, Miss Mantel criticised Kate for appearing to have been ‘gloss-varnished’ with a perfect plastic smile who was ‘painfully thin’ and selected for her role of princess because she posed no risk of showing any character.

Last night she said: ‘I’m delighted to receive this honour. It’s given for services to literature, but I see it not so much as a reward for the past, more as encouragement for the future.’

Oscar-winning star Dame Maggie Smith has been elevated to a Companion of Honour.

The 79-year-old, recently best known as the Dowager Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey and Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter films, has had an extensive career stretching back to the 1950s and has collected numerous awards.

Daniel Day-Lewis, the first man to win three best actor Oscars, is knighted.

The 55-year-old actor, the son of former poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis and actress Jill Balcon, said: ‘I’m entirely amazed and utterly delighted in equal measure.’
