A man was charged Wednesday with killing and dismembering his mother and stepfather, whose body parts were found in trash bags and containers inside their home. 

Frederick C. Harris is facing two counts each of criminal homicide and abuse of a corpse in the deaths of 73-year-old Olivia and his stepfather, 76-year-old Lamar Gilbert.

Police say some of the elderly couple's body parts were not recovered.  

Neighbors told police that Harris had been living in the couple's Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, home recently. Olivia Gilbert's daughter asked police to do a welfare check on the couple Tuesday afternoon after they hadn't been heard from since Saturday.

Charged: Frederick C. Harris, pictured, is facing two counts each of criminal homicide and abuse of a corpse in the deaths of 73-year-old Olivia and 76-year-old Lamar Gilbert

Crime scene: Trash cans inside the Gilberts' home contained a man's torso with stab wounds, the victims' heads and two sets of feet and hands, police said

After the daughter forced open the door, police found Harris unresponsive under the covers and in bed, they say. Authorities say they took Harris to a hospital, where doctors found nothing wrong with him and police discovered an unusual note in his pocket:

'Hello Fred Thanks for house sitting and fixing up the place while we are on vacation. See You soon, tell everyone hello. Mr and Mrs Gilbert Lamar PS Don't answer the door for anyone.' 

After Harris was hospitalized, Penn Hills police found remnants of a carpet that appeared to be blood-stained and more than a half dozen garbage cans in the garage, four of which appeared to be new. Among other things, the trash cans contained a man's torso with stab wounds, the victims' heads and two sets of feet and hands, police said.

Investigators didn't find a woman's torso or arms - nor did they find a man's arms. 

With search warrants, detectives found receipts for four garbage containers purchased Monday and Tuesday afternoon and a section of the laundry room floor that appeared to be wiped clean, police said.

Surveillance video from a Home Depot store showed Harris buying the garbage cans, police said.

'Five bloodied large kitchen knives were also recovered. The blades were bent and in some of the knives the handles were broken,' according to the criminal complaint.

Investigation: Authorities who questioned Harris said he 'sat upright in the chair with his eyes closed and refused to speak or acknowledge detectives'

'It's hard to believe something like that can happen. It can happen anywhere I guess, you know, so, it's a bad time for the holidays, that's all I can say,' neighbor Robert Irish told CBS Pittsburgh. 

Authorities who questioned Harris said he 'sat upright in the chair with his eyes closed and refused to speak or acknowledge detectives.' Police also noticed a fresh cut on Harris' right palm.

CBS Pittsburgh reported that Harris was briefly an Allegheny County Human Resources employee in 2000, though he did not complete his probation period.

Harris is scheduled to be arraigned early Thursday; online court records don't list an attorney for him. 

Investigators told the affiliate station Harris attempted to choke his father, was forced out of his house, and then starting living at his mother and stepfather's home.

Additionally, sources told CBS Pittsburgh the missing body parts were included in trash that had been collected - meaning investigators might never find them. 

Harris was convicted of insurance fraud in 2009 and of harassment in 2012, according to online court records. Details of those cases weren't immediately available.

At the time of his arrest, Harris was also wanted for a parole violation in a 2011 squatter's case in neighboring Westmoreland County. He received five to 23 months in jail after pleading guilty to criminal trespass in Murrysville, where police say he removed a for-sale sign from a $500,000 home and moved in without permission.
