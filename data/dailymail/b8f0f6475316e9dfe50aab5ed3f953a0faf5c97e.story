Boko Haram, the extremist Islamic group in Nigeria, has released a video that shows the beheading of a man who identifies himself the pilot of a missing Nigerian Air Force jet.  

The video that emerged yesterday also allegedly features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau - a terrorist who Nigeria's military claimed to have killed. 

Officials announced last week that Shekau was dead and that a man who had been posing as the group's leader in the videos had been killed after fighting with troops in the far northeast.

Leader: The video also allegedly features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau - a terrorist who Nigeria's military claimed to have killed. He claims that the group are implementing Shariah law in parts of Nigeria

But the new 36-minute video appears to show Shekau, in combat fatigues and black rubber boots, standing on the back of a pick-up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air.

Standing in front of three camouflaged vans and flanked by four heavily armed, masked fighters, he then speaks for 16 minutes in Arabic and the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria. 

There was no indication of where or when the video was shot. Shekau appears in separate images from the violence.

The heavily bearded Shekau, who appeared to be the same man as those in previous clips released by the group, said the military's claim that he was dead was propaganda.

Speaking to the camera, the man says: 'Here I am, alive, and I will remain alive until the day Allah takes away my breath.

Claims: Shekau, in combat fatigues and black rubber boots, standing on the back of a pick-up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air. He says that the military's claim that he was dead was propaganda 

'Even if you kill me... it will not stop us imposing Islamic rule ... We are still in our Islamic state, reigning and teaching the Quran.'

There have been two previous claims by Nigeria that Shekau had been killed or 'may be dead' but Boko Haram later issued video denials. 

Security analysts and the United States have also questioned the credibility of the Nigerian military's claim. 

Footage shows charred plane wreckage that appear to have Nigerian military markings, bolstering the group's claims that it shot down a fighter plane. 

In the video, a man is seen kneeling in a camouflage vest with his right hand in a sling, with a fighter hovering over him with an axe, which is later used in his beheading.

Speaking in English, the victim identifies himself as a wing commander in the Nigerian Air Force and says he was undertaking a mission in Kauri area of northeast Borno state.

He says: 'We were shot down and our aircraft crashed. To this day I don't know the whereabouts of my second pilot.'

Two pilots and an Alpha jet have been missing since mid-September when it left the northeastern town of Yola on a bombing mission against Boko Haram. 

In the footage, Boko Haram fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed Alpha aircraft and the military's green and white logo is clearly visible.

But air force spokesman Air Commodore Dele Alonge said: 'For any group to claim they shot it down is mere propaganda and rubbish.'

Military top brass suggested images of the plane could have been manipulated but said they were studying the claims in the video, even though they had not seen it. 

In a statement on its website, Nigeria's Defence Headquarters said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that Shekau was alive.

'As far as we are concerned, the individual who was appearing in video and claiming to be the leader of the terrorist group was killed in the Kondunga battle in September.

Wreckage: In the footage, Boko Haram fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed Alpha aircraft and the military's green and white logo is clearly visible.

'The resemblance of the corpse and that of the eccentric character was incontrovertible. His identity was equally corroborated by people who knew him before we announced his death.'  

The video contains images of extreme violence, including graphic scenes of an amputation, a stoning to death and lashings. 

Elsewhere in the new video, the militant leader said the group had implemented strict Islamic law in the towns that it had captured in the northeast in recent weeks.

He says: 'We are running our caliphate, our Islamic caliphate. We follow the Koran...in the land of Allah.'

Brutal: The video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery, another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft. Above, Shekau speaks in the new 36-minute video released yesterday

The video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery, another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft and a man and a woman receiving 100 lashes for sex out of wedlock.

Crowds of men, women and children are seen watching the punishments.

The scenes of graphic violence are not unprecedented but come as other groups in the wider jihadi network, particularly Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, have issued similar footage.

In a Boko Haram video obtained on August 24, footage showed the apparent execution of about 20 men captured in town of Gwoza in Borno and two others beaten to death with rocks and pick-axes.

Doubts: In a statement on its website, Nigeria's Defence Headquarters said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that Shekau was alive

Richard Downie, deputy director of the Africa Programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Boko Haram has likely adapted its videos to model the IS group, which has captured global attention by broadcasting grotesque violence.

Extremist groups 'learn from each other, certainly in terms of communication', said Downie, describing Shekau as a 'savvy media character'.

But, he added, the influence of the IS organisation on Boko Haram is likely minimal, describing the group as still focused on Nigeria with limited interest in Arab jihadis.

'I'd be wary of the notion that the Middle East drives everything,' Downie said.
