Stoke are one of a number of English sides interested in Livorno's Brazilian striker Paulinho, according to the Italian club's president.

Aldo Spinelli said the 28-year-old, who scored 15 goals in 35 Serie A matches, is also attracting attention from Abu Dhabi.

'Al Jazira have already spoken with Paulinho, but Stoke City also want him and there are also a couple of other English clubs,' Spinelli told Gazzetta dello Sport.

'We will take the decision which is best for everyone together.
