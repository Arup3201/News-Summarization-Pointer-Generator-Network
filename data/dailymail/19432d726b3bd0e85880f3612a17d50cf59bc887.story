A rural village community has been torn apart by an acrimonous row which has seen all but one of its councillors quit in protest.

The parish council of Long Preston has been divided by Nazi slurs, corruption claims and a heated five-year health and safety row over the Christmas lights.

But a petition signed by almost half the community over the illuminations appears to have triggered the resignations of six out of seven parish councillors of the remote village, near Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales.

Walk out: Six of Long Preston parish council's members quit on Thursday night over 'unwarranted abuse'

Former chairman Nick Thwaite complained about a ‘bitter, personal and unrelenting attack’ by residents. 

He, along 
with colleagues Hilary Baker, Philip Johnston, Keith McBride, David 
Monks and Roy Newhouse said the final straw came when their fourth clerk
in as many years resigned over the 'unwarranted level of abuse'.

At one meeting retired journalist Peter Scott-Smith, 81,  shouted ‘Heil Hitler’ at the clerk and performed a Nazi salute before being arrested for public disorder.

Pauline Joyce said: 'It is good news all round. The councillors have gone and we¿ve got our lights back' (stock picture)

Mr
Thwaite said: 'The village has been torn apart by the poison of this 
small group of residents who refuse to respect that we were elected by 
people here, in preference to them, and we have decided to take this 
action in the hope the boil can be lanced and the village given a chance
to have their say by electing a new council.

'Our
last clerk was subjected to an unwarranted level of abuse from a 
resident who shouted "Heil Hitler" at her and the rest of the council 
and gave the Nazi salute - all because the council was conducting its 
lawful business.

'It is completely unpardonable and we condemn their actions completely.'

Mr Scott-Smith made the Nazi salute when the chairman refused to answer questions about councillors’ expenses.

‘I was told to remain silent,’ he said. ‘It turned into a shouting match between the chairman. It was farcical.’

He was protesting over an alleged conflict of interest as farmer Mr Thwaite was awarded a contract – reportedly worth up to £20,000 – to cut the grass and tend the verges in the village.

Retired solicitor Pauline Joyce, 74, was delighted the lights issue proved to be the final straw.

‘It is good news all round. The councillors have gone and we’ve got our lights back,’ she said.
