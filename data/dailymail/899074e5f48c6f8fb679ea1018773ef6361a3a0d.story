An Australian professor says people should be eating cane toads, sea urchins and camel meat instead of regular options found in supermarket freezers for future sustainability.

Professor Philip Hayward from Southern Cross University believes it makes sense to eat animals that are culled because they are considered pests and prey on Australia's native animals.

The marine specialist has been encouraging the consumption of sea urchins on Tasmania's east coast, which are known for stripping food away from the native purple urchins.

Sea urchins are a delicacy in Japan and China and chefs in Tasmania have slowly started to introduce it on their menus.

'Fresh, high-quality ones get premium prices,' Prof Hayward told news.com.au.

But Prof Hayward said his theory of sustainability extends to eating cane toads and meat from camels, which are introduced species in Australia.

'It makes sense to farm other animals that are culled because they are pests,' he said.   

Most Australians are already shifting away from the standard meats like chicken, beef and lamb, according to Queensland University of Technology's Dr Gary Mortimer.

'People are becoming more adventurous, and shows like MasterChef, which feature a range of more exotic ingredients, are a part of that mind shift,' he said.

Camel burgers have been stocked in Coles supermarket stores in 200 stores across the east coast of Australia since May last year.

Cane toads have long been considered a pest since they were introduced to Australia
