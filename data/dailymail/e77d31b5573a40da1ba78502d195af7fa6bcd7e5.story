The taxman was left humiliated last night after being exposed for getting his sums wrong on how much tax was collected.

In a damning report, the National Audit Office said HM Revenue and Customs had miscalculated its figures by £1.9billion a year since the coalition Government came to power.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was a ‘serious error’ which painted a ‘worrying picture’ of HMRC’s ability to do its job.

She said: ‘If HMRC can’t get its own numbers right, how can it ask the same of others?

‘It is truly depressing that HMRC’s failure to take appropriate action has led to its unwittingly misleading ministers, parliament and the taxpayer.’

Lin Homer, the department’s embattled chief executive, will be grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee next Tuesday to explain the latest disaster.

A week later, she faces a second inquisition from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, a sign of the MP’s concerns about the latest cock-up by the department.

The embarrassing mistake comes as HMRC is demanding new powers to be able to raid people’s bank accounts.

It wants to be able to take money directly from people’s current accounts, joint accounts or even tax-free Isas in order to settle unpaid tax bills.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was a ‘serious error’

Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers in a move which has triggered outrage among many accountants.

In November 2010, HMRC set itself a target for how much tax it would collect each year.

For the next few years, it boasted that it had beaten this target. In fact, it had just got its ‘baseline’ calculation, used to work out whether it had beaten or missed its target, wrong by around £1.9billion a year.

The NAO’s report, published yesterday, said: ‘This made the original targets easier to achieve.’

In 2011/12 and 2012/13, HMRC claimed to have beaten its targets by £1.9billion and £2billion respectively. In reality, it had not. 

The report warns: ‘It is now clear that this apparent over-performance was actually attributable to the baseline error.

‘So HMRC in fact achieved almost exactly the level of performance improvement that was required.’

Mrs Hodge said: ‘The fact HMRC did not know about this serious error in its calculations until the NAO pointed it out paints a worrying picture.’

John O’Connell, director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, the campaign group, said: ‘It is not surprising people don’t trust the tax system when HMRC is making such basic errors.

‘It’s ludicrous that there could be billion-pound errors in the public finances and it raises fears that the deficit might be even bigger than we think it is.

‘Such mistakes show what folly it would be to allow HMRC direct access to people’s bank accounts, as the coalition government is proposing.’

Recently, HMRC estimated around 3.5million customers paid too much tax in 2013/14 and around two million customers paid too little tax.

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many HMRC workers, said: ‘It is stunning that the department charged with administering the taxes that fund all our other essential public services can’t seem to get its sums right.

‘It is also deeply worrying that, at a time when it is cutting thousands more staff, HMRC is over-egging its level of performance.’

Overall, HMRC collected £506billion in tax in 2013/14, which was £30billion more than it had collected during the previous tax year.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We regret an historic error made in 2011 when we wrongly calculated the baseline against which our performance was measured.

‘We have corrected this error and even against the corrected baseline we have still exceeded our targets. We will work closely with the NAO to prevent this happening again.’
