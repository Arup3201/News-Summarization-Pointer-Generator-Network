Health
 investigators suspect norovirus, but lab results are not expected until
 later this week. If norovirus is to blame, it would be one of the 
largest norovirus outbreaks in last 20 years, the CDC said. A 2006 
norovirus outbreak on a Carnival Cruise Lines ship also sickened close 
to 700.

Norovirus — once 
known as Norwalk virus — is highly contagious. It can be picked up from 
an infected person, contaminated food or water or by touching 
contaminated surfaces. Sometimes mistaken for the stomach flu, the virus
 causes bouts of vomiting and diarrhea for a few days.
