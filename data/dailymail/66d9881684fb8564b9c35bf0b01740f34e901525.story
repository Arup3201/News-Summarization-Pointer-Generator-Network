Britain has the so-called 'plastic police' - and in China they've got cardboard police cars.

In a bid to deter speeding on motorways police in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, have placed virtual police vehicles on the hard shoulders.

They even have solar-powered lights on top, for extra realism.

However, whether these cardboard cut-outs will have any effect remains to be seen.

Neil Greig, Director of Policy and Research at the Institute of Advanced Motorists, insists that wooden police cars are ineffectual.

He told MailOnline: 'Forces in the UK have tried this on motorway bridges. But basically it's a waste of time. Once one person has gone past it, everyone realises it's a joke, so any effect tails off very quickly.

'Drivers are very savvy. They can spot these things a mile off. There might be an effect for an hour or two, but it soon wears off. The impact is transitory.

'It's like these signs that light up to tell motorists to slow down. These things don't really work.

'And the carboard cutouts could be distracting. If you put them in the wrong place you could be causing more problems than you're solving.'

Manufacturing fake items appears to be something of a Chinese speciality.

They’ve invented pirate brands such as King Burger and Anmani, built entirely convincing Apple stores, shopping streets boasting Starbocks Coffee – and even entire fake towns.

The town, which reportedly cost £500million to build, is officially called Thames Town and sits 19 miles outside of Shanghai.
