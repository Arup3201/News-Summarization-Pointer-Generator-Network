The New York City police officer accused of plotting to kidnap, rape and cook at least 100 women has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

Gilberto Valle was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping on Friday, facing him with life in prison if convicted in what his defence has argued was only a 'fantasy.'

The six-year married veteran also faces a maximum of five years for illegally accessing the National Crime Information Center database to collect potential victims' address according to investigators.

Indicted: Gilberto Valle has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in a twisted plot to allegedly torture, kill, cook and eat women

Not guilty: Valle, 28, is seen in this courtroom sketch last month with his public defender Julia Gatto, center, after pleading not guilty to criminal charges

Valle, 28, who works in Harlem, was 
arrested by the FBI for the heinous plans in October after his estranged
wife reportedly tipped off police.

Valle is being held without bail after a judge's ruling he posed a danger to the community.

That judge also found enough evidence showing Valle had clear and convincing intent to carry out his plans.

One such document on Valle's computer was 
titled 'Abducting and Cooking (Victim 1): A Blueprint,' according to the
criminal complaint. The file also had the woman's birth date and other 
personal information and a list of 'materials needed' - a car, 
chloroform and rope.

'I was thinking of tying her body 
onto some kind of apparatus ... cook her over low heat, keep her alive 
as long as possible,' Valle allegedly wrote in one exchange in July, the
complaint says.

Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators

Shock: Valle's brother arrived at the apartment to collect his dog and was swarmed by reporters

Emails, computer files, and fetish 
chats were retrieved from the NYPD officer’s computer. None of the women
was harmed, although a prosecutor said some of the women knew Valle and
he had stalked at least two of them at home or work - once in his 
police car in a 'very intimidating fashion.'

In other online conversations, 
investigators alleged, Valle talked about the mechanics of fitting the 
woman's body into an oven, noting that the women’s legs would have to be
bent, and discussed how 'tasty' one woman looked.

'Her days are numbered,' he wrote, 
according to the complaint. That woman told the FBI she knew Valle and 
met him for lunch in July.

Public defender Julia Gatto had asked for bail, saying the Valle was only guilty of a 'deviant fantasy.'
'There's no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality,' Gatto 
said. 'At worst this is someone who has sexual fantasies about people he
knows and he talks about it on the Internet,' according to the AP.

But Valle was arrested because he was
too close to carrying out the 'grotesque and disturbing' plots, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said. He had 'plans to kidnap, 
rape, torture, kill and eat the body parts of young women, some of whom 
the FBI has identified and they acknowledge knowing the defendant for a 
period of time,' she said.

Valle, a graduate of the University 
of Maryland, where he studied psychology and criminal justice, was 
suspended from the police force after his arrest.

Scene: FBI searched his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens (pictured) and allegedly found lists of women on his home computer. One file was named: 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint'

He allegedly created files on his 
personal computer containing at least 100 women with at least one photo 
of each, details of their physical characteristics and lists of their 
addresses.

He even 
allegedly had a file named 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A 
Blueprint' containing information including the woman's name, date of 
birth, height, weight and bra size.

FBI
agents tracked down 10 of his named victims who said they knew him. 
Phone records showed he was once outside the home of one woman, who told
investigators that she hardly knew him.

In
another eerie message, Valle, who is believed to have married in June, 
wrote that his knowing the victims would lead to a 'flawless' abduction 
as his arrival 'will not alert her', the complaint noted.

His co-conspirator, who has not been named, responded with equal excitement at the plans.

'I love that she is asleep right now not have the slightest clue of what we have planned,' Valle allegedly wrote, ABC reported. 'Her days are numbered... She does look tasty, doesn't she?'

His alleged co-conspirator responded: 'You do know if we don't waste any of her, there is nearly 75 lbs of food there.'

He also allegedly asked Valle, 'How big is your oven?' and 'What's your favorite cut of meat?'

Their
bizarre relationship only became more deranged as Valle allegedly 
offered to sell a woman to the other plotter in February for $5,000 so 
that he could rape and kill her.

But Valle said he would only deliver the
woman and would not get involved in the rape as 'I don't want to be 
tempted the next time I abduct a girl', he wrote, prosecutors said.

Horrifying: The complaint shows Valle's in-depth plans for the kidnapping and killings of the potential victims

He allegedly added that the co-conspirator needed to ensure her body was not found.

Valle is not known to have engaged in any of these plans, an officer told the New York Times on condition of anonymity. No women were harmed, the FBI confirmed.

It is believed he has a young child; his estranged wife has commented on Facebook about needing a babysitter, while the New York Daily News noted that his home appeared to be child-proofed.

Valle was suspended on Wednesday and arrested by the FBI, who worked in conjunction with the NYPD on the case, on Thursday.

He is due to appear in a federal 
court in Manhattan later today on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and 
access of unauthorised computers.

Secrets: Valle, pictured with his mother, was reportedly investigated after his wife tipped off authorities

Workplace: A police officer stands guard outside the 26th precinct where Valle worked. He allegedly used law enforcement databases to conduct surveillance on potential victims

'The allegations in the complaint 
really need no description from us,' Mary E. Galligan, the F.B.I. acting
assistant director, said in a statement. 'They speak for themselves. It would be an understatement merely to say Valle’s own words and actions were shocking.'

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly called the case 'bizarre' in a statement.

He added: 'We suspended the officer immediately upon his arrest, and a review is now underway to determine whether there was anything in his background that should have alerted the department to his alleged proclivities.'

A
criminal complaint outlines alleged online communication between 
Gilberto Valle and co-conspirators (CC1 and CC2), which are excerpted 
below:

CC1: How big is your oven?

Valle:
Big enough to fit one of these girls if I folded their legs. The 
abduction will have to be flawless... I know all of them... I can just 
show up at her home unannounced, it will not alert her, and I can knock 
her out, wait until dark and kidnap her right out of her home.

CC1: You really would be better to grab a stranger. The first thing the police force will do is check out a friend.

Valle: Her family is out of state.

CC1: I have anesthetic gasses.

Valle: I can make chloroform here.

---

CC1:
It's really had to dislocate a jaw. Also, how would we put her over the
fire, spitting kills the girl. Have to put her into a kind of cage. 
What is your favorite cut of meat?

Valle: I was thinking of tying her body onto some kind of apparatus... cook her over a low heat, keep her alive as long as possible.

---

Valle:
I love that she is asleep right now not having the slightest clue of 
what we have planned. Her days are numbered. I'm glad you're on board. 
She does look tasty doesn't she?

CC1: You do know if we don't waste any of her there is nearly 75 lbs of food there.

----

Valle:
It is going to be so hard to restrain myself when I knock her out, but I
am aspiring to be a professional kidnapper and that's business. But I 
will really get off knocking her out, tying up her hands and bare feet 
and gagging her. Then she will be stuffed into a large piece of luggage 
and wheeled out to my van.

CC2: Just make sure she doesn't die before I get her.

Valle:
No need to worry. She will be alive. It's a short drive to you. I think
I would rather not get involved in the rape. You paid for her. She is 
all yours and I don't want to be tempted the next time I abduct a girl.
