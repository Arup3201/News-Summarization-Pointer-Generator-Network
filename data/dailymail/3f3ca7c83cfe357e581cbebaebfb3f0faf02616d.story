A Colorado climber died of blood loss and his friend was injured after the pair fell off a mountain trail and waited two days for rescuers to find them.

Jarod Wetherell, 37, was hiking with his friend David Richardson last Wednesday when the climbers, both from Vail, became separated.

Both of them then fell after wandering off the trail on their descent of North Maroon Peak.

They had taken a selfie after they reached the top, sending it to a friend in Vail, reports Post Independent. 

But the friend became concerned after not hearing from the climbers and called Pitkin County authorities that night.

On Thursday, Mountain Rescue Aspen volunteers began the search, but weather conditions meant they could not deploy a helicopter.

They spent two days searching for the pair, but Wetherell was dead by the time they found him on Friday near one of two peaks over 14,000 feet comprising the Maroon Bells near the ski town of Aspen.

Mountain Rescue Aspen members brought Richardson, who injured his pelvis and ribs, to safety at 11:15 a.m. Friday.   

Sheriff's Deputy Michael Kendrick told Post Independent the climbers had gone off the trail.

'They climbed up South Maroon and traversed over to North Maroon,' Kendrick said.

 'On their way down from North, they got off trail.

'There are a lot of places you can get off trail coming down. 

The only way you know for sure what the trail was is if you went up that way. 

They didn't go up that way. They were coming back down a trail they had never been on.'

Kendrick said the climbers ended up off the trail and fell down one of the gulleys.

'They were not roped together and fell separately at different times,' Kendrick said. '

The route coming down on the north side is not easy.'

Wetherell was originally from Matunuck, Rhode Island, although he moved to Vail a year ago.

'He was just starting to explore his new home,' said Jenny Tucker,  Wetherell's many friends, reports Vail Daily. 

'It was because he loved living here that he went on these grand adventures.'
