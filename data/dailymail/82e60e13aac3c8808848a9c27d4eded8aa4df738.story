A glittering stash of £50 million worth of unwanted jewellery is gathering dust in Britain's homes, according to new research.

Changing tastes in jewellery mean millions of pounds worth of earrings, necklaces, bracelets and other pricey pieces are simply forgotten, hidden on top of wardrobes or in bedside drawers.

Auction house Bonhams used data from the past five years of sales to create a jewellery hot-spot map, showing some of its most lucrative sales.

These diamond-set natural pearl earrings circa 1925 were brought to the auctioneers in a supermarket carrier bag and went on to sell for £157,250.

Last year's sales included a new world record price for a blue diamond 'Trombino ring', which sold for £6.2million at Bonhams

While some
 jewellery is deliberately squirreled away for a rainy day, many more 
items are simply lost and forgotten among general household clutter or 
are passed down through the generations without their true value being 
known.

With
 prices rising, and increasing numbers of investors moving away from 
stocks and shares to more tangible commodities such as diamonds, gem 
stones and historically significant pieces, the figures suggest people 
should pay more heed to the value of their family jewellery.

 year's sales included a new world record price for a blue diamond 
'Trombino ring', which sold for £6.2million at Bonhams in London.

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said: 'We estimate there is at least £50 million worth of unwanted jewellery that owners have forgotten or never worn just waiting for a new home. We're urging everyone to have a look in their drawers and jewellery boxes, dusting off any items they haven't worn for several years or may have been bequeathed and not know much about.

'Over the years we've had some astonishing finds, often brought to us in carrier bags or wrapped in tea towels.

'Many clients tell us they had simply forgotten about a piece of jewellery that might have been handed down to them when an elderly relative passed away. A lot of them have no idea just how valuable these pieces could be.'

Among some extraordinary finds are a rare Art Deco diamond, seed pearl, onyx and coral shoulder brooch, by Cartier, circa 1922. It had been worn by several generations of the same family but more recently it lay unused on the top of a wardrobe.

It sold for £97,250, while a pair natural pearl and diamond ear pendants, circa 1925 and brought to the auctioneers in a supermarket carrier bag sold for £157,250.

Bonhams has launched a campaign to find the nation's hidden treasures and have highlight some of the most amazing finds, such as this diamond spray brooch and pendant circa 1955, which sold £27,500, to motivate people

Bonhams estimates £9.5 million worth of unwanted jewellery is gathering dust in the London area, £8 million in the south east and Thames Valley areas, £3.5 million in the south-west, £4 million in East Anglia, £5 million in the Midlands, £3 million in Wales, £4 million in Yorkshire, £2.5 million in the north-east, £3.5 million in the north-west and £5 million in Scotland.

Ms Ghika said: 'Current market conditions for fine jewellery, most specifically period pieces, fine coloured gem stones, diamonds and natural pearls, have never been stronger.

'During June our team of jewellery specialists will be available to give confidential valuations, free of charge, on any piece of jewellery people may be considering for auction.'
