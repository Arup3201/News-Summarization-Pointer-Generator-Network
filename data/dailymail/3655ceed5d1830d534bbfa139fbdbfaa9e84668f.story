Former Rangers star Gennaro Gattuso has thrown his hat in the ring to become the next Hamilton manager.

Sportsmail understands the Italian World Cup winner is one of more than 50 applicants to replace Alex Neil – despite the position not yet being advertised.

Centre-back Martin Canning has been placed in interim charge, but Gattuso is thought to have made known his wish to be included in considerations for a permanent appointment.

World Cup winner and ex-Rangers midfielder Gattuso has had a patchy managerial career to date

The 37-year-old has endured a turbulent managerial career to date, spending three months as player-coach of Swiss side FC Sion and being sacked after six Serie B games in charge of Palermo.

His most recent stint was with OFI Crete in the Greek Super League. The AC Milan icon was appointed last June but resigned in December after insisting the financial crisis at the club left him feeling ‘unable to go on any longer’. He had signalled his intent to step down two months earlier but reconsidered after pleas from OFI supporters.

Gattuso’s wife is from Glasgow and a move back to Scotland has long carried emotional appeal for the ex-midfielder, who has spoken in the past of his desire to manage Rangers.

He spent 15 months at Ibrox early in his career before a hugely-successful 13-year spell with Milan, where he won two Champions League titles.

Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald last night refused to confirm that Gattuso had put himself forward.

‘We would never divulge any applications or break confidentialities,’ he said. ‘We are in a process and could possibly look at a different structure going forward, one that would suit everyone at the club.’

Frankie McAvoy is currently assisting Canning but will leave to join Neil at Norwich City at the end of the month.

The Accies board are likely to want a succession plan in place before then. Canning remains in the frame but the net will also be cast wider to ensure the best possible candidates are sourced.

McAvoy’s importance to the both the first-team and youth structures could mean a clutch of appointments in a revamped set-up at both senior and academy level.

As well as riding high in the Premiership after promotion last season, Accies also top the Under-20 development league.
