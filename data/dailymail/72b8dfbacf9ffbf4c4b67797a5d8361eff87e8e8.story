A streaker has interrupted proceedings on the annual Met Gala soiree in Manhattan.

A man wearing just a hot-pink 'mankini,' a chunky gold chain and a smile made a run for the celebrity-strewn red carpet as celebrities preened for photographers.

At an event for which attendees pay $25,000 for a ticket and try to upstage each other with the most fabulous and elaborate gowns, the scantily-dressed exhibitionist was quite a striking sight.

While some attendees, such as Rita Ora, had inadvertant wardrobe malfunctions, the unnamed man was ready and willing to show the world what he's made of.

He reportedly whipped off his tear-away suit and ran for the red carpet, much to the amusement of onlookers.

Unfortunately for him, police managed to intercept the man before his loafer-shod foot reached the hallowed ground.

According to Harpers Bazaar, Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the evening's hosts, was unperturbed by the interruption.

Tight security: With so many police around, the streaker's mission was doomed from the start

While he must have felt disappointed to have failed in his nudie mission, the man flashed a smile for cameras as he was hauled off by police.

It's not the first time in recent months a streaker has attempted to interrupt a fashion event.

In February a man who bears a striking resemblance to tonight's intruder crashed the catwalk at Prabal Gurung's New York Fashion Week show.

In that fashion-streak, the man was clad just in a leopard-print thong, red socks and a gold crown set at a jaunty angle.

Most attendees of tonight's event took the interruption in stride, but one star will be mightily annoyed.

Madonna reportedly skipped the event this year because she was asked not to wear a particularly revealing dress.

Had she taken inspiration from the fashion streaker, she could have worn the outfit of her choice - and saved herself $25,000.
