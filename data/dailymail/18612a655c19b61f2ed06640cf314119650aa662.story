These four body images, comprised of celebrities' best features, reveal the staggering differences in how men and women perceive the perfect body.

A new survey has gathered the preferences of both genders, creating 'body beautiful' composites using the physical attributes of the world's most beautiful people.

It appears that women covet a ultra-slim boyish figure, while men lust after curvacious full hips and an ample bust - but both sexes prefer a broad and chiselled male body.

The composite of various aspects of celebrities' bodies shows the difference in men and women's perceptions of 'perfection'

While women opted for the boyish hips of
 youthful Noah actress Emma Watson, 23, men plumped for the fuller 
curves of 34-year-old model Kelly Brook.

The biggest difference is in our choice of favourite face.

Women aspire to the supermodel features of model Cara Delevingne, 21, with men more attracted to the softer features of actress Megan Fox, 27.

Ladies admire the pert and perky breasts of Jennifer Aniston, 45, while men appreciate the fuller bust of US TV star Kim Kardashian, 33.

Both sexes like a fairly muscular frame when it comes to men, though women prefer a slightly more rugged look, choosing Harry Styles floppy hair Jamie Dornan's rough-hewn features

When it comes to hair, long luscious locks are a winner for everyone - but while women are enthralled by the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, their halves would love to run their fingers through 29-year-old Scarlett Johnsson's mane.

Women are less concerned than men about age when picking celebrities with admirable bodies.Gwyneth Paltrow, a 41-year-old mother of two, has the best toned tummy, according to other women.

And 50-year-old Elle Macpherson - still known as The Body - came top of the female poll for perfect pins.

Men and women are equally conflicted with the masculine ideal. Ladies are charmed by the beautiful, open face of Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan, 31, while men want the flawed but chiselled bone structure of Bradley Cooper, 39.

Emily Bendell, founder of Bluebella who conducted the survey, said: ‘Interestingly, the sum of all these parts does not match perceived physical perfection - neither men nor women opted for six-foot, stick-thin teenage models or perfectly chiselled, super-groomed guys.

'It's great to see such a range of ages and shapes.

‘Who would have thought a mother of two in her 40s in Gwyneth Paltrow would come top of the female poll for the best toned tummy?

‘And it is great that in her sixth decade Elle Macpherson is still seen as a style icon by so many women.

‘What the survey shows is that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder - it should give us all more body confidence!’
