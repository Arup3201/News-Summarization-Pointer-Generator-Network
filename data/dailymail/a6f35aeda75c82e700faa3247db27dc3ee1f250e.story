TOWIE star-turned-business woman Billie Faiers is using her experience as a new mother to build her brand.

The star of The Only Way Is Essex is opening her debut children's wear store in the heart of Brentwood (where else?) and she's already got her sights set on a certain customer.

Speaking to MailOnline ahead of the launch of JAM Kidswear on December 13, Billie said: 'I already have some really famous names who want to come down and shop for their children. 

'We will be gifting some celebrities and I’m going to send a package across for Prince George, Kate and William. I hope they will love JAM.'

Businesswoman: Billie Faiers, 24, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, is opening her debut childrenwear store in the heart of Essex. She chats to FEMAIL about her plans for her latest venture

The 24-year-old is opening her new store next to Minnie's Boutique - the shop she owns with her sister, Sam.  

Billie explains that JAM Kidswear has been in the family for a number of years. Her partner Greg's sister is in charge of running it on a daily basis but now they want to make it bigger and better with a debut store.

'I came on board earlier this year and we are now gearing up and taking it to the next level and opening the store in Brentwood,' she said.

Billie gave birth to daughter Nelly earlier this year and is taking inspiration from her trendy bundle of joy.

She said: 'Nelly does inspire me when I am buying. It gives me a great insight into what mums love to put their children in.'

Sharing her top tips for dressing children, Billie, who also recently designed her own pushchair range, said: 'If you are out and about, it's important to always have your kids in something which is really easy and accessible so you can change nappies.

'Things that are comfortable, in particular things with poppers, are usually best and I find them really easy day-to-day.'

Billie often dresses herself in designer garments on the hit ITVBe show, but she's open-minded when it comes to dressing her daughter.

'Obviously some designer kidswear is lovely, but here at JAM we like to have something for everyone,' she explained. 

'We like it to be very affordable. We like one-offs and occasion wear for children but we mainly concentrate on affordable fashion.

Business-minded Billie has big plans for her new new venture. She said: 'I have spotted lots of gaps in the market and I have a plan for 2015 which will see JAM at the forefront of the children’s clothing retail world.

'I’m really involved with all the buying and details of the new store opening. 

'Minnie's made such an impact and set the trend and I’m looking forward to having JAM as the next string to my bow business wise.'
