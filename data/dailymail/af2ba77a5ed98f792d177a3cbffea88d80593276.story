Ukraine today accused pro-Russian rebels of hitting a refugee convoy of buses with rocket fire near the eastern city of Luhansk, killing people trapped in the burning vehicles, but the separatists denied responsibility.

Government forces kept up pressure on the separatists in fighting overnight into Monday, blockading or recapturing rebel-held positions after international talks failed to reach agreement on a ceasefire.

Ukrainian military spokesmen said rebel missile fire on the buses had caused an unknown number of casualties.

The attack came as NATO's top commander warned Putin that the alliance would respond militarily if Russia infiltrate its soldiers into an alliance member country it did when it seized Crimea.

Military spokesman Anatoly Proshin 
told Ukrainian news channel 112.ua: 'A powerful artillery strike hit a 
refugee convoy near the area of Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka.

'The
 force of the blow on the convoy was so strong that people were burned 
alive in the vehicles - they weren't able to get themselves out.'

'Many
 people were killed, among them women and children,' Colonel Andriy 
Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's national security council, added at a
 briefing.

Nine Ukrainian troops were killed in the overnight fighting.

A senior rebel leader denied his 
forces had the military capability to conduct such an attack, and 
accused the government of regularly attacking the area including with 
Russian-made Grad missiles.

'The
 Ukrainians themselves have bombed the road constantly with airplanes 
and Grads. It seems they've now killed more civilians like they've been 
doing for months now.

'We
 don't have the ability to send Grads into that territory,' said Andrei 
Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's 
Republic.

The road where the attack happened is 
likely to be the one that a convoy of Russian humanitarian aid would 
take if Ukraine allows it into the country.

The International Committee of the Red
 Cross, which is to take responsibility for the aid convoy when it 
enters Ukraine, has demanded security guarantees from all sides, 
including the rebels, for the mission.

As of midday, there was no indication that the guarantees had been given.

Fighting across eastern Ukraine has forced nearly 344,000 people to flee their homes, according to UN figures.

The UN says about 155,800 have left for other places inside Ukraine while 188,000 more have crossed into Russia.

The flow of refugees only seems to be growing.

The
 UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than 
22,000 people fled Donetsk last week compared to 6,200 the week before.

City officials have released even higher numbers. Donetsk, the largest Ukrainian city still under rebel control, has seen at least 300,000 of its pre-war population of one million leave their homes, while Luhansk has only 250,000 of its 420,000 people left, local authorities have said.

Russia's foreign minister earlier said he expects the extensive humanitarian aid mission for eastern Ukraine to enter the country in the near future.

Speaking at news conference in Berlin, where he met a day earlier with his counterparts from Ukraine, France and Germany, Sergey Lavrov said Monday that all questions regarding the mission had been answered and that agreement had been reached with Ukraine and the ICRC.

It was not clear if Lavrov was referring to the security guarantees.

The humanitarian aid convoy from Russia has been watched with suspicion by Ukraine and Western countries, who suggest it could be used to spirit in weapons for the separatists, who are gradually losing ground to Ukrainian forces.

Tensions grow: Ukrainian authorities fear the humanitarian aid convoy may be used to smuggle in arms to the pro-Kremlin insurgents

Reports of fresh successes by the Kiev military followed a breakthrough for government forces at the weekend when troops raised the national flag in Luhansk, a city held by the pro-Russian separatists since the onset of the conflict in April.

Despite Western sanctions, the crisis has defied attempts at an international settlement and turned into the worst between Russia and the west since the end of the Cold War.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said all issues around a humanitarian convoy sent by Moscow to relieve needy areas of eastern Ukraine had been resolved at international talks in Berlin.

But he said no progress had been made in his talks with the Ukrainian, German and French foreign ministers on a ceasefire or a political solution.

'We are not able to report on positive results on reaching a ceasefire and on the political process,' he told a news conference.

Threatening all-out war: NATO's top commander General Philip Breedlove (pictured) has warned Russia not to smuggle troops into a member nation like it did in Crimea or it will respond militarily

Russia says it would like a ceasefire to allow aid to get to people trapped by the fighting.

A 280-truck convoy sent by Russia and carrying tonnes of humanitarian aid has been stalled at the Ukrainian border since last week as Kiev has insisted on formalities so it can be properly distributed by the Red Cross.

With the rebels now apparently losing ground by the day to government forces and with the leadership of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko likely to be keen for a victory by Independence Day next Sunday, it is doubtful Kiev sees any advantage in agreeing to a ceasefire now.

Earlier, NATO's top commander warned that any Russian bid to infiltrate its soldiers into an alliance member country will immediately trigger a 'military response'.

The alert suggests that if Moscow was to use in a NATO country the tactics the West says it deployed to seize Crimea and destabilise eastern Ukraine, then it could trigger war between east and west. 

U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, spoke as the Kremlin is accused by Kiev of infiltrating its troops and weapons into Lugansk and Donetsk regions where retreating pro-separatist rebels still control sizeable territory.

Moscow strongly denies the claims.

Late-night talks near Berlin involving the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, Sergei Lavrov and Pavlo Klimkin, were described as 'difficult' but with 'some progress' made.

In an interview with Die Welt, Breedlove expressed the fear that Russian troops wearing unmarked uniforms - dubbed 'little green men' when they were deployed in Crimea - could be used in NATO countries with Russian-speaking populations. 

'If we see these actions taking place in a NATO nation and we are able to attribute them to an aggressor nation, that is Article 5. Now, it is a military response,' he said.

The commander warned it was 'most important' to prepare NATO members 'for the problem of "little green men"' and that this work 'happens now'.

No countries were named but the three Baltic NATO member states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - former part of the Soviet Union - all have significant Russian speaking populations.

NATO's article 5 sees an attack on one
 state as an attack on the alliance as a whole, and vows action 
'including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security 
of the North Atlantic area'.  

Negotiations were again underway today 
over the Russian 'humanitarian' cargo which is held up at the border 
with rebel held eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine has accused Moscow of pushing more military equipment over the border, including three missile systems.

Separatists
 whom Russia is accused of arming shot down a Ukrainian Mig-29 fighter 
jet on Saturday, although the pilot managed to eject safely.

The
 rebels had earlier boasted they were receiving 150 armoured vehicles, 
including 30 tanks, and 1,200 soldiers who were 'trained in Russia'.

Moscow
 continues to deny sending military equipment or personnel into 
Ukrainian territory, but large convoys have been seen massing on the 
Russian side of the border.

The Ukraine crisis has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War and set off a round of trade restrictions that are hurting struggling economies in both Russia and Europe.

NATO has taken a series of steps to reinforce its military presence in eastern Europe since the crisis began.

Longer term measures are expected to be agreed at a NATO summit in Wales in September.
