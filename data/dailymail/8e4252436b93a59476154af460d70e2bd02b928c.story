While London’s busy Regent Street certainly sees a colourful cross-section of life in the capital, it is doubtful it has ever seen anything quite like this. Shoppers today were treated to the sight of 10 women striding down the street wearing blue jeans, high heels… and very little else.

The stunt was part of the promotion of InvisiBra: a new strapless, backless bra that all the women were wearing to maintain their dignity.

The bra claims to be a backless, strapless, self-adhesive bra that will lift and enhance cleavage but won’t slip off.

Despite of their minimal attire and the downcast weather, the girls kept a smile on their face as they posed for the waiting cameras

It is the clasp of the InvisiBra that makes it different, the firm says.

'The shape of the cups for InvisiBra are unique and the way they are placed on the breasts and then clasped together in the centre gives the wearer support and lift.

'It is the only self-adhesive bra that gives you a cleavage,' they say. 

Handwash only, each bra can be reused up to 200 times.

InvisiBras are made from medical grade silicone with fabric or lace placed over the cups.

The stickiness is a special glue from Germany that regenerates itself every time it is washed.

Invisibra say their silicone is medically proven to be safe for the skin.

Some of the bystanders couldn't believe their eyes (or their luck) as half naked girls suddenly strolled by

it
also aims to bring an element of fashion into the strapless bra market,
with the Invisibra coming in a range of colours and fabrics rather than
the traditional ‘nude’ shade.

The silicone InvisiBra is priced at £48 while the less padded Fabric InvisiBras cost £38.

Unsurprisingly rather shocked tourists stopped and openly stared at the scene as the girls flaunted their bodies.

A few rather cheeky builders who couldn’t believe their luck could be seen snapping away on their camera phones as the girls posed for the waiting press.

They managed to maintain a smile despite the rather inclement weather in London today and, despite some rather extensive bouncy walking, there were no ‘wardrobe malfunctions’, giving sway to the InvisiBra’s claims.

Despite the walking and twisting the bras held up and their were no 'wardrobe malfunctions'

The models showcased the self adhesive bras aim to bring an element of fashion, with varying fabrics and colours available

Tourists and shoppers stopped to look at the unusual sight, as those standing behind them must have questioned if they were topless

The bras are designed to be worn with low cut, cut out or revealing tops and dresses

One passerby seems particularly pleased at the sight...

...and attempts to persuade his companion to follow the girls!
