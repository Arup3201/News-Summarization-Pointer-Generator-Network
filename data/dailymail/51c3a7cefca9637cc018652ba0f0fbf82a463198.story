Andy Murray logged into Twitter last month and described Nick Kyrgios as the ‘next big Aussie star’. It turns out he might have sold him short.

What happened on Centre Court on Tuesday night — the demolition of Rafael Nadal by a 19-year-old wildcard — was quite remarkable in a global sense.

He started with an ace and closed the show four sets later with another. In between there were a further 35, and 70 winners from the world No 144. It was astonishing.

Not since Andrei Olhovskiy defeated 
Jim Courier here in 1992 had a player from outside the top 100 beaten a 
world No 1 at a Grand Slam.

To
 be clear, Nadal did not play badly. Instead, this was about a fearless 
player with grass-court tools who never stopped going for the big shot. 
The surprise was that this Australian, who travels with an Xbox and 
whose mother gave him no chance against Nadal,  sustained such levels 
against this particular man.

Nadal
 is the immovable object, an obdurate beast who chases all lost causes. 
Not many players can wait out the temperamental storms of talent quite 
like the Spaniard.

And, it 
should not be forgotten, Nadal was up to speed. He had a peculiar run to
 the fourth round, dropping the first set in his three previous matches.

But every time he bounced back with devastating force, giving every 
indication that once again he would reach the final, as he has on the 
five occasions he has survived the third round.

But
 along came Kyrgios, the tradesman’s son, with his rapid serve and those
 uninhibited groundstrokes. This was his first time on Centre Court, a 
man leading a charmed life having already been brought back from the 
dead by a Hawk-Eye call when facing match point in the second round.

Everything
 he did was done with joy. When he was broken for the only time, in the 
second set, he smirked. When he pulled off the shot of the Championships
 — a winner played from between his legs, or a hotdog, if you prefer — 
at 3-3 in the second, he grinned for two minutes. He described his  
celebratory dance at the end as a ‘juicy wiggle’.  

His
 only frown came when he  discussed his mother’s lack of faith. ‘I just 
believed in myself and believed that I could create some opportunities,’
 he said.

Kyrgios’s response, quite aside from providing the shock of the tournament, was to text his mother a smiley face.

From
 the start, he carried the confidence of someone with  considerably more
 experience. While Nadal ran from the coin toss to the baseline to begin
 his fidgety routine of tics and outfit adjustments, Kyrgios sauntered. 
He waved to someone in the crowd.

Then
 came the bombardment. He opened with an ace and, as someone once touted
 as a professional basketball player, he walked the baseline bouncing 
the ball between his legs. He held to love and would lose only four 
points on his serve in the opening set, which he took on a tiebreak. The
 clinching shot? An ace.

For
 an hour and 32 minutes,  Kyrgios sustained the same extreme level 
without a single  significant wobble. Then, serving at 5-6 in the 
second, he cracked a little and fluffed two straight- forward volleys 
for 0-30. He fought his way back into the game, surviving a set point, 
but at the second opportunity Nadal took it when Kyrgios hit into the 
net.

That should have been that. That should have been Kyrgios’s cue to leave politely, as Nadal’s previous three opponents had.

Instead,
 he won the third set on a tiebreak and broke Nadal to lead 3-1 in the 
fourth. That became 5-3 and the magnitude of the occasion hit Kyrgios. 
He hit it back.

‘You know if you believe in yourself you’re going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match,’ he said.

He did just that, with his 37th ace of an extraordinary contest.

Kyrgios,
 like many players his age, grew up idolising Roger  Federer. He had the
 fortune of practising with him at the French Open — now he might face 
him in the Wimbledon semi-finals.

For
 Nadal, there was a trace of uncharacteristic bitterness in his muted 
praise for a teenager who played in the juniors last year and was on the
 Challenger tour as recently as two weeks ago.

‘Everything
 is a little bit easier when you are arriving,’ said Nadal, who lost to 
Steve Darcis in the first round last year and to Lukas Rosol in the 
second round the year before.

‘You
 have nothing to lose.’  Now Kyrgios has everything to gain with a 
quarter-final on Wednesday against Milos Raonic, who until now held an 
advantage over him in the ‘next big thing’ stakes. Both men are widely 
deemed to be behind Grigor Dimitrov in that pecking order, but who 
knows?
