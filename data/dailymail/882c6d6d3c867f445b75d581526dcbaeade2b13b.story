London could soon be covered with a free public WiFi network as Virgin Media moves to challenge BT's Openzone network.

Virgin Media's network would be freely available to anyone at 0.5Mbps, and to subscribers to its home broadband at speeds up to a blistering 10Mbps.

The proposals would see WiFi routers installed in each of the company's street-side cabinets, which distribute its cable network to homes and businesses.
