Senior Conservatives have drawn up plans to cap immigration from poorer countries as part of the renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU.

Limits would be placed on the number of people coming from countries where wages and benefits are lower than in the UK.

The restrictions would include existing EU members, such as Romania and Bulgaria, as well as countries joining in the future. The cap, tearing up the EU’s founding principle of free movement, is thought to have won some backing in the Cabinet.

Senior Tories want immigration reform to be at the centre of efforts to renegotiate the relationship with Brussels.

Under the proposals, there would be ‘two rings of Europe’, with Britain and others breaking away from eurozone countries committed to closer integration.

Countries in the ‘outer ring’ would focus on trade, with business regulations, human rights laws and entitlements to benefits all radically cut.

The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU before an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. David Cameron is facing calls from his MPs to spell out what measures he hopes to achieve in a renegotiation.

Some in the Tory party want him to adopt a tougher stance on immigration to see off the threat of Ukip at next year’s general election.

Mr Cameron has previously talked about proposals for a wealth test to stop migration from countries joining the EU, such as Turkey and Albania, until their economies are closer aligned to the UK.

But some Conservative MPs want the idea extended to include countries that are already members. People from these countries would still be allowed to come to Britain, but their numbers would be limited.

People from these countries would still be allowed to come to Britain, but their numbers would be limited.

Earlier this year there were reports of a Cabinet split on whether a pledge to stop the influx of foreign workers from poorer European nations should be included in the Tories’ 2015 manifesto.

Home Secretary Theresa May is said to be one of those pressing to limit the number of migrants from existing member states.

Critics have cast doubt on Mr Cameron’s ability to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU after he failed in his attempt to stop the appointment of arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission.

Labour said it had been an ‘utter humiliation’ to be outvoted by 26 to 2 on Mr Juncker’s candidacy. After the defeat, Mr Cameron came closer to suggesting he would recommend a No vote in a referendum on EU membership if he fails to claw back powers from Brussels before 2017.

‘I will always do what’s in the national interest,’ he told the Commons. He conceded that renegotiating a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels would be harder with Mr Juncker at the helm, but insisted it was still achievable.

It has been argued that some countries owe Mr Cameron a debt after overriding his opposition to the appointment of Mr Juncker.
