Universities have been accused of discriminating against pupils who suddenly flourish in the sixth form – especially boys – by using GCSEs to decide which candidates to accept on to degree courses.

The heads of some of Britain’s top schools said universities were increasingly relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude ‘filter’ to weed out applicants who have similar A-level grades.

But they said bright pupils often failed to excel in GCSEs and only reached their full potential at A-level.

Universities were accused of relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude 'filter' to weed out applicants who have similar A-level grades

Among those that require top GCSE passes for courses is the University of Manchester, which insists those taking its dentistry course need a minimum of six GCSE A grades, while law students need a minimum of five GCSE A grades.

The heads’ warning comes as a record number of teenagers scramble to find university places after top A-level grades fell for the first time in 20 years. A drop in the proportion of top grades has also been predicted when GCSE results are unveiled on Thursday. 

The heads said universities increasingly use GCSE results as ‘a ready reckoner’ as competition for places reaches unprecedented levels.

Dr Martin Stephen, former High Master of St Paul’s School in West London – one of the most academically successful fee-paying schools – said universities were forced to use GCSE results to help them select students because they had few other indicators of academic ability.

He said: ‘You only get in the pile for consideration if you jump that hurdle. They are a key gateway. But GCSEs were never designed to identify the most able and they don’t do that.

'As an identifier they are not fit for purpose. The use of an exam taken at 15 or 16 is discriminatory because of the late development of boys.

Dr Martin Stephen, former High Master of St Paul's School, said it was 'discriminatory'

‘Even more important, really  creative and clever children take risks and make mistakes, and pupils should not lose out because of that.’

Dr Stephen said that while GCSEs were good predictors of academic ability for two-thirds of pupils, for the others ‘they are about as accurate as a clay pigeon shooter trying to hit a clay while facing the wrong way’.

David Levin, headmaster of the City of London School, said: ‘There has been a trend for universities, particularly the leading ones, to use GCSEs to distinguish between candidates as competition for degree courses has risen.

'But it discriminates against boys because GCSEs are a recall set of exams whereas in the A-level there is much more independent work. Boys tend to develop later and do better at A-level where there is more independent work.’

The admissions authorities said GCSE results were ‘among the criteria’ universities used, but most leading institutions now tell candidates applying for certain courses that they need to achieve top GCSE passes in addition to their A-levels.

At Birmingham University, applicants for its medicine and surgery degree must have at least seven  A* grades at GCSE, and at least A grades in maths and English.

In contrast, Cambridge University said: ‘As our research shows, post-16 exam performance is a much better predictor of degree success. We do not have any hard and fast GCSE requirements. Strong performance in Years 12 and 13 can make up for less stellar performance at GCSE.’

UCAS, the body responsible for admissions, said: ‘GCSEs are among the criteria institutions consider.’
