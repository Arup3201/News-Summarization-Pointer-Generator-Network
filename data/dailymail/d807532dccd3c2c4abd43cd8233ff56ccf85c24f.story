Public school pupils are being discriminated against when they apply for places at Oxford and Cambridge, a leading headmaster has claimed.

Dr Anthony Seldon, the Master of the 
prestigious Wellington College described the 'hostility' towards these students as 'the hatred that dare not speak its name.'

There are cases of some parents allegedly putting their children into local state sixth forms to give them a better chance of getting into Oxbridge.

'Hostility': Dr Seldon, the Master at Wellington College, claims there is discrimination against public school pupils who apply to Oxbridge

David Cameron has tried to 'disown' his Eton-educated background because of the public 'jealousy' of independent schools, said Dr Seldon.

He told the Daily Telegraph that at Wellington there were 62 pupils clever enough to get an interview at Oxbridge, but he expected only 20 to be offered places.

'From our perspective it looks as if some public school students are being discriminated against at the final hurdle,' he said. 'Was that different to when I was at Oxford 35 years ago? Yes. I don't think anyone gave a toss back then where you came from, only that you were good enough to go.'

He added:  'Positive discrimination in favour of state school people has become the hatred that dare not speak its name.'

This year, according to the paper, Cambridge has reduced the number of places it is offering to independent schools to 200 with almost two-thirds its students coming from state schools and colleges.

The dilemma facing parents of privately-educated children is highlighted in the Sunday Telegraph's Seven magazine tomorrow with the case ofÂ  a QC with two daughters at the Catholic boarding school St Mary's Shaftesbury, Dorset.

He took away the cleverer of the two at 16 and sent her to the local state sixth form because
 he believed it would improve her chance of a place at Oxbridge.

Last October, private school leaders raised the prospect of boycotts against any university found to be systematically discriminating against their pupils in admissions.

They are incensed that more than half of top universities have set specific targets for admitting more state school pupils under pressure from the Government to widen the social mix of students.

Headmasters are demanding that universities such as Cambridge and University College London are banned from setting targets which classify students according to the type of school they attended.
