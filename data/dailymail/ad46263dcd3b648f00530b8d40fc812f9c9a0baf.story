Two horses died at Royal Ascot yesterday on the opening day of the annual event. 

Case Statement and Sir Graham Wade had to be humanely put down after sustaining serious injuries during races.

Their deaths will highlight an ongoing controversy in the sport as animal activists believe horse racing is cruel and the animals sometimes suffer painful injuries and deaths.

Case Statement was pulled up over two furlongs out in the Coventry Stakes while Sir Graham Wade was also injured and pulled up in the two-and-a-half-mile Ascot Stakes.

Jenny Hall, chief veterinary officer for the British Horseracing Authority, said both horses were assessed by vets who concluded that they had to be put down.

She said: 'Case Statement received immediate first aid on course from the racecourse veterinary surgeons before being transferred by horse ambulance to the veterinary assessment centre at the racecourse stables where he was X-rayed.

'The X-rays confirmed that Case Statement had sustained a fracture of his near-fore fetlock.

‘Following full evaluation, the nature of the injury was such that sadly there was no other option but for the horse to be humanely put down.’

On Sir Graham Wade, Hall said: ‘The vets diagnosed that he had suffered a serious pelvis fracture that the nature of the injury was such that there was no other option than to be humanely put down.'

Yesterday the Queen was in attendance with the rest of her family. 

Her Majesty was joined in her carriage by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of York and Prince Harry. 

In a message in the event programme, the Queen thanked racegoers for the 'wonderful welcome' for her horse Estimate on winning the Gold Cup last year.
