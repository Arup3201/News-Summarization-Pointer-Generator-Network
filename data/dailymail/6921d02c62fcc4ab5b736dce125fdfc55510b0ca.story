Paul Foster, who has been served with an eviction notice for playing Chris de Burgh's tune too loudly

This is the first picture of the neighbour-from-hell who has been forced out of his home - for repeatedly blasting out Chris de Burgh’s hit Lady In Red tune so loudly that neighbouring walls vibrated.

Paul Foster, 51, also belted out tracks by Pink Floyd and played love songs on late-night radio shows at full volume.

Fed-up neighbours in Chesterton, Staffordshire, said Foster would often leave his music on all night from his collection of albums by the British band.

But his favourite tune by far was the 1986 UK number one smash hit Lady In Red by Chris de Burgh - which he played daily.

Foster was jailed for 28 days last month following the latest in a long line of injunction breaches.

And he has now been ordered to leave his home by August 7 after landlord Aspire Housing secured an eviction notice in court.

Neighbour Susan Baxter, 39, started to complain about Foster when his music was so loud it made her walls vibrate.

And the housewife said enough was enough when a teacher phoned to say one of her children had fallen asleep at school because the noise was keeping them up at night.

Susan, who lives with her children Emma, 16, Thomas, nine, and six-year-old Alex, said: 'At first I asked him politely to turn the music down. He would say "yes" and then an hour later it would be back up again.

'It was disturbing me, but not the 
children, so I didn’t do anything. But as soon as it started waking up 
the children, I called Aspire.

'Every now and then the music would be played throughout the night.

'It was so loud it made my walls vibrate. You could hear the songs word for word.

'I had one call from teachers saying my son had fallen asleep in class - that was after a night when the music had been keeping us awake.

'Sometimes he would go out in a taxi and still leave the music playing full blast while he was out.

'This year my daughter has been trying to revise for her GCSEs and it hasn’t helped.

'Eventually we got an injunction against him, but he has carried on breaching it.'

Foster was jailed for 28 days at Stoke-on-Trent County Court on June 11 for breaching an injunction from playing loud music for the fifth time.

The court heard how one family even moved out of the area because they couldn’t put up with the constant din.

Speaking about evicting Foster, Aspire head of housing Caroline Baggaley said:

'Mr Foster’s anti-social behaviour caused misery for his neighbours and the wider community.

'We have tried every possible way to get him to behave in an acceptable way but he didn’t change.

'We hope this will bring an end to the problems he has caused. We do not tolerate anti-social behaviour.'

Foster was first hauled before the courts in September last year but then breached an ‘undertaking to his future conduct’ agreement on October 4 and December 1.

He was sentenced to 21 days in jail suspended for one year on January 17 and also served with an injunction banning him from causing nuisance noise.

He breached the injunction on February 22 and was jailed for 63 days on March 20 when he admitted further breaches.

Despite spending time in prison, Foster then breached the injunction again on May 30 and was imprisoned again on June 11.

He was unavailable for comment today.
