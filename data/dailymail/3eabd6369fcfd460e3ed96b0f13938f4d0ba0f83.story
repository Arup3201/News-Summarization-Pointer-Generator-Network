Ploughing ahead: Tory MP Richard Drax has ignored hundreds of residents' wishes by ploughing ahead with the development near Wimborne, Dorset

A millionaire Tory MP who has opposed taxpayer subsidies for green energy today sparked fury after winning permission for a giant solar farm on his sprawling estate.

Richard Drax has ignored hundreds of residents' wishes by ploughing ahead with the controversial development near Wimborne, Dorset, which will be the size of 110 football pitches.

It is claimed that Good Energy, the operators of the solar farm - the third biggest in Britain - will receive a substantial amount of the very government subsidies which MP for South Dorset Mr Drax has campaigned against.

The 55-year-old politician has been accused of presiding over the ‘industrialisation of the countryside’, with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174-acre farm will be a blot on the landscape.

They argued it will blight views from miles around - and that the sheer scale of the development is out of kilter with the rural location, which once inspired author Thomas Hardy in his writings.

Despite protests, the local authority yesterday voted to grant planning permission by one vote.

Mr Drax, who is currently supporting opposition to plans for a wind farm off the Dorset coast, has not yet personally commented today on the solar farm on his 7,000 acre Charborough Estate.

But a spokesman for the Estate said: 'The Charborough Estate notes the approval of the photovoltaic scheme at Mapperton.

'The Estate has worked carefully with Good Energy (which is leasing the land from Mr Drax) to identify a suitable site and consider the balance of a wide range of interests.

'The Estate will continue to liaise 
closely with Good Energy and the local community to progress the project
as smoothly as reasonably possible.'

Last
year Mr Drax was one of 101 Conservative MPs who wrote to the 
government asking for the £7.6billion a year in subsidies to renewable 
energy like wind farms to be cut.

An
in an article he wrote in a local newspaper in June, Mr Drax welcomed 
fracking to boost the crisis of energy supplies - and criticised 
amendments to the Energy Bill.

He said: ‘Rather than deal with this 
potential crisis, the Energy Bill increases the subsidies for wind-farms
and solar panels to £7.6billion a year.

‘A recent House of Commons library report suggested that such subsidies have put 50,000 Britons into “fuel poverty”.’

Rupert Hardy, 62, lives a mile from the site of the solar farm which will be in Mapperton village.

He said: ‘It is most curious that (Mr Drax) has been very vocal in his protests for the offshore wind farm, yet he is happy to install a giant solar farm on his estate.

‘It is also rather curious that only months ago he was talking about reducing subsidies for renewable energy when this farm on his land will be heavily subsidised.

Unhappy: Mr Drax has been accused of presiding over the 'industrialisation of the countryside' with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174-acre farm will be a blot on the landscape

‘He has gone against the views and wishes
of the local community. An area of great landscape value will be ruined
for the next 30 years.

‘We opposed to its sheer size and 
scale - it will be the equivalent of 110 football pitches. It will have a
detrimental visual impact and will be seen for miles around. It will 
impact seriously on the amenity value for horse riders and ramblers.’

Katharine Butler, of Dorchester, the daughter of retired Foreign Office diplomat Sir Michael Butler, grew up in Mapperton.

She said: ‘This beautiful landscape is now threatened to become a hideous industrial park of glass and steel. It is effectively the industrialisation of the countryside. These farms have to be in the right places.

‘If Richard Drax is so keen on renewable energy why not put the farm in view of his beautiful home, within the high walls of Charborough Park and not have to disturb others?

‘It’s hard not to feel that the impetus behind this scheme is financial and not about renewable energy. It will receive a huge sum in subsidies on top of the electricity that is generated that will be sold to the national grid.’

The solar farm has been granted permission by East Dorset District Council for the next 30 years. It will contain 120,000 solar panels on grade 3a arable land and will generate power to nearly 7,000 homes.

The project will be run by the company Good Energy which will lease the land from Mr Drax. The Drax family are no strangers at being labelled the villain of the piece.

Mr Drax’s late grandfather Sir Reginald 
Drax went to school with James Bond creator Ian Fleming who named Hugo 
Drax, the villain in Moonraker, after him.

Richard Drax, whose full name is 
Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, previously said in a 
statement that the solar farm had taken local residents’ views.

He
said: ‘Following a detailed and thorough assessment of the area, an 
application for planning consent for the proposal has been submitted.

‘The opinion of the local community was sought prior to submitting the application and will continue to be incorporated. The site is well screened and the land will be planted to a wildflower rich grass sward.

‘The local area will benefit from a community fund to be established. At the end of the project the land will return to the existing agricultural use.’

Good Energy said the solar farm will have a capacity to generate 28MW of power and will generate enough renewable electricity to power around 6,800 homes.

Ben Gowers, head of development at Good Energy said: ‘We would like to thank everyone who has supported the project so far.

‘The location and design of the solar farm will make the most of the area’s sunshine for renewable energy generation while minimising impacts on the landscape, and enhancing biodiversity.’

The scheme is expected to begin generating electricity as early as April next year.
