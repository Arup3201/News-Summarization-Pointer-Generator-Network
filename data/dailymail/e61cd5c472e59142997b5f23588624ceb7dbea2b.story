A woman who suffers from 'severe vertigo' has won a legal battle with a council after she refused to move into the 16th-floor flat it offered her.

The Court of Appeal said the decision of a Westminster City Council official who concluded the flat 16 floors up was 'suitable' for the woman was 'perverse'.

The woman, who was not identified in a written Court of Appeal judgement published today, had suffered a panic attack and collapsed when visiting the property in Maida Vale, central London, judges were told.

'Perverse': The woman, who suffers with 'severe' vertigo, was offered a flat on the 16th floor of a council-owned block

Three judges had been told, at a hearing in London, that the woman's husband took legal action against the authority after failing to persuade staff to offer a flat on the ground or first floor.

An official who dealt with the case had thought that the woman, who objected to the offer from Westminster City Council, would settle 'in time', the court heard.

But judges were told that the woman had 'severe vertigo' and had suffered a panic attack and collapsed when visiting the flat.

The official had not given 'proper weight' to medical evidence, they said.

The woman's husband had appealed after a county court judge ruled in the council's favour.
