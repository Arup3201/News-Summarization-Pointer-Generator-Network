French tennis star Gael Monfils is renowned as one of the biggest entertainers on the tour - and he took it to a whole new level with a dance-off on court at Roland Garros.

During the traditions French Open Kids' Day, 27-year-old Monfils took the chance to show off his moves in a dance battle with compatriot Laurent Lokoli.

Even the torrential rain failed to dampen the spirits of the crowd who were wowed by the moves of Monfils and Lokoli.
