The Australian radio DJ who asked prime minister Julia Gillard live on air if her live-in partner is gay simply because he is a hairdresser has been sacked.

Howard Sattler sparked outrage yesterday during the drive-time interview on 6PR when he ambushed Miss Gillard into discussing the sexuality of Tim Mathieson, with whom she has been in a relationship since 2006.

Furious bosses at the station in Perth, Western Australia, immediately hauled Sattler before them for a hairdryer treatment of his own before terminating his contract with immediate effect.

The incident again thrusts Australian radio into the global spotlight, a week after a DJ behind last year's prank call on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital that lead to a nurse's suicide not only kept his job but won a top award for his stunt as well.

Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser

It has been an awkward week for Australia's first female prime minister, who expressed 'deep shock' on Wednesday after 
it 
emerged a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party 
included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail', 
described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'

6PR general manager Martin Boylen apologised 'unreservedly' for Saddler's offensive line of questioning today, telling listeners: 'In the wake of yesterday’s interview, Radio 6PR suspended Mr Sattler from broadcasting pending a review of the matter today.

'The station has now decided to terminate Mr Sattler’s engagement effective immediately.'

The light-hearted interview appeared to be going well before it nosedived when Sattler demanded to know Mr Mathieson's true sexual preference, citing 'rumours' on the internet as his source.

'That's absurd,' Miss Gillard responded sharply.

But the interviewer was not going to drop the subject, after earlier asking the Labour leader about the sexist menu.

game'

'But you hear it,' said Mr Sattler, quoting what people were saying: 'He must be gay, he's a hairdresser.

Miss Gillard made it clear that she was not going to be drawn in to the rumours Mr Sattler said were being bandied about.

'I mean, Howard, I don't know if every silly thing that gets said is going to be repeated to me now,' she said.

Howard Sattler's dismissal will raise eyebrows among some after one of the DJs behind the prank call on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital 
that lead to the suicide of one of its nurses not only kept his job but even won an award for the stunt.

Michael Christian, who paired with Mel Greig during the hoax on Australia's 2Day FM, has been named the 'next top jock' of the station and now describes himself as being 'at the top of my game.'

His comments come despite the fact that the nurse who took his initial call Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was later found hanged.

Along with the award he won a trip to Los Angeles.

In a statement after receiving the gong, Christian said: 'From the start, I felt like I had something to prove to myself... Regardless of all that's happened in the past few months, I'm still at the top of my game.

'So it felt good to see my name at the top of the final leader board!'

Christian
 and Greig called King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of 
Cambridge was being treated last December pretending to be the Queen and
 Prince Charles.

Mrs 
Saldanha failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them 
through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition.

She was found dead three days later.

'To all the hairdressers out there, including the men who are listening, I don't think in life one can actually look at a whole profession full of different human beings and say "Gee, we know something about every one of those human beings."'

Mr Sattler reminded the Prime Minister that he had been promised a candid interview with her, asking: 'You can confirm that he's not (gay)?'

'Oh Howard, don't be ridiculous, of course he is not,' said the British-born Prime Minister.

'But you're in a heterosexual relationship?' he pressed. 'That's all I'm asking.'

She replied: 'Howard, let me just bring you back to earth - you and I have just talked about me and Tim living at the lodge. We live there together as a couple, you know that.'

And today Miss Gillard refused to answer reporters' questions on the affair, saying: 'I'm aware that a number of you want to ask questions in relation to yesterday's interview.

'I'm not intending to make any comments on that interview.''

However, she added she was concerned such questioning could have a negative effect on women and girls who enter public life.

'I don't want to see a message like that sent to young girls,' Ms Gillard said. 'I want young girls and women to be able to feel like they can be included in public life and not have to face questioning like the questioning I faced yesterday.'

Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that many women in public office faced a 'significant demeaning attitude, sexist questions, invasive questioning'.

'It's got to stop because we want women in public office, we want women to step up and be part of a decision-making of this country... [but] women and young women are put off by what they see.'

The astonishing interview had begun with Mr Sattler telling Miss Gillard that she had been the butt of rumours and snide jokes many times, to which she she said that was probably right.

When he asked if he could test a few out and she asked in what way, he said: 'Tim's gay.'

After telling the radio host that the suggestion was ridiculous she said: 'Yes, on the internet, you know, there are lots of, you know, what I've referred to in the past as nutjobs and I'm happy to use the expression again - people who peddle and circulate vile and offensive things.'

Bloggers later pointed out that the questions had put Miss Gillard off guard - she told Mr Sattler that the general election was on September 12 when it is actually being held on September 14.

Mr Mathieson is divorced with four adult children, three born during his marriage and one who he fathered in his late teens.

Stunt: In a vulgar incident earlier this week it emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail',  described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'

Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also 
targeted in the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist 
trick'

He began dating Miss Gillard in 2006 and has been her partner ever since.

It has not been an easy week for Miss Gillard.

In a vulgar incident earlier this week 
it 
emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party 
included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail',  
described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'.

Details of the menu at
 a fundraising event in Brisbane were revealed after Miss Gillard's 
warning that if her Labour Party lost the general election in September,
 the incoming Liberals would be 'dominated by men in blue ties' and 
women would be given only minor roles.
