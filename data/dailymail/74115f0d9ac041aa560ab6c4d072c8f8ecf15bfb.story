A lawyer for a police officer who was fired after shocking video footage showed him firing a Taser at a 76-year-old man has said there was 'nothing unreasonable' about the attack.

Nathanial Robinson, 23,  caused an outcry throwing elderly Pete Vasquez to the ground and firing his weapon on him.

The police department in Victoria, Texas, terminated him after an investigation found he had broken protocol during the December 11 encounter - but attorney  Greg Cagle has claimed he did nothing wrong.

Cagle said his client was entitled to use the level of force he did, and should be reinstated as a police officer.

He told the Victoria Advocate that Robinson, who plans to appeal the dismissal, acted constitutionally within the law.

Robinson stopped Pete Vasquez for an expired vehicle inspection sticker, and video captured him grabbing Vasquez's arm and pushing him onto the police cruiser.

The footage didn't show what happened between the two after falling on the ground. Cagle said Vasquez kicked the officer, and that the level of resistance was a basis for using the stun gun and arresting Vasquez.

'There's nothing unreasonable at all about that level of force,' said Cagle, adding that Vasquez 'wasn't injured. He scratched his elbow and hurt his feelings, but those aren't injuries in the constitutional sense.'

Victoria Police Chief Jeff Craig has said Robinson violated policies that included conduct and the use of force. He also personally apologized to Vasquez.

A criminal investigation into the traffic stop was completed by the Texas Rangers, who turned their findings over to local prosecutors for review.

Cagle is an attorney for the Texas Municipal Police Association. Kevin Lawrence, the group's executive director, said it has become more common for administrators and politicians to not stand behind police officers.

'Why we're not giving them more benefit of the doubt today, I don't know,' Lawrence said. 'I think it's a very dangerous path we're on.'

Robinson had been with Victoria police for 18 months.

'If you think he could have done it different or better, then that's a training issue,' Cagle said. 'I think he deserves his job back, and that's what we're going to try to do.'
