'I'm Stalin, but you can call me Meowseph': Stalin the cat is a fan of causing mayhem and mischief, and rules Anne Sofie's house with an iron paw

Anne Sofie has been a big fan of felines since she first persuaded  persuaded her parents to take in an abandoned kitten when she was 14 years old.

Her love for cats grew while she was a student in Japan for a year-and-a-half.

She said: 'I realised just how much better life is with cats - they just make life easier.

'I was able to reserve Stalin and his buddy Durin until I got home from Japan, which happened to be when Stalin was old enough to leave his mother.

'When we got him home he turned out be a real a**hole doing all kinds of things we didn't want him to; stealing food off the kitchen counter, and tearing down and breaking our stuff.

'I have a framed photo of my late mother high up on a shelf which he managed to tear down and break, so it appears he has no compassion - suitable to his name.

'Now he is a bit more grown up and luckily isn't as wild as before. He's really turned into a cuddle bug that loves his treats.'

Anne started the Instagram page out of boredom, and Stalin's followers are constantly growing, currently set to break 9,000. 

Although Stalin has calmed down since he was a kitten, Anne says he still knows he is the boss of the household.

She said: 'He will run after us and attack our toes, as well as attacking our faces and hair when we bend over to stroke him. He's a real character.

'We have had some comments from people saying we're terrible people for giving him this name and making joke about it.

'Of course we have never meant to insult anybody by naming our cat Stalin. We're not exactly the first people to name their cat after a terrible dictator, and mean no harm with parodying Stalin.

'We just try to brighten up people's Instagram and Facebook feeds by making people laugh at our silly cat and his captions.'
