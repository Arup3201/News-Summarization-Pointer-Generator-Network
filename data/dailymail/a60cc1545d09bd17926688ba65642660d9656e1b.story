A female bank manager was left lying in a pool of blood and may be paralysed for life after being brutally attacked by a machete-wielding robber when she bravely refused to hand over money.

Shocking CCTV shows Jyothi Uday being attacked inside an ATM kiosk in India by an armed raider who demands she withdraw cash from the machine.

When she resists, he first pulls a gun out of a bag and then a machete which he uses to rain down blows on her head and face.

After being struck three or four times, Mrs Uday collapses to the floor unconscious as the attacker makes off with items from her purse including a mobile phone.

Terrifying: CCTV footage shows a gunman demanding cash from a female bank manager inside an ATM kiosk

Life flashing before her eyes: When the woman refuses to hand over cash, the man pulls out a machete

Horrific: Moments after this clip, the victim is struck three or four times over the head causing her to collapse unconscious in a pool of blood. Doctors say she is currently paralysed down her right side

Two schoolchildren finally raised the alarm three hours later after seeing blood flowing out of the kiosk, it was reported by The Times of India.

Mrs Uday suffered severe injuries to her head which has left the right side of her body paralysed, doctors said.

CCTV footage shows Mrs Uday being 
attacked in an unguarded ATM kiosk in Bangalore at around 7.10am 
yesterday after making a detour on her way to her work as manager of the
cheque truncation system at a branch of Corporation Bank.

Within seconds of her entering the building, the attacker comes in and pulls the shutter down behind him.

Sickening: The attacker rains down four blows onto her head and face with the machete

Brutal: The woman cowers in the corner as she is struck, knocking her unconscious

Out cold: Detectives say they are also looking into other motives for the attack aside from robbery because the gunman left all of Mrs Jyothi's gold jewellery behind

A police officer said: 'The man wore a blue striped shirt. We can see his face clearly in the visuals.

'He first pulled a gun out of a bag he was carrying and asked her to withdraw cash.

'She resisted. Everything was over in less than four minutes.'

The attacker was seen rubbing bloodstains from the machete with a cloth or piece of paper before pulling the shutter down as he leaves, police said.

Police said the attacker may have been using a fake gun and spoke in Kannada, a language used mainly in the state of Karnataka.

Detectives say they are looking into other motives for the attack aside from robbery because the gunman left all of Mrs Jyothi's gold jewellery behind.

Kamal Pant, additional commissioner of police, law and order, said: 'We are also investigating if there was any personal vendetta.'
