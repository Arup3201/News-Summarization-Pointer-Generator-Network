A cage fighter beat his wife so badly after she sent him a text message saying their relationship was over that police thought they had been called to a murder scene.

Mother-of-two Charlotte Small, 33, was so scared that Gary Marcel, 46, would attack her that she had already entered 999 into her phone - but he immediately snatched it off her.

The thug forced his way into Miss Small's home and repeatedly kicked and punched her in the face - shouting 'no one will want you now'.

Marcel stamped on her breasts, pulled out clumps of her hair, fractured her eye socket and almost ripped off her ear during the attack in Maidstone, Kent.

Miss Small, who still suffers from memory loss, said today that her husband, who she has since divorced, took breaks during the attack before continuing to beat her.

She was finally rescued after her neighbour Martin Nolan, 75, heard her piercing screams and called Kent Police.

Marcel, who was found standing over the apparently lifeless, half-naked body of his wife with his hands drenched in blood, told officers 'it was me'.

One officer who was called to the scene three days before Christmas last year described Miss Small’s facial injuries as 'the most disturbing I have seen in my 10 years service'.

Miss Small, who is mother to Finn, six, and Molly, eight, said: 'He said he’d come to kill me.

'He was kicking me in the face and said "no one will want to be with you now". I ran around the house, desperately looking for corners to hide in.

'At times he stopped hitting me and stroked my hair saying he needed a rest.'

Recounting previous episodes of violence, Miss Small said: 'He pulled radiators off the wall, punched holes in every door and one night he ripped kitchen units out.'

In the summer of 2012 Marcel attacked the mother in front of her children for the first time.

She said: 'It was terrible, Finn hid under a bed and Molly was trying to pull Gary off me.'

Marcel, of Snodland, Kent, denied attempted murder and his guilty plea to causing grievous bodily harm with intent was accepted by the prosecution.

Judge Michael Carroll sentenced Marcel to 11 years behind bars at Maidstone Crown Court.

Sentencing Marcel, Judge Carroll told him: 'You caused horrific and life-changing injuries to this young woman.'

The court also heard how the former soldier had been cautioned in February 2012 for assaulting her.

After another savage beating in August last year, Marcel was given a suspended prison sentence for assault and harassment.

He was slapped with a restraining order until 2017, but that didn’t stop the monster from tracking Miss Small down.

Marcel breached the order in the attack on December 22.
