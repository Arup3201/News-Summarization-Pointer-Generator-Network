A teenage girl who weighed more than Mike Tyson lost a whopping seven stone - after taking up boxing

Courtney Clarke, 18, piled on the pounds after gorging on crisps and sugary snacks washed down with litres of full-fat coke.

At her heaviest she tipped the scales at 19st when she was just 10 years old and was taunted by school ground bullies about her bulky size.

Courtney won her first bout in Birmingham last November when she defeated a fighter 25kg heavier than her

Courtney used to eat secretly throughout her childhood (pictured left and right at 14; right with brother CJ, nine)

But she had the last laugh after she took up boxing and shed 7st and became a champion fighter.

Courtney, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, now weighs a muscular 12st and has gone from a size 20 to a size 12 in the four years since taking up the sport.

She said: 'I would eat breakfast, eat cereal bars on the way to school, crisps and chocolate at break and have a school dinner, as well as some extra food I brought in from home, for lunch.

'Then, I would go home after school and have some sandwiches or crisps before tea, have tea and often secretly eat at night too.

'I have always liked watching boxing on the TV but never really thought I would ever actually do it for real but my friend persuaded me to give it a go.

'I was nervous when I first stepped into the ring but I really got into it.

'I was getting compliments from family and friends and people noticing I had lost weight straight away really but it took me a good couple of months to realise. I didnâ€™t feel any different at first.

Training up to five times a week, Courtney was delighted when she realised the weight was falling off her

Now Courtney is setting her sights on making the British Olympic boxing team in Rio

'It was only when I went shopping with mates that I realised I was too small for the usual size 18-20 clothes I was buying. This was a big boost for my confidence.

'I was very surprised but it spurred me on to train even harder.

'I was training Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for one and a half hours each day - sometimes longer - at the club.'

Courtney, who has just completed a sports coaching qualification at college, won her first bout in Birmingham last November when she defeated a fighter 25kg heavier than her.

She is now setting her sights on making the British Olympic boxing team in Rio in two years time.

She added: 'It was a very welcome to lose weight through boxing. It has always been a hobby so to lose weight because of it too has been wonderful.

'My ultimate dream is to box in the Commonwealth or Olympic Games.'
