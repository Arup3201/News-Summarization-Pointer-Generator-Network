Roger Goodell has hinted that London could be set for more NFL games in the near future.

With three International Series games scheduled for the second season in succession, 2016 may see a further increase, according to the 56-year-old NFL Commissioner.

Speaking to Peter King of TheMMQB.com on the eve of the league's owners meeting in Pheonix, Goodell said: 'Yeah, we’re looking at more games.'

The NFL wanted to host more games in England this year, but were hampered by the rugby World Cup, which sees Pennyhill Park - a favourite haunt of visiting NFL teams - booked up by  England and Wembley hosting two games during rugby union's showpiece event.

'I think every year we’ve learned something from our experience, which is the objective. First and foremost is the passion of the fans—they want more. … What we’re getting from authorities is that, “We’d love to have a permanent presence here.” Stadiums are another big part of it,' Goodell to King.

Goodell also spoke about the Deflategate saga, saying the saga is rumbling to a close two months after the NFL began their investigation.

The NFL is investigating the New England Patriots after 11 of 12 game balls they used in their 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC title game were found to be underinflated.

And Goodell said he expects to get the final report 'soon' from independent investigator Ted Wells.

'I think that if you’re going to be thorough, it takes time. You’re having to meet with a lot of people. I guess it’s always too long, because you want to get to that issue and deal with it. It’s important not to exert any pressure to short-circuit or do anything other than be fair and transparent,' he said.
