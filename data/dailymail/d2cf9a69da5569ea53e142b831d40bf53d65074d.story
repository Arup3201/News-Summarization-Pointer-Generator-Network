Injuries: When 70-year-old player Neal Manning called a batsman on his team 'not out', the game in Suffolk turned hostile

It should have been a pleasant game of a cricket in the sunshine on the village playing field.

Ipswich’s fourth team had gone to nearby Stradbroke in Suffolk to play their team in an eighth division club match.

There was no umpire so the players decided to take turns when not at the crease.

But when 70-year-old player Neal Manning called a batsman on his team ‘not out’, the game turned hostile.

After his team went onto win the game, he claims players from the other team, the Stradbroke Vikings, attacked him in the car park.

He was confronted by players from the losing team, who accused him of cheating for his side.

Following a heated exchange he turned to leave but was pushed over from behind. He fell to the floor and was left with grazes to his arm, leg and shoulder.

Mr Manning, who has been playing for 50 years, said he was shocked by the reaction in the league ‘for players who’ve seen better days’.

The incident on Saturday is now being investigated by local league officials in Suffolk and Essex.

The dispute came after Mr Manning, who 
was playing as a lower order batsman for Ipswich, took his turn as 
umpire, as is normal in local cricket matches.

Playing at home: Stradbroke Vikings, which is a new team, were all out for 163 when Ipswich went into bat

Stradbroke Vikings, which is a new team, were all out for 163 when Ipswich went into bat.

One of Mr Manning’s teammates had scored 12 when Stradbroke appealed for a catch, but he ruled that the batsman had not played the ball.

The player went on to score with 84, 
which led to Ipswich reaching the target with the loss of just four 
wickets, to the fury of Stradbroke’s younger players.

'I’m saddened that this is what cricket’s coming to. I got off lightly'

Mr Manning, a retired sports journalist of Kesgrave, Suffolk, said there was animosity after the game as his own side refused to have a customary drink with their hosts.

He said: ‘This has never happened to me before and I’m saddened that this is what cricket’s coming to. Things are said on the field, but once you get to the bar everything is usually forgotten about.

‘I got off lightly, I could have got a head injury. We have umpires decide against us all the time, but you get on with it. It’s not open for discussion.’

He added: ‘The world has changed so much - this is division eight cricket, for players who’ve seen better days.

‘More aggravation has crept into the game over the years. It’s society today - the players now are not what they were when I was a kid.

‘Youngsters today are unsociable and don’t stop for a drink after a game anymore. They just get changed and drive off.’

The attack has not been reported to the police, but a disciplinary panel for the Marshall Hatchick Two Counties Cricket Championship, which covers Suffolk and Essex, will now decide the fate of the alleged attackers.

A spokesman for the league said: ‘I can confirm that an initial report has been submitted to the league.

‘It is normal procedure that once a report is received both clubs involved have seven days to submit a full report to the league and the disciplinary committee will then make a judgement.’

Richard Pierce-Saunderson, captain of Stradroke Vikings, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned both clubs have investigated the matter and the issue has been resolved.’

The Ipswich IVs declined to comment.

Stradbroke is a small village with a population of around 1,500. It is around 25 miles north of Ipswich.
