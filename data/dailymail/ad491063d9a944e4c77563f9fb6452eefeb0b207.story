Two peas in a pod: Lexi and Eli were inseparable and even called themselves twins 

Police are now looking for the dark truck that may have been street racing with the Garcias at the time of the crash.

Elexis Garcia, known to her friends as Lexi, was a senior while her brother was a sophomore. 

By all accounts, the two siblings were inseparable, even jokingly calling themselves twins, reported The Daily Breeze.

Those who knew Elias described him as the most popular boy in school, known for his fashionable hip hop-inspired clothes and his bold nickname, ‘The King.’

‘He was the center of attention at all parties,’ said Christopher Ortega, a former Banning student. ‘Everybody liked him.’

Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents Wilmington, started a fund to help the Garcias’ family with the teens’ final expenses.
