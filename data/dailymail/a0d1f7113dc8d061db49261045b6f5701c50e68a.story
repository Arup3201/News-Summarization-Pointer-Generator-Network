Suspect: Charles E. Brownlow, Jr., 36, is accused of killing five people during a series of attacks hours earlier in his rural North Texas community of Terrell

A Texas man accused of shooting dead five people, including his mother and aunt, was captured on a surveillance video entering a Mexican restaurant in the middle of his drug-fueled rampage.

Charles Brownlow Jr. was arrested at about 1.30am Tuesday after running into the woods following a high-speed chase, authorities said.

Terrell police Chief Jody Lay identified the victims of the North Texas shooting spree as Brownlow's mother, Mary Brownlow, 61; his aunt, Belinda Walker, 55; Jason Michael Wooden, 33; Kelleye Lynnette Sluder, 30; and Luis Gerardo Leal-Carrillo, 22.

At 9.47pm, after Brownlow had allegedly killed his mother and aunt, he was seen walking into Dos Aces Mexican restaurant on U.S. 80.

The footage from the eatery obtained by NBC DFW shows a hostess escorting the suspect dressed in a sports jersey with No. 32 across the front to a table.

After exchanging a few inaudible words with the staffer, Brownlow walked out after refusing to order food or even sit down. 

Manager Eric Fragoso told the NBC station that had Brownlow decided to open fire on his way out, the rampage would have claimed much more victims because the restaurant was packed with dinner crowd at the time.

Brownlow, 36, was being held on one preliminary count each of capital murder and evading arrest, although additional charges were expected.

‘We're all in a state of shock,’ Lay said at a news conference hours after Brownlow's arrest. ‘You have a tendency to think, “How can that happen here?” This is a country community, a rural community, people are real close. This is going to be, it's going to have a really big impact on us.’

Police would not give a motive for the shooting spree, but they believe that the suspected gunman may have been high on drugs. 

Brownlow's brother, Terrence Walker, said Brownlow struggled with addiction and ‘always wanted to take something that wasn't his.’ He said Brownlow had been living at their mother's home and that she continued to look after him.

‘I was hoping my mom would open her eyes and realize that she needed to let him grow up, put him out,’ said Walker.

He said his own family spent the night at a hotel instead of their home in Forney, and that he was armed with a pistol in case his brother came after him.

Brownlow's criminal record dates back to 1995 and includes convictions for drug possession, burglary and assaulting a family member in 2011.

Records indicate Brownlow was accused of striking a woman he had a relationship with. In 2009, he was sentenced to three years in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and was paroled after seven months.

The attacks began around 5pm at the home of Belinda and Robert Walker. He said he arrived home to find his wife lying on the floor of his 15-year-old son's room.

‘I just went in calling my wife's name and she never did answer,’ Robert Walker said.

About 30 minutes later, fire units responded to a blaze at Mary Brownlow's house a few blocks away. When the fire was extinguished, crews found her body in the smoldering wreckage. Lay said it was clearly arson.

At about 10.30pm, police responded to a report of a shooting at another home and found Wooden and Sluder dead. A 3-year-old boy in the home was unharmed and was released to relatives.

Tesla Savell, who lives across the street from the home where the two bodies were found, said worried friends sent her text messages as the slayings continued Monday night.

‘It hits close to home,’ Savell said of the killings of the couple, whom she described as a ‘sweet family.’By this point, authorities had a description of the stolen vehicle Charles Brownlow was believed to be driving. An off-duty police officer saw that vehicle parked outside a convenience store at 10.37pm.

As the officer called in the sighting, the suspect ran from the store, jumped in the vehicle and sped away, Lay said.

A high-speed police chase ensued. Charles Brownlow wrecked the car and took off on foot into thick woods, dropping a holster or handgun on the way, the chief said.

Career criminal: Brownlow's record dates back to 1995 and includes convictions for drug possession, burglary and assaulting a family member in 2011.

A police helicopter and dogs were summoned to assist in the manhunt, and Brownlow was found hiding in a creek.

Lay said Brownlow appeared to be intoxicated "on some sort of substance" when he was arrested.

The fifth victim, Leal-Carrillo, was a clerk at the convenience store. The store's owner, Ali Karimi, said he was a model employee and a "beautiful young man" who had a 1-year-old son.
