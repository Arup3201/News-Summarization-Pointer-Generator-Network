Two British soldiers serving in Afghanistan are under investigation over the murder of a Kenyan prostitute.

The body of Agnes Wanjiru-Wanjiku, 21, was found stuffed inside a septic tank at a hotel where she plied her trade as a sex worker.

A night porter at the hotel in Nanyuki, Kenya, has said he witnessed a violent altercation between a British soldier and Miss Wanjiru-Wanjiku in one of the rooms.

Nanyuki: The Kenyan town where Agnes Wanjiru-Wanjiru was found dead

The British Army keeps a base in the 
Rift Valley town for soldiers carrying out training prior to their 
deployment in Afghanistan.

The area offers unique jungle and 
desert training opportunities for the military and is one of the only 
places where live rounds are used in training exercises.

It is understood Miss Wanjiru-Wanjiku 
had been working as a prostitute in the town and was last seen alive on 
the night of March 31.

Complaint: A copy of a letter from the Kenyan public prosecutor demanding local police properly investigate the case amid claims they are reluctant to

Witnesses have come forward claiming 
they saw the prostitute, who had a six-month-old baby, entering the 
Lion’s Court Hotel with two British soldiers in March.

The night porter allegedly saw the 
21-year-old in a violent altercation with at least one British soldier 
in one of the rooms later that night. Her badly decomposed body was 
recovered more than two months later as a hotel worker was unblocking 
the tank.

Police in Kenya began a murder 
investigation but it is understood troops left Nanyuki shortly 
afterwards to be deployed in Afghanistan.

Human rights groups have hit out at an
 apparent lack of impetus in the investigation, claiming police were not
 willing to apprehend the soldiers.

Miss Wanjiru-Wanjiku’s family also fear those responsible may never be brought to justice.

Ideal: The conditions around Nanyuki are like those in Afghanistan

During her burial recently, Benedict 
Kimotho, an uncle, said family members and friends held the hotel and 
the British Army responsible.

‘We still believe that the hotel has records indicating who these soldiers were and can arrest them,’ said Mr Kimotho.

An MoD spokesman said it was assisting the Kenyan authorities where appropriate.

In April this year around 200 soldiers
 were involved in a massive bar brawl at a pub in Nanyuki which resulted
 in a number of troops requiring hospital treatment.
