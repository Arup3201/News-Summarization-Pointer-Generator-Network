Hundreds of illegal migrants heading for Britain have moved into a vast new heated hostel in Calais – as local authorities confirmed a formal ‘welcome centre’ will open in January.

The prefecture responsible for the port town in northern France opened the so-called ‘cold weather centre’ over the weekend as temperatures plummeted to freezing.

A more formal ‘welcome centre’ is, meanwhile, likely to be up and running by January 15.

A warm place to rest: Migrants bed down for the night at a warehouse in Calais, northern France, which provides mattresses and bedding for migrants sleeping rough in the town as winter temperatures drop

‘It will provide hot meals, toilets and phone charging points,’ said William Alexander, the CEO of Active Life, the French agency running it.

He said there had been delays in the building of some of the facility - set in an old leisure centre - but ‘the entire site will be completed in early April’.

Referring to the temporary cold weather centre which opened on Friday night, a spokesman for the Calais Prefecture said: ‘We had around 500 people in over Friday night, and numbers should increase up to around 1,500 over coming days.

‘At the moment the centre is a provisional one, but it will become more permanent as the winter progresses.’

Situated around two miles from the centre of Calais, the centre is in a 40,000sq ft warehouse with mattresses and hot showers.

It is in easy walking distance of the main ferry port, where those staying at the centre make regular attempts to get aboard ferries heading for the coast of England.

Once there the vast majority of mainly young men will claim asylum, or else disappear into the black economy.

'Humanitarian gestures': The top local official said the new centres would not be like Sangatte-type hostels

While refugee groups say the centre is essential for the 2500 migrants sleeping rough in the Calais area, others fear it will become a magnet for even more.

Immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters, writes Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail.

Over the past year it has moved ahead of the economy as the British public’s top priority, according to YouGov.

Since May, voters have put it above or tied with the economy in every survey conducted by the organisation.

At one point, in September, it was selected by 58 per cent of voters as one of the three most important issues for the country while only 48 per cent had the economy in their top three.

YouGov chose ‘Immigration becoming the public’s most important issue’ as one of its top five public opinion trends of 2014.

Will Dahlgreen, from YouGov, said: ‘Although immigration began to narrow the gap at the end of 2013, 2014 is the first year since 2010 when the economy has not been the top issue.

‘Immigration had an average lead of one point over the whole year, compared to a deficit of 18 in 2013 and 32 in 2012.’

It is the first large-scale facility since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002.

Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees over six years.

Calais prefect Denis Robin said the new centre would only be open on certain nights, with migrants being forced out by 9am each morning.

He said: ‘The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall.

‘We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.’

A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants is also set to be opened in January.

Mr Robin insisted the shelters were ‘humanitarian gestures’, adding: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.’

Tensions have been mounting in the town in recent months as hundreds more people from countries including Afghanistan, Syria and Eritrea flood into the town.

Brawls between rival gangs and people smugglers left more than 70 people injured during July and August.

At least 15 migrants died during 2014 as they tried to get to Britain from France too, either by drowning in the sea, or being knocked over by lorries.

Security measures: A part of the metal fence erected to keep UK-bound illegal immigrants from getting into the port at Calais is seen after it was toppled by high winds on Saturday night

In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal.

The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal.

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart blames the UK’s generous state benefits for their influx of migrants, saying Britain was viewed as ‘an Eldorado’.

It came as high winds in Calais knocked down part of a new metal fence erected to prevent migrants from getting on to UK-bound ferries.

Sections of the fence, which was only put up last month, were flattened by winds of up to 100mph.
