It was meant as an 80th birthday present for the Queen, but the expensive golden coach ended up the centre of a political row over taxpayer dollars while it lay idle for almost a a decade in a backyard workshop in suburban Sydney.

Called Britannia, the jewel-encrusted carriage which cost millions and took thousands of hours of painstaking work, may finally be put into service by the royal family.

A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace confirmed 'the coach has now arrived in the United Kingdom and plans are being made for it to be used in the future'.

After almost a decade in a backyard workshop in suburban Sydney, during which it became the centre of a political row, the coach 'Britannia' built by Sydney man Jim Frecklington has may finally be put into service for the Royal Family, the Palace says

Since successfully delivering his first coach (above) for the Royal Family in 1988 it has been in constant use, but Jim Frecklington has struggled with his second coach, which until now  has been something of a white elephant

Eight years overdue for its original purpose, as Her Majesty's birthday present on her 80th brithday in 2006, the coach has missed several royal milestones promised by its maker, Sydney man Jim Frecklington.

A former member of the royal household who worked as a carriage driver and cared for the Queen's ceremonial horses, Frecklington allegedly fell behind schedule for a 2006 delivery.

He has since claimed the coach would be delivered for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, then the birth of Prince George in July last year.

Now it has finally been shipped to the UK, it is still unclear just who will use the carriage, which Buckingham Palace described as 'a private initiative which was undertaken by Mr Frecklington' and not a coach commissioned by the royal household.

The coach, which Mr Frecklington says contains hundreds of historical items including wood from Lord Nelson's ship HMS Victory and from a tree known to William Shakespeare, took years of toil only to become a political football.

Mr Frecklington, who made the Australian State Coach for Queen Elizabeth to mark the nation's 1988 Bicentenary celebration, began building the coach after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

Still in service, Jim Frecklington's 1988 coach (above, carrying the Queen in 2006) has been a royal success his subsequent carriage has failed to emulate, but which may now be put to use

The onetime Australian government of staunch monarchist and former Prime Minister John Howard gave ardent monarchist James Frecklington a $245,000 taxpayer-funded grant towards the cost of construction.

The 5.5 metre long coach, which has modern hydraulics, heating, air conditioning and power windows, is lined with military and other items Frecklington says he sourced from 'special contacts' he got to know while working for the Royal Family.

The coach has bits of 'the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Balmoral Castle, Blenheim Palace, Canterbury Cathedral, Hampton Court, Holyrood Palace and Kensington Palace'.

Mr Frecklington said items incorporated into the vehicle were also taken from 'the Battle of Hastings, the Mayflower, the former royal yacht Britannia, a Battle of Britain spitfire a “Dambusters” Lancaster, part of a musketball from Waterloo and a sliver of Isaac Newton’s apple tree' along with objects relating to naturalist Charles Darwin, polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott and mounatineer, Sir Edmund Hillary.

Undelivered for the Queen's birthday, the coach became the subject of intense debate in the Australian Parliament, after John Howard lost office and the Australian Labor Party took power.

Labor senator John Faulkner addressed Parliament in 2011 about the whereabouts of the carriage, which public servants apparently could not locate.

The public servants claimed they didn’t know where the coach was, had never inspected it and there was never any contract for its manufacture. The Senate was told John Howard approved the $245,000 payment to Mr Frecklington to support 'Australian craftsmanship' as a gift to the Queen.

Mr Frecklington told the MailOnline he could not comment about the coach, because he was 'under a confidentiality agreement with the Palace'.

While it lay in Mr Frecklington's North Head workshop, he reportedly allowed visitors paid inspections, saying he'd had people from Melbourne, the Czech Republic (and) England come here and look at it'.

Two years ago, he told the Sun Herald newspaper he was close to signing a deal with a 'large organisation' in Britain.
