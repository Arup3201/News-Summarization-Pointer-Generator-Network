Royal Marines armed with thermal-imaging equipment will patrol the water at today’s Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in a tightening of security following last year’s disruption.

Commandos will man up to ten rigid inflatable boats up and down the four-and-a-quarter-mile course. Organisers have introduced the ‘visible deterrent’ to prevent any copycat of protester Trenton Oldfield who stopped the race when he jumped into the Thames and was almost hit by one of the Oxford oars.

Police will monitor Twitter for any signs of a planned disruption of the event.

Executive director of the Boat Race David Searle said: ‘We are taking additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last year in detail.

‘There will be an increased presence both on and off the water, including support from the Royal Marines, but as with any security plan I cannot disclose the exact details.

‘What I would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that it’s unbelievably dangerous. You risk injuring yourself, the crews and the other people following the race. Nobody wants that. This is just a sporting event.’

However, organisers will not have to worry about Oldfield, 37, making an appearance. He will spend the day walking in the Cotswolds. The Australian was released from prison in December after serving seven weeks of a six-month sentence for causing a public nuisance.

He has since been contacted by the 
Metropolitan Police by letter and on Twitter to establish whether he was
planning any action this year, saying they were ‘keen to facilitate any
peaceful protest’.

In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his ‘lawful rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others’.

However, Oldfield told The Spectator he would ‘probably have a ramble across the Cotswolds instead’.

Oxford have emerged as clear favourites to win the race after more than 70 per cent of bets were placed on the Dark Blues, according to bookmaker William Hill.

Spokesman Joe Crilly said: ‘Oxford are certainly the best backed crew as of yet, although that was very much the case at this stage of proceedings last year.

‘Last year, however, we took nearly £40,000 on the day of the race and Cambridge became best backed by the time the race started. Maybe history will repeat itself this time around.’

There have been calls for supporters to boycott the Cambridge team over claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten wildlife.

Mark Avery, the former head of conservation at the RSPB and Cambridge student, told the Daily Telegraph that the building project is in danger of wiping out otters and bitterns on the Great Ouse river.

‘I hope that the Cambridge boat sinks in Sunday's University Boat Race,’ he said.

‘Why? Because the Cambridge University Boat Club is planning to build a new boathouse (although it is far more than just a boathouse) on one of the best sites for otters in Cambridgeshire, and its impact on local wildlife will be severe.’

But Project Ely, the group working to provide the new facility, have stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its natural surroundings, the paper reported.
