After driving a tractor the length of Africa, Dutch adventurer Manon ‘Tractor Girl’ Ossevoort is setting out for the South Pole.

She hopes to fulfil her decade-long dream of travelling the 2,796 miles from Russia’s Novo base to Antarctica and back.

When asked whether people think she’s crazy for attempting such a bizzare stunt, the 38-year-old actress replies with a wide smile: ‘Only if they haven’t met me.’

After driving a tractor the length of Africa, Manon Ossevoort is heading for the South Pole

Ossevoort originally began her African journey in 2005, taking four years to drive from her home village in Holland to Cape Town at the southern tip of the continent.

She was meant to head to Antarctica to complete the final leg of her trek, but was delayed and ultimately missed the boat that was set to take her there.

Frustrated, the former actress spent the following four years back in Holland where she wrote a book and worked as a motivational speaker, while dreaming of the day that she would be able to get back on her tractor.

It seems like that day has finally arrived.

In the video, the new mum of a 10-month-old daughter Hannah, perches on the seat of the tractor in a mini-dress and chats about her epic plans.

Mechanics are visible in the background putting the finishing touches on her beloved mode of transport, named the Antarctica 2, in honour of legendary explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, who travelled to the South Pole on a tractor in 1958.

Ossevoot plans to spend about 12 hours per day in the tractor seat, bundled up in Arctic gear – as she heads for what she likes to call ‘the end of the world.’

She will make a 2,800-mile round trip across the largest mass of ice on earth – from Russia’s Novo base to the South Pole and back.

‘Ten kilometres an hour would be good,’ she says. ’15 would be nice, 20 lovely.’

Ossevoort will also bring with her the 'dreams' - scrawled on scraps of paper and emails - that she has collected from people around the world

She will also bring with her the ‘dreams’ – scrawled on scraps of paper and emails – that she has collected from people in Africa and around the world.

They have been converted into digital form and will be placed in the belly of the big snowman that she plans to build at the Pole – to be opened in 80 years time.

‘I want to turn them into a beautiful time capsule of the dreams of the world, so that in the future, children and people can read something about our dreams and not only about politics or war.

‘The tractor, for me, symbolises this very down to Earth fact that if you want to do something, maybe you will not be so fast, but if you keep going and keep your sense of humour, you will get there.’

Though Ossevoort travelled alone during her African expedition, in Antarctica the tractor will need to creep forward both day and night, so French mechanic Nicolas Bachelet will share the driving.

They hope to cover 60 to 120 miles each day and complete the trip in four to six weeks.

‘I think I’ll love the experience, travelling the last leg in relative silence over this vast and white continent,’ she says.

‘It’s a beautiful last phase in a long pilgrimage.’

A team of seven will accompany her, including a film crew who will record the journey for a documentary.

Her progress can be tracked on the website, antarcticatwo.com.
