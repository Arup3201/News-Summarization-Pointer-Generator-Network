The vicious fight at Chester High School involved chairs and fists that pummeled a 16-year-old student

The attack on the 16-year-old victim was filmed by one of the five assailants and posted onto YouTube where it went viral and led to their arrest

The five teens were charged as adults with aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, reckless endangerment, robbery and conspiracy and arraigned late on Wednesday night by Magisterial District Judge Walter A. Strohl and remanded to Delaware County prison in lieu of 10 percent of $100,000 bail.

According to police sources the arrests were made once the video went viral on Tuesday and came to the attention of a student of the school who reported it to authorities.

'We’re trying to fit the pieces together, but we’re not letting this go lightly,' said Police Commissioner Joseph Bail to the Delco Times on Thursday morning.

The father of the 16-year-old victim revealed that his father has four stitches in the back of his head from wounds he sustained during the fight.

'The kids are really taking over the school there. I think security really needs to be stepped up in there,' added the father to CBS Philadelphia.

'You think it’s all fun and games, but it isn’t no game out here. And you think you’re getting away with it, but you’re not.'

The video begins with Stanley narrating and the police affadavit says that as the group attacks the young man, several other students join in, hiting him in the head and face with chairs, fists and feet.

Police said Morales hit the victim with a chair, then his fist and then kicked him, while Parker hit the boy with a chair and then punched him in the head as he was stricken on the floor.

Newman is accused of striking the victim in the head with a chair and then repeatedly hiting him with his hands before stealing the victims cell phone.

Gomillon was also seen kicking the victim in the back but was stopped by school security and admitted to striking the victim.

'Obviously, in an ideal setting, we would have a situation where this would not happen, where this could not have happened, and we’re going to investigate and find out what happened,' said Chester Upland School District Receiver Joe Watkins.

Mayor John Linder praised police for working quickly on an investigation that resulted in the arrest of five students.
