The wait for a man to dethrone Jon Jones continues after the UFC light-heavyweight champion delivered a controlled performance to beat Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas. 

In doing so, Jones recorded his 12th consecutive victory and the eighth successive title defence. 

After a long and often bitter build-up, the champion was made to work hard by the undefeated 35-year-old but Jones pulled away in the closing stages.

An hour before he was due to enter the Octagon, Jones was mingling with the crowd and signing autographs for fans.

But he was quickly into his stride in the fight, aiming an axe kick at Cormier’s head before following up with several swipes up top. 

Cormier was then taken down for the first time in his MMA career but recovered quickly only to be sent backwards by a straight left.

Cormier responded with a sharp right hand but although he kept the pressure on Jones, the challenger struggled to overcome the 11 inch disparity in reach.

Cormier did land an uppercut with 30 seconds remaining but it was the champion’s round.

Jones also started the second session as the aggressor but Cormier’s high work rate began to pay off and he found a home for his right hand.

The attacks continued to come from the challenger as he landed an uppercut and while Jones mounted a response, it wasn’t enough to stop the round slipping away.

Encouraged by his corner, Cormier looked for a repeat performance in the third session but was temporarily halted by a stray finger in the eye.

Cormier, who twice represented his country at the Olympics, went for a takedown but was thwarted by Jones’ excellent defence.

And it was the younger man who finished the round the stronger.

Ahead on my scorecard, Jones then produced an inspired opening 90 seconds of the fourth stanza, taking Cormier down twice having also landed with his elbow and knee.

Jon Jones' next title defence will be against the winner of Alexander Gustafsson's fight against Anthony Johnson on January 24. 

And although Cormier rose, he spent much of the remainder of the round with his back to the cage, looking visibly fatigued. 

And despite landing an early uppercut, Cormier struggled to make an impression as the pair grappled in the centre of the Octagon for the final five minutes.

The challenger's increasingly frustrated attempts to record a takedown failed to yield fruit until 50 seconds from the end, but Jones immediately sprung to his feet.

The pair continued to exchange blows after the final bell before Jones' hand was raised in victory after all three judges scored the fight 49-46 in his favour.

He said: 'It felt great; he's only human. The undefeated DC. All the haters. All the c**p he talked, it motivated me. I'm sorry for being classless, but I do not like DC, which is why I'm being this way.' 

A deflated Cormier said: 'By the end of the first round we were both bleeding and that’s how it should be in a championship fight.

'He got better and he won the fight. He felt a bit bigger than he looks and when he hangs on you it can take its toll late in the fight. I know I lost.' 

Donald Cerrone controlled the first round on the ground as he dominated Myles Jury in the co-main event

In the co-main event, Donald Cerrone dominated Miles Jury for his seventh successive victory to edge closer to a lightweight title shot.

Jury took the fight to the ground in the opening minute but his decision backfired as he spent the remainder of the round fending off repeated attacks. 

Cerrone almost succeeded with a rear naked choke while a late armbar attempt was cut short by the bell.

The pair remained on their feet for the second round but neither were prepared to let their hands go, much to the frustration of the crowd.

The third session, however, burst into life at the midway point when Cerrone connected with a vicious head kick and it was he who continued to be the aggressor.

He finished the fight with a succession of angry body kicks as Jury lay defenceless on the canvas.

'I was either trying to break my leg or his, I was very upset,' said Cerrone.

'I don’t like hearing boos. I want to be fighting my a** off all the time. I don’t consider that a win.

'I was very upset with the performance and I apologise to everyone watching.'

It was announced earlier in the night that the division champion Anthony Pettis will defend his title against Rafael dos Anjos at UFC 185 on March 14.
