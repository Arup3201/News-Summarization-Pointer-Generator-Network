A teachers’ protest over pay turned violent in Rio de Janeiro, with masked anarchists pelting police and buildings with fire bombs and breaking into banks in scenes that will raise questions about the security of the 2014 World Cup.

Teachers in Brazil have been on strike demanding better pay for almost two months and on Monday thousands of them - joined by students, anarchists and civil rights groups – marched in support of the action.

The march began peacefully, but ugly scenes erupted when it reached City Hall, where controversial legislation that's altered teachers' working conditions has been signed off.

Masked demonstrators threw tear gas, fireworks, firebombs and stones at police, set a bus on fire and smashed the gate at City Hall.

Some then broke into banks and attempted to either set ATMs on fire or rip them open.

As police responded with tear gas, demonstrators ripped furniture out of the banks and used it to form barricades.

Anarchist Hugo Cryois, 23, who was carrying a gas mask, told the BBC: ‘Without the police, there is no violence. When they are there, there always is. I came prepared. You can't trust them.’

Last week police used tear gas to disperse a group of around 100 protesting teachers.

Some claimed around 50,000 had gathered for the protest, but police said the figure was closer to 10,000.

Brazil faces a challenging security situation as it gears up to host the World Cup in eight months’ time.

In June thousands of demonstrators, angered by the billions spent in preparations for the event, clashed with riot police near the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte.

'We don't need the World Cup,' said Leonardo Fabri, a 19-year-old protester, at the time. 'We need education, we need better health services, a more humane police.'
