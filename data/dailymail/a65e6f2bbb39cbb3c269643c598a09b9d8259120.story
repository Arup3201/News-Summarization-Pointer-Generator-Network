David Gregory endured months of humiliating speculation that NBC executives were planning to fire him as moderator of 'Meet the Press.' When he finally got the boot last week, he left with nary a bad word to say about the network - telling his Twitter followers that he is leaving NBC 'humbled and grateful.'

The New York Post reports that Gregory's gracious exit from NBC was ensured thanks to a $4million payoff he received before he was kicked off the Sunday talk show and replaced with chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd. 

Gregory's contract dictated that he had to be paid into next year. The network also paid a severance package after he signed a non-disparagement contract, sources tell the newspaper.

Gregory wasn't even allowed to host one final episode of 'Meet the Press' after he was given the boot. NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell sat in the moderator's chair today. Todd will take over next month.

Out with the old, in with the new: David Gregory (left), who has hosted 'Meet the Press' for six years, could be replace with Chuck Todd (right) as early as this Sunday

Andrea Mitchell filled in a moderator of 'Meet the Press' on the first Sunday after Gregory was fired. He wasn't even allowed to host a farewell show

The 43-year-old Gregory, who had been at the helm of the show for six years since the death of Tim Russert, has overseen a precipitous drop in ratings. After 15 years at the top of the Sunday political talk show heap, 'Meet the Press' has the lowest ratings in more than two decades. It currently comes in third after ABC's 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

Politico reports that executives blamed Gregory for the slide, saying he didn't seem 'engaged' about politics and policy, which doesn't bode well for the host of a program about politics and policy.  

Politico also claims that Gregory was not liked at NBC and that he 'rubbed his colleagues the wrong way.'

The Post reports that Gregory isn't likely to be out of work long. CNN is eyeing him to became moderator of its political debate show 'Crossfire.'  

Last week NBC announced that chief Todd will replace Gregory as host on September 7.

Shortly before NBC made the change public, Gregory took to Twitter to announce he was leaving the network: 'I leave NBC as I came - humbled and grateful. I love journalism and serving as moderator of MTP was the highest honor there is.

'I have great respect for my colleagues at NBC News and wish them all well. To the viewers, I say thank you.'  

 

Resignation: David Gregory told his 1.7million followers that he was leaving NBC. His resignation came before network executives could announce he was being replaced

A memo from NBC News President Deborah Turness praised Gregory's 'remarkable gift for holding leaders to account,' but several news sources report that he was forced out.

Todd currently has his own morning show on MSNBC, 'The Daily Rundown,' which airs weekdays at 9am. 

Ratings for 'Meet the Press' have been slumping for years. Last year, they hit 2.9million - the lowest level in 21 years as the show fell to third behind ABC rival 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 

And ratings have continued to nose-dive.TV Newser reports that on August 3, just 2.1million people tuned in - and only 584,000 from the vital 25-54 age demographic.

Earlier this week, Politico reported that NBC had anointed Todd as its new 'Meet the Press' moderator.  

'The move is an effort by NBC News President Deborah Turness to restore passion and insider cred to a network treasure that has been adrift since the death in 2008 of the irreplaceable Tim Russert,' Politico's Mike Allen said. 

The white-haired Gregory was a rising star at NBC when he was appointed replace Russert - whose sudden death was widely mourned by the political establishment. 

Media watcher say NBC hopes Chuck Todd's sources and his 'political junkie' enthusiasm will draw viewers back in to the show, which is known for its long, in-depth interviews with politicians and other newsmakers. 

Todd, 42, grew up in Miami and is a devoted University of Miami Hurricanes fan. He attended George Washington University in Washington, DC. - first majoring in music, then in political science - but never graduated. 

He has served as NBC's chief White House Correspondent since 2008.

Politico reports that he has since developed a devoted following of  politicians, policymakers and other Washington insiders.

'Meet the Press' is one of NBC's marquee programs. On the air since November 6, 1947, it has the distinction of being the longest-running show on TV. Gregory is the 11th moderator of the show.
