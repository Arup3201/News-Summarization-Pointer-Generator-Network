A Spanish thug who pushed Scottish holidaymaker Stephen Mallon to his death during an anti-British mob attack abroad has been jailed for just three years.

Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin, 28, was facing a 15-year jail sentence if he had been found guilty of homicide.

But he was cleared of that charge and was instead convicted of the father-of-three’s manslaughter after a judge ruled he had provoked Mr Mallon’s fall from a 13ft ledge during a mass attack by a gang of Spaniards armed with weapons.

Roofer Mr Mallon, 49 and originally from Glasgow, died in hospital 11 days after suffering severe head injuries in the summer 2009 fall in Competa, near Malaga, where he owned a holiday home.

His sons Peter and Carl, who were 16 at the time, suffered broken bones after being punched and attacked with a metal pole and were left with post-traumatic stress caused by their ordeal.

Two other men were found guilty of assault with dangerous weapons in a 31-page written document released by Malaga’s Criminal Court number three yesterday.

Luis Felipe Romero Allsop, convicted of hitting Carl Mallon with a metal bar and fracturing his right hand, was sentenced to two years in prison.

Juan Ortega Gonzalez, who prosecution lawyers wanted jailed for five years for smashing a bottle over Mr Mallon’s head, also received a two-year jail sentence.

The pair may escape going to jail, because in Spain prison sentences of two years or less are normally suspended for first-time offenders who pay compensation orders linked to their convictions.

Ten of the 12 other defendants tried last month over the orgy of violence that led to Mr Mallon’s death were fined after being convicted of affray. Two were cleared.

Last night, Mr Mallon’s widow Teresa criticised the sentences. She said: ‘They’re disgusting to be honest. We will be reviewing the sentencing document to see where we go from here.’

Fifteen Spanish men took the witness stand as defendants in a five-day trial which finished on May 26.

Mr Mallon’s sons said when they gave evidence they were attacked by up to 40 men armed with coshes, knuckledusters, bottles and iron bars outside a disco-bar called La Estrella, simply because they were British.

The defendants denied the claims and insisted they acted in self-defence after the Mr Mallon started attacking them.

Some witnesses said the trouble kicked off over a girl who used to date one of the accused.Jimenez, accused of wilfully killing Mr Mallon, insisted when he took the witness stand he had only moved his arms about trying to defend himself after the Scot punched him.

Lead judge Andres Rodero, one of three 
who presided over the trial, concluded in the written ruling: ‘We 
believe there is sufficient proof in relation to the origin of the fall,
 in the sense that it was provoked by the accused and not the result of a
 simple loss of balance.’

The
 sentencing judges also ordered him to compensate Mr Mallon’s 
hairdresser widow Teresa with 120,000 euros (£96,000) and his three 
children with 90,000 euros (£72,000) each.

The ten men convicted of affray will have to pay 10 euros (£8) a day over four months and face prison if they fail to do so.

Teresa
 who has still not been able to cremate or bury her husband, said on the
 last day of the hearing last month she felt let down by the lack of 
support from British diplomats and UK police.

She
 added: ‘We would be worried for anyone who went to Competa for a day 
because they could be attacked by a mob of 30 armed men.’

The
 charge of homicide in Spain is a halfway house between manslaughter and
 the more serious charge of murder and carries a ten to 15-year prison 
sentence.

Under Spanish law murder, like homicide, is a wilful killing but it must also be premeditated.
