Civilisation has long been regarded as one of the BBC’s greatest programmes since it debuted in 1969.

They’re making a brand new version of the documentary which was a ratings smash when it first aired nearly 50 years ago.

Director-General Tony Hall will announce the remake this week when he unveils plans for a major expansion of arts coverage across all BBC channels and platforms.

Hall will say the 13-part BBC2 show charting the history of Western civilisation left him with a life-long passion for the arts, and the new series will have the same impact on a new generation.

The hunt is now on for ‘leading cultural figures’ to front the show.

Art historian Kenneth Clark presented the original but the remake may use more than one presenter.
