Two pupils who were sponsored by their headteacher to do a charity head shave were put in isolation the next day as their hair was too short.

Billy Howard and Joe Moon, both 15, decided to shave off their hair and jointly raised £500 for St Luke’s Hospice in Basildon, Essex.

They got permission from Gable Hall School in Stanford-Le-Hope, Essex, and were even sponsored by head teacher Dr Sophina Asong.

But after having their heads shaved in front of friends and family at Billy’s home in Stanford-Le-Hope on Tuesday night, a teacher ordered the boys into isolation on Wednesday morning. 

The school claims the teenagers knew their new look was too short and was against the school's code.

Their new dos were cut an eighth of inch shorter than they were allowed.

The pair decided to fundraise for St Luke’s after reading about the good work it does in the community.

Billy’s parents were so angry with the school’s decision that Billy was home-schooled today whilst Joe, who lives in Corringham, Essex, was allowed special permission to go on a pre-arranged school drama trip to London.

Billy’s mother, Sally, 45, said: 'We’re angry. It’s such a shame the boys were put in isolation for the day.

'They will be in for all breaks until it grows out, even though Dr Asong sponsored the boys.

'Apparently only a number three is allowed and they had a number two.

'We are so proud of the boys and they should not be hidden away as they did it for such a good cause.

Gable Hall headteacher Dr Sophina Asong said the boys had knowingly broken school rules

'The school could have gone about this differently and got the boys up in assembly and congratulated them in front of the school, but instead they told younger pupils that skinhead hair is not an acceptable part of the uniform.'

In a letter sent to the school, Billy’s father, Gary, 45, expressed disappointment at the decision and asked what values the school were teaching.

He said: 'It’s a strange one really. They have shown responsibility and creativity for a good cause. Now they can’t even collect their sponsorship from their fellow pupils.'

Gable Hall headteacher Dr Sophina Asong said the boys had knowingly broken school rules.

She added: 'The school’s support for St Luke’s Hospice and the service it provides to our community is whole-hearted.

'The decision by two students to raise sponsorship by shaving their heads was approved by the school provided it conformed to the school behaviour code.

'On the day the students came into school with their heads shaved, they admitted to staff that they had knowingly flouted the code and it is for this reason that they ended up being taught in isolation.'
