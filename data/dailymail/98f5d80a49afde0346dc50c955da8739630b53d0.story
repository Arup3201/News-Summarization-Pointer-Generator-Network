Agatha Christie, pictured above, used a Belgian policeman as the inspiration behind her famous detective Hercule Poirot

It is a mystery almost as great as those that he solves.

It seems the inspiration behind Agatha Christie's Poirot may have been unveiled as a policeman from Belgium.

Little-known gendarme Jacques Hornais is the man who the author turned into her famous detective Hercule, according to the descendant of a wartime fundraiser.

Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels.

Although the author never revealed any particular person as her inspiration an amateur researcher says he has now uncovered evidence Hornias could have been the real-life Poirot.

New details have emerged of a meeting between a young Hornais and Christie - when she played the piano for him in her home town of Torquay.

Hornais fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914,  and made his way to England -  just as the fictional character did.

The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logs their names in her diary.

Mrs Clapp, a married mother-of-four, helped around 500 Belgians find places to stay during the Great War and was later honoured by its Government.

She was also involved in wartime fundraising events, hosting one at the home of a friend, a Mrs Potts-Chatto, who was putting up Hornais and his son at her house in Torquay.

Newspaper records reveal that locals laid on entertainment on January 6, 1915, with 24-year-old Agatha Christie playing the piano for the Belgian guests.

Christie later claimed she 'found' the characters for The Mysterious Affair at Styles while travelling around Torquay.

Alice Clapp’s grandson Michael was 
researching his relative’s exploits with the help of the Torquay Museum 
when he uncovered the chance meeting between Hornais and Christie.

'Jacques Hornais' - now revealed as Jacques Hamoir - fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914,  and made his way to England, just as the fictional character did. The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logged their names in her diary

Mr Clapp, a retired Navy Captain, 
said: 'Alice kept a black notebook listing some 500 Belgian refugees of 
all classes who passed through Exeter.

'The
 first lot included this retired gendarme, Jacques Hornais, and his son.
 The names of many of the families who received them are recorded.

'He eventually went to stay with a Mrs Potts Chatto who lived in a house called the Daisons in Torquay.

'It’s been knocked down now and there’s a housing estate in its place.

Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels

According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character which in turn became a TV hit - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception'

'But the Torquay museum has confirmed however that the Potts Chattos held a meeting in their house to raise money and gather clothing for the refugees.

'A young girl played the piano at the event. This young lady later became the crime writer Agatha Christie - so there is a very strong circumstantial link to Poirot.'

Mrs Clapp, who was married to Cecil Robert Mainwaring Clapp, a solicitor and Sheriff of Exeter, died in the 1920s just as Christie’s writing career was taking off.

For her services to the refugees Mrs Clapp was awarded a Belgian medal, la Medaille de la Reine Elisabeth, which the family still have.

The youngest of the refugees are said to have nicknamed her Moei, pronounced Moy, which is Flemish for Mother.

Mr Clapp said his grandmother has personally gone to the train station to meet all 500, including Hornais and his son Lucian, in person.

Hornais would have been a similar age to his fictional counterpart, although little else is known about him and there is no mention of whether he had a moustache like Poirot.

Mr Clapp said: 'All of us now think of Hercule Poirot as rather a fat chap waddling along with a distinct character but that doesn’t mean to say he was like that in real life.

''All we know about Hornais is that he was gendarme and he had a son. He was married but he didn’t bring along his wife his wife at the time.

'It’s seems quite plausible that Christie met him at the event and may have been intrigued by his stories.

'We don’t know any of this for sure, but then its seems quite fitting that the real life Poirot should remains as mysterious as the books themselves.'

According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception'.

David Brawn, publisher for the Agatha Christie Estate, said: 'Agatha always claimed she was inspired by the Belgian refugees she met.

'It’s quite plausible that she played the piano for them at a social event as she was quite an accomplished pianist.

'As far as I’m aware she never said that Poirot was based on any one person, he’s very much a composite character.

'So whether this event was one of those occasions when she thought about him, I don’t know - but it certainly makes for a great little story.'
