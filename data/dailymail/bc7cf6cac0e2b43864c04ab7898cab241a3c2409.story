The first images of the Australian Submarine AE2 wreckage, lost more than 99 years ago at the bottom of the ocean in Turkey, have been captured by a high-definition camera and sophisticated lighting.

The roving camera used to inspect the wreck 73 metres below the Sea of Marmara reveals that the submarine is still in surprisingly good condition since being lost to Turkish gunfire from the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar on 30 April 1915.

Since the submarine was found by a Turkish maritime archaeologist in 1996, a joint Australian and Turkish initiative has been in full swing to access the wreckage without disturbing the site and the long process was finally achieved last month.

Divers verified the site in 1998 before Silent ANZAC project began with a team of Australian submariners, scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the US Remotely Operated Vehicle designers, SeaBotix.

Project leader and Chair of the AE2 Commemorative Foundation, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs said the camera  captured the entire length of the submarine including her forward and aft hydroplanes, rudder and tops of her propellers.  

‘The submarine interior is in amazingly good condition, original paint, signalman's sand shoes (plimsolls) still stowed in the flag locker in the conning tower along with the flags and what we believe was the battle ensign used by Lieutenant Commander, Henry ‘Dacre’ Stoker, DSO, 99 years ago,’ he said. 

RADM Briggs said one of the most significant discoveries of the exercise was a portable Wireless Telegraph pole and antenna wire, the existence of which had long been the subject of discussion of military historians.

‘It is most likely that it was this telegraph which transmitted the message to Army headquarters that AE2 had torpedoed an Ottoman gunboat at Çanakkale,’ he said.

RADM Briggs said there were many hiccups along the way as the process was inevitably challenging.

The diving team first practiced in 12 metres of water in Corio Bay in Geelong last year and then again in Turkey for three days before the real dive last month

The process was painstakingly slow with the wet diving bell, that transported the two divers down to the sea floor, taking four hours and only allowed the divers 20 minutes to work before going back up to the surface again

The diving team first practiced in 12 metres of water in Corio Bay in Geelong last year and then again in Turkey for three days before the real dive last month.

‘We built a mock-up of the conning tower and its control room and we dropped that on the bottom alongside our ship, which took four days to mobilise, in 12 metres of water and practiced with the Turkish diving team,’ he said. 'Then we took the ship down for 10 days but we lost one day through bad weather.'

'So we had to find the submarine again and then moor the ship with four buoys so it could adjust its position very accurately and let us work on various sites on the submarine,’ he said.

HMAS AE2 was the first Allied submarine to penetrate the Dardanelles strait at 2.30 am on April 25 in 1915 as part of the Gallipoli Campaign, on the morning the ANZAC soldiers landed at Anzac Cove.  

After five hectic days ‘running amok’, she finally fell to Turkish gunfire from the Ottoman torpedo boat Sultanhisar on 30 April 1915 and was scuttled.

All of AE2’s crew were rescued by the Sultanhisar crew before the submarine slid down to the sea floor.

The submarine lay unseen until 1998 when she was discovered, intact, in 73m of water in the Sea of Marmara. 

His Majesty's Australian Submarine AE2 was launched in the yard of Vickers Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness England on 18 June 1913.

She commissioned at Portsmouth on 28 February 1914 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Henry Hugh Gordon 'Dacre' Stoker, RN
