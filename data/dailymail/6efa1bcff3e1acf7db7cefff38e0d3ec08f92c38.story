Few bosses are as willing to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to the company's products as Claes Nilsson.

The president of Volvo Trucks has so much confidence in the toughness of the Swedish manufacturer's vehicles that he appeared in a video standing on the new FMX model as it dangles 65ft above the sea from a crane.

'Well, I have to admit I had butterflies in my tummy and I certainly did wonder more than once about what I'd let myself in for. I'm no mountain-climber and I don't like heights,' he said.

Confident: Claes Nilsson, president of Volvo Trucks, stood on the latest model as it was suspended above the sea by its tow hook

Vertigo: Mr Nilsson admits he is afraid of heights but agreed to do the short film anyway

'But I'd promised to do the stunt so I couldn't very well back out.'

He had to spend almost two hours standing on the front panel of a Volvo FMX construction truck that had been hoisted high above the water in Gothenburg harbour in Sweden.

The stunt was undertaken to show that the truck's front towing hook can handle far greater stresses than those to which it is normally subjected.

Incredibly there was not trick filming or special effects, just Mr Nilsson standing atop the suspended truck.

The film was shot from a helicopter. Everything had been prepared in advance down to the tiniest detail.

No CGI trickery or filming tricks were used in the creation of the incredible film

'The difficulty is to shoot the entire film in one take from a helicopter,' says Filip Nilsson of Folke Film, who directed the viral'

'I'm really impressed by Claes Nilsson, who stayed cool and focused throughout the two hours while hanging 20 metres up in the air. I tried it myself, but just for 15 minutes.

'It was pretty scary I can tell you.'

This is not the first time Volvo Trucks has filmed spectacular tests featuring their trucks.

'The Ballerina Stunt' saw tightrope walker Faith Dickey balance on a slackline between two trucks driving at full speed.

It has now been seen by 7 million people on Youtube.
