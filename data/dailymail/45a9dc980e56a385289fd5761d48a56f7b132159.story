The Montana Supreme Court will censure a state judge and suspend him without pay for 31 days for saying a 14-year-old rape victim was 'older than her chronological age.'

Justices said in Wednesday's opinion that Judge G. Todd Baugh of Billings eroded confidence in the court system with his actions in the case of convicted rapist and former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold.

Baugh was ordered to appear before the court July 1 for a public censure.

The judge sent Rambold to prison for just 30 days last year after he pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent.

Rambold was 47 years old at the time of the assault.

The girl, a student in Rambold's class at Billings Senior High School, 
committed suicide while the case was pending trial.

After
 prosecutors from the state Department of Justice appealed, the high 
court ruled unanimously in April that Rambold's original sentence was 
illegal under a state law that says he should have served a minimum of 
two years.

Rambold's lawyers
 filed a petition seeking a new hearing in May, arguing in part that it 
was appropriate for court to factor the girl's conduct into his 
sentence.

A brief, 
one-paragraph order said the legal issues raised by Rambold already were
 addressed in the court's April ruling. Under Montana law, children 
under 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse.

Department of Justice spokesman John Barnes said the agency was pleased that the court denied the request for a new hearing.

Rambold
 has been free since last fall after serving out his original sentence —
 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended — from Baugh. After his release, Rambold registered as a
 sex offender and was to remain on probation through 2028.

A new judge will be selected to resentence him.

Baugh has apologized for his actions.

He plans to retire when his term expires in December.
