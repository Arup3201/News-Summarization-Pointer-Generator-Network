The first pictures of the three youngsters killed in a devastating house fire have been released as the families pay tribute to 'their beautiful babies.'

Teenage sweethearts Andrew Gunn, 18, and Rosie Benellick, 17, both died within hours of the blaze in Honiton, Devon, on Friday.

Rosie's three-year-old brother Harvey, who was described as 'funny and very loving' by his parents, was also killed.

The families of Rosie Bennellick, 17, and Andrew Gunn, 18, who both died in the house fire, said the young couple 'loved each other more than words can say'

Rosie's three-year-old brother Harvey also died in the blaze. Police are believed to be investigating whether the accidental fire was started by a child playing with a lighter

Five other members of the Bennellick family were in the house at the time of the fire but managed to escape.

Harvey, Rosie and Andrew were airlifted to hospital after becoming trapped in the burning house at about 7.50am but could not be saved.

Police said the fire was an accident and officers are believed to be investigating whether a cigarette lighter was the cause.

Rosie and Harvey's family today said their hearts had been broken by the tragedy.

They said in a statement: 'Rosie, our beautiful daughter, was the 
most amazing big sister anyone could ever ask for. She was always 
smiling, singing, dancing, and, most of all, looking to everyone she 
met.

'She was our daughter, 
our best friend and our rock. She always put a smile on everyone's face 
and looked after anyone who needed help. She loved life and gave us more
joy than she will ever know.

'Harvey,
our beautiful baby boy, was a lot like his big sister. He loved to sing
and dance around with her. He was funny and very loving. He didn't like
to see anyone upset and would always hug you if you were sad.

'He
loved being around his brothers and sisters and other children. He 
would always ask to play and share and make everyone laugh. Harvey 
always smiled and made us smile, he was our baby.

The three victims were airlifted to hospital after the blaze at the Bennellick home in Honiton, Devon

Andrew's family said Rosie was 'the love of his life'. The couple had been together for almost three years

'Everyone
who met Rosie and Harvey will have seen just how amazing they truly 
were and have some funny memories about them. They touched many people's
hearts. Our own hearts are broken. We loved them more than we will ever
be able to say.'

The family also paid tribute to Andy, who had been with Rosie for almost three years.

They said: 'Rose and 
her boyfriend Andy, who also sadly died, loved each other more than 
words can say. Andy will 
always be a big part of our family.

'Harvey
particularly loved to see Andy. He would drop everything when he knew 
Andy was coming to run for a cuddle. Our family are so thankful that 
Andy loved Rosie so much and we know that she loved him just as much.

'We
have asked that the toys be collected by the police to place at the 
grave of Harvey and Rosie at a later time' 

The family also thanked emergency services and said they were overwhelmed' by the support they had received from friends and neighbours.

Hundreds of people have donated clothes, household items and money since the blaze.

The Gunn family, who live in Bishopsteignton, said Rosie was 'the love of Andy's life'.

The family of Andrew, who was staying with his Rosie on the night of the fire, said his death has left 'a void in the lives' of his friends and family and said he leaves behind 'devastated and grieving parents'

They said: 'He
had his whole life in front of him. He lived in Bishopsteignton, a 
village he loved, and worked in the village at the Cockhaven Manor Hotel
where they considered him "family".

'He will be missed by so many and 
leaves behind devastated and grieving parents, an older brother, and 
many friends who have a void in their lives from this loss.'

Seven members of the Bennellick family were living in the terraced council house in Lee Close, Honiton, and Andy was the eighth 
person in the house at the time of the fire.

Andrew, Rosie and Harvey were all airlifted to hospital after being freed at about 7.50am.

The 
victims appeared to have been trapped in two upstairs bedrooms. A burned
out bunk bed could be seen through the blackened windows.

Rosie and Harvey's father and a six-year-old boy were treated for smoke inhalation at an Exeter hospital.

Their father had raced back into the house 
to try and save the trapped victims.

An
emergency 999 worker said police are looking into whether the fire was started by a lighter.

They said: 'It appears that a child playing with a 
cigarette lighter may have started the fire. It was a total accident but
this is an important line of inquiry.'

Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: 'With regard to the fire start, we cannot discuss the cause at this time.' But the force said the cause was accidental.

An inquest is due to be opened into their deaths later.
