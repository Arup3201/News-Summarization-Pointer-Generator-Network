St Helens' Australian scrum-half Luke Walsh has been ruled out for four to five months with a broken leg.

The 27-year-old spent two nights in hospital after sustaining the injury in the first half of last Friday's 44-22 win over Widnes and has already undergone surgery.

Although Walsh's first season in Super League has been cut short, the injury was not as serious as initially feared.

Down and out: Australian scrum-half Walsh will miss the next four of five months after undergoing surgery

'He's basically snapped his fibula,' St Helens coach Nathan Brown said. 'He's had surgery with the plate and bolts and all the type of things that go in and he'll be out for four or five months.

'It was as good a result as you could expect. It could have been worse.'

The loss of Walsh is still a body blow to the Super League leaders, who are just two points ahead of Leeds going into the last five games of the regular season. 

Brown has the option of switching skipper Paul Wellens into a playmaking role, especially with former Hull full-back Shannon McDonnell available to make his debut, but he is set to start Friday's game at Hull with Jordan Turner and Gary Wheeler after they finished the Widnes match at half-back.

'At the moment that would appear to be our best, most stable, option,' Brown said.

'They both played there last week. Gary has played a number of games earlier in the year in that position and Jordan has filled in a couple of times this year and done a great job. He's also played there a number of times for Hull.'
