There was only one present Daniel Tennant wanted for Christmas this year.

The brave tot has just been given a new hand for Christmas - after being born without fully formed arms or hands.

It means that little Daniel, five, can now open his Christmas presents and pull crackers with his mother Stephanie, 29.

Stephanie who lives in Bathgate, West Lothian, said: ‘We are going to have a wonderful Christmas this year.

‘Daniel is thrilled with his new hand. He can’t stop smiling. It means that he can do so much more now that he can grip things like his presents and pull crackers too.

The youngster was born without fully formed arms or legs, but preferred to live without the prosthetic arm he had fitted at six months

'He is so excited for Christmas now he’s got his new hand.’

It wasn’t until he was born that Stephanie realised there was anything wrong with Daniel. 

Nothing had been picked up during her pregnancy scans and it was only when he was born that she was told that there was a problem with the development of his arms.

She said: ‘It was a massive shock to me when I found out. My mum and aunty were in the delivery room at the hospital with me and I saw the shock on my aunt’s face when she saw him for the first time.

‘Then the midwife told me that he was perfect, but there were some problems with his arms. I could see that his left arm stopped above the elbow and he only had a very small arm on his right side. 

‘There was no explanation for why it had happened in the womb, I was told it was just one of those things. But it was a massive shock to me as I hadn’t imagined anything would be wrong with him.’

Daniel had a prosthetic arm fitted at six months old, to help him balance when he crawled, but he preferred to try without it.

Stephanie, who is single, said: ‘He never used his prosthetic arm that he had when he was a baby, and he managed fine without it. He learnt to crawl and walk and he would also pick things up like a ball by balancing it between his two stumps.

Doctors at Edinburgh's Astley Ainslie Hospital made Daniel a new hand with fingers that open and close and it was fitted last month, just in time for Christmas

Daniel's mother Stephanie said: 'It really is the best present that Daniel could ever have wished for'

‘When he was a baby he just played with his plastic arm just like he would do a toy, then as he grew into a toddler he ignored it.

‘He never needed anything else, he just adapted to doing things without any proper hands. But then a few months ago he started to say that he really wanted a hand with five fingers, just like everyone else.

‘He started school in September and he just wanted to be like the other children.’

So Stephanie took him to the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh and doctors made him a prosthetic hand with fingers that opened and closed.

He was fitted for the prosthetic arm and it was finally ready earlier this month - just in time for Christmas.

Stephanie, who is supported by REACH, a charity that helps children with upper limb deformities, said: ‘It really is the best present that Daniel could ever have wished for. 

'He was thrilled when he tried on his new hand for the first time, and could pick things up properly. He is able to pick his toys up for the first time too. It has given him so much more independence and confidence.

‘He has always managed really well, but now he can feel more like the other children now that he’s got his new hand. 

'It was wonderful to see him being able to pull Christmas crackers for the first time this year. It’s something that I never thought I’d be able to see.’
