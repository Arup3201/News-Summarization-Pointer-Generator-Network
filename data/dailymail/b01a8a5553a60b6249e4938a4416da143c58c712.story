More witnesses in the death of Trayvon Martin have changed their stories about what happened on the night he was shot dead by George Zimmerman in a gated community in Florida.

At least four key witnesses have changed their story and more may come forward as the case moves closer to trial, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

A report from the paper comes after state prosecutors released about half the evidence they have in their second-degree murder case against Zimmerman, 28.

Final picture: As part of the ongoing court preparations, George Zimmerman's team submitted photos last week of Trayvon caught on the convenience store's camera

In his favor: Public opinion has shifted so that now 40 per cent of Americans believe George Zimmerman acted in self defense, which is up from only 15 per cent who believe such in March

The witnesses - who are only identified by numbers - first made statements to the Sanford Police on or close to the night of February 26. Later, around mid-March, they had to repeat their statements to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and state prosecutors.

Three of the witnesses altered what they thought had happened. One changed her story completely.

Witness two - a young woman who lives in the Retreat at Twin Lakes community, where Trayvon was shot - was interviewed three times and each time her account was different.

She did not have her contact lenses in at the time but said she saw two men running and then a fist fight. The second time she said she saw two men standing ten feet apart.

When she was interviewed the final time, by an FDLE agent, she said she saw just one person running away and could not tell if it was a man or woman, black or white.

Witness six - a man who lived at a home a few feet away from where Trayvon was shot - first told police he saw the teen on top of Zimmerman and said he was raining punches down on him 'mixed martial arts-style'. He also said Zimmerman was yelling for help.

Weeks later however, he said, he was not sure who was yelling for help or if Tryavon was punching him or simply pinning him to the ground.

The only thing he was sure of was that the teenager was on top.

Witness 12 - a young mother from the same community - told police she saw two figures on the ground but was not sure who was on top.

But at the end of March she said she was sure it was Zimmerman on top as she recognized his shape and build from seeing him on the TV.

Witness 13 - another man who lived close by - did not see the altercation between the pair but gave an account of Zimmerman's demeanor when he spoke to him after he heard the gun shot fire.

He said he came out to see the neighborhood watchman with blood on the back of his head and a body next to him.

The 28-year-old said Trayvon had been 'beating up on me, so I had to shoot him'. Then he asked him to call his wife to let her know.

Weeks later he described Zimmernman's tone as being 'no big deal'.

'It wasn't like, "I can't believe I shot someone", but just, "tell my wife", like it was nothing,' the witness said.

All the witnesses will likely be interviewed again before the trial starts.

Surrounding area: In the weeks and months following the February 26 altercation, many neighbors have given their stories as witnesses

Difficult to tell: Some witnesses said that the dark night made it difficult to tell who was straddling whom

Their changes reflect a softening view of Trayvon Martin, likely due to the massive media attention the case has received, and the fact they have become aware of the circumstances around what they saw at the time of the attack.

The changing opinions of both the public and the key witnesses in the case confirm that the trial of the teen's killer will be constantly evolving.

A new poll says that public opinion is shifting as 40 per cent Americans believe that the unarmed 17-year-old was killed in self defense.

That number shows a significant jump up from only 15 per cent of people siding with Zimmerman's version of events when asked in March when the attack sparked a national firestorm.

According to theÂ Rasmussen Report released yesterday, only 24 per cent say the fatal incident was murder, denoting a decrease since the last poll when 33 per cent believed that to be the case in March.

Regardless, Zimmerman was been charged with second-degree murder and his trial will unfold in the coming months as he waived his right to a speedy trial in an effort to guarantee that his legal team can be fully prepared when it does go to court.

Preparations: Both sides are submitting evidence in the coming days as Zimmerman is in hiding

While Zimmerman's lawyers entered in their extensive list of witnesses and evidence last week, the specifics of the witness changes came as a preview of the evidence due to be used by the prosecution.

Special prosecutor Angela Corey turned a eight-page document to the Seminole County clerk on Monday which spelled out the changed testimony.
