TV presenter Paula Yates had a mission for a long time to 'get' Michael Hutchence and he could not get out of her web, a former member of the rock band INXS said today.

Speaking on Australian television, the band's guitarist and saxaphonist Kirk Pengilly joined with other members of the band in telling how Hutchence changed after being punched to the ground while out with model girlfriend Helena Christensen.

He lost his sense of taste and smell, said bassist Garry Gary Beers, but it was Hutchence's relationship with Miss Yates that changed him dramatically.

Mr Pengilly revealed what he said had been a secret he had kept for all the years since Hutchence had died at the age of 37 in 1997.

'Just prior to his death, about a week or so, what he told me he had a plan in place to basically split up with Paula and so, what can I say?

'That's what he told me. I don't know, it's all very personal stuff, I don't want to dwell on it.'

Tim Farris, guitarist, told the Channel Seven TV network how Hutchence took a swing at him on one occasion after he and Miss Yates had a daughter, Tiger Lily.

As they told of their shock at the 
death of Hutchence in a Sydney hotel room after he had had dinner with 
his father and stepmother, Pengilly recalled a strange dream he had had.

'I
 was in a field, it was moonlight and Michael came to me as an owl and 
said "Everything's fine, I'm finally free, don't worry, I'm happy."'
