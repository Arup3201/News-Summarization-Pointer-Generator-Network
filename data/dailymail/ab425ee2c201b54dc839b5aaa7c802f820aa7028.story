DMG Media, the global media brand which owns DailyMail.com, today announced that it has acquired US-based news website Elite Daily.

The online publication, which boasts 74 million monthly unique browsers around the world, was founded in 2012 and has since become one of the world's leading news websites for millennials - people aged between 18 and 34.

‘We are delighted to announce this deal. Elite Daily has a unique and engaging voice on a diverse range of topics and we expect them to be the perfect complement to DailyMail.com,’ Martin Clarke, Publisher and Editor in Chief of DailyMail.com, said of the announcement.

Jon Steinberg, CEO Daily Mail North America added: ‘This gives us the opportunity to invest in and grow two different but complementary media brands which together will have a reach that few can match.’

With more than 70 per cent of its audience aged between 18 and 34, Elite Daily offers a host of unique and innovative content which is specifically targeted at the younger generation, a group that is so sought-after by advertisers. 

Meanwhile, DailyMail.com, the world's largest English language newspaper website, is read by 19.3 million American millennials every month, meaning that more than half of the country's 18 to 34 year old visit at least one of the two sites each month.

David Arabov, Chief Executive Officer of Elite Daily said: ‘We’re excited about joining the DMG Media family. 

'This is the next step in our development as a media company for and by millennials and will position us to deliver millennials the content they desire on an international scale.’ 

Social media success: Earlier this week, DailyMail.com was unveiled as one of 11 media brands to partner with messaging app Snapchat on its newly-launched Discover feature

Mr. Clarke noted that the two editorial teams would remain entirely separate to allow for the brands to continue developing their own unique voices, however added that there would be plenty of collaboration between the two sites.

The news comes just days after DailyMail.com was unveiled as one of 11 media brands to be signed up to partner with messaging app Snapchat on its new Discover feature, which allows users to access a selection of the world's top stories with just one swipe on their smartphones.

The app's new feature, which launched on Tuesday, features 12 unique news channels, one for each media partner, plus a dedicated Snapchat channel which will include original content from the app's creators. 

All of the app's media partners will handpick up to 15 different news stories and videos to feature on their own channels every day.

'Every day DailyMail.com will offer Snapchat users 10-15 of its best news stories,' Mr. Clarke said of the company's channel.

‘Stories are either full length articles or the best video stories of the day. It will encompass a collection of breaking news, showbiz, lifestyle and all of the stories that DailyMail.com is famous for.’
