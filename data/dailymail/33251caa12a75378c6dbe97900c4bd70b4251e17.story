The BBC is spending up to £500,000 on a major refit of its £1 billion new headquarters because staff have complained their state-of-the art surroundings ‘lack character’.

The high-spec London HQ was only opened in June – four years behind schedule and £55 million over budget.

But the Corporation has already decided to revamp two floors of New Broadcasting House to make them ‘more creative and vibrant’ – following a string of gripes from staff. Critics have branded the move a ‘ludicrous’ use of the licence fee.

The BBC is set to spend £500,000 revamping two floors of New Broadcasting House just six months after the new building was opened £55million over budget in June. It comes after staff complained their surroundings 'lacked character'

Among the more bizarre innovations will be internal road signs based on past and present BBC programmes to help staff find their way around their departments. Dubbed ‘wayfinders’, the signs include Who Do You Think You Arcade, Little Britain’s Passage, EastEnders Common, Goodness Gracious Mead, Have I Got Mews and The Great British Bake Wharf.

The costly interior design revamp will also include new floor coverings, the introduction of ‘a new collaboration project zone’, new meeting areas, ‘break-out furniture’ and revamped dressing room doors.

Danny Cohen, the BBC’s £327,000-a-year director of television, has defended the changes, which he admits were prompted by staff complaints.

In an email to workers, he wrote: ‘Over the next few months, we are planning some design changes on the sixth and seventh floors of New Broadcasting House.

‘We have decided to make these changes in response to strong feedback from television staff that the floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character. It was something people felt particularly strongly about when we moved in.’

In his message, Mr Cohen pays tribute to a committee of staff volunteers drawn from both floors who came up with a list of ‘reasonably costed’ improvements.

New 'wayfinders' in the form of London road signs will help guide staff through the new state-of-the-art building. They are part of £500,000 plans to make the building 'more creative and vibrant'

The sixth floor, currently home to some of the BBC’s most senior staff, including Charlotte Moore, the £244,000-a-year controller  of BBC 1, and Janice Hadlow,  the £235,000-a-year head of  BBC 2, is to be rebranded in line with the theme ‘Welcome to the world of television’.

Seating areas will have existing backdrops replaced with new ones featuring iconic BBC logos and programmes. Other changes for the floor include ‘feature seating’,  a ceiling-suspended lighting rig, new fabric wrap panels for a meeting room and a series of ‘magnetic glass boards’.

The seventh floor, home to Ben Stephenson, the £247,000-a-year drama commissioning controller, and Christine Langan, the £176,000-a-year head of BBC Films, will include a streetscape called The Street.

Its design will include bus-stop-type structures, new soft seating, railings, planters, an EastEnders Albert Square street sign and a pub window that wouldn’t look out of place in the flagship soap.

One design expert who has worked on similar schemes said the work was likely to cost in the region of £500,000. He added: ‘It’s projects like this where the costs really start to rack up.’ But a BBC source claimed the work could be implemented for £100,000.

Both Labour and Tory MPs last night criticised the revamp as unjustifiable during hard economic times. John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘It seems extraordinary that the BBC can spend money on things like this at a time when it says its services and programme budgets are under threat.’

Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘None of us get everything right when we move into a new building, but spending money on what sound like questionable improvements is inappropriate when money is tight.’

And Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘I think this is ludicrous. It proves the BBC has still got far too much money to spend.’

A BBC spokesman said the changes were cosmetic and that the revamp was confined to communal areas. He said the floors had originally been designed for World Service and news staff who had been relocated elsewhere.

He added: ‘The BBC must ensure it continues to produce fantastic television programmes for licence-fee-payers so some changes are being made to create the most effective working environment possible for staff.’
