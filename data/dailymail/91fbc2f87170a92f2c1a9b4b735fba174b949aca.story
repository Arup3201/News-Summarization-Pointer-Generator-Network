They are esteemed badges of honour to commemorate a building where important people throughout history lived and worked.

And the London blue plaques scheme – administered by English Heritage since 1986 – has been running for nearly 150 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world.

But English Heritage has come under fire for choosing a blue plaques panel of celebrity ‘white men off the telly’, prompting a slew of resignations from the existing panel.

The new panel, which is responsible 
for selecting the historical figures to be honoured with the famous 
plaques, now boasts the likes of arts council chair Sir Peter 
Bazalgette, who brought Big Brother to the UK; FA chairman Greg Dyke; 
broadcaster and art dealer Philip Mould; scientist and TV presenter 
professor Lord (Robert) Winston; TV host and physicist Professor Brian 
Cox and banker Rupert Hambro.

These
 appointments saw two existing members of the panel, David Edgerton, 
professor of the history of science and technology at King’s College, 
London, and architectural journalist Gillian Darley, quit three weeks 
ago.

Professor Edgerton slammed the new appointments and told The Observer: ‘Instead of a blue plaques panel, English Heritage are creating a white-men-off-the-telly panel, with a banker added.

‘It
 is hardly expert, especially in history, and is not representative. 
Such a panel may wish to fund its own plaque scheme, but it should not 
call itself the blue plaques panel, nor should a scheme advised by such a
 panel be in receipt of public money.

‘People are not so dumb that they want their blue plaques decided on by people they might have seen on television.’

Professor Edgerton had been a member of the panel for six years – yet only discovered the new appointments when reading the addressees of the agenda to the next meeting.

He said he feared the appointments had been made purely to encourage donations, adding: ‘English Heritage is the custodian of the blue plaques panel, not its owner.

‘Proposers, supporters and the public will rightly expect the blue plaques panel to be expert, particularly in history.

‘They will also expect it to be representative so that plaques are awarded to people distinguished in all fields, including those currently under-represented.’

The new blue plaque panel appointments have also been condemned for being entirely male.

Ms Darley said she was appalled by the lack of females on the panel and said: ‘The appointments are all male and, with the exception of Brian Cox, they are all over 60.

‘And the other point is that they are all busy people. I doubt they will find time to scrutinise these decisions.

‘Bonnie Greer was appointed to the panel last year and they make a lot of that. But, well, let’s just say her attendance record hasn’t been very good. I’ve met her. Once.’

Professor Edgerton and Ms Darley were asked whether they wished to assist in the appointment of their replacements, but declined.

In a letter to Professor Ronald Hutton, chairman of the panel, Professor Edgerton said: ‘I don’t feel able to recommend anyone, nor indeed to recommend that anyone accept an invitation to serve.

‘I am sorry to be blunt, but English Heritage have clearly made up their mind what panel they want, and have got it.’

Last year the funding for the blue plaque panel was suspended after government cash was slashed, and its support staff was reduced by 30 per cent.

A spokesman for English Heritage said further appointments were being made, including that of Professor Martin Daunton, master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

He told the Observer: ‘We were disappointed to receive the resignations of two blue plaque panel members.

‘We are confident that, once complete, the panel will represent the full range of in-depth knowledge and expertise required to consider all the different blue plaque nominations.’
