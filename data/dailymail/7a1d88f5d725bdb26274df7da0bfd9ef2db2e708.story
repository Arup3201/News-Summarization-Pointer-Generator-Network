She's been the victim of a campaign of Twitter abuse. But trolls beware, MP Stella Creasy seems to be showing  her followers she has her own Dark Side.

The Labour MP for Walthamstow has posted a Twitter profile picture featuring her as a female version of  Star Wars’ Boba Fett, a ruthless henchman hired by Darth  Vader.

The painting is the work of the MP’s brother, academic Matthew Creasy.

Miss Creasy, who is widely tipped to be Labour’s first female Prime Minister, was subjected to a barrage of Twitter abuse last year after she backed a high-profile social media campaign to feature  Jane Austen on £10 notes.

She was bombarded with tweets branding her a witch and threatening to rape her.

She also suffered a slew  of abusive messages from an employee of  payday loan firm Wonga, after she called for a crackdown on ‘legal loan sharks’.

Despite this, Miss Creasy remains a compulsive Twitter user, with more than 48,000 followers, and more than 44,000 tweets.

She sometimes uses the hashtag #labourfriendsofstarwars and regularly alludes to the cult films in her tweets.

Her brother originally put the picture on her birthday card  this April, posting a picture of  it on his Twitter page with the caption: ‘Happy birthday @stella creasy! #proudbigbrother.’

Although the exact reasoning behind her change in profile picture is not known, Miss Creasy’s office said Boba Fett was a ‘no-nonsense’ character, and suggested ‘that might be  the message that she’s trying to put across’
