A husband was shot and killed by his wife just minutes after he was released from jail following an arrest for domestic violence. 

Robert Vann Marshall, 34, was arrested on Saturday morning after he allegedly threatened to kill his wife and children.

He was found by police at a motel in Athens, Tennessee with a gun and an array of drugs.

Violent end: Robert Vann Marshall, 34, was shot dead by his wife 15 minutes after he was released from a Tennessee jail after being held over domestic abuse

A few hours later, Marshall was released from jail at 1.27pm with a restraining order to prevent him from going near his family.

Ten minutes later, police received a 911 call from Marshall's wife claiming that he was trying to break into the home and could be armed.

McMinn County Sheriff Joe Guy told WRCB: 'She retreated into the back bedroom, and at some point fired a shot and he was killed.'

The sheriff added that the woman will not be charged because she acted in self-defense. The district attorney is currently deciding whether the case will face a grand jury.

Family tragedy: MailOnline has chosen not to identify the woman who shot her husband dead when he returned to their home, ignoring a restraining order

Pain: The woman, who filed a restraining order, posted pictures of her bruises online

Anguish: The woman has not been charged by police as she is believed to be a domestic abuse victim

Police rushed to the home where they 
found Marshall and his wife who admitted that she had fired a gun at 
him. Her name is being withheld because is a presumed victim of domestic abuse.

The
sheriff described the protective order as 'just a piece of paper' which
some will choose to ignore but urged all women subject to domestic 
abuse to file one. 

Marshall's wife's Facebook page gave an insight into the couple's home life. She had posted pictures of bruises and cuts which she claims were caused by her husband.

An autopsy on Marshall has been scheduled and the investigation is ongoing.

Rash decision: The husband had been held at the McMinn County jail and was told not to go near his wife but ignored the restraining order

Threatened: Minutes after he was released from jail, Marshall returned to his family home where his wife is believed to have shot him in self-defense
