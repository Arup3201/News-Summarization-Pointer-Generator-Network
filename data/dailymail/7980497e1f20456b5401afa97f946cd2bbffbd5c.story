A former private schoolboy who admitted taking potshots at children with a BB gun has had his sentencing delayed for seven months because he is going to Fiji on holiday.

Jack Hewitt, 17, fired at primary school pupils in Edinburgh as they played last May and told police he 'was letting off steam' during exams.

Several of the children, aged between eight and ten, were shot with pellets and one girl was struck on the forehead and another was hit just below the eye.

Others had red marks and bruising on their arms, legs, stomach and heads.

Off on his hols: Teenage gunman Jack Hewitt arrives at court with his father Grant for his sentencing today, which was deferred for seven months so he can go on a gap year break to Fiji

Admission: The 17-year-old said he fired at primary school pupils to 'let off steam' during his exams

But the former pupil at £10,000 a year George Watson's College in Edinburgh, who pleaded guilty to the shooting, had his sentencing adjourned in January so he could complete his  Scottish Higher exams.

And today at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Sheriff Isobel McColl delayed it again, for seven months, and said it will now take place in February 2015.

She wanted to defer it for six months because she felt sentencing would be 'premature' now, and extended it to seven months after learning he was off on his gap year break to the south Pacific.

The teenager is now free to fly to Fiji in September and won't return until the new year.

The Scottish Conservatives have today criticised the decision, saying it sent out the 'wrong message' to the public.

The party's justice spokeswoman, Margaret Mitchell MSP, said: 'This latest deferral sends out completely the wrong message.

'The public will be mystified and alarmed that there has still not been an official sentence handed down for the crime committed.

'The parents of children who suffered as a result of this incident will also rightly be angered by a further delay.

'Rather than allowing a gap year holiday in Fiji, the Criminal Justice System should be dealing with this case, as opposed to bending over backwards to accommodate the perpetrator.'

Victim: This ten-year-old, who cannot be named, was shot in the arm, right. His friends were also shot in the head and body

Prestigious: Hewitt was a student at the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and first had his sentencing delays so he could take his Scottish Highers

Anger: Critics have said the 'public will be mystified and alarmed' that the boy, right, remains unsentenced

Hewitt, who has left Watson's, is taking a gap year, part of which involves travelling to the South Pacific.

The prolific social media user recently revealed he had been on holiday in Lanzarote, and was at T in The Park at the weekend.

In December last year Hewitt pled guilty to 'culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm'.

He shot at and hit a group of young children who were playing in the grounds of Gilmerton Primary School during their lunch break.

One parent described the January decision to defer sentence as a 'joke'.

At the hearing earlier this year, the court was told that Hewitt had accepted responsibility for his actions.

Police visited Hewitt's home following the incident last year. Officers said that a tearful Hewitt had admitted opening fire from the bathroom window but was unable to explain why he had done something 'so stupid.'

Hewitt told the police at the station: 'That was me. I was just letting off some steam. I'll never do it again.'
