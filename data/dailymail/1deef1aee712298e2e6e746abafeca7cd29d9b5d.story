Barcelona frontman Luis Suarez made a triumphant return to England on Tuesday night and appeared keen to look back on his career during his flight home to Spain.

The former Liverpool star scored twice in Barcelona's 2-1 Champions League victory over Manchester City and was later pictured at Manchester airport with a copy of 'Luis Suarez - La Fuerza de un sueno', which translates into 'Luis Suarez - The strength of a dream', in his hand.

The book, written by Antonio Fuentes, features anecdotes on Suarez's rise from playing in the streets of Salto, Uruguay, with his brother Paolo, to becoming one of the best attackers in the world.

Suarez netted a brace to give the Catalan giants the advantage in the last-16 tie against City and reminded English football fans of the all-action displays which lit up the Premier League last season and saw Liverpool push Manuel Pellegrini's side all the way in the title race.

The frontman, part of Barcelona's fearsome trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar following his £75million summer switch from Anfield, opened the scoring on 16 minutes as he fired a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Joe Hart after the ball had landed kindly for him in the box.

Suarez doubled the lead for Luis Enrique's side on the half-hour mark, sliding in to convert Jordi Alba's left-wing cross before Sergio Aguero replied in the second half for the hosts with 20 minutes to go.

The Uruguay international now has nine goals and 12 assists to his name during his first season at the Nou Camp.
