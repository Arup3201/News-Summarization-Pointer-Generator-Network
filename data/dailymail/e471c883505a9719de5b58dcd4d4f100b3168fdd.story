Raheem Sterling was '100 per cent entitled' to have a night out on his return from England duty, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says.

Sterling came under fire when it was revealed the 19-year-old hit Carnaby Street nightclub Cirque le Soir with England team-mates Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain until 3am the day after he told national team boss Roy Hodgson he was too tired to start against Estonia in Tallinn. 

But following Liverpool's 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday night, Rodgers emphatically defended his star winger.

'I think for Raheem it's obviously just important he focuses on his football - it's unfortunate, six days before a game when he's on a day off can't go out,' he said.

'It's obviously a story for some, but if you read it carefully, then there's not a story in it.

'100 per cent it was a night out he was entitled to have, yes.'

Rodgers also praised Sterling's performance against Real as his side were comprehensively outplayed by the Champions League Group B leaders.

'He was terrific tonight, and he goes about his work really well. With his rise he'll learn maybe people want to knock you, but he's focused on his work,' Rodgers said.

Hodgson also backed Sterling on Wednesday night when talking to students at Cambridge University.

'With young Raheem Sterling this week, it guts me to see that sort of treatment,' Hodgson said. 'It's totally unfair and totally wrong.

'It's suiting people's agendas. But, you know, he'll be stronger for it. 'Is that right? Of course it's not right! But I can't turn the clock back, I'm living in 2014, I can't go back to Downton Abbey!'

The England mentor added there have been no arguments with Rodgers despite clashes over Sterling and the Reds' striker Daniel Sturridge, who was injured on international duty.

'There is no tension with Brendan,' Hodgson said during a talk about his philosophy of leadership. 'We get on very well. I've been very fortunate that, in two and a half years I've not had a single situation where a manager has tried to drag a player out of the team, or told me that they don't want their players to take part.

'Brendan and I have always got on very very well since he took the job at Liverpool, so there's no problem at all.'
