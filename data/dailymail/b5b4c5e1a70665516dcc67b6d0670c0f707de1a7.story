Lyft operators hit the beach and burned their pink mustaches in protest of the company after it cut rates in September.

Southern California drivers claimed that some were already struggling to make minimum wage before the company dropped fares a third time make rides more affordable for consumers.

Vice was in Southern California with the organizers, who brought the mustaches they hang on the front of their cars in order to burn them in protest.

Fiery: Lyft drivers removed the pink mustaches from their cars and tossed them in a bonfire aimed at protesting recent fare cuts

In spite of protesters toting pizza and beer, the mood on the beach was dour.

The drivers, who did not share their names with Vice, admitted that most of those who still worked with Lyft were also driving for Uber on the side as a way to make a living.

Some were hoping that with the situation deteriorating, Uber would acquire Lyft, believing that the bigger ride-sharing startup would raise wages once their competitor was swallowed up. 

What appealed to many riders was the culture at Lyft, which used the slogan 'your friend with a car' and encouraged to socialize with passengers.

'Lyft is a real community — with both the drivers and riders being inherently social — making real friendships and saving money,' Scott Weiss, a partner at venture capital investors Andreessen Horowitz, once wrote.

Driver frustration with the company blew up late last month when another fare cut was announced via email.

'To keep phones buzzing with requests, we're testing 10% lower prices in Los Angeles starting today,' the message read.

Many drivers had started on a guaranteed rate of $18 an hour, which converted over to a commission split with Lyft after a few months. Drivers have lately seen their fares cut to levels that made it difficult to earn minimum wage.

So the drivers toted their shaggy, pink mustaches to the beach, set a fire pit ablaze with lighter fluid and torched a few symbolic 'staches.

The protest comes at a time of a backlash against ride-sharing companies. 

The Chronicle reported that Lyft Plus drivers were lured by the promise of high returns to buy $34,000 luxury SUVs before the company scaled back the program, angering operators.

The last year has also seen drivers protest against Uber in New York, San Francisco and Santa Monica.
