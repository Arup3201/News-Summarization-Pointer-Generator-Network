A transgender goth singer known as the 'Black Madam' accused of injecting a fatal dose of silicone into a dancer's buttocks before sealing the wounds with super glue, has broken her silence.

Padge Victoria Windslowe said she felt remorse over the death of 20-year-old Claudia Seye Aderotimi, but shouldn't be charged with murder because she only wanted to help people at her 'pumping parties'.

'The Philadelphia District Attorney's 
Office would like to promote [the] thought that it was greed, 
recklessness and malice that fueled my conduct,' the 42-year-old wrote in a letter sent to Philadelphia's Daily News.

'However,
 I swear that my aim was noble in nature. I simply really just loved the
 feeling of ... helping others feel more beautiful, wonderful and 
magical about themselves - just as someone once helped me.'

Windslowe, from West Philadelphia, also revealed that she rejected a plea deal to serve 15 to 30 years in prison for third-degree murder. The maximum sentence for that crime is 20 to 40 years.

She instead offered to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and serve the maximum sentence of 2.5 to five years.

In a letter to D.A. Seth Williams obtained by Daily News, the hip-hop artist wrote that pleading guilty would allow her to honor Aderotimi's memory and avoid a trial.

'Please let us amicably put this case to rest without any more negative press and media attention on our city ... which a trial like this would bring,' Windslowe, who was born male, wrote.

According to the District Attorney's Office, Windslowe held a 'pumping party' in a hotel room near Philadelphia 
International Airport in February 2011, during which she injected silicone into 
Aderotimi's buttocks for free.

Windslowe, who does not have an injecting license, then allegedly closed the wounds with glue and cotton balls.

When Aderotimi, a British citizen, complained of chest 
pains, Windslowe allegedly told her to drink more fluids and to call an 
ambulance if needed, before leaving the party.

Aderotimi, an exotic dancer,
 died a short time later of a pulmonary embolism which, law-enforcement 
officials say, was caused by Windslowe's 
silicone.

The musician, whose videos and interviews can be viewed on YouTube, was charged with third-degree murder in July 2012 after a lengthy investigation involving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

By that time she was already in custody, having been charged with 
aggravated assault for a silicone butt injection that gravely injured a 
23-year-old woman in February 2012.

The woman was allegedly coughing up blood and was also treated for a blocked artery in her lung at Temple University Hospital.

Police believed Windslowe had performed at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations and using different names to avoid detection.

At the time of her 2012 arrest, DA Seth Williams said Windslowe was arrogant and greedy.

'Her conduct cost one young woman her 
life and placed countless others in danger,' he said.

'The defendant put
 her own greed above the public's health and safety, and instead of 
being remorseful she bragged about prospective clients.'

Windslowe's  court-appointed defense lawyer said it was 'grossly inappropriate' for his client to have contacted Daily News, but echoed her claims that she did not commit murder.

'The commonwealth, by filing a 
third-degree-murder charge, is claiming there's malice. The defense will
 claim that there isn't malice. That's for a jury to determine,' David S. Rudenstein said.

Windslowe's trial is scheduled for February 17, 2015.
