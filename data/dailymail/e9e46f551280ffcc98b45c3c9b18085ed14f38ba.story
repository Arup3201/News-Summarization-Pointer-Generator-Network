Glamorous in a tailored grey suit and beige silk shirt, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the professional as she toured a tourism fair - even when confronted by a man in fancy dress.

The Spanish royal, 42, was visiting the FITUR International Tourism Fair in Madrid when a well-wisher in a grey robe approached, brandishing a map.

Ever composed, Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrates his 47th birthday on Friday, smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on.

Interesting choice! A well-wisher in fancy dress approached the Spanish royals during a visit in Madrid

Today's visit is the latest in a busy week for the Spanish royal couple, with Letizia yesterday attending the board meeting of FEDER, the Spanish Federation of Rare Diseases.

Despite the serious subject matter, the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left.

The meeting with FEDER was a bit of a departure for Letizia who, until now, has focused her efforts on championing Spanish culture and the plight of disabled people, although latterly, health has become something of a preoccupation.

Last week, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president.

Come to Spain: Felipe made a speech at the event, which hopes to showcase the many beauties of Spain

A day later and she was back on the cultural beat, joining husband King Felipe for the opening of a museum in Pamplona.

During the couple's tour of Museum of the University of Navarra, they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of Spanish greats, among them Pablo Picasso.

Letizia's latest meeting comes shortly after the Spanish royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king Juan Carlos has come forward.

Ingrid Sartiau, 47, has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the Spanish Supreme Court - if she can prove her story is true.

No car: She was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard

According to Ms Sartiau, she is the product of a three-night liaison between her mother Liliane, a Belgian governess, and the now 76-year-old royal in 1966. 

Although by then a married 28-year-old father of two, an affair would hardly have been out of character for Juan-Carlos.

Throughout his marriage 'Don Juan' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women, including an alleged affair with Princess Diana while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986.

Ms Sartiau herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years, only being told his name in 2011.

Although Spanish courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests, Juan-Carlos' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt. 

Concerned: Letizia has been championing an increasing number of health related causes in recent weeks 

Looking cool: Letizia donned a pair of stylish aviator sunglasses as she made her exit
