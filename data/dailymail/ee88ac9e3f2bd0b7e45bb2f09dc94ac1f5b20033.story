Two vets 150 miles apart told of shocking animal abuse cases today which saw one kitten hurled from a car window and two more abandoned in a bush.

Ten-week-old Hammond had to have his face stitched together and smashed teeth removed after being thrown from a vehicle near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire.

And in South Shields, South Tyneside, Raymond and Wonder may never see again after being abandoned and developing a severe eye infection.

Shocking: Ten-week-old kitten Hammond was thrown from a moving car last week in one of two horrific cases

Horror: In a separate case also revealed by vets today, siblings Raymond and Wonder could lose their sight

The haunting cases, both revealed today, prompted fresh warnings to animal owners never to abandon their pets - and even to burden charities and kennels with them instead.

The two cases were also revealed today alongside that of Matt the Cat, a moggy so neglected he had to be completely shaved and have his rotting teeth removed in Kilburn High Road, north London.

In the first case, vets have revealed photos of ten-week-old kitten Hammond after he had to have his face stitched together.

The black cat suffered deep cuts to his nose and shattered teeth after being thrown from the window of a moving car on the A46 last week near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire.

He underwent painstaking surgery to remove all his broken teeth, including two canines that had been pushed into his jaw.  

It is thought the people in the car he was thrown from had hoped the vehicle behind would run him over.

Injured: It is believed Hammond's owners intended the car behind them to run him over. Instead, the driver swerved in time, picked the cat off the road and rushed with it covered in blood to the nearest vet's surgery

Vet Laura Morrell said: 'His nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered on impact'

Instead the driver collected Hammond from the roadside before taking him to the rescue centre, covered in blood. 

Laura Morrell, assistant manager at the Ark Animal Rescue Centre in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire, said: 'His face was in a really bad way.

'His nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered upon impact with the road.

'He’s a very lucky boy though. If the car behind had not swerved he would have gone straight under their wheels.

'Thankfully he has recovered well from both operations. It’s nice to know that, in a world where such devastating animal cruelty exists, there are still so many animal lovers out there.'

Hammond's plight was so desperate that he has already been adopted - but the rescue centre still needs more information to bring a prosecution against his attackers.

In the second case, meanwhile, three-month-olds Raymond and Wonder may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in South Shields, South Tyneside.

Looking for a home: In a second case revealed today, three-month-old siblings Raymond and Wonder may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in South Shields, South Tyneside

Vet Suzanne Hickmott said: 'They are beautiful. Wonder is likely to lose both eyes, and Raymond will lose one'

The kitten siblings were discovered cowering in a bush by dog walkers and are now looking for a new home, despite having severe eye infections.

Suzanne Hickmott, who works at Pets 4 Vets in South Shields, South Tyneside, said: 'The kittens are now being taken care of and are being given eye drops daily. They are eating and drinking and doing quite well.

'They are beautiful little things. Wonder is likely to lose both eyes, and Raymond will lose one, but they are both affectionate, lovely and friendly animals.

'It has been very distressing for both of these animals, and now we are concentrating on getting the cats ready for the operation and then finding them a new home.'

She added: 'We are hoping that it will be a happy ending for these two now, but if they hadn’t have been found they could easily have died.

'There is never any reason to just dump an animal, as people who can’t cope can always call the RSPCA or other charities who offer shelter for cats.'
