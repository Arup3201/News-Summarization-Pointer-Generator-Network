West Ham have had problems finding Cheikhou Kouyate after he went missing on international duty in the past two days.

Kouyate is due back at the club after Senegal we're knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations.

But West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has revealed they have had issues tracking him down.

Cheikhou Kouyate (8) has been reported missing by West Ham United boss Sam Allardyce

'We've had trouble finding him,' he admitted. 'If you speak to all Premier League managers if they're honest they will tell you the same thing.

'He should be back today after we've chased him down over the last 48 hours. He could play against Liverpool.'

Allardyce and West Ham have a frosty relationship with the African side after they reported them to FIFA for not allowing Diafra Sakho to play in the tournament, citing a back injury, then letting him play back in England.

Senegal want Sakho to be banned for playing for West Ham as punishment.

But Allardyce insisted: 'We're not worried at all about him facing a ban. We've stuck to every rule and regulation in the book by FIFA, the FA and UEFA. We've not breached any rules what so ever.

'I'm extremely disappointed with Senegal's reaction.'

Allardyce said that their deal to bring Darren Fletcher to the club from Manchester United is 'still a possibility' but added: 'We're not there yet. It's not certain. It's not as if we're desperate but we'd like a quality player like Darren.'

But Allardyce dismissed reports suggesting they had made an £8million bid for Swansea's Bafatembi Gomis and that Chelsea had contacted them about the availability of Sakho and Enner Valencia, both only signed in the summer.
