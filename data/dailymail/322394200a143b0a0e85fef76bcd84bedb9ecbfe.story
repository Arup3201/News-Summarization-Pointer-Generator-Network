The father of a 12-year-old girl killed by a teenage boy has filed a lawsuit against the boy's parents for negligence.

Anthony Pasquale filed the lawsuit against the parents of his daughter Autumn's murderer, Justin Robinson, in Gloucester County Superior Court on September 23, according to NJ.com.

'If you're going to raise a murderer, you're going to take responsibility for it,' said Kathleen Bonczyk, Anthony Pasquale's attorney for the civil complaint.

Off to jail: Justin Robinson, who pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in the death of Autumn Pasquale, leaves the courtroom after being sentenced to 17 years in prison

Autumn Pasquale was brutally murdered in October in her hometown of Clayton, New Jersey,

Clues: Justin Robinson 'liked' the Facebook page set up to find Autumn despite knowing she was already dead

Pasquale claims in the lawsuit that 
Robinson's parents, Anita Saunders and Alonzo Robinson, should have 
known that their son was troubled and should have sought treatment for him.

Specifically, the lawsuit claims the parents should have been aware that their son was 
'possibly engaging in the theft of bicycles' and had been negatively 
affected by witnessing domestic abuse in their home.

Robinson,
16, was sentenced to 17 years in prison this month after pleading 
guilty to aggravated manslaughter and admitted to strangling the Clayton
Middle School student to death in October last year.

He apologized to the family and said, 'This was not supposed to happen,' as he called the killing a 'mistake.'

The New Jersey teenager had lured Autumn to his home with an offer to trade bicycle parts.

Prosecutors faced difficulties during the trial including a lack of 
physical evidence to determine whether he or his brother Dante Robinson, then 17, 
killed Autumn and they struggled for provide a motive for the killing.

Devastated: Autumn's mother and father, Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell, said their daughter was treated 'like a piece of trash'

Life cut short: Authorities found some of Autumn¿s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last seen riding when she left her West High Street home in the New Jersey town

Death
wish: Autumn Pasquale's mother Jennifer Cornwell and father Anthony 
Pasquale say they wish her murderers could be given the death penalty

Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors found the body of Autumn Pasquale in a bin just blocks from her house

The teenager will now spend the next half
of his life in prison for the crime, however he will be eligible for parole after 14½ years.

'I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen,' he told Judge Walter Marshall. 'This was all a big mistake.'

Relatives of the girl did not see it 
that way, and some wanted the judge to issue a tougher sentence than the
one agreed to in a plea agreement.

More than 8,500 people signed an 
online petition at change.org demanding a stiffer term, but Superior 
Court Judge Walter Marshall Jr. in Gloucester County accepted a plea 
deal agreement and the sentence of 17 years.

During Robinson's sentencing, family 
and friends of Autumn  — many who were hoping for a harsher sentence — 
packed one side of the courtroom.

Autumn's parents spoke of their pain since losing their daughter.

Addressing the court, Anthony Pasquale said that Robinson's sentence was not nearly 
long enough and called him a 'murderer who does not deserve to live.'

'I believe the defendant deserves 
more than 17 years,' said Mr  Pasquale, who as a mail carrier had
delivered letters to Robinson's family in Clayton, where the families 
of the victim and her killer had deep roots. 'I believe his fate should 
be nothing but death.'

When he pleaded guilty, Justin 
Robinson said he acted alone. During a sentencing proceeding, neither 
he, his lawyers, nor prosecutors shed light on a motive for the killing,
or even what happened beyond what was already known: Pasquale went to 
his house several blocks from hers after receiving a Facebook offer to 
trade bike parts on Oct. 20. When she didn't return home that night, her
family, then the entire community, set off in a frantic search. Two 
days later, her body was found in a recycling bin behind the home next 
to Robinson's.

A break in the case for investigators
came when the boy's mother, Anita Saunders, called police after seeing 
something troubling in a Facebook post from one of her sons.

Speaking briefly during the 
sentencing, Saunders told the judge that media accounts of what happened
were incorrect. 'Nobody knows exactly what happened the day of the 
accident,' she said.

Robinson's lawyer, Jean Faulkner, 
told the judge that the boy had post-traumatic stress disorder from 
being physically abused as a young boy and seeing his father strangle 
his mother more than once.

'This is a learned behavior,' Faulkner said.

Pasquale's family told the judge 
about Autumn, whom they described as a loving tomboy who wore 
mismatched socks and loved to ride her BMX bike.

Upset: Anthony Pasquale, father of slain child Autumn Pasquale spoke in court saying her killer Justin Robinson did not deserve to live

Guilty: Justin (pictured left) will now spend the next half of his life behind bars. He plead guilty in August to choking Autumn last year. His brother Donte Robinson (pictured right) has also been charged with the murder

Innocent: Autumn went round to the brothers house to trade BMX bike parts. Instead, they killed her

They talked about how her 
disappearance and death touched the town, located 25 miles southeast of 
Philadelphia. Her old soccer team, once known as the Clayton Comets, is 
now Autumn's Angels; her jersey number, 14, has been retired from the 
Clayton Middle School sports teams; a bike path and a park are now named
for her.

And they told the judge how members 
of the family, including her siblings and young cousins, are in therapy 
and dealing with nightmares about her death.

'When I see the blue recycling bins 
out, I cry to think Autumn's innocent life was so easily discarded like a
piece of trash,' said the girl's maternal grandmother, Mary Pasquale, 
who had taught Justin Robinson in school.

A slide show of pictures of Autumn were projected onto a screen in the courtroom.

About a dozen family members recalled her as happy, lively young girl who made others laugh.

OCTOBER 20, 2012: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey. Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her'.

OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. 

OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York. After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. 

OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder. Authorities also said that the brother’s mother, spotting a suspicious post on Facebook, turned them into police.

AUGUST 7, 2013: Justin Robinson, 16, pleads guilty to aggravated manslaughter.

SEPTEMBER 12, 2013: Justin Robinson, now 17, sentenced to 17 years in jail. He won't be eligible for parole until he has served 85 per cent of his sentence in 2030.
