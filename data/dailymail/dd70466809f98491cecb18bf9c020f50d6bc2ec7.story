Senate Republicans blocked an election-year Democratic bill on Wednesday that would have boosted the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 an hour.

The vote was 54-42 in favor of allowing 
debate on the measure to proceed, six votes short of the 60 that 
Democrats needed to prevail.

Sen. Bob Corker was the only 
Republican to cross party lines and vote 'yes.' Reid switched his vote 
to 'no,' which gives him the right to call another vote on the measure. 
No other Democrats opposed the bill.

Even if the Senate had voted on passed the legislation, it would have died in the House, which is controlled by Republicans.

Sen. Tom Harkin's legislation would have hiked the minimum wage up to $10.10 an hour from $7.25 over the next 30 months

The measure's rejection, which was 
expected, came in the early months of a campaign season in which the 
slowly recovering economy — and its impact on families — is a marquee 
issue.

'Millions of American workers will be 
watching how each senator votes today. To them, it's a matter of 
survival,' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said before the vote.

He pointedly added, 'For Republicans, this vote will demonstrate whether they truly care about our economy.'

Reid blamed Republican reluctance to pass minimum wage legislation on conservative billionaires David and Charles Koch.

President Barack Obama blasted Republicans in a statement after the vote.

'They said "no" to helping millions work their way out of poverty,' Obama said.

The President characterized the issue of raising the minimum wage as 'a very simple one.'

'Either you're in favor of raising wages for hard working Americans, or
 you're not,' said Obama, who named raising the minimum wage as one of 
his goals for 2014 in the president's annual State of the Union address 
in January.

Republicans, solidly against the Democratic proposal, say it would be too expensive for employers and cost jobs.

As ammunition, they cite a February study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that estimated the increase to $10.10 could eliminate about 500,000 jobs — but also envisioned higher income for 16.5 million low-earning people.

'Washington Democrats' true focus these days seems to be making the far left happy, not helping the middle class,' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

'This is all about politics,' said No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas. "This is about trying to make this side of the aisle look bad and hard-hearted."

The
 legislation, authored by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, would gradually raise the $7.25
 hourly minimum to $10.10 over 30 months and provide automatic 
annual increases to account for inflation.

Harkin's bill would also gradually 
increase the minimum wage for tipped workers like waiters to 70 percent 
of the minimum for most other workers. It is currently $2.13 hourly, 
which can be paid as long as their hourly earnings with tips total at 
least $7.25.

Democrats argue that if fully
 phased in by 2016, Harkin's legislation would push a family of three above the federal 
poverty line — a level such earners have not surpassed since 1979.

The minimum wage was first enacted in 1938 and set at 25 cents. Congress
 has passed nine laws slowly increasing it, including one each decade 
since the 1980s. The minimum has been $7.25 since 2009.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who has been seeking a deal with other senators on a lower figure than $10.10, said on Wednesday that she will continue that effort. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who usually sides with Democrats, said he too favors finding middle ground.

But Democratic leaders have shown no inclination to do that — a view shared by unions that favor an increase and business groups that oppose one.

'We're not going to compromise on $10.10,' Reid told reporters after the vote.

In a clear sign of the political value Democrats believe the issue has, Democrats said they intend to force another vote on the increase closer to this year's elections.

The White House issued a statement urging the bill's passage and saying the administration wants legislation 'to build real, lasting economic security for the middle class and create more opportunities for every hardworking American to get ahead.'

'The senators who voted no today are doing contrary to the wishes of the American people,' White House press secretary Jay Carney said after the vote.

'There is a reason to do this, and we ought to see Republicans acting in the interest of Americans to get it done.'

Supporters note that the minimum wage's buying power has fallen. It reached its peak value in 1968, when it was $1.60 hourly but was worth $10.86 in today's dollars.

The legislation is opposed by business groups including the National Council of Chain Restaurants and the International Franchise Association. The National Restaurant Association has hundreds of members at the Capitol this week lobbying lawmakers on several issues, including opposition to a higher minimum wage.

Also opposed were conservative organizations including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity.

Opposition from Republicans running the House makes it unlikely that chamber would debate minimum wage legislation this year.

According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, about two-thirds of the 3.3 million people who earned $7.25 an hour or less last year worked in service jobs, mostly food preparation and serving. More than 6 in 10 of those making $7.25 or under were women, and about half were under age 25.

Democrats hope their support for a minimum wage boost will draw voters from both groups — who usually lean Democratic — to the polls in November, when Senate control will be at stake. The GOP's hold on the House is not in doubt.

Harkin's legislation also would provide automatic annual increases in the minimum wage to account for inflation. The bill could come back up for a vote in the Senate this year
