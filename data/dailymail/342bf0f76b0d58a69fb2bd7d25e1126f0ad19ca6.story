Gay couples exchanged vows in early morning ceremonies in several New Jersey communities on Monday as the state began recognizing their marriages, becoming the 14th state to do so.

Last week the New Jersey Supreme Court refused Governor Chris Christie's request that same-sex marriages be put on hold until a state appeal against the decision is decided.

The Christie administration said on Friday it would appeal the decision but today he ordered his team to drop the appeal.

In a statement on Monday, the administration said that Christie strongly disagrees with the Court for overruling 'the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people'.

But it added that 'the Governor will 
do his constitutional duty and ensure his Administration enforces the 
law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court'.

Mayors
 in New Jersey cities including Newark and Jersey City opened their city
 halls at 12:01am Monday morning, the official start-date of the court 
order, to marry eager couples.

The hastily planned first weddings to 
legally unite long-time couples were planned for a state Senator's grand
 home in Elizabeth, the boardwalk in Asbury Park and government 
buildings in small towns and big cities.

In
 the arts community of Lambertville, Mayor David DelVecchio led the 
ceremony to marry Beth Asaro and Joanne Schailey. He also presided when 
they joined in a civil union the minute they became recognized in the 
state in February 2007.

Soon after they cut the cake, DelVecchio handed Asaro a pink marriage license.

The couple, both wearing suits, hosted a reception attended by friends, family and several politicians. The song 'In the Mood' played.

Backing down: The state's highest court had unanimously denied Governor Chris Christie's request to put gay marriage on hold while the state's appeal was heard. On Monday he dropped the appeal

Asaro, a member of the city council 
in Lambertville, said they wanted to get married at the first moment, in
 part, to promote the gay-friendliness of their community north of 
Trenton.

'This shows to the world that Lambertville is open for business,' DelVecchio said.

The
 weddings came amid a flurry of legal activity after the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled in June that the federal government should recognize gay 
marriages and confer couples with the same benefits that it does for 
heterosexual married couples, including joint tax filings, the right to 
live together in government-funded nursing homes and Social Security 
survivor benefits.

A
 state judge last month agreed with advocates who said that by allowing 
civil unions but not marriage, New Jersey was keeping gay couples in the
 state from legal equality.

The
 administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and possible 2016 
presidential candidate, had appealed both the ruling and Monday's 
implementation date to the state Supreme Court.

And on Friday, less than 60 hours before the weddings were to begin, the state's top court refused to delay them while it sorts out the overall case. The court said the state is not likely to prevail.

Many of the people who have long fought for the right for gay couples to marry had been bracing for a delay, even while they were optimistic the state's top court would ultimately force New Jersey to recognize same-sex marriage.

Despite the many happy unions that have been made in the wee hours of Monday morning, many couples have to wait for 72 hours after obtaining their marriage licenses according to New Jersey law, unless they can find a judge to waive the waiting period.

Others have been held up by authorities unsure whether they had permission to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

For the first couples to tie the knot legally, it's been a weekend of fast wedding planning and confusion.

Some towns began taking applications for same-sex marriage licenses on Thursday and continued even after the state government told them not to until there was clarity from the courts.

Other towns refused to grant licenses even after the state Health Department said Friday evening that towns should accept the applications.

It's expected that a rush of weddings will continue in coming days as couples are able to get licenses.
