The producer of The Cosby Show and longtime friend of the embattled comedian released a statement today expressing shock at the sexual assault allegations but denying any knowledge of them. 

Tom Werner's production company Carsey-Werner worked with the comedian to create The Cosby Show. 

Werner, who is also chairman of the Boston Red Sox, was also reportedly part of creating the new sitcom with Cosby for NBC which has since been cancelled after ten women came forward this month to allege Cosby had attacked them, many accusing the star of drugging and raping them.

According to The Boston Globe, the statement read: 'The Bill we know was a brilliant and wonderful collaborator on a show that changed the landscape of television.

'These recent news reports are beyond our knowledge or comprehension.' 

On Thursday, Raven-Symoné blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby during their years on The Cosby Show.

'I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! [sic]' the 28-year-old wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.

'I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of!,' she added. 'Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!' 

Symone starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter Olivia from 1989 till 1992 (the show started airing in 1984).  

Symone was referencing a report posted earlier this week on fake news site Hip-Hop Hangover, claiming the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when they acted together on the hit sitcom.

It was announced on Friday that Bill Cosby's appearances at Las Vegas and Arizona casinos have been canceled amid widening allegations.

No reason was given by Diamond Desert Casino in Tucson, Arizona for the canceled February 15 show.

Las Vegas' Treasure Island confirmed on Friday that the comedian's show, the day after Thanksgiving, had been canceled, reportedly by 'mutual agreement'.

In the past week, numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby, 77, from a number of women have led to canceled interviews along with NBC and Netflix projects. 

TV Land has also announced that they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.

Netflix postponed the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving.

He pulled out of scheduled slots with Queen Latifah and David Letterman and, when asked about the allegations in a November 6 interview with the Associated Press, said: 'There's no response ... I don't talk about it.' 

A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them.

MailOnline was awaiting comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Friday. 

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz -  She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. 

Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. 

Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. 

Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. 

Renita Chaney Hill -  She appeared alongside Cosby in TV program Picture Pages in the early 80s and claimed the pair had a relationship for four years. The 47-year-old from Pittsburgh said she would be flown to different cities and stay in hotels, where he would insist she had a drink, even though she was still in high school. She told KDKA she believed that is when he drugged her as she did not remember anything until she woke up the next morning.
