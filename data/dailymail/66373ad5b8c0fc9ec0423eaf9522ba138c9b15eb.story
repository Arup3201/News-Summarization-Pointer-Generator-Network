One of only three surviving 'Lord Kitchener Wants You' First World War recruitment posters has gone under the hammer for a world record £30,000.

The incredibly rare poster was responsible for the enlistment of millions of men and has since become one of the most iconic images of the war.

But despite its success and popularity, it was not produced on the same scale as other recruitment posters - and only three originals survived.

Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions sold the incredibly rare piece of history, which is only one of three left in the world, for a record £30,000

The other two are in the Imperial War Museum in London and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, meaning this poster was the only one in the world that was available for sale.

The poster started off life as the front cover of a 1914 edition of magazine London Opinion which had commissioned renowned artist Alfred Leete.

The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, which commissioned all the recruitment posters, spotted the artwork and turned it into a poster.

Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort

It was then plastered on billboards around the country - but only 10,000 were made.

Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort.

The poster was so successful it was copied by the Americans who replaced Kitchener with Uncle Sam.

Kitchener was killed in 1916 when the warship taking him to negotiations in Russia was sunk by a German mine.

The poster for sale was bought at auction in 1983 for £100 and has remained in a private collection ever since.

Experts had tipped it to fetch £15,000 but were shocked when it went for almost double that, setting a new record for the sale of a war poster.

It was snapped up by a London-based collector for £27,540 in an online sale by Dorset-based auction house Onslows.

Patrick Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'When war broke out in 1914 the British army had a real problem on their hands because they only had about 150,000 soldiers.

'Lord Kitchener was a respected leader and strategist who had found fame in the Boer War and during the last days of the British Empire.

'He was too old to serve as a general and so he was hired to take on the mammoth role of recruiting more soldiers.'

Thousands of poster were reproduced and distributed around the British Empire.

The Lord Kitchener poster however, was only displayed in Britain, but it was an instant hit.

Mr Bogue said: 'It was so popular that the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee sought permission to use the front page as a recruitment poster.

'The only thing different was that they changed the wording from 'needs you' to 'wants you'.

'It was a hugely successful poster and was responsible for tens of thousands of men enlisting in the army.

'Only two other original copies exist and they are both in museums.

'The Lord Kitchener poster is the holy grail of historic recruitment posters and this copy is the only one in the world that you could actually buy.

'We had hoped it would sell for a decent amount but we were delighted when it sold for so much.

'It just goes to show how much value is put on such a rare, historic poster as this.'

At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up.However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits.Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service.The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers.Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal.Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year.
