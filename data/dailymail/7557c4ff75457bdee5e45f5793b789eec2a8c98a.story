A mentally ill woman accused of stabbing a grandmother to death was previously detained under the Mental Health Act, it was revealed last night.

Nicola Edgington, 31, was deemed fit to be freed in September 2009.

But that decision is now subject to an urgent Health Service inquiry after it emerged that she tried to get herself sectioned shortly before a rampage in which she is accused of murdering Sally Hodkin, 59, and attempting to kill Kerry Clark, 23.

Yesterday the father of one of her 
alleged victims told of his anger and astonishment that the suspect 
walked out of a mental health unit only an hour before Monday’s 
bloodbath.

Edgington arrived at the A&E department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, at around 5am on Monday.

She was referred to a mental health ward, but while nurses were preparing a bed and medication for her, she left.

Staff chased after her, but Edgington outran them and is said to have escaped in a taxi at 7am.

Within an hour, she had bought a 6in 
knife from an Asda store and allegedly attacked Miss Clark, who was 
waiting at a bus stop nearby.

Killed: Accounts manager Sally Hodkin, pictured centre, was stabbed to death with a cleaver

Miss Clark, an artist, suffered minor 
hand injuries as she fought to defend herself. It is claimed Edgington 
then dropped the weapon and ran off.

Attack: Kerry Clark was injured while she was sat at the bus stop

But minutes later, she is accused of 
stealing a 12-inch meat cleaver from a butcher’s shop and hacking to 
death Mrs Hodkin, who had just left her £350,000 home in Bexleyheath to 
walk to Cunningham Blake solicitors in Blackheath, where she worked as 
an accounts manager.

The grandmother of two  died after being knifed in the neck. Edgington was arrested at the scene.

Yesterday Miss Clark’s father David 
said: ‘My daughter had a lucky escape. I cannot believe that woman was 
allowed out of hospital.’

The 59-year-old rail supervisor added:
‘My daughter Kerry was sitting at a bus stop and she saw this woman 
coming towards her out of the corner of her eye.

‘The woman pulled a knife  out and 
started to attack  her. How can it be that someone like this is allowed 
to walk  the streets?  Surely she should  be in hospital.

‘Why is the NHS sending people like this into the community when they are clearly not well?’

Yesterday the petite 5ft 2in suspect 
was said to be too ill to attend Greenwich Magistrates Court to answer 
charges of murder and attempted murder.

Stabbed to death: Mrs Hodkin with her husband, Paul, pictured at a wedding together three years ago

The mother of two, who lives alone in 
sheltered accommodation in Greenwich, was described as having ‘extreme’ 
mental health problems.

Psychiatrist Dr Amit Chatterjee told 
magistrates: ‘She does have extreme mental health problems. I don’t 
think she is fit to attend court in her mental state.’

No plea was entered on Edgington’s behalf.

Edgington is the daughter of former Daily Mail Moscow correspondent Harry Edgington.

Grieving: Members of Mrs Hodkin's family lay flowers at the scene where she was killed in Bexleyheath

Yesterday a spokesman  for Oxleas NHS 
Foundation Trust said she had received treatment in the community in 
line with  the conditions of her release  in 2009.

He added: ‘Nicola Edgington has been receiving regular treatment from the trust since 2006.

‘She attended A&E at Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich yesterday at around 5am seeking help and 
was transferred to our mental health assessment unit at Oxleas House on 
the QEH site.

Gathering evidence: Forensics officers surround the scene where Mrs Hodkin was fatally stabbed in south-east London

‘At Oxleas House she was promptly 
assessed. A bed was available and medication was being prepared before 
admitting her to a ward on a voluntary basis.

‘At 7am she unexpectedly left the assessment suite. Staff saw her leave and pursued her but were unsuccessful.

‘We are carrying out a full investigation which will look at all of the treatment Nicola received from the trust.’
