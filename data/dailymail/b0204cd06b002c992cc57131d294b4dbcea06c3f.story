The amount of local geography required to operate a New York City yellow cab has been significantly reduced as organizers claim they are modernizing the test and critics claim they are making it too easy for prospective drivers. 

Cabbies have traditionally faced a rigorous set of geography questions on the 80-question test they must pass to get a license, but now only ten geography questions remain that have to do with navigating the city with a map.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission says GPS technology means divers don't need to learn so much information about getting from A to B and the revised exam can focus more on safety issues.

Spokesman Allan Fromberg told The New York Times that the revised test is 'catching up to the times.'

However the changes come just as the commission is facing a shortage of drivers as many prospective candidates apply instead to driver for alternative services such as Lyft and Uber that don't bother to test local geography.

The change to the test was introduced several weeks ago and there has since been a 20 percent increase in the pass rate.

The companies who operate fleets of yellow cabs are happy to have more drivers to rota onto shifts, but users are unhappy that they might have a driver who doesn't know their way around the city.  

Lifelong New York Carolyn Baker told the Times that she has been taking cabs for more 50 years.

'If I got into a cab and the driver didn't know where Penn Station was, that'd be ridiculous,' said

She also voiced concerns about being driven by someone who was too busy looking at their GPS to focus on the road. 

'I don't want the driver using GPS while they are driving and put my life at risk,' she said.

Using a GPS device when a cab is not standing or parked is currently prohibited. 

Half of the 80-question test, 30 questions on English-language proficiency and the 10 on map reading, remain unchanged. 

Of the remaining 40, up to 25 questions previously covered geography, but now they all cover rules and regulations. 

'The chance that a licensed cabdriver is not going to know where major tourist attractions are is slim to none,' said Fromberg.
