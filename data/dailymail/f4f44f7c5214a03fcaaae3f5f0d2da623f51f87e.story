When Ashlee Hammac's newborn son died just five days after being welcomed in the world, she decided to pay a special tribute to baby Ryan - by building a sandbox on his grave so that his older brother could come and spend time with him.

Last week, the 24-year-old mother from Lake City, Florida, shared a touching and heart-breaking photo on the Facebook page Sawyer's Heart depicting her 3-year-old son, Tucker, playing with toy cars in the blue sand by his brother's headstone.

Over the past week, the image has gone viral, drawing more than 173,000 'likes' and just shy of 50,000 'shares.'

Viral tribute: Photos of Ashelee Hammac's 3-year-old son, Tucker, playing with toy trucks in a sandbox set up on top of his brother's grave became an Internet sensation, drawing tens of thousands of 'shares'

Initially, Hammac, 24, planned to place glass pebbles on baby Ryan's tombstone, but ultimately she decided to create something that her son could relate to as well

Hammac's younger son, Ryan Michael Jolley, was born October 11, 2013, and passed away October 16 from Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephlopathy: a condition that occurs when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain.

Following baby Ryan's funeral, Miss Hammac decided to adorn his burial place with glass pebbles, but thinking of her son Tucker and his grieving process, she decided to come up with the kind of tribute that he could relate to as well.   

Together, the mother and son embraced the idea of turning the newborn’s black-granite gravesite into a play area filled with sand.

‘He always goes out there with me, and sits out there, and sings lullabies, and talks to him just like he was there,' Miss Hammac told People Magazine. 'So I wanted it to be special for him too. His favorite thing right now is trucks.’

The Florida mom said 3-year-old Tucker often asks her if he can go to 'baby Ryan's sandbox.'

In the months since Ran passing, Miss Hammac and her family have launched a non-profit organization called Pages to Memories to help raise awareness of her son's condition.

As little Ryan, who was delivered prematurely, slowly faded in the intensive care unit last fall, Hammac was able to share a few precious moments with him by reading him books.

Now, her organization donates books and blankets to hospitals so that other parents could bond with their newborn children.

Ashlee Hammac went into an early labor on the morning of October 11 after experiencing a severe migraine. During the delivery, her placenta burst, depriving Ryan of oxygen for several hours.

Once the tiny infant was hooked up to tubes and wires in the neonatal ICU, doctors said he only had 1 in 8 chances of survival.

After a five-day struggle between life and death, an MRI test showed that the child’s brain showed no activity.

Even though he was alive for less than a week, the infant's death was not in vain, as his healthy little heart was donated to another ailing baby.

Ashlee Hammac said she hopes one day to meet the mother of the child in whose chest Ryan’s heart continues to beat.
