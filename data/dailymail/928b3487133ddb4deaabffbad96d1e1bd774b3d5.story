Police investigating the deaths of a married couple who were knocked off their tandem bike in an alleged hit-and-run, have charged a second person.

Louise Cox, 35, has been charged with perverting the course of justice by Avon and Somerset Police. She is due to appear before magistrates in Yate, Gloucestershire, on Monday.

Ross and Clare Simons died in a crash while cycling on January 27 in Hanham, near Bristol - less than 24 hours after they celebrated the news that they could undergo fertility treatment to start a family.

Tragic: Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, on their wedding day - they died in January. Two people have been charged in connection with their deaths

Investigation: The scene where the two cyclists died after being hit in an alleged hit and run

Nicholas Lovell, 38, has already been 
remanded in custody after he was charged with two counts of causing 
death by dangerous driving.

He is also charged with driving while 
disqualified, driving without insurance and failing to stop after a road
accident, following his court appearance on January 30.

Mr Simons and his wife - said by friends as 'two 
peas in a pod' - died when their bicycle was in collision with a Citroen
Picasso car.

Their families described them as 'very special' and said they had 'no words' to describe their loss.
Dozens of floral tributes were left at the scene of the crash.

Mr Lovell was arrested after handing himself 
into police hours after the collision.

The couple died less than 24 hours after they celebrated the news that they could undergo fertility treatment to start a family.

Hearing: Nicholas Lovell, 38, was remanded in custody at North Avon Magistrates' Court in January charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving
