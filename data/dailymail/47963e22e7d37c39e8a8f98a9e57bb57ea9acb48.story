A 14-year-old boy has been arrested after a video of an assault on another pupil who desperately tried to defend himself was posted online.

The Facebook clip appears to show a teenager from Winifred Holtby School in Hull, East Yorkshire, repeatedly hitting another boy, lashing out six times with his fists and headbutting him twice.

Pupils have condemned the 27-second video taken on a school bus, which has been shared more than 200 times, with nearly 700 Facebook users expressing their anger and sadness over the attack.

Attack: The clip appears to show a teenager from Winifred Holtby School in Hull repeatedly hitting another boy

Video: The boy can be seen in the clip lashing out six times with his fists and headbutting his victim twice

The boy allegedly being assaulted, who was said to suffer from learning difficulties, could be heard repeatedly saying that he did not want an argument. He did not fight back at any point of the video.

Some commenters suggested the aggressor could be assaulted himself because so many people are angered by the clip, which showed the attacker eventually being pulled away by another pupil.

Humberside Police acted after being made aware of the video, with officers going to the school to arrest a 14-year-old boy and interview him. He was bailed and has not been charged.

Mike Birkenshaw, Winifred Holtby’s deputy head for community, said staff at the school were ‘liaising with the appropriate authorities in dealing with this extremely unpleasant incident’.
