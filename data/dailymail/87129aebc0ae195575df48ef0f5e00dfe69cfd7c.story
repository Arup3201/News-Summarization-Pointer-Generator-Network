A health boss played an innuendo-laden game of scrabble with a newly qualified nurse as he waged a campaign of harassment, a tribunal has heard.

Peter King is accused of bombarding the nurse with text messages and making lewd remarks. 

The senior manager of a community mental health in Swindon, Wilts, is also accused of using sexually suggestive words during a game of online Scrabble on Facebook.

The senior manager pressured the nurse into adding him as a friend on Facebook then sent her saucy messages while they played Scrabble

The hearing in central London yesterday heard that in one exchange, King said: ‘You are obviously not catching on too quickly, and I’m getting bored of inferring things.

'I’ll be blunt, I think you are f********.’

The nurse was so repulsed by his approaches she reported King to Wiltshire Police who made him sign a document promising not contact her again.

King, who was already on a final warning for harassing student nurses, yesterday faced a Nursing and Midwifery Council misconduct hearing, accused of waging a campaign of sexual harassment.

Nurse A, whose identity has been protected during the hearing, joined his team on August 2 as she qualified as a psychiatric nurse, and immediately became the object of King’s attention, it is said.

‘Nurse A’s experiences had left her fearful, intimidated and threatened’, said Ros Stower, who investigated the complaints against King.

‘Throughout the whole time I was interviewing her, she was tearful, anxious, and very distressed.’

King allegedly text the nurse saying: 'You will see from the texts I don't chase for long, and I don't like failure. xx pity' (posed by model)

Nurse A began keeping a diary of alleged approaches by King, which started on August 12 when he is accused of saying to her: ‘You mean you have been in my car before and I did not molest you?’

‘Those are exactly the words she used and she read them out from her diary herself’, said Ms Stower.

On August 18, King is alleged to have sent saucy messages through Facebook as he and nurse played a game of scrabble online.

‘There were interactions on Facebook and some chat which was flirtatious with sexual innuendo’, said Ms Stower, although she admitted there was no evidence of the online exchanges.

King allegedly told nurse A she was ‘f*******’ on August 20, and sent her a series of text messages the next day out of working hours.

Nurse A went off sick on August 24 with stress, but King allegedly continued to pursue her by trying to get her personal mobile phone number through her mentor.

Ms Stower told the hearing King had been on his last warning at work, with sexual innuendo part of daily life in his department.

‘He was on a final written warning because of complaints raised by student nurses of sexually inappropriate comments towards them while they were on a placement with his team’, she said.

‘From the interviews it appeared his team was quite split, with Peter King held in high regard by some and others hold him in less regard.

‘The consistent message was Peter King was quite friendly with his team, and there was a lot of belief he did not consistently present in a professional manner.

‘Sexual innuendo was a long-established culture on his team.’

King was suspended from his role as manager of the community mental health team based in The Mall, Swindon, and was eventually sacked by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust for serious gross misconduct in March 2011.

A police caution for harassment had already been handed to him on September 17, 2010.

King is not at the hearing in central London, but wrote to the panel denying wrongdoing.

He admitted sending nurse A texts but denied they were sexual, and did not deny trying to get her personal mobile phone number.

But the National Medical Council did not accept any admissions of guilt had been made.

Nurse A told the hearing her ‘world fell apart’ as former soldier King’s advances became more aggressive and threatening.

Giving evidence yesterday, the nurse said she put his comment about ‘molesting’ her in his car down to his reputation among the nursing team.

‘This was the first time Peter King made me feel uncomfortable, but he had a bit of a reputation among student nurses as being a bit of a ladies man’, she said.

When she got into a game of online Scrabble with King via Facebook, he laid the eight-point word BOOB while sending her sexually charged instant messages, it is alleged.

‘I can’t be 100 per cent certain what he wrote, but I have some memory of the word boob being placed on the board’, she said.

‘I just thought he was mucking around.

‘I am absolutely sure he made sexual innuendos, he made me feel uncomfortable during one of the games, so uncomfortable I made excuses that I had to go and tend to one of my children, which wasn’t the case.’

Nurse A said King had pressured her into adding him as a friend on Facebook, and said she felt she had no choice after he asked three days in a row.

When King went out for a cigarette on August 20, just over two weeks after he hired her, and allegedly commented that the mother-of-three was ‘f*ckable’.

‘This just knocked me for six’, she said.

'I was scared, and disgusted that it had gone to a new level.

‘Prior to that, some people may have seen what he was saying as banter, but it wasn’t banter anymore.

‘I felt really disempowered as he was my boss. If another man said that to me I would respond, but I didn’t feel I could because it was him and at that point he was frightening me.’

Nurse A said the situation deteriorated rapidly at the end of the week when she received a text message from King, saying: ‘You will see from the texts I don’t chase for long, and I don’t like failure. xx pity.’

‘That was the moment when my world fell apart’, she said.

‘I took it as a threat, and took it that he was clearly after me in a sexual way and he was angry that I didn’t want to do it.

‘He had clearly got the message that I wasn’t interested and I really felt when he said “pity” he meant pity for me as I was only two or three weeks into my job.’

Nurse A said King, who she described as having an ‘army persona’, had isolated her from other colleagues since joining the team, so she had no one to confide it.

‘It seemed like every time I tried to beat him off, as politely as possible, he kept coming back saying it’s OK I won’t tell anyone’, she added.

She thought about quitting nursing, and was signed off sick with stress on August 24.

After she confided in a colleague the alleged harassment was reported to a senior manager in the trust.

Nurse A, who fought back tears as she gave evidence to the hearing, was eventually moved to a different mental health team within the trust.

She was promoted to a band 6 nurse in September last year, and took on a new job as a specialist practitioner in April this year.

The hearing continues.
