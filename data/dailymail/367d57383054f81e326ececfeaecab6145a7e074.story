The message upon entering the village proudly declares: 'Stamfordham welcomes you, not litter'.

But it appears the rather modest sign, planted in a bed of daffodils, is not having the desired effect.

In recent weeks, one resident has become increasingly frustrated at having to pick up a deluge of rubbish outside her home, including condoms and pornographic videos.

Rubbish row: Jo Riddell has been causing a stink in her village with her anti-litter signs, which she felt compelled to put up after having to collect piles of detritus outside her home

Garish: Mrs Riddell's signs have been causing offence in some quarters due to the use of the word 'tosser' and their 'ghastly' yellow colour

So when Jo Riddell decided to take a 
more obviously proactive approach, she could be forgiven for thinking 
she would have the backing of her fellow villagers.

Instead, the 49-year-old has found herself at the centre of a storm after her bright-yellow signs bearing the slogan 'Don't be a tosser - take your rubbish home' were branded 'offensive and garish'.

She put up the placards after claiming to have collected 27 bags of rubbish along
 the roadside on her land in the Cheeseburn Grange Hall Estate, near 
Stamfordham, Northumberland in recent weeks. Most were thrown from 
passing cars.

The Grade II*-listed Cheeseburn Grange has been home to the Riddell family for generations.

Mrs Riddell has lived on the estate for 24 years with husband Simon, managing director of an agricultural company, and they have three children Ed, 25, Camilla, 21, and Henrietta, 18.

Idyllic: The villagers of Stamfordham in Northumberland, where Mrs Riddell lives, is clearly keen to keep their community tidy, but many have objected to the 49-year-old landowner's tactics

'Shocking and shameful': Mrs Riddell with some of the rubbish she has been collecting along the roadside on her land on the Cheeseburn Grange Hall Estate, including condoms and pornographic videos

But her signs have caused offence to some villagers and two have been ripped down.

Edward Trevelyan, chairman 
of Stamfordham Parish Council, who has lived in the village for 30 
years, said: 'They are ghastly notices, an eyesore and they’re rude. 
It’s garish and defacing the countryside. I’ve had about six or seven 
complaints from residents. I hope they will be removed.'

Mrs Riddell, 49, said: 'I can’t walk three paces around the estate without coming across litter. I have picked up condoms, needles and pornographic videos along with all the bottles, cans, plastic and paper. It’s shocking and shameful. It’s been getting worse in recent years.

'I was inspired by a trip to Australia. I was walking along Bondi beach and the signs were along it. They said: ‘Don’t be a bloody tosser - take your rubbish home.'

Controversial: Mrs Riddel says she sought legal advice and spoke to the Campaign to Protect Rural England before putting up the signs

She claims she had no idea what 'tosser' meant until a friend commented on how brave she was using the word.

'I had to look it up on Google. It was a bit of an "oops" moment,' she said.

'I
 was brought up with the Queen’s English. But before I put the signs up,
 I consulted legal experts and I made sure they were only on my land. I 
also sought advice from the Campaign to Protect Rural England and there 
was no problem.'

She added: 'I’m sorry if the signs cause offence and I know there have been some complaints. I’m a law-abiding citizen and if I have broken the law, I will take them down.'

Parents of children at nearby Stamfordham First School were divided on the issue.

Louise Chalmers, 40, who has a daughter Lily, five, said: 'I think they’re terrible. There was something in the village newsletter about it.

'It is a bit awkward to have to explain to a five-year-old what the word means.

'Lily is just learning to read and when she saw the sign she asked what the word meant.

'I think it is inappropriate and I don’t even think it will work.'

Sarah Bell, 42, a full-time mother from Matfen, Northumberland, said: 'I thought it was funny and puts the point across, but I can see some people might be offended.'
