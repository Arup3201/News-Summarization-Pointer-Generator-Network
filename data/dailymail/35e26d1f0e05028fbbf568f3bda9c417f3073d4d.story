Those clever marketing guys at Ikea have stepped things up a level with this year's Halloween advert. 

Late night shopping may never be the same again after you watch Ikea’s homage to Stanley Kubrick’s horror classic, The Shining.

The clip begins with a view from behind of a boy on a tricycle - mirroring when Danny begins his ferocious hallway pedal scene.

The young boy sets off on his tricycle journey in IKEA's latest video

He cycles past a couple of skeletons enjoying some dinner in a kitchen

The boys continues to motor his way through what looks like a deserted warehouse

What follows is the youngster taking us on a journey through what appears an abandoned warehouse. In reality it is Ikea's Singapore store.

Cycling past one unit, the Halloween theme is all to evident as two skeletons sit in a kitchen.

Twisting and turning past sofas, beds and high-end tables, while keeping the speed up, the boy turns the corner only to be met by two not-so little girls dressed in blue who ask him to 'come play.'

The one on the right seems at this point a man wearing a dress. 

Danny is then met by 'two little girls' who block his path

They say to the boy that they want to play

Danny is now scared and his journey has come to an abrupt halt

'Come play with us Danny,' say the pair in unison as the boy begins to cover his eyes and recoil in fear. 

Then peeking through the gaps in his fingers, things turn to normality. 

'Come play with us Danny, come on',say a now more appropriately dressed couple extending their hands out.

He uses his hands to cover his face in fright - but can't resist peering through the gaps in his fingers

But instead of 'two little girls' he is met by his parents, who tell him that they have to go

And all is right with the world, as Danny realises it was all just a bad dream

The boy smiles, showing huge relief and runs towards his parents as they say 'let's go.'

It's not the first time the Swedish company have done their own parody video.

Back in September Ikea one-upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka 'bookbook' - a play on Apple's MacBook.

The scene from Stanley Kubrick's hit film The Shining, of Danny cycling through the hallway. The film was an adaptation of Stephen King's novel.

'The interface is 7.5 x 8 inches. But can expand to 15 x 8 inches,' the narrator explains

This parody video was particularly timely as Apple was gearing up to launch the new iPhone with what was a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign. 

'Once in awhile, something comes along that changes the way we live,' the advertisement began.

'A device so simple and intuitive, using it feels almost familiar.

'Introducing the 2015 Ikea catalogue.' 

The advert demonstrates the 'bookbook's' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it

The entire advert is narrated by Jorgen Eghammer, dubbed the Chief Design Guru

'The first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable,' Jurgen continues. 'Not even a power cable. The 2015 Ikea catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal.'

Thoughts will now be turning to their Christmas offering, and what tricks they have up their Swedish sleeves next. 

Oh, and Ikea is open until 11pm daily during the Halloween season - the point of the spoof video.
