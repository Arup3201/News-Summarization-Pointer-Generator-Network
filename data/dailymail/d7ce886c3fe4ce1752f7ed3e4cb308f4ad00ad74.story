Police arrested two men following clashes in Sheffield which were sparked by men holding up a flag allegedly linked to Islamic extremism.

The group were said to have been carrying a black and white standard - versions of which are sometimes used by the Islamic State - during a demonstration against the conflict in Gaza on Saturday.

Members of the Kurdish community are then said to have approached the men, who were reportedly of Pakistani-origin, before ripping up the flag.

Control: Officers who were called to deal with the incident managed to disperse the crowd that had gathered for the demonstration

This prompted the police officers to intervene, and two men were subsequently detained. 

South Yorkshire Police said the demonstrators were holding a Palestinian flag which bears a declaration to the Islamic faith - which was mistaken by Kurdish residents as one used by ISIS militants.

Sarwat Jaf, a Kurdish refugee who left Iraq in 2006, told The Times: 'They said they were helping the Palestinians and they waved a Palestinian flag, but after that they brought the ISIS flag as well

'The Kurdish people did not want that. They said terrorists are killing people in Kurdistan.' 

Footage Mr Jaf recorded on his mobile phone shows the streets lined with police officers in the aftermath of the confrontation.

A police helicopter is also seen hovering above the area of the incident.   

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'There was a planned peaceful demonstration on Saville Street, Sheffield, on Saturday 9 August in relation to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

'The organisers of the demonstration were pro-Palestinian and were flying the Palestinian flag and a black flag that bears the Islamic declaration of faith.

'This was mistaken for a flag representing the militant group Isis by some local Kurdish residents who took offence.

'The Gaza demonstrators were adamant that no offence was meant. Overall, the demonstration was peaceful. 

They confirmed that two people were arrested - reports from witnesses suggest they were Kurdish.

Response: Officers were forced to intervene after members of the Kurdish community ripped up a flag they believed to be linked to ISIS

Detained: Two men were arrested following the incident - they were believed to be Kurdish residents

Mr Jaf believes that the group accused of holding the flag should not have been walking through a part of the city where many Arab and Kurd refugees live.

Concerns about homegrown involvement in terrorism are constantly increasing, with many Britons taking to Twitter to show their support for extremist movements.

Around 500 people from the UK are said to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight alongside terrorists, some of whom have recently been seen holding the heads of beheaded soldiers. 

Last week a nun has torn down a black and white flag similar to one championed by Muslim extremists from the gates of a  housing estate in  London, and branded those who hoisted it up as 'naive young hotheads'.

The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign. 

A group of Kurdish students called The Solidarity Against Islamic State held a demonstration outside Downing Street last night.

They were trying to raise money for people in Kurdistan who have been displaced by the ongoing conflict. 

The situation in Iraqi Kurdistan has been described as 'catastrophic', with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French president Francois Hollande being called to intervene.
