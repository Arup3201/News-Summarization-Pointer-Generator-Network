Businessman and father-of-four Craig Lavelle has launched his own bin collection business in Bury where bins are being collected every three weeks

A businessman has stepped in to offer rubbish collections after a council slashed its own bin- emptying service to just once every three weeks.

It will cost families £8.40 a time, but Craig Lavelle says there has been a ‘tremendous response’ to his idea.

The enterprising 54-year-old said he was prompted to act after realising how furious residents were about the council’s scaled-back service.

Many were last week still waiting for their Christmas rubbish to be emptied.

The Labour-run council in Bury, Greater Manchester, began three-weekly collections in October, the first in England to do so.

Falkirk in Scotland, and parts of Gwynedd, North Wales, are also running collections every 21 days.

Town hall bosses say the move will boost recycling rates and save money for other frontline services.

But so far locals have not been impressed and fear it is the precursor to a monthly collection.

While some complained about wheelie bins bursting with three-week-old rotting waste and black bins bags scattered all over the streets, others said fewer collections were causing an increase in vermin and fly tipping.

In some areas the situation was so bad that residents reported their bins had been ‘secretly’ filled by their neighbours or even stolen because people were so desperate to dispose of their rubbish.

So it is perhaps not surprising that after canvassing 5,000 households in Bury, Mr Lavelle – who is a managing director of a commercial waste company – found there had been a ‘tremendous response’ to his idea.

His new firm, Bury Bins, to be launched on March 1, would charge £8.40 per bin and would collect every week – apart from the week of the council collection – and on the same day, so as not to confuse residents. 

It means anyone who signs up will be shelling out £327.60 every year, or £168 every six months, on top of their council tax to have their bins emptied every week.

But unlike the council’s waste, no rubbish collected by Bury Bins would go to landfill, instead being all burned for energy.

Bury Council was the first in the country to announce three-weekly collections and there are fears the new measures will see increased fly tipping and streets strewn with over flowing bins, which could attract pests

Mr Lavelle’s plan is to launch Bury Bins in a small area with one lorry, before rolling it out across the town, depending on demand.

‘The people of Bury want a service and I’m going to provide one for them,’ he said.

In order to satisfy the Environment Agency that all waste would be disposed of correctly, Bury Bins will have a waste carrier’s licence, and the company also has public liability insurance to protect its staff and customers.

A Bury council spokesman defended the three-weekly collections, pointing out that recycling rates had improved from 47 per cent to 55 per cent since they were introduced, and the move could save £800,000 annually.

He added: ‘After only the first month, non-recyclable waste had reduced by 600 tons compared with the same month in 2013.’

A Facebook page 'Say NO to Bury Council 3 weekly bin collection' has been liked almost 6,000 times

Doretta Cocks, of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, condemned the switch to one council collection every three weeks.

She said: 'I dread to imagine the consequences of rubbish remaining in a bin awaiting collection for three weeks especially during hot weather.

'Just think of a situation where those with babies have to dispose of nappies.

'It will be horrendous and I cannot understand why the council's own health experts are standing by and letting it happen. It is a recipe for the spread of disease.'

'Residents are paying for a service through their council tax and they are not getting it.

'It is also the thin edge of the wedge towards monthly collections - I feel it is only a matter of time now before that happens which would be a disgraceful.'
