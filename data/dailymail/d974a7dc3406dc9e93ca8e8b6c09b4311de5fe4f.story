A Republican group has been forced to apologise after being accused of going too far with a Halloween email which featured a zombie President Obama with a bullet hole in his head.

The email got the attention of the Secret Service after a Virginia GOP committee used it to scare up interest in Halloween political activities.

The montage, a banner on a mass email to Loudoun Republicans, mingles seasonal images including a jack-o-lantern, a disfigured U.S. Rep Nancy Pelosi and a throng of flesh-hungry zombie Obama supporters.

Undead: This email, featuring an image of a zombie President Obama with a bullet in his head got the attention of the Secret Service after a Virginia GOP committee used it to scare up interest in Halloween political activities

The image of a rotting, undead Obama with a bleeding, large-caliber hole an inch above his right eye prompted Democrats to cry foul and Virginia's Republican governor to denounce it as 'shameful and offensive.'

'This is a disgusting and violent portrayal of the president of the United States,' said Democratic Party of Virginia spokesman Brian Coy.

After Virginia officials from both parties condemned the email, Loudoun County GOP Chairman Mark Sell was forced to apologise.

'The Loudoun County Republican 
Committee yesterday sent an email to its members that represented a 
light-hearted attempt to inject satire humor into the Halloween 
holiday,' he said in a statement.

Apology: Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell called on the Loudoun GOP to 'apologize for their actions, and to immediately ensure that such imagery is never used again'

'Apparently, some individuals have 
interpreted an image of Barack Obama that appeared within the email as 
intending to portray the president as a victim of a violent crime. 

'Nothing could be further from the 
truth, and we deeply and sincerely apologise to the president and anyone
who viewed the image if that was the impression that was left.'

He said his group 'deplores any 
effort to display, suggest or promote violence against the president or 
any other political figure.'

The statement came after Gov Bob 
McDonnell, through spokesman J. Tucker Martin, called on the Loudoun GOP
to 'apologise for their actions, and to immediately ensure that such 
imagery is never used again.'

Virginia GOP Chairman Pat Mullins said such an image 'has no place in our politics. Ever.' The image was first reported in a post on Monday on the conservative northern Virginia blog, Too Conservative.

The
post's author, identified as a 'Loudoun Insider,' said he's no Obama 
fan, 'but putting up a photo of him as a zombie with a bullet hole in 
his head?'

'Someone should 
send this to the US Secret Service,' the blog post concluded. The Secret
Service is in charge of the president's security.

'We are aware of the situation,' said George Ogilvie, a Secret Service spokesman in Washington.

No laughing matter: The Loudon GOP offered an apology to President Obama for the image

The
picture by the Loudoun GOP is the red, white and blue image of Obama 
gazing upward that, emblazoned with the caption 'HOPE,' became a 
ubiquitous Obama poster during his 2008 campaign.

It
was created from a copyrighted AP photo taken in 2006 when Obama was a 
U.S. senator appearing at the National Press Club in Washington. 

The AP sued over the unlicensed, uncredited and uncompensated use of its photo. The litigation was settled earlier this year.
