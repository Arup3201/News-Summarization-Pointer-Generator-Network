NBC has announced plans to introduce Matrix-style replays into its coverage of pro football.

They will use freeD™ system by Replay Technologies that have been used in PGA golf shows.

This comes after Japanese television network NHK announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion.

Saturday Night Football will use the 360 degree technology to capture the action in both end zones

The move will give fans a complete view of the events, reported Peta Pixel.

Sunday Night Football, the most watched show on television, will use one 24-camera bullet time rig at each end zone.

The technology will be installed by the first game in September between the Giants and Cowboys in Dallas.

It will ensure that there is a back-up in case a referee makes a controversial or incorrect decision.

NBC announced that they will use the technology from September

NBC’s Cris Collinsworth: ‘We're trying to be a show that really appeals to everybody.

‘We're trying to [show] human beings behind the facemasks.’

NHK last month said they would use a robotic multi-camera system that has been developed in Japan and can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles.

A computer can then stitch the 
individual images together to create a video clip of that scene, which 
can sped up or slowed down.

The
 effect the system creates is called 'bullet time' and is the same 
effect used in 1999 film The Matrix in which the main character Neo is 
shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the 
audience 360-degrees around the shot.

NHK's system uses eight cameras, each one used for various pans, tilts and zooms.

These eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action.

Each of the remote-controlled 'Hi-Vision' HDTV cameras is equipped with 
two motors for left-right pans, up-down tilts and zooms.

Bullet Time is also known as frozen time, the big freeze, dead time, flow motion, or time slice.

It is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable-speeds, such as  slow motion and time-lapse photography.

It is used in films, adverts and video games.

Bullet Time slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience's point of view.

This isn't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place. 

This makes it impossible. 

The term 'bullet time' is a registered trademark of Warner Bros who first used it in March 2005 in the video game The Matrix Online.

It was also used to promote the 1999 The Matrix film.

As the main camera moves, the eight cameras follow the action with it, pointed at different angles.

This lets the cameras keep up with quickly moving players and provide multi-view imaging of the same event.

This
 makes it possible for a single cameraman to operate all of the cameras 
and have them all pointing at the same moving object.

The
 images are then automatically stitched together into video feeds and 
can be used within minutes for analysis during live sporting events.

The broadcaster plans to trial the 
camera set-up during sports matches to check for fouls and when balls 
leave the court or pitch, for example.

The
 system could also be used as an alternative to the Hawk Eye system that
 can slow down images during sports matches for analysis and refereeing 
decisions.

NHK's system is similar to the set-up used by the Wachowski brothers during the filming of their 1999 film The Matrix. 

Various scenes in the film are shown in slow-motion and the camera pans around a single shot.

This led to the term 'bullet time' being coined and trademarked by Warner Bros, the film's distributor. 

Bullet Time is also known as frozen time, the big freeze, dead time, flow motion, or time slice.

The technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th-century experiments by Eadweard Muybridge. He used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse

Multi-view imaging involves surrounding the objects, such as sports players, with a number of cameras.

These cameras can provide a virtual all-round view of the object at any one time.

Traditional cameras and systems can only capture objects from a limited number of viewpoints.

To capture the full 360-degree view, 
the cameras would have to travel around the object at the same speed at 
which the event happens which is impossible and would blur any images 
created.

NHK designed the system to reduce the size of remote-controlled cameras currently used and speed up the capturing process.

They showcased it at the NHK Science and Technology Research Labs Open House at the start of June.

The technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th-century experiments by Eadweard Muybridge.

He used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse.

Muybridge placed still cameras along a racetrack and each camera was attached to a piece of string stretched across the track.

As the horse galloped passed the camera shutters snapped taking one frame of the galloping horse at a time.
