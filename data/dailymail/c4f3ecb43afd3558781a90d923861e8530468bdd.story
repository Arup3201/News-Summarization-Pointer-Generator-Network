You would not be the only one thinking Halloween is back when looking at this creepy gathering of demon-children, a possessed little girl and adults with vacant stares.

However, this is not a an Addams holiday snap, but the official portrait of three generations of the Danish royal family.

The painting of Queen Margrethe II, her two sons and their families has been accused of bearing a closer resemblance to a horror film poster than a royal portrait.

The royal Addams family: From left to right are: Princess Isabella, Crown Prince Frederik holding Prince Vincent, Princess Mary holding Princess Josephine, Queen Margrethe II, Prince Christian, Queen Margrethe's husband Prince Henrik, Prince Henrik - son of Joachim, Princess Marie holding Princess Athena, Princes Nikolai and Felix from Joachim's first marriage and last - but not least - Prince Joachim

'Is the Danish Royal Family starring in a sequel to The Omen?,' one Twitter user posted in response to the image.

The portrait sees the young Prince Christian, second in line to the Danish throne, stand in the foreground with visible bags underneath his eyes and an eerie glow around him.

Next to him, on the floor, sits his sister Isabella, who has been turned from her normal adorable cherub-self into a creepy come-alive doll creature with blue-brown lips, rubbing her hands.

In the background on the right are Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian wife Princess Mary, holding their two youngest - twins Vincent and Isabella.

Left are Prince Joachim and his French princess Marie, holding their young daughter Princess Athena. Both wives are staring at their children, while their husbands take a regal stand and stare into the distance, a rather unconventional interpretation of the role of a woman in a country proud to be one of the world’s most gender neutral nations.

In a better light: From left to right are Prince Joachim, his sons Prince Felix and Prince Nikolai, Queen Margrethe II, Crown Prince Frederik holding Prince Christian, and Crown Princess Mary, in 2006

The only three to have eye contact with the viewer are the Queen, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Christian as current or future rulers of Denmark.

On the floor playing with Denmark's pride and joy - Lego - are Prince Felix and Prince Nikolai, the two sons from Prince Joachim's first marriage to Hong Kong-born Briton Alexandra Manley, now Countess Alexandra of Frederiksborg.

The Lego is said to symbolise the two young boys rebuilding their lives following their parents divorce.

The couple standing in the ruins in the background is the painter Tomas Kluge and his wife.

Responsible: Artist Thomas Kluge, who painted himself into the picture, with his new portrait of the Danish Royal Family displayed at the Amalienborg Museum in Denmark

‘It is a bit creepy with the children, 
but that disappears when you have studied the image for a while,’ ’ art 
expert Dennis Dahlqvist told Aftonbladet.

‘It is an interesting image
which is party very photographic but which has borrowed light and 
colour from Dutch 17th century painting.

‘The first thing which hits 
me is that you can see the Queen’s hands very clearly displayed, and it 
is traditionally so, that royals show them to show their decisiveness.’

Denmark is one of the oldest European royal families on register and have been ruled by the same house since 1448.
