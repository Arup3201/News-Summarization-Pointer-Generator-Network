Parents have hit out at a junior school which took pupils as young as nine to an art gallery displaying explicit images of naked women and dead bodies.

Children from Hafren Junior School were invited to Oriel Davies Gallery in Newtown in Powys, Wales, to see their own artwork, which had been placed on display.

But part of the visit included a tour of the gallery’s own collection - including a collection horrifying images of women who appeared to have died violently.

Horrified: Parents have hit out at Hafren Junior School for taking their children to Oriel Davies Gallery in Powys, Wales, where images of women who had died violently were displaying alongside the pupils' artwork

One shocking image in the gallery shows a bed splattered with blood stains and another appears to show the body of a dead woman slumped on a river bank.

There were also several pieces of artwork involving nudity and angry parents have described the images as 'vulgar' and 'pornographic'.

Stephanie Lockwood said she was horrified that the school had deemed the gallery an appropriate place for her 10-year-old daughter to visit.

She fumed: 'I was mortified when I was told what she had seen. Some of the children on the trip were as young as nine.

'While at the gallery my daughter was shown what I would say is pornographic disturbing pictures.

'She is 10 years old and other class friends who also went were nine years old.

'When she came from school she told me what she had seen so I went to see the images my self. I was mortified.

'As well as the pictures there is also a video of a naked man covered in white and red paint, also there where images on the wall of what was made to look like dead people.

'I am horrified that Hafren School and the Oriel Gallery would expose my 10-year-old to these images.'

Scarred: Children came home to their parents horrified after seeing an image of a blood-splattered bed and another of a naked woman slumped over the river bank in a series that the gallery defends as 'a visual display of fragility'

Apology: The school for three- to 11-year-olds has been forced to apologise for the trip

Another mother, whose 10-year-old son was on the trip, added: 'It is a disgrace, surely they should have checked it out first.

'That way they could have let us know what was there and each parent could have decided if they wanted their child to go.

'My son has asked a lot of questions about death since looking at those horrible and vulgar images. He’s been scarred for life.

'It shook him up, he’s used to watching Austin and Ally or Good Luck Charlie on the Disney channel - not seeing blood soaked naked women.'

Father-of-two Derek Lowe, 44, added: 'I don’t think it is right that a junior school is taking young children to view that sort of thing.

'It’s something that could corrupt young minds and stay with them for a while.

'I cannot understand their decision to take them to this sort of exhibition without doing a bit of research first.'

Defending the work on display, gallery director Amanda Farr said it was connected to visual artists who work with theatre, films and opera.

She added: 'This exhibition is concerned with human endurance, vulnerability and the fragility of the human body.

'The exhibition is about visual artists who work with the stage.

'This includes artists who design stage sets for film, opera and the theatre, and also performance artists - some of whom use their bodies as part of their art.

'The exhibition contains one video piece by Philip Lee and some photographs of performance artists, Franko B and Anne Louise Wilson.

'These have images of the artists without clothes on.

'Oriel Davies also had a live performance by Philip Lee at the exhibition’s opening, and those who saw his performance found it a very moving and thoughtful artwork.

'It is our role as a public art gallery to show contemporary visual art in its different guises and forms, and we include performance art within this.'

Headteacher Huw Jones said the gallery had an education officer who explained the context of the artwork but admitted that some parents had expressed concerns.

He said: 'The school embraces opportunities for its pupils to experience art and culture as part of the national curriculum in Wales.

Complaints: Parents at Hafren Junior School complained they were not warned what would be on display

'After seeing their own work they were then shown a selection of artwork from the gallery’s own exhibition which is open to the general public.

'Some art did show nudity and surrealism but the gallery education officer, who works with schools and planned this event, was careful to explain the artwork and the context that it was to be viewed in.

'Some parents of children in our school have expressed concern about the exhibition and in light of this we have decided that no more pupils will view this particular artwork and Hafren School would like to apologise for any distress caused.'

Hafren Junior School is a state school for boys and girls aged from three to 11 with 186 pupils on the books.

It is situated in the centre of Newtown - a historic town in the Mid-Wales countryside - on the banks of the River Severn.
