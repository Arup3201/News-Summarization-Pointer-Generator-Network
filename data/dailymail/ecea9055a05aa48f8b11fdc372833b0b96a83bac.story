Just days after reports claimed Apple was halving production of its iPhone 5C because of 'dismal sales' in China, new figures show the model may equally be floundering in the U.S. too.

Figures from a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners survey show that during last month, the iPhone 5C accounted for just 27 per cent of Apple's total iPhone sales.

This is half the amount of 5S models sold, at 64 per cent, and only three times the amount of sales for the two-year-old iPhone 4S handset, at 9 per cent.

Analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners shows Apple is selling twice as many higher-end 5S phones than its lower-priced 5C in the U.S. The 5S accounted for 64% of sales, pictured, while the 5C made up 27% and the iPhone 4S came third with 9%

Official figures from Apple claim the tech giant sold nine million new 5S and 5C handsets during the first three days on sale.

These figures smashed the firm's own records - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or around 2083 a minute.

Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012.

However, only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't made available in China immediately.

Despite the success of the 5S, figures also show it couldn't match the amount of iPhone 5 sales during the same period last year. 

The iPhone 5 debuted at 68 per cent - four per cent more than the current high-end model.

The news comes just days after Chinese 
website C Technology reported sales of the cheaper iPhone 5C have been 'dismal'.

It added Apple is believed to have halved production of the model as a result.

Suppliers claim they have gone from making 300,000 handsets a day, on 
average, to just 150,000 and there are also reports prices are dropping 
across the region in a bid to attract buyers.

The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time Apple had made the handsets available in China from launch.

Previously, Apple launched handsets in key regions including the UK and the U.S and would roll out the handsets to other areas, including China, in the following months.

C Technology claim that although the iPhone 5C was touted as a cheaper option, it costs a similar amount and has 'no particular highlights - making it unappealing to new buyers.

The site adds that although prices of the iPhone 5S have remained high, the cost of the iPhone 5C has also dipped in certain areas from 4,488 yuan (£459) to 3,500 yuan (£358).

Official Apple figures show the firm sold nine million iPhone 5S and 5C, pictured, handsets during the first three days they were on sale. However, Apple did not say what proportion of this amount was for each model. Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012

In an investor note last week, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said: 'During our visit to Apple stores and resellers this week in China, we have found that there is healthy interest in the iPhone 5C.

'However, we believe this has not yet translated into exciting volume levels in China.'

He continued that Apple would need to reduce the price further to attract new buyers, claiming demand had been 'soft.'

When the company unveiled the iPhone 5S and 5C at the start of September, shares fell by around five per cent.

Following the launch a week later, shares rose more than 5 per cent to $493.47, and counteracted the initial losses.

Last
year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in
September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this
year's two - and it wasn't sold in China from launch.

Apple was unavailable for comment.

An inside source has told Chinese website C Technology that sales of the cheaper iPhone 5C, pictured, have been 'dismal' and Apple has had to halve production of the plastic model. Suppliers claim they have gone from making 300,000 handsets a day, on average, to just 150,000
