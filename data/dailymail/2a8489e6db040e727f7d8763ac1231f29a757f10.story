Shock jock Don Imus  asked Joan Rivers' personal doctor 'who the effin idiot was' who went  to the clinic' with her on the day she died  – before finding out it was her.

The veteran broadcaster revealed that he had been a patient of Dr Gwen Korovin, a Manhattan doctor 'known as the throat specialist to the stars' for decades and recently went to visit her.

However, during his conversation, he was unaware that Dr Korovin had been Rivers' personal doctor and she was the one who went with the star to Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28.

Conversation: Don Imus has told how he could not get Dr Gwen Korovin to talk about Joan Rivers sudden death

Response: The 56-year-old, pictured outside her Manhattan home this weekend, has released a statement via her lawyers which says she cannot comment on the tragic incident which led to the 81-year-old's death

Tragic: It has been reported that Joan Rivers vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest

Imus told listeners of his 'Imus in the Morning' show that she refused to say a word about the star's tragic death when he quizzed her for more information on what could had gone wrong. 

And the 56-year-old Manhattan doctor, who specializes in ear, nose and throat procedures kept quiet despite allegedly being linked to the throat biopsy that led to Rivers' heart attack.

On Friday's show, he said: ‘So I said, 'Why wouldn't' Joan Rivers see somebody like you?'

‘Who was the 'effin idiot who went with her to the clinic?' he recalled asking.

‘What did she say?’ his show sidekick Bernie McGuirk asked.

‘She didn't say anything, of course,’ Imus replied.

A few days later, Imus said he realized his mistake. 

Rivers arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28.

The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.  

The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin. 

According to CNN, Dr Korovin allegedly snapped a selfie with Rivers while the 81-year-old was under anesthesia. 

But Imus said he couldn't imagine Dr Korovin, whom he called a ‘marvelous physician,’ stopping the procedure to snap a pic.

Imus said: ‘I would bet a lot of money she didn't take a selfie. Why would she need to take a selfie?’

Dr Korovin counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients.

She proudly boasts a wall full of thank you notes from some of Hollywood's biggest stars.

But it has been reported that during Rivers visit, her vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest.   

The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic but never regained consciousness and died days later on September 4 after being taken off life support.

Yet Imus said he was surprised to hear Dr Korovin would have performed a biopsy.  

He revealed that a few years ago, she had discovered a lump and 'white stuff' on his vocal cords, but sent him to another doctor to get a biopsy. 

‘If she did biopsies, why didn't she do one on me? She had plenty of opportunity,’ he said. 

Imus said he plans to continue seeing Dr Korovin despite her alleged connection to Rivers death. 

‘I will continue to see her. Unless she says lets go over to the clinic,’ he said jokingly.

Dr Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident.

Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman said in the statement that she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident further.

It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. 

'She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment.'
