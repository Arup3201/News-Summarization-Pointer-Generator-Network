Somalia's al-Shabaab group has banned samosas after ruling the popular snacks are 'offensive' and too Christian.

Militant Islamist fighters last week used vehicles mounted with loudspeakers to announce the bizarre ruling across the regions of the war-torn country it controls.

The extremist group has offered no official explanation for the ban on the triangular snacks, which are commonly cooked up and served across the Horn of Africa.

'Offensive': The samosa is said upset militant Islamists due to a supposed resemblance to the Christian Holy Trinity

The bizarre ban comes just days after militants linked to Al-Qaida in Somalia refused to let some aid workers into the country as tens of thousands suffered in the nation's massive famine.

Aid groups including the UN Food Programme say they were not given permission by militants to provide aid in the country, where it has been warned that 800,000 children could die from starvation.

It is now thought islamist militants have taken offence at the three-sided samosa's supposed resemblance to symbol of the Christian Holy Trinity.

Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper today reported that residents of the Somali town of Afgoye, 20 miles south of the capital Mogadishu, had confirmed the samosa ban had been imposed.

The fried snacks, usually filled with spicy meat or vegetables, have been served for centuries in the East African country.

But the newspaper said locals believed al-Shabaab leaders had decided the triangular shape was not compatible with their strict version of Islam.

The unexpected move means Somalis could now expect to be punished if caught cooking, buying or eating samosas, known locally as sambusas.

The ban is the latest in a string of authoritarian rulings introduced by al-Shabaab, a violent Islamist organisation linked to al-Qaeda and classified by several countries as a terrorist group.

The
 word 'samosa' derives from the Persian 'sanbosag'. It is referred to as
 'sambusak' or a similar variation in most parts of the Arabic-speaking 
world.

The snack is thought to have 
originated in Central Asia before the 10th century and was introduced to
 the Indian subcontinent around 1300 by traders in the region.

Records from the 14th century 
describe a 'small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachio, 
walnuts and spices', served before the third course.

The snack, popular in South Asia for centuries, then gained popularity when bought to India by Muslim traders and soldiers.

The crispy meat-filled samosa made today was then made around campfires and saved by travelers as snacks for long journeys.

The extremist army has taken command of several provinces of Somalia and is fighting the country's official government for total control.

However it has been widely criticised for its strict enforcement of Shariah law and unmerciful treatment of the population.

Resemblance: Islamic militants say samosas look like the Christian Holy Trinity

At the weekend the organisation sparked outrage after saying it would refuse to allow overseas aid agencies into drought-hit parts of Somalia.

The UN last week declared a famine in two parts of the country and warned millions face death from starvation.

Al-Shabaab had previously suggested it would allow foreign agencies to bring in vital food aid to prevent its people from dying.

But on Friday the group denied the 
famine even existed and accused Western governments of inventing the 
crisis as a propaganda tool.

The organisation also warned foreign agencies were still banned in the regions of Somalia it controlled.

Experts
 have warned the group's refusal to acknowledge the food crisis could 
cause millions of unnecessary deaths as people struggle to find food 
amid a devastating drought.

The
 reported ban on samosas is the latest in a string of bizarre rulings 
from the organisation, which has been likened to the Afghan Taliban.

Earlier this year the group introduced a blanket ban on the playing or watching of football.

It
 has also previously ordered men to grow beards and warned it will take 
action against anyone caught wearing tight-fitting clothes.
