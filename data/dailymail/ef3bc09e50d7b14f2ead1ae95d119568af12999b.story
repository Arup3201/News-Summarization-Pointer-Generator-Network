With the birth of the Royal baby set to happen any day now, Kate and William may be hoping their newborn is a girl if the latest research is anything to go by.

British parents have revealed that their darling offspring are costing them a King’s ransom in replacing and repairing everyday items and it's little boys who are the biggest culprits.

According to the latest research, boys under the age of five cause over three times more damage than girls in the home.

Additionally, almost half of parents stated that two-year-olds are deemed to be the biggest culprits of accidental damage to items.

When it came to calculating the average cost of damage caused by curiously-minded kids, parents estimated they had to fork out up to £1,764 each replacing and repairing broken items during their child’s first five years.

This is the equivalent of buying a one week family holiday for two adults and one toddler in Spain.

A third of parents polled said their children damaged goods by dropping or smashing them, and over a quarter said their child had ruined household items by spilling a drink on something.

Gareth Lane, Head of Home Insurance at Confused.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'Our advice to new parents is to toddler proof their home and keep a particularly watchful eye out - especially if the baby is a boy.

The regions where children caused the most damage include, in order of rank:

1. London (23.85 per cent)
2. North West (12.70 per cent)
3. West Midlands (10.15 per cent)
4. Yorkshire & The Humber (9.90 per cent)
5. South West (8.95 per cent) 

'As our research shows, breakages caused by children happen all the time.

'With the right preventative measures such as keeping pricey items out of sight and out of reach from children (and adding cover for accidental damage to your home contents insurance policy) parents will be less out of pocket.'

The research also found the top five items that proud new parents may have to replace, including damaged clothing (30 per cent), blemished walls painted or wallpapered (28 per cent), spoiled jewellery (23 per cent), smashed ornaments (22 per cent) and a broken phone (21 per cent).

The most expensive ruined goods include gadgets such as a tablet, laptop or computer with over a third of parents citing these as the most costly possessions needing replacement as a result of their offspring's handiwork.

When it came to finding out which region’s children caused the most domestic havoc, almost a quarter of London’s toddlers caused damage, compared to well-behaved youngsters in Northern Ireland who ranked in at just under 2 per cent.
