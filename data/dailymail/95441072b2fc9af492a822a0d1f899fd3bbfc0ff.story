Arrest: Courtney Lynn Stewart's son weighed less than 15 pounds when she took him to hospital

A 24-year-old mother starved and abused her three-year-old twin sons, leaving one so malnourished that he weighed less than 15 pounds, authorities have said.

Courtney Lynn Stewart's other son was also found to be badly malnourished and with a fractured jaw when police went to her Murietta, California home, they said on Wednesday.

Authorities began investigating the young mother after the Rancho Springs Hospital contacted police when one of the boys was taken to the hospital in critical condition on November 7.

Staff said the boy weighed less than 15 pounds and had suspicious bruises over his body.

The youngster was rushed to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition, officials said

Investigators then visited Stewart's home and found the boy's twin brother, who was severely malnourished.

He had been medically neglected and had a fractured jaw, police said.

He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is now under the care of Riverside County Child Protective Services.

Stewart has been arrested and charged on suspicion of willful harm or injury to a child and corporal punishment or injury to a child and remains in jail. 

Scene: When police went to her home in Murietta, California (the neighborhood is pictured), they found her second twin son with a broken jaw. He was also malnourished and has been hospitalized

Neighbors told NBC Los Angeles that she had another, older boy but that they never saw the younger two children.

'Never saw the two little ones, only the older one,' the shocked neighbor said. That is just insane, that is horrible.'

Anyone with any information is asked to call Detective Jeremy Durant with the Murrieta Police Department at 951-461-6354.
