A suspected US drone strike Saturday in central Yemen killed three men believed to be al-Qaida militants, security officials said.

The officials said the attack took place in the town of Bijan in Yemen's Shabwa province and that the nationalities of the men killed had not been established. 

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists.

Saturday's drone strike reportedly killed three men believed to be al-Qaida militants in the town of Bijan, in Yemen's Shabwa province

The U.S. has launched several strikes in recent weeks, reflecting Washington's resolve to keep fighting the militants despite Yemen's political paralysis. 

The Shiite Huthi militia effectively placed President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi under house arrest in January but last week he escaped to the southern city of Aden.

Despite the turmoil, President Barack Obama vowed on January 25 not to let up in the US campaign against jihadists in the strife-torn Arabian Peninsula country.

Within a week, a U.S. drone strike killed Harith al-Nadhari, a senior Al-Qaeda figure, and three other militants in Shabwa province, the jihadist network said on Twitter. 

Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, as its Yemeni affiliate is known, is considered by Washington as the network's most dangerous franchise.

Meanwhile Saturday, the Shiite rebels who control Yemen's capital, Sanaa, signed an agreement with Iranian authorities in Tehran to set up direct flights between the two countries, the nation's official news agency reported.

The memorandum of understanding between aviation officials from the two countries calls for 14 flights per week from each side, according to the SABA news agency, controlled by the Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Officials also discussed training for Yemenis in the aviation sector, it added.

The rebels, who stormed into the capital, Sanaa, last September, are widely believed to have support from regional Shiite power Iran. 

Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi managed to escape Sanaa and house arrest at the hands of the rebels and has established a base in the southern city of Aden, from where he says he is still the country's rightful ruler.

Also Saturday, Bahrain announced it was relocating its embassy in Yemen to Aden, a move aimed at supporting Hadi. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have done the same since Friday.

Thousands of anti-Houthi protesters also marched in five provinces — Taiz, Ibb, Dhamar, Sanaa and Hodeida.
