After scoring Gillingham's winning penalty at Colchester in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy second round on Tuesday night goalkeeper Stuart Nelson found himself in a spot of bother.

The Gills' team coach left without the evening's hero while he was describing his moment of glory to the media.

Team-mate Jermaine McGlashan revealed the mix-up on Twitter, posting: 'Stuart Nelson may have missed the team bus and joined the media car to get home but what a return!'

The 33-year-old keeper wasn't left standing alone for long as he hitched a lift home with the media team - which was lucky, seeing as Gillingham and Colchester are a 70-mile drive apart.

Nelson was a surprise inclusion in the team after spending two months on the sidelines with an injury, but was thrown into action to make his 100th appearance for the club in a match Gillingham won 4-2 on penalties after it had finished 3-3.

The game itself saw former West Ham striker Freddie Sears score the hosts' third to force the game into a penalty shootout with three minutes left to play.

Colchester's George Moncur and Tom Eastman both missed from the spot, leaving Nelson to step up and put his side through to the next round.
