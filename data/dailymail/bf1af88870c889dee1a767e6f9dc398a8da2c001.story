Clutching a razor-sharp bayonet, the British infantryman peered nervously over the parapet of the First World War trench and into No Man’s Land.

Less than 100 yards away was the enemy frontline - conjuring up terrifying images of the hearing the sergeant’s shrill whistle, going ‘over the top’, and risking death charging headlong into a hail of murderous German machine gun fire.

But Rifleman Stuart Gray, 35, serving with the 4th Battalion The Rifles, was not preparing to make the ultimate sacrifice, and this was not the Great War.

History: Stuart Gray, of 4th Battalion The Rifles, inspects the front line trench of a newly discovered practice WW1 battlefield in Gosport, Hampshire. Historians say it is the best-preserved of its kind ever found

Instead, a century after the start of the bloody 1914-18 conflict, historians have discovered an entire mock battlefield used to train tens of thousands of troops about to deploy to the Western Front.

Covering an area the size of 17 football pitches in Gosport, Hampshire, the site contains the remains of two opposing trench systems, each with a 200-metre long frontline, supply trenches and dug-outs, separated by a No Man’s Land.

Experts say the site, on heathland, is the best preserved example of its kind in the UK.

Brave young men from across the UK, Canada and the U.S. would have travelled to the training ground learn how to fight in the mud and cold of the trenches.

Instructors would have taught soldiers how to run quickly along the trenches - dug in a zig-zag to reduce the deadly risk of direct hits from shells – go ‘over the top’, put on gas masks and face live fire. Pieces of exploded grenade are still being found at the site.

But over the years Browntown Heath became overgrown with gorse bushes and forgotten, used by local people for picnics.

Rfl Gray – who has fought in Afghanistan – said standing in the practice trenches had given him an inkling of the conditions endured by his forebears in the infantry.

He said: ‘It’s difficult walking up and down the trenches today so to do it in a war would be something else. Going over the top would be pretty scary. I have loads of respect for the guys in the First World War.’

The site was discovered in autumn by Rob Harper, a conservation officer with Gosport Borough Council, who spotted a set of strange lines on an aerial photograph from the 1950s and went to investigate.

Mr Harper, 48, said: ‘I found myself walking along a ditch and realised it was part of an elaborate trench system, hidden for all these years by bracken and gorse. I looked around and there were trenches everywhere. It’s quite jaw-dropping.

‘It brings home a sense of loss and emotion. I have five relatives buried on the Western Front. Did any of them train here? So many soldiers must have passed through on their way to sacrifice their lives.’

TV historian Dan Snow, president of the Council for British Archaeology, said: ‘I never thought I would see something this large in the UK. It's an entire replica World War One battlefield.

Tens of thousands of soldiers would have trained in the mock battlefield, the size of 17 football pitches. Pictured: Soldiers led by Army reservist Captain Leanne Christmas retrace the steps of those 100 years ago

‘It shows how seriously Britain took the business of training. They had to send the guys to France ready to do the hardest of tasks, to defeat the German army when they were dug in with deep trenches, artillery, machine guns and they had to break that deadlock.

‘This shows that these guys weren’t just rounded up from industrial towns and carted to the Western front to be chucked at the machineguns. They were learning new tactics and techniques and using new equipment, and this gave them the best chance of success and, ultimately victory.

‘The training experience would have been as realistic as possible: cold, wet, sleep deprivation, dodgy food, people firing live ammunition. It would have got the troops used to all the sounds and smells of battle. But by the end of the war the British Army was the finest in the world.’

Wayne Cocroft, English Heritage’s First World War expert, said: ‘Buildings from Tudor, Georgian, Victorian times…these are all well documented. But the built history of the First World War in England is virtually a blank chapter.’

Experts are now working to map and record the practice battlefield for posterity as well as trying to discover which regiments might have trained there.

The find marks the start of Home Front Legacy 1914-18, a project on which English Heritage and the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) are working together to document and record key sites on the home front that helped Britain win the First World War.

They are trying to identify former drill halls, requisitioned factories and farm buildings, pill boxes, secret listening stations, prisoner-of-war camps and gun emplacements.

The aim of the Home Front Legacy 1914-18 campaign is to bring marry national expertise with people’s local knowledge to record the remains of the war in the UK.
