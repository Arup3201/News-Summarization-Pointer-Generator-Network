A pop-up restaurant event selling dinners requested by prisoners on death row is under pressure to shut before it even opens after a barrage of criticism.

The event, called Death Row Dinners, was due to open in trendy Hoxton Square, East London next month - charging customers £50 for their 'last meal'.

But organisers are now reconsidering their plans after an online backlash.

The event, called Death Row Dinners, was due to open in trendy Hoxton Square, East London next month - charging customers £50 for their 'last meal'. It was advertised using images like the one above

Backlash: Images of apparent prisoners photographed with their last meal requests printed on cards around their necks were used to promote the pop-up event, which promised to serve customers 'a five course feast'

Planned location: The ticketed event was set to take place in London's trendy Hoxton Square, pictured, for a limited number of nights next month. A Facebook page calling for the plans to be cancelled has been set up

Chefs were to cook 'a five course feast of their culinary twists on some of death rows most interesting and popular last dinners', according to a statement from the organisers.

It adds: 'Prepare to be charged, sentenced, searched and frisked.'

The event, which is set to run for a limited number of nights, was promoted with pictures of men, apparently prisoners, with menus around their necks.

But after a wave of criticism the organisers have placed a statement on its website saying: 'We're shocked and saddened by the response to Death Row Dinners and are genuinely very sorry for any offence caused.

'The pop up is intended to explore the concept of last meals; anyone who has ever been to a dinner party has probably had this conversation - what would they love their last meal to be.

'In light of the response to the idea we are considering our next steps and will update everyone with our decision.'

Criticism: Primrose Prints was just one of the Twitter users that used the social network to voice their concerns over the idea. The pop-up event was set to run for a limited number of nights

Apology: In the wake of a wave of criticism, organisers posted a statement online that said: 'We're shocked and saddened by the response to Death Row Dinners and are genuinely very sorry for any offence caused.'

Under fire: Organisers of the event, which is selling tickets through website eventbrite, released this statement following the online backlash. Many who were offended took to Twitter to condemn the idea

Many of those offended by the concept took to social media to express their anger at the restaurant's decision.

Richard Hughes said: 'The next step should be to call it off totally.'

A user called Seta said: 'Your apology's hollow. If you are still gonna profit from the thing you think should be apologised for. Gonna [sic] cancel it?'

Primrose Prints wrote: 'Using pictures of people who were executed with menus round their necks, how on earth did you think that was OK?'

Linka said: 'The entire concept is appalling.'
