She's about to hit her half century, has been modelling since the 1980s and has three children but one look at Yasmin Le Bon's new campaign and you'd never guess it.

The supermodel has been unveiled as the new face - and incredibly toned body - of the Speedo Sculpture swimwear collection.

As well as posing poolside to showcase the new range, the 49-year-old has also revealed her industry secrets, which are dedicated to helping women feel confident in their swimwear this summer.
