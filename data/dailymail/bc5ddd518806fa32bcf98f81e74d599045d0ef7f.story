A baby beluga whale, thought to have been only two days old when it was found stranded after a storm, has died despite round-the-clock efforts to save its life.

The male calf died at the Alaska SeaLife Center, where it was being cared for by mammal specialists from four different marine centres.

It was taken in by the research aquarium last month after it was separated from its mother following a storm in Alaska's Bristol Bay.

Care: A marine expert feeds the beluga whale from a bottle. Specialists worked around the clock to help the mammal, but it died less than month after it was rescued

Officials at the centre, in Seward, 
Alaska, said the whale died in the early hours of Monday, a few hours 
after it became clear that its condition was declining.

They said the calf would never have survived for as long as it did were it not for the care that teams of experts provided.

It was believed to be the first baby beluga rescue in the US, at least since federal record keeping began in 1972.

In
a statement, the centre's president and chief executive, Tara Riemer 
Jones, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of this beluga calf.

'But we are incredibly proud of the care that the multi-institution animal and veterinary team provided.

'The
knowledge they brought from the whales in their care at their home 
institutions allowed us to provide the best medical and animal care 
possible to this calf.

'There
is more we will continue to learn about beluga whales as a result of 
this loss that will ultimately benefit beluga whales in the marine 
mammal community and in the wild.'

Unable to survive: The baby beluga whale died at the Alaska SeaLife Center, where it was being cared for by marine mammal specialists from four different centres

The calf was found on June 18 near South Naknek, Alaska, where no other beluga whales could be seen in the immediate vicinity.

Witnesses called the Alaska SeaLife Center, where staff were authorised to attempt a rescue.

The calf was then flown 90 miles from South Naknek to Seward in a plane.

It was placed on an air mattress throughout the journey and positioned so its vital organs would not be damaged under its own weight.

Progress: Experts hope to learn more about the species so that beluga whales at mammal centres and in the wild can receive more support

Staff vet Carrie Goertz said at the time: 'The calf is swimming on his own, cooperating with feedings, and breathing regularly, which are all very positive signs.

'However, there are tremendous hurdles ahead. Because this animal is extremely young, it is at a very high risk of complications.'

On arriving at the aquarium, the whale remained in critical care but it learned to take food from a bottle and started putting on weight.

It was five feet long and weighed 115lbs - 5lbs more than it did on arrival.

Vets were today due to carry out a full necropsy on the whale's remains in the hope of determining the cause of death.

However, staff have admitted further tests are likely to follow in the coming months and they may never know why the whale died.

The Alaska SeaLife Center is the only permanent marine rehabilitation center in Alaska, responding to stranded wildlife such as sea otters, harbor seals, and whales.
