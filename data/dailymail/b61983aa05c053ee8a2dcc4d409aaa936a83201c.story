At the age of ten English children are on a par with the brightest in Taiwan and Hong Kong

England's brightest primary school children are lagging two years behind their counterparts in the Far East by the time they take GCSE maths, a study shows.

The cleverest youngsters are as able as those in Taiwan and Hong Kong at age ten.

But they make much less progress while they are at secondary school, between the ages of 11 and 16.

By the time they sit their GCSE maths, the brightest English children are two years behind their counterparts in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The study also found that England’s 
most able youngsters make less progress compared with an average score 
for those of similar abilities across all the 12 places studied: 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Slovenia, Norway, 
Scotland, the US, Italy, Lithuania and Russia.

The
findings, from the Institute of Education in London, will fuel growing 
concern that the country’s cleverest children are being allowed to coast
during secondary education instead of being stretched.

Sir
Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, has already 
ordered a ‘rapid response’ survey of how state schools teach the most 
able youngsters.

Dr John 
Jerrim and Dr Alvaro Choi analysed children’s performance in maths tests
set by the Programme for International Student Assessment and the 
Trends in Mathematics and Science Study.

They
studied the results of the TIMSS tests taken at ages nine/ten in 2003 
and ages 13/14 in 2007 as well as the PISA test for pupils aged 15/16 in
2009. The study focused particularly on the scores of pupils in England
relative to the ‘tiger’ economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong, but also 
examined their performance relative to pupils in the other places.

The difference in the progress of the highest achieving English pupils was most marked in comparison to the East Asian places.

By the time English students reach the age of 16, they are two years behind their counterparts in the Far East

The average scores for all of England’s pupils remained broadly similar to those of the other countries between ages ten and 16.

Dr
Jerrim, from the institute’s department of quantitative social science,
said: ‘At the age of ten, the highest achieving children in England can
match the highest achieving children in Taiwan and almost match the 
highest achieving children in Hong Kong.

‘But the highest achieving children aged 16 in England are about two years behind the highest achieving children in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

‘One reason might be that the curriculum doesn’t stretch the highest achieving children enough in secondary school.’

Another possible explanation for problems in maths is ‘the widespread use of private tuition by East Asian families for both remedial and enrichment purposes’.

The researchers say: ‘This helps to boost the performance of all pupils, including those already performing well at school. In comparison, private tutoring in England is mainly undertaken by a relatively small selection of children from affluent backgrounds, often for remedial purposes.’

Education Secretary Michael Gove launched a back to basics national curriculum where fractions will be introduced at an earlier age

The researchers suggest that the state intervenes through ‘enhanced tuition’ and other schemes for children who excel at school.

Education Minister Elizabeth Truss 
said the report was ‘a damning indictment’ of Labour’s education record.
‘This Government is clearing up Labour’s mess,’ she said. ‘Our reforms 
will drive up standards so our pupils have a first-class education that 
matches the best in the world.’

Education
Secretary Michael Gove recently launched a new back to basics national 
curriculum, which sets out the topics teachers in English state schools 
should cover between the ages of five and 14.

In
maths, five-year-olds will  be introduced to basic fractions  such as 
recognising a half of a  specified length. Currently, fractions are only
introduced around the age of seven.

At
secondary school, there will be a focus on the application of 
mathematical knowledge and skills to solve problems and better 
preparation for post 16 maths. Personal finance will be covered in a new
citizenship curriculum.

Meanwhile,
Government league tables published last month showed that out of 
176,538 high-achieving pupils at primary school, more than half were 
never entered for GCSEs in five basic subject areas at 16.Instead they 
were steered towards subjects seen as less rigorous.

It
means that more than six in ten pupils who were high-fliers in tests at
11 – 108,570 – finished compulsory education without achieving the 
English Baccalaureate: C grades or better in English, maths, two 
sciences, a language and history or geography.
