It was probably unlikely that a TV comedy series about a Muslim community leader would pass without comment.

And so it was that in the region of 200 complaints were made to the BBC yesterday after it broadcast the first episode of Citizen Khan.

It was claimed that the programme ‘takes the mickey out of Islam’, was guilty of ‘stereotypes about Asians’ and was ‘disrespectful to the Koran’.

Controversial: The first episode of BBC comedy series Citizen Khan attracted in the region of 200 complaints

Provocative: The programme's British Muslim creator Adil Ray (second from left) stands with co-stars Bavna Limbachia (left), Maya Sondhi (second from right) and Shobu Kapoor (right)

One scene that particularly provoked anger was where a heavily-made up girl, Mr Khan’s daughter, rushed to put on a hijab and pretended to be reading the Koran when her father entered.

The six-part series, which aired for the first time on BBC1 on Monday at 10.35pm, has been created by British Muslim Adil Ray, who also plays the lead role.

One viewer wrote on the BBC’s messageboard: ‘This is terrible stereotyping, ignorant and just dreadful.’

Another said: ‘HIGHLY disappointed especially when her father walks in and she dis-respectfully opens the Koran!!’

But others defended the show. One 
said: ‘People are reading too much in to Citizen Khan, especially the 
hijab thing, it happens!’

Complaints: The series, which follows the fortunes of a Muslim community leader, has been accused of being 'disrespectful to the Koran'

Family argument: The first episode was about the troubled wedding plans of one of Mr Khan's daughters

‏@Saduf_I: Caked in makeup, a sleeveless top & tight clothes? A pathetic portrayal of a hijabi. The hijab defines modesty. This isn't it. @Sana_Choudery: Why did they have to make the hijabi like that? #citizenkhan Insult to all hijabis! ‏@_Raja_Talat_ : Citizen Khan is very disrespectful.. they crossed the line when they brought religion into it. @MarwaZiane: Citizen Khan is honestly the dumbest show EVER. It's not even funny & quite disrespectful.‏@sayeedahassan1: When will BBC stop with racial sterotyping? Re:citizen khan ‏@Original_Ted: Citizen Khan is just s***, why try make Islam look like that? ‏@kalrlz: I was so disgusted with that Citizen Khan sitcom aired yesterday. Shame on the person who thought of such a concept.‏@j_sabre: Aaliyah on Citizen Khan? That stereotype does exist, it exists for a reason. Because its true! ‏@BAPB00: I watched Citizen Khan.. And it is quite rude and i can see why people are getting offended but its alllllll trueee

The
 series stars former My Family actor Kris Marshall as the mosque manager
 and Shobu Kapoor, who is known for her work on EastEnders, who plays Mr
 Khan’s wife.

The comedy mocks Mr Khan’s self-importance, including his delusions about his position in the community and about his standing in the business world.

Critics have complained that it repeats many stereotypes about British Muslims, with the first episode all about the troubled wedding plans of one of Mr Khan’s daughters, Shazia.

Some claimed while Goodness Gracious Me, the acclaimed BBC2 Asian sketch show, had challenged stereotypes, the new show reinforced them.

The two other writers on the show, Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, had both worked on Goodness Gracious Me.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Citizen Khan has made a very positive start, launching successfully with 3.6million viewers and a 21.5 per cent share in a late-night slot.

'New comedy always provokes differing reactions from the audience. The characters are comic creations and not meant to be representative of the community as a whole.'

In a recent interview with BBC Breakfast, Mr Ray said the show was allowing the Muslim community to laugh at itself.

He said: 'I think it is a great opportunity, with Mr Khan as a Pakistani Muslim and the character, to take that kind of really rich content and laugh at ourselves and I am a firm believer in that.'
