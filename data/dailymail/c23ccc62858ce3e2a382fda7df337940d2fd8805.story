With a sad shake of the head, Chris Sutton laments that the foreign legion has taken over English football.

In his own Blackburn Rovers' heyday — up front alongside Alan Shearer — the talk on Match of the Day was very much centred on 'the SAS'.

The goals of Sutton and Shearer, quickly earning them that tag, ultimately captured the league flag for Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn in 1994-1995, their first title win in 81 years.

But the English top-flight scene of 2014 is now all about Spain's Diego Costa at Chelsea, Manchester City's Argentinian Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal and Chile.

And Sutton believes an over reliance on foreign recruits has driven down the standard of local players, rendering this England side 'underwhelming'.

A lacerating pitch-side pundit with BT Sports, Sutton is unconvinced by goalkeeper Joe Hart and defender Phil Jagielka.

He also thinks midfielder Fabian Delph is no Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard.

Ultimately, though, Sutton blames the English Premier League and its obsession with overseas talent for the roar of the Three Lions being replaced by a whimper.

'English football is a great watch, it's box office — but it's not English players we are raving about,' said former Norwich, Chelsea and Celtic striker Sutton, who picked up just one cap for England. 

'On a Saturday night, when people watch Match Of the Day, they talk about Diego Costa. You don't hear them talking about English players and I think that is a big problem.

'Young English players are finding it harder to get their chance and that has an effect on the national team.

'People talk about changing the manager but Roy Hodgson can only work with what is available to him.

'I don't think there are enough good English players and the current England team is underwhelming.

'They have issues all over the pitch. At the back, I think Joe Hart is under pressure. I like Fraser Forster and I think he deserves an opportunity.

'There are also problems at centre-half. I don't believe Jagielka is good enough to play international football.

'In midfield, they are toying with players to replace Lampard and Gerrard and bringing in the likes of Delph who, to me, isn't an England player.

'Up front, I still like Wayne Rooney. I think he has a big effect on the team and that he gets unfair criticism. But they need to get Daniel Sturridge fit.

'England have a lot to do. I don't think they are up with the best teams in the world, not by a long shot.'

In Brazil last summer, England's endured their worst-ever World Cup, finishing bottom of a group that included Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Under Hodgson, they have won four out of four in an admittedly weak qualifying group and are on the brink of reaching Euro 2016 in double-quick time.

But major finals are where England are judged and Sutton wants affirmative action in their Premier League to help restore the national team's fortunes.

'At the World Cup, there was all this stuff about England in the group of death but I still expected them to qualify.

'You must hit the ground running in big tournaments. England didn't and it cost them.

'Greg Dyke at the FA is trying to sort things out at grass-roots level. He gets criticised but at least he is trying to do something about it.

'But, until there's a bigger quota of English players in club sides, it will keep affecting the national team.

'When clubs name a 25-man squad, around half should be British. That's the sensible way to address things — but it isn't being addressed.'

It is against that bleak backdrop that Sutton believes an England defeat to Scotland tonight would represent 'a disaster' — but 'no surprise'.

He said: 'This game has more significance for England than it does for Scotland.

'I think English people would expect England to win but I'm not so sure they will. Scotland have momentum and are playing with confidence.'
