Humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible damage around the year 1610, scientists claim.

Experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the Earth's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent.

But British researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the New and Old Worlds.

The Anthropocene is the name of a proposed geological epoch that may soon enter the official Geologic Time Scale. 

It refers to a time in which human permanently changed the planet.

According to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS),  we are officially in the Holocene epoch, which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age.

Some experts argue we should now change the name to 'Anthropocene'. This is from from anthropo, for 'man,' and cene, for 'new'.

But up until now, experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the Earth's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent. 

Researchers at UCL said that 1610 - when William Shakespeare's Cymbeline was first performed - marked the start of the human-dominated geological epoch known as the Anthropocene.

Previous epochs began and ended due meteorite strikes, sustained volcanic eruptions and the shifting of the continents.

The study, published in Nature, said human actions are now changing the planet producing a new geological epoch.

But to define an epoch scientists must pinpoint and date a global environmental change that has been captured in natural material, such as rocks, ancient ice or sediment from the ocean floor.

Such a marker - like the chemical signature left by the meteorite strike that wiped out the dinosaurs - is called a golden spike.

Comparing the major environmental impacts of human activity over the past 50,000 years against these two formal requirements just two dates were in the running - 1610 when the impact of the discovery of The Americas began to be felt and 1964.

Scientists said the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas, and subsequent global trade, moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level, resulting in a global re-ordering of life on Earth.

They also found a golden spike that can be dated to the same time - a pronounced dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 and captured in Antarctic ice-core records.

Geologists have named the 1610 dip in carbon dioxide the 'Orbis Spike'.

They chose the Latin word for 'world' because this golden spike was caused by once-disconnected peoples becoming globally linked.

Dr Simon Lewis said: 'In a hundred thousand years scientists will look at the environmental record and know something remarkable happened in the second half of the second millennium.

'They will be in no doubt that these global changes to Earth were caused by their own species.

'Today we can say when those changes began and why.

'The Anthropocene probably began when species jumped continents, starting when the Old World met the New.

'We humans are now a geological power in our own right - as Earth-changing as a meteorite strike.

'Historically, the collision of the Old and New Worlds marks the beginning of the modern world.

'Many historians regard agricultural imports into Europe from the vast new lands of the Americas, alongside the availability of coal, as the two essential precursors of the Industrial Revolution, which in turn unleashed further waves of global environmental changes.

'Geologically, this boundary also marks Earth's last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long-term global warmth of the Anthropocene.'

He added while 1964 saw a peak in radioactive fallout following nuclear weapons testing, it was not - in geological terms - an Earth-changing event.

An official decision on whether to formally recognise the Anthropocene, including when it began, will be triggered by a recommendation of the Anthropocene Working Group of the Subcommission of Quaternary Stratigraphy, due in 2016.
