The five-year-old sister of the toddler killed by a gas explosion which ripped through his home wrote 'I miss you so much' in a poignant letter to her dead brother.

Jodie Heaton wrote the tribute to Jamie, two, who died instantly in the blast in Shaw, Greater Manchester, last week.

The young girl has been unable to sleep following the huge explosion which killed her brother while he was watching Peppa Pig on television.

Tragic: Jamie Heaton, two, who had an older sister Jodie, five, and an older brother Jack, nine, was killed instantly in the blast

The handwritten letter Jodie wrote said: 'To Jamie, I miss you so much. Love from Jodie and Jack.' She added 17 kisses underneath.

On the opposite side of the page she wrote the names of all the Heaton family members with a tick next to Jamie's name to show he had gone to heaven.

Jamie's mother Michelle, who also has an
older son called Jack, aged nine, had feared the explosion may have 
been caused by her lit cigarette. However, she has now been told by 
investigators that it was not responsible for the blast.

Tragic: Mrs Heaton had left Jamie watching Peppa Pig when the blast happened

Mrs Heaton, 31, said Jodie wrote the letter because she was having difficulties sleeping.

'The other morning Jodie came to me at about 5am,' she told The Sun. 'She had little red eyes like she had been crying and she asked me for a pen and paper.

'I gave her them and asked what they were for but she just took it back to bed.'

The mother-of-three, who shared the wrecked home with her husband Kenny, 36, found the letter later the same day and took it to the scene of the blast.

Police are still investigating the cause the devastating explosion.

Agony: The couple had to wait for four hours while rescue teams searched the rubble of their home for two year old Jamie's body

The mother waited for four hours after the blast while they searched through the wrecked home for missing Jamie before she was told she was dead.

Police arrested a 32-year-old gas fitter who is believed to have examined a boiler in one of the affected houses in the days before the disaster. He will answer bail next month.

Officers
are still waiting to speak to the couple's next-door neighbour Anthony 
Partington, 27, who suffered 80 per cent burns when the blast happened 
at his home.

He is under sedation in Wythenshawe hospital and will be questioned when he regains consciousness.

Officers are thought to be probing
claims that Mr Partington had sent a text message threatening to hang 
himself after his partner, Tanya Williams, also 27, walked out on him 
the night before the explosion taking her five children with her.

Last
week the 27-year-old’s family claimed she had fled after suffering 
months of drink-fuelled violence but insisted nothing Mr Partington 
said suggested he could have set off the blast deliberately.

The massive explosion flattened number 
11 Buckley Street, where Jamie lived, and number 9, where Mr Partington 
lived. The two houses are separated by an alleyway.

Surrounding properties were also devastated and structural engineers will check each house before residents can return.

partner Tanya Williams, right, the night before
