Britain's most feckless parent is about to father his 15th child with his 13th lover.

Jobless Jamie Cumming's own mother is now so sick of his philandering ways that she's pleaded with him to stop having babies and start taking responsibility for his actions.

Lorraine, 55, said her son needs to find a job before his 19-year-old girlfriend gives birth so he can start paying maintenance rather than let each mother claim benefits.

Feckless: Jamie Cumming, holding his son's hand, has had 14 children with 13 different women - and another baby is on its way

The 34-year-old's latest lover is due in November but Lorraine has branded her son as 'useless' and said he needs to try to be a decent parent to all his other children before having more.

'I love Jamie and I love all of my grandchildren. But enough it enough. It is time for my son to stop fathering babies and start being a father,' embarrassed Lorraine told The People.

Jamie, from Dundee, has had numerous jobs and has been a barman and a security guard in the past but has never been able to hold down a job.

He first told his mother and his father Harry he was going to become a dad, aged just 17.

'I love Jamie and I love all of my grandchildren. But enough is enough. It is time for my son to stop fathering babies and start being a father.'

His girlfriend Kelly Dulley gave birth to a little girl in February 1995 and everyone believed the couple would go on to get married.

But once the baby was born, Jamie started a relationship with Kelly's cousin.

Their relationship lasted 10 years but the couple struggled to have a baby despite receiving IVF treatment through the NHS.

While they were trying for a baby Jamie had managed to father another child with a woman who gave birth to his first son in 1997.

She has since moved to France and neither Jamie nor his family have seen her or the child since.

'Around the same time in 1997, Jamie got another girl pregnant - Kelly's cousin's pal,' said Lorraine.

Trouble: Jamie is about to father his 15th child with his 13th lover

In November 1998 he fathered another child after a one-night stand with a neighbour's daughter and less than three years later in July 2001 he became a father again.

Fourteen months later his sixth child, a boy, arrived and occasionally Jamie gives some money to the boy's mother but does not contribute towards his other children.

A few months later he fathered a 
seventh son and shortly after that in 2002 another woman gave birth to 
his eighth child, another boy.

In
 2004 Jamie was in new a relationship and together they have three 
children - a seven-year-old, a two-year-old and a 13-month-old baby.

By December 2007 Jamie's tenth child had arrived and five months later his 11th son was born.

Jamie,
 who has five siblings, also fathered a child with an Australian woman 
who took their son back with her after she'd given birth.

Lorraine
 regularly keeps in contact with her 14 grandchildren and often meets 
with their maternal grandparents but she feels humiliated because her 
son is refusing to raise or support his own children.

He
 often spends Christmas day flitting between each of the women and will 
sometimes spend his money buying lavish gifts rather than buying food 
and clothes.

Other relatives have pleaded with him to stop fathering children but they believe he is addicted.

Jamie
 has refused to comment while five of the mothers were unavailable, four
 declined to comment and the others refused to be named.

Kelly Dulley said she could not say anything because she didn't raise her child either.

One of the women who got involved with Jamie Cumming claims he pretends he is available by saying he lives in a battered old caravan.

Paula Ryan, 31, became pregnant with Jamie's son Cayden after they were together for a few months.

She said Jamie would take her away for romantic weekends in Fife and Ayr and claims it was the best relationship she'd ever had.

Ms Ryan said he was extremely affectionate and was a real charmer.

She said she had no idea he was with other women at the same time and only knew about two of his children.

When she fell pregnant five months into the relationship other people told her how many children he had.

Jamie has not contributed financially to her son Cayden's upbringing.
