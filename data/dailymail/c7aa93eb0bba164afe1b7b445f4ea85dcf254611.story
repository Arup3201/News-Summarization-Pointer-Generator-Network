Everyone hopes to one day own their dream home but, short of winning the lottery, it an aspiration out of most peoples' grasp.

However, one young woman has found an ingenious of overcoming these financial obstacles - by building her perfect home in a garage.

Keen designer Stephanie Bertenshaw shelled out just £15,000 designing and renovating the five garages on her parents' land and the new home has now valued at £150,000.

Miss Bertenshaw and her partner Luke Stanley, both 24, live in the transformed three bed house at The Old Coach House in Marsden, West Yorkshire - land that is also home to Stephanie's parents Chris and Suzanne, her grandparents and her uncle.

Stephanie Bertenshaw, 24, has built her dream house by converting five garages on land owned by her parents

Miss Bertenshaw, who lives in the house with her two dogs, Lola and Ben, pictured, settled on a Spanish style for the outside

The site before the converseion. Miss Bertenshaw spent £15,000 on the project but the home has now been valued at ten times that amount

Miss Bertenshaw, left, has always had a flair for design, she said she lost her deposit on several rented properties because she would decorate them. It is this drive to create herself the perfect home that made the project so appealing. Friends and family all pitched in with the labouring, right, to help keeps costs down

She said: 'I originally started my online business from home, which is where I still work now.

'I was living at home to save money while working as a teaching assistant and running the business. I used to stare at the garages and think "they could be so much better".

'I've always rented properties in the past and I could never help doing renovations on them. In fact I never got my deposits back because I always ended up painting rooms.

'My parents owned the garages and said that I could do what I wanted with them.

It took two years for the row of garages to be transformed from cluttered workshops into a picturesque three-bedroom home

The garages are on land which is also home to Miss Bertenshaw's parents and grandparents, she says this is perfect as she is quite a homely person

Miss Bertenshaw, who was living at home before launching the conversion project, said she used to stare at the garages thinking 'they could be so much better'

Miss Bertenshaw used the image editing software Photoshop to try different designs for the outside of the house, the Spanish theme is nothing like her original intentions

The house was featured on the television programme Kirstie's Best of Both Worlds with Kirstie Allsopp, after Miss Bertenshaw submitted a photo on Facebook

'I'm quite a stay at home person and I like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when I could convert the garages.

'I've tried to be hands on as much as possible. I was always collecting pictures of design ideas that I liked, and even though I look back and think I could have done some things differently I absolutely love the result.'

Miss Bertenshaw's eye for design can be seen throughout the open plan house. A light and airy living room with hard wood floors is now where a dirty workbench once stood. 

A lot of effort went in to making the house as light and airy as possible, it's almost unrecognisable from the dark workshops that were there before

The three-bedroom home has been valued at £150,000, it is on the grounds of The Old Coach House in Marsden, Yorkshire

Before converting the garages, Miss Bertenshaw was living at home and working as a teaching assistant in order to save money

Since completing the house, Stephanie has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business

And one cluttered garage filled with dust is now a beautiful country style kitchen.

The exterior of the house was not what Stephanie originally had in mind, but after playing with designs she settled on the Spanish style.

She said: 'I was 22 when we started the work. I started using Photoshop to design and play around with ideas about what the house would look like.

'I would see some things that I thought would look great and then really they were actually a bit rubbish.

'I roughed out the designs of what I wanted it to look like and helped with a lot of the labouring work. Everyone mucked in to help, especially my parents.

Miss Bertenshaw said: 'I'm quite a stay at home person and I like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when I could convert the garages'

Because her parents owned the garages to begin with, Miss Bertwnshaw lives in the house rent and mortgage free

The country style kitchen, which takes the place of one of the entire garages, is a highlight for Miss Bertenshaw

Looking back, Miss Bertenshaw says she would do some things different but that she still 'loves the result'

'It took two years, lots of hard graft and a keen eye for bargains to furnish it but now I have a perfect, mortgage-free home for me, my fabulous boyfriend and my two dogs Lola and Ben.'

Stephanie's new home has also put her in the TV spotlight when she appeared on a show presented by Kirstie Allsopp.

She added: 'To top it all off, I decided to send off a little picture of my home to a "take part" post I saw from Kirstie's Facebook Page.

'They said they were looking for unique homes that are "The Best of Both Worlds" and little did I ever think I would be accepted.'

Since completing the house, Stephanie has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business.

Stephanie works from the workshop running her business, Felt Mountain Studios, specialising in handmade gifts, stationery, art, prints and homeware.
