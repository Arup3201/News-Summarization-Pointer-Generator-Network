Marco Rubio has claimed people are 'born with a sexual preference' while insisting state legislators should decide whether or not to allow gay marriage.

The presidential candidate spoke to CBS's Face the Nation after admitting in an interview he would attend the same-sex wedding of a family member or staffer - even if he didn't agree with the decision.

The Florida Senator told Bob Schieffer that he wasn't against gay marriage, but believes the 'definition of the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman'.

Marco Rubio told Face The Nation he believes people are born with a sexual preference, but insisted same-sex marriage should not be a constitutional right 

He added: 'States have always regulated marriage. And if a state wants to have a different definition, you should petition the state legislature and have a political debate. 

'I don't think courts should be making that decision.

'I don't believe same-sex marriage is a Constitutional right,' Rubio continued. 'I also don't believe that your sexual preferences are a choice for the vast and enormous majority of people. 

'In fact...I believe that sexual preference is something that people are born with.'

Last week, during an interview with Fusion magazine, he said if someone he 'cared' for was involved in a same-sex union he would 'of course attend'. 

He added: I'm not going to hurt them simply because I disagree with a choice they've made or because I disagree with a decision they've made, or whatever it may be.

'Ultimately, if someone that you care for and is part of your family has decided to move in one direction or another or feels that way because of who they love, you respect that because you love them.'

Rubio also noted that, as a Catholic, he believes divorce is wrong, but he wouldn't stop loving someone if they were divorced. 

The Miami politician announced he is running for president last week. 

Donors have said their candidate has already received monetary commitments in excess of the $40 million he will likely need to battle through a presidential primary season that will feature a crowd of seasoned Republican candidates with strong financial backing.
