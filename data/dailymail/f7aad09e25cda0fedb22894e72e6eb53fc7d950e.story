World flyweight No 1 Andrew Selby has revealed he almost quit boxing for good after a controversial defeat in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last summer.

Hot favourite Selby was dumped out of the tournament by home favourite Reece McFadden after receiving a points deduction for repeatedly losing his gumshield.

The 26-year-old double European champion and two-time world medallist went home to Wales and struggled to get over his enormous sense of disappointment.

Selby told Sportsmail: 'I got home from Glasgow and I quit boxing for a couple of weeks. I locked myself in my flat and I didn't see anyone for seven days.

'I had gone to Glasgow expecting to get a gold medal and I came back with nothing. I still haven't got over it and it still hurts when I think about it now.

'I wasn't thinking straight and I was thinking I had had enough. But in the end I knew I just had to face reality. Every champion loses so hopefully I will do better in the future.'

Selby will be part of the re-formed British Lionhearts squad which will compete in this season's World Series of Boxing - starting with a January 15 clash against China Dragons at York Hall in Bethnal Green.

Automatic qualification for Rio 2016 is at stake for the leading WSB fighters in each weight category and Selby is determined to make the most of his opportunity to end his amateur career on a high.

Selby added: 'Whatever happens I will definitely be turning professional after Rio and there's no reason why I can't do so with a medal.

'I've got a good medal background but not at the Olympics or the Commonwealths. It's time for me to put my disappointments behind me and I'm just pleased I've got another chance.'
