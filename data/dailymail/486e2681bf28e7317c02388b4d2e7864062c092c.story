President Barack Obama knew he'd be upsetting Republicans in Congress when he announced on Tuesday his intentions to press ahead with unilateral action on immigration. 

GOP leaders had been telling him for months that any attempt to circumvent the legislative process would be met with fierce opposition. 

But a handful of Senate Democrats came out against executive action, as well, this week, saying they'd rather Congress make fixes to the immigration system than the president.

'I'm disappointed the president decided to use executive action at this time on this issue, as it could poison any hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the new Senate before it has even started,' North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp told Politico on Thursday.

Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia told Reuters, 'I wish he wouldn't do it.'

Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill was also hesitant to fully get behind the president. 

 'I have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable, I think it probably makes most Missourians uncomfortable,' she told Reuters.

Several of the Democratic lawmakers acknowledged that like Obama, their first preference would have been for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

Their failure to do so doesn't give him license to issue his own rules, though, they said. 

 'I am as frustrated as anyone that Congress is not doing its job, but the president shouldn't make such significant policy changes on his own,' Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly said in a press release on Thursday.

Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said this week that he thought Obama should have waited until after newly elected members had the chance to weigh in on the issue before taking matters into his own hands.

'If I were the president, what I'd say to the Congress — House, Senate, Democrat or Republican — I'm going to give you a little bit of time and in the new Congress expect you to do something,' Carper told reporters.

As a result of midterm election victories, Republicans will hold at least eight additional seats in the Senate, if not nine, depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 runoff in Louisiana.

Republicans also picked up at least a dozen seats in the House of Representatives, and potentially several more that have yet to be decided.

President Obama blew off this week suggestions from both Republicans and his fellow Democrats that he give the GOP one more shot to make changes to the immigration system before going it alone, however, arguing at a press conference last Sunday that he'd been given the opposition party plenty of opportunities to act and he was done waiting.

Across the street from the White House, Leaders of Casa de Maryland and SEIU 36BJ led the celebration today of President Obama's temporary measures to delay the deportation of nearly five million immigrants.

'On immigration reform it continues to be my great preference to see Congress pass comprehensive legislation, because that is not reversed by a future President, it would have to be reversed by a future Congress,' Obama said in response to a reporter's question about the possibility of a future president rescinding his executive order.

'That’s part of the reason why I’ve argued consistently that we’re better off if we can get a comprehensive deal through Congress.That’s why I showed extraordinary patience with Congress in trying to work a bipartisan deal,' Obama stated.

'That’s why I was so encouraged when the Senate produced a bipartisan immigration deal and why I waited for over a year for Speaker Boehner to call that bipartisan bill in the House.'

But, the president said, 'I can’t wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that, at least for the next two years, can improve the system, can allow us to shift more resources to the border rather than separating families' and 'improve the legal immigration system.

'I would be derelict in my duties if I did not try to improve the system that everybody acknowledges is broken,' he argued.

In an address to the nation on Thursday night officially announcing the contents of his forthcoming executive order, Obama again proclaimed that he'd been backed into a corner by Congress and was taking the lead on the issue only because lawmakers on Capitol Hill refused to bring his preferred reforms up for debate.

'Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote,' he said.

'Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President – the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me – that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.'
