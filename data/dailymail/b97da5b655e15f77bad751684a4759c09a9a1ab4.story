A Washington couple's weekend hike took a terrifying turn when an avalanche nearly came crashing down on them.

Colby Dotson and Ashley Bechard managed to outrun the fearsome cascade of snow and ice and take refuge in one of the caves that they had come to visit at Big Four Ice Caves in north central Washington state on Saturday. 

Mr Dotson filmed part of the harrowing escape on his phone as he watched tons of snow crashing down the mountainside.

'It was like a huge cloud of dust coming down, and I turn around and Ashley was like 30 feet running already,' Dotson told KING-TV.

Miss Bechard said she heard a thunderous noise like a jetliner flying close overhead and knew in an instant that it was an avalanche. 

'No question in my mind, I just ran. I was like, "that's an avalanche," and I ran,' she told the TV station. 

Mr Dotson and Miss Bechard took a weekend trip to the Big Four Ice Caves in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest on Saturday hoping for adventure. They got more than they expected. 

The couple admit that they ignored avalanche warning signs and left the trail to explore the ice caves. 

The Big Four Ice Caves are  major attraction in Washington. No one was injured in the avalanche

They were a few feet from one of the ice caves when the avalanche struck and ran inside for shelter. 

From the safety of the cave, they watched in horror as a dozen people outside scrambled for their lives, too. 

'I see headlamps. There was two or three kind of flickering in there, so I am terrified people are dying right now,' Ms Bechard said. 

Police later said that no one was injured. They only two people caught in the avalanche were Mr Dotson and Ms Bechard - who were able to dig themselves out when it was over.
