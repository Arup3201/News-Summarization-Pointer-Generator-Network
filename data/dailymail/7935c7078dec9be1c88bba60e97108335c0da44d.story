The Premier League are taking action over Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho riding roughshod over regulations that require him to hold a press conference the day before a game.

Mourinho refused to meet the media on Friday before Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash at home to Manchester City. 

The Special One also breached rules when coach Steve Holland deputised for him before the Newcastle game three weeks ago but there was no media conference at all on Friday. It happened twice last season, too.

The Premier League have written to Chelsea asking for an explanation of Mourinho’s absence ahead of the Newcastle match. Another letter will follow about Friday’s media snub.

The Premier League board will then decide whether to fine the club. However, it might take some time as former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson did not talk to the BBC for seven years before that issue was resolved — and Mourinho thinks he is the new Fergie when it comes to flouting the Premier League rulebook. Chelsea refused to comment.

The FA have brought in former Manchester United finance director Nick Humby to be their interim chief operating officer until the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, who left on Friday, arrives at Wembley.

Greg Dyke will work as executive chairman during that void in a double move that does not reflect much confidence in the remaining heads of department and also points to the FA being prepared to wait for the right replacement for Horne. 

Humby, who temporarily led the Lawn Tennis Association after the Roger Draper regime, takes over at an opportune time with football agents urgently wanting guidance from the FA after FIFA scandalously washed their hands of regulating the middle men.

Humby knows the subject, having conducted the United inquiry into the 99 questions posed by shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus into Sir Alex Ferguson’s transfer business. His findings led to Ferguson’s agent son Jason being banned from United transfer activity.

Meanwhile, only FIFA could have been planning to scrap all agents’ licences on Monday — transfer deadline day — until persuaded to postpone the move until the end of March.

The start of Prince Ali of Jordan’s campaign for the FIFA presidency — endorsed by the FA on a reform agenda to improve integrity, governance and transparency — coincides with him having to decide the future of Ray Wilkins as the national coach.

Jordan failed to get out of the group in the Asian Cup under Wilkins’s leadership, having reached the quarter-finals in the previous two tournaments. 

But the former Chelsea assistant manager would like to extend his five-month deal and with Prince Ali due in London next week to talk about his FIFA ambitions, Wilkins will perhaps get an unlikely stay of execution.

Gary Lineker hosting BT Sport’s Champions League coverage next season, first revealed by Sports Agenda, is more likely with BBC and BT bosses intent on building on their FA Cup partnership.

Gary Lineker is pictured presenting an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day, but could he present at BT?

Consequently, with more joint deals on the horizon — perhaps the Six Nations from 2018 — the BBC are not going to object to Lineker’s contract changing to allow him to work for BT as he has done for Fox and Al Jazeera before they rebranded as beIN Sport.

Tom Harrison, the new ECB chief executive, finally arrives at Lord’s on Monday with a ruthless cull of staff aged over 50 near completion. But Harrison must decide about the future of Machiavellian chief operating officer Gordon Hollins with all that blood on the carpet. This includes Mike Gatting, the managing director of cricket partnerships, being reduced to a humiliating part-time ambassadorial role. Meanwhile, the ECB’s 12 elderly pitch inspectors and umpire mentors are also for the chop.

The sports sponsorship war between Pepsi and Coca-Cola comes to a head at the Super Bowl in Phoenix tomorrow. Pepsi are sponsoring the Katy Perry half-time show and have taken the lead commercial at a cost of $5million for 30 seconds. Coke have responded by booking a 60sec slot at some time during the game.
