Winter revellers have been quick to take advantage of July's heavy snowfall in areas of NSW and Victoria - and it is showing no signs of slowing up.

Centimetres of thick fresh snow have covered popular ski destinations Thredbo, in NSW's Snowy Mountains, and Mount Buller in Victoria's Alpine region.

Coinciding perfectly with school holidays, those visiting Thredbo village and its peaks have been able to enjoy some of the longest runs in Australia.

In its first weekend of the snow season over the June long weekend, there was barely enough snow for skiing and snow boarding due to warm weather caused by El Nino weather patterns.

However despite the disappointing start, July's snowfall has been so heavy that Thredbo is experiencing one of the strongest starts to its season on record, and it's expected to continue with another 30cms forecast by the weekend.

It's also all good news for Mount Buller, with a series of cold fronts crossing Victoria and expected to dump up to 40cm of snow this week and with 24 centimetres of snow already fallen as of Wednesday afternoon, reported The Age.

There has also been strong snowfall in Victorian Alpine areas, with ski resorts getting between 20 and 30 centimetres this week and with a further 15 centimetres expected to be dumped overnight.

The fun is set to continue further into the week, with another strong cold front on Saturday expected to bring an extra 15 centimetres.
