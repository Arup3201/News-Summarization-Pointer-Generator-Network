Naomi Hunter was just three-years-old when she was first sexually abused by two men close to her.

She suffered in silence until the age of 10 and when the physical abuse stopped, her mental torture continued into her teens as she developed an eating disorder at the age of 13.

‘It happened for so many years it was just normal for me. My whole view of the world was skewed,’ she told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Hunter, is now 31, a mother and a primary school teacher and as part of her mission to help others from suffering sexual abuse she has written an illustrated book to teach children about the subject and to show parents and teachers how to talk about it.

Primary school teacher Naomi Hunter has written an illustrated book to help children speak out about sex abuse

'I connected strongly with children I think because of my own childhood experience and lack thereof, I really found my own joy being around them,' she said of being a teacher.

'I always knew I wanted to do something more and when the idea of the book came up I realised that's what I wanted to do, to provide help... on a level that's respectful of what children go through,’ she said.

‘There is no sexual abuse education at all in Australia, it's more just sexual and puberty education which doesn’t happen until grade five or six which is such a shame,’ Ms Hunter added.

She believes parents should begin teaching their children about ‘body safety’ as soon as they can talk so that the children have the ‘confidence to know what is right or wrong’.

Ms Hunter, seen here as a little girl, was abused as a child until the age of 10

‘It doesn’t have to be about abuse but body safety...  for example washing yourself in private areas and who is allowed to touch those areas… it’s about talking about these things in a real, nurturing and informative way.’

Ms Hunter lives with her husband, her high-school sweetheart Jeremy, and their five-year-old daughter Marli in Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, Victoria.

She wrote her book, A Secret Safe To Tell, four years ago but it has taken years to get it published because it was seen as a ‘risky topic to invest in’. 

'I wrote the first draft relatively efficiently as it came from such a personal place. I felt at ease in writing it,’ she said.

Editing it so that it was perfectly reachable and appropriately sensitive took a while but now it is published and already helping children to speak out.

The book describes one little girl's experience alongside illustrations.

Naomi hopes her book, A Secret Safe To Tell, will be used by parents, psychologists and in schools

One page says: 'He said that I was a GOOD GIRL and I would be PERFECT... I liked hearing that. We had SECRETS that no one else could know.'

Another paragraph reads: 'When I closed my eyes all I could see were HIS GAMES and HIS HANDS. It DID NOT feel nice.... But HE SAID IT DID feel nice.'

As Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes’ sex crimes were revealed this year, Ms Hunter said her publisher believed it was the right time to release the book.

Since then the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and Rolf Harris’s abuse conviction in the UK have also opened the gateway for discussions around the topic in Australia.

‘People are feeling safer to talk about it. There is so much shame going through it that you hide it for so many years,’ she said. 

Ms Hunter said she didn’t speak out when she was young because she ‘probably wasn’t strong enough’.

In her teenage years Naomi developed a severe eating disorder. She said it was her way of coping with her childhood abuse

‘I didn't know that behaviour wasn't normal. I’ve really been trying to speak out my whole life in some ways... but now I’m a in a really strong place,’ she said.

Ms Hunter hopes her book will be used by parents, support careers, in schools and education programmes and by clinical psychologists.

'The feedback has been amazing. Everyone is so supportive of it as a nurturing tool to break the taboo,’ she said.

Ms Hunter believed there wasn’t much support for her when she did reveal the abuse and so she found comfort in anorexia.

‘I was very unwell and very troubled. I didn’t really feel I could relate to anyone. But at school I was the head prefect, I got amazing grades,’ she explained.

While she was at highschool Naomi met her future husband Jeremy. She credits him for helping her become strong again and said he always believed in her book

Ms Hunter, is now 31, a mother to five-year-old daughter Marli (centre) and a primary school teacher. She lives with her family in Victoria and hopes to continue writing books about her experiences

The mother-of-one said her life turned around when she met her boyfriend, now husband, Jeremy at highschool. 

‘He was a massive turning point. We met when we were 16 and were high school sweethearts, we are so connected and so amazing together and are stronger together. 

‘He's the reason why I’m here today. He’s provided me with so much strength.’

Ms Hunter said Jeremy believed in her book from ‘the first moment’.

Child sex abuse is not the only subject Ms Hunter wants to raise awareness of. She also hopes to write books on mental health, cancer and grief. 

‘This is just one of many ideas. I’ve got heaps of experiences to draw on. A family member suffers from schizophrenia. I lost my brother to leukaemia. I suffered anorexia. 

‘After what I went through, I just want to provide beautiful nurturing books without frightening anyone.’
