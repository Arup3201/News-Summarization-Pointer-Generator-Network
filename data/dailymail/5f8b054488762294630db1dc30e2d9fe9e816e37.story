In view of his much-publicised 
troubled love life, an audience with the Pope was probably the last 
thing Francois Hollande needed right now.

Nevertheless,
 the somewhat sheepish French president fulfilled that obligation 
yesterday as it emerged that his estranged girlfriend Valerie 
Trierweiler is also determined to carry on with her duties.

Miss
 Trierweiler, recovering from an apparent drugs overdose after learning 
of Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with an actress, is keeping a charity 
commitment in India this weekend.

Her trip is being seen by some as her ‘last stand’ as First Lady. Mr Hollande, who visited Rome with the threat of a reprimand from Pope Francis over France’s decision to allow gay marriage also hanging over him, is believed to be considering leaving Miss Trierweiler  for actress Julie Gayet, 41.

Despite the unfortunate timing, yesterday’s private meeting with the Pope passed off without any further embarrassment for Mr Hollande – with Francis even showing his lighter side by joking about their shared name.

For 48-year-old Miss Trierweiler, the trip to Mumbai on behalf of a French aid organisation is in her capacity as official escort to the French leader. She will visit a slum in the city and will be a guest of honour at a gala dinner.

A friend hinted that the visit could be her swansong in the limelight. ‘It’s a way of showing that she is attached to humanitarian causes and that she will continue to take an interest in them whatever happens in the days to come,’ she told a French newspaper.

Many Parisians are describing the 
visit as the First Lady’s ‘last stand’, but others believe that Miss 
Trierweiler, nicknamed the Rottweiler, has no intention of leaving her 
role at the Elysee Palace quietly.

There
 have also been claims that Mr Hollande, 59, has told friends he is 
ready to cave in to pressure from her to rekindle their relationship. 
According to one of his friends, the president is considering ending 
his  affair with Miss Gayet, and ‘giving in’ to Miss Trierweiler’s 
appeals to save their relationship.

The
 friend told France’s VSD magazine: ‘Until now he has been thinking 
about going ahead with a separation, but he realises it’s not quite that
 simple.

‘Valerie is determined to hang on to him. I know him. He is giving in to her.’

Hours
 before the arrival, a small homemade bomb exploded in front of a French
 foundation that manages French architectural treasures in Rome, 
including five churches, and is headed by the French Embassy to the Holy
 See.

The
 Carabinieri military police said no one was injured, but that a few 
windows of the palazzo were shattered and that three cars parked on the 
street outside were damaged.

Police
 said it wasn't clear if the bomb, which contained metal bits as well as
 explosive powder, was related to Hollande's visit or the foundation, 
which is located in the heart of Rome's historic center.
