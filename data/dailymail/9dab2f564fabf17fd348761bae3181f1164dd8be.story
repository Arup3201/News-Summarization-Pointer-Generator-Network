The former girlfriend of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev said he slapped her and beat her head against a car because she was wearing shorts.

Nadine Ascencao, 25, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she and Tsarnaev split up after he became so abusive she called police.

The couple dated for three years and she said he became increasingly religious during that time.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in a police mugshot, was arrested after attacking then-girlfriend Nadine Ascencao, right. She called police after he beat her head against a car for wearing shorts 

Nadine Ascencao said she was shocked that Tsarnaev's younger brother got involved in the attack

Tsarnaev, 26, and brother Dzhokhar, 19, set off the bomb at the marathon on April 15 that killed three by-standers and injured more than 170 people.

Tamerlan was killed in a stand-off with police four days later and his young brother is in police custody after being injured in the same shoot-out.

Ms Ascencao told Inside Edition that Tsarnaev, a former amateur boxer, attacked her after she wore a tank top and shorts to a pool party.

She said he screamed at her 'what are you wearing' and then became violent.

She said: 'He literally grabbed my jaw and he was telling me "you are not going to wear this, do you understand what I'm saying" and he kept pushing my head until I hit the car and it hurt and that made me really upset and he just slapped me across the face. But that right there just made me so furious'.

Ascencao, who dated Tamerlan for three years, says she now regrets not pressing charges

Ms Ascencao said she told she was going to dial 911 and he told her to 'go ahead'.

She said in the interview with Inside Edition: 'The police officer goes up to him and
 she said, "did you hit her?"

'He goes, "I just gave her a little slap." She goes "excuse me what did you just do to her?"

‘[He said] I just gave her a little slap.

'She said, "turn around sir" and just handcuffed him.'

He was arrested on domestic assault and battery charges and the mugshots later emerged after he was identified as the suspect in the bomb attack.

Three people were killed and more than 170 people injured in the attack on the Boston Marathon

However, despite the violent outburst Ms Ascencao did not press charges, which she says she now regrets.

Ms Ascencao said: 'At that time I was young and really didn't think it through'.

In previous interviews, Ms Ascencao said her boyfriend, who she met at high school, became increasingly religious and was angered if she wore Western clothes.

He later went on to marry Katherine Russell, who converted to Islam.
