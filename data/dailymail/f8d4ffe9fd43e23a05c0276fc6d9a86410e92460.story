Harry Redknapp believes he could have won the Premier League with Tottenham, if only the club had invested in more players.

The 67-year-old spent four years at White Hart Lane, twice guiding Spurs to a fourth-placed finish in the league.

Redknapp's performance in north London led for calls for him to become the England manager, but the former West ham boss was eventually sacked by Tottenham, and also missed out on a position with the national side.

The current QPR boss claimed the experience left him feeling regretful over missed opportunities.

'I think I could have actually won the league at Tottenham,' Redknapp told FourFourTwo. 'If we had invested more at the right time, we could have done it. We were probably short of a striker. 

'I know the reasons why (things didn't work out), but they are personal. I enjoyed my time there, and to be honest I was choked when I had to leave.

'But I couldn't sit at home and sulk about it. It is life, it happens. They did what they wanted to do, but they haven't been in the top four since me. I finished in the top four twice in three years.' 

Five months after leaving Spurs, Redknapp became manager of QPR but couldn't help them avoid relegation from England's top flight. Although winning immediate promotion back to the Premier League, the R's have struggled for form this season, leading some to question the manager's future.

Redknapp's side are currently bottom of the league with just four points from their opening eight fixtures.
