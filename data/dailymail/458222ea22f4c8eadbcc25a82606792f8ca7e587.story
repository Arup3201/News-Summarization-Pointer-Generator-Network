Winston Reid has expressed his delight at signing a new contract with West Ham and said their imminent move to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor in his decision.

The New Zealand defender put pen to paper on a six-and-a-half-year contract worth £60,000-a-week.

And the 26-year-old, who had been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham with his contract expiring in the summer, is pleased to have his future tied down.

He told fanbookz.com: 'Obviously I'm absolutely delighted to have signed a new contract with West Ham. I've enjoyed my time here, and I just needed to make sure that the decision was a right one for me and my family.

'There were a lot of factors that I took into account when I was making my decision, but most importantly I felt that I was valued at the club - we will be improving in future seasons and I really feel at home here.

'With regards the decision that I've had to make, I had to be sure that it was going to be a place that I was going to be for the next few years of my life, so I have to feel at home and I feel welcome here. I enjoy living in London and my family is settled so that was the most important thing I had to think about.'

Reid took his time in making a decision but clearly feels his future lies with the club having made 27 appearances across all competitions this season.

He added: 'It might have been frustrating for the fans to have it drag out for so long, but whenever I've been asked this question over the past few months it's just been when we've been negotiating. 

'You don't sort something out in the course of one day, there's always got to be some sort of give or take when doing these things.

'There was no big drama towards it, and there was a lot of stuff in the press that was misleading with regards to my situation, but the main thing is that now we've got it sorted.

'Both the club and I were keen to do something, and I'm happy to be staying here. Speaking to the chairman it was clear that the club is on the up, we've been getting better this year but we were realistic about the club and where it's at currently - there's a lot that we can still improve on, and that was the main thing.'

West Ham currently sit tenth in the Premier League standings following a vastly-improved campaign in contrast to the travails of Sam Allardyce's side last year.

Reid said: 'As long as we all work hard to improve ourselves each day we will get better, and that was the main objective - we want to get the club further up the league and I'm sure that we will in the coming years.'

Reid joins James Tomkins and Mark Noble in signing new deals at West Ham.

'For James Tomkins and Mark Noble they've been here all their lives. I've not been here quite as long as them, but come the end of this contract I will have been here for a fair bit.

'It's nice for them to be here and I'm looking forward to the next six years of my life. With the club, I’m looking forward to exciting times ahead and hoping to be a big part of it.

'I came here in a sticky period – the first year we got relegated, but since then it’s gradually got better. The team has improved, the organisation as a Club has improved as well and we need to do that if we want to go places.

“I’ve grown massively over that time too. Coming here five years ago I was only a young kid, but now I’m kind of a Londoner I guess! It’s a second home for me and I’m delighted.'

The New Zealand international had his time on the pitch against Chelsea on Wednesday curtailed after eight minutes with a hamstring issue but with 10 days off before the Hammers' next game, he does not expect to miss too much action.

'It's just one of those things with the injury. I had it a little after Crystal Palace and unfortunately it flared up again. It's just part of the game I guess,' Reid said.

'We've got some time to recover now, which is much needed.'

Reid also spoke of his excitement in playing at the Olympic Stadium.

'Moving to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor for me in staying at the club, but it wasn't the deciding part of the deal - it was just one of many positive points. I'm looking forward to playing there, and it's going to be a massive opportunity for us as players and fans of the club to move to such a great facility.

'The deciding factor for me really was where I felt at home and how settled I felt with my family - I am happy here at the club and I wasn't going to stay here if I wasn't happy - it took a bit of time but I'm glad we got there in the end.'

Reid joined West Ham from Danish club FC Midtjylland in 2010 and has made 121 appearances for the club.
