Britt Assombalonga has a list of 20-goal-a-season strikers from which he picks one at random and watches videos of them before every game. It includes Radamel Falcao, Jermain Defoe, Diego Costa, Thierry Henry and Fernando Torres.

Viewing highlights of these stars on YouTube is clearly rubbing off on the 21-year-old Nottingham Forest forward who is setting the Championship alight this season, sitting top of the scoring charts with eight goals in eight games.

‘Before every game I watch videos of different strikers and try to pick up different things from all of them,’ says Assombalonga, who was born in Zaire but moved to London aged eight months.

Britt Assombalonga has proven he is more than capable of scoring goals in the Championship

‘I go on YouTube and pick a name at random and watch it. I’ve got quite a few on the list, strikers that score over 20 goals a season. Thierry Henry is probably one of my favourites with Jermain Defoe. Fernando Torres when he was at Liverpool.’

It is testament to Millwall’s defence that they kept the burly, bustling forward at bay for the whole of Saturday’s goalless draw. That was the first time Forest had failed to score in 10 games this season, although the point kept Stuart Pearce’s side unbeaten and top of the league. 

Chesterfield striker Eoin Doyle continued his scoring run but failed to net three consecutive hat-tricks for the first time since Liverpool’s Jack Balmer in 1946. Doyle could only manage one against Doncaster.

Leeds continued their unbeaten run under caretaker manager Neil Redfearn with a 3-0 victory against Huddersfield. Redfearn, however, missed out on the top job. with Darko Milanic taking over.

Accrington Stanley won 5-4 against Northampton in John Coleman’s first game in his second spell in charge at the club. They now have three victories in four games.

Assombalonga, whose father Fedor was an international for Zaire (now DR Congo), gave centre back Alan Dunne a fierce shove in the fourth minute to let the Millwall captain know he was there. The pair were pulling and jostling each other all game and Dunne, 32, played the young hopeful well.

Forest manager Pearce pointed out afterwards that Assombalonga still has much to learn. ‘With young players expectation goes through the roof very quickly and we have to make it clear he is a young man who’s learning the game,’ said Pearce.

‘I sat with him after the match and said, “Look, tactically you might have had to go and play on the other centre half.” Dunne, I think, played him very well. I use the example of Ian Wright, who was very clever when he played up front for Arsenal and Crystal Palace. He looked at the two central defenders and said, “Well, I might not play against you, Des Walker, because you can run as quick as me, but I’m coming over there to play against you because you’re a bit of a donkey.”

Ian Holloway's Millwall managed to keep the Championship's top scorer at bay on Saturday

‘Britt has got to learn those nuances of football, but he has such an attitude to want to learn, and want to work for the team, it’s fantastic.’

MK Dons 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli celebrated signing a new three-year deal by netting a hat-trick in his side’s 6-1 mauling of Crewe. Alli, who was subject of a £3.5million bid from Liverpool in the summer, is fast developing a reputation as one of brightest young English talents and has six goals in 10 games this season. 

A true test of that ability will come when he faces Tottenham in the League Cup third round on Wednesday.

There is a hunger to Assombalonga’s style. He is constantly on the shoulder of the last man, or making forays out wide when space opens up. He charges down defenders on the ball, hassles and hustles for the full 90 minutes. As soon as there is a stoppage he is alert, on his toes, seeking space, moving a few yards clear of the nearest defender. It will not be a poor work ethic which stops Assombalonga reaching his target of the Premier League.

Training-ground sources tell Sportsmail that he is always the first out and one of the last to leave.

Assombalonga sealed a £5million move from Peterborough to Nottingham Forest in the summer

They explain that he is enjoying the attention, following his club-record £5million move from Peterborough in the summer, but he is still very grounded.

That is partly down to his modest rise, only joining Watford’s academy at 17 and spending loan spells at non-League and lower-League sides.

Even after drawing a blank against Millwall, it is Assombalonga’s name called out by a group of young fans as the Forest squad warm down. He jogs over to sign autographs and pose for photographs.

No wonder, Assombalonga is fast developing an impressive highlights reel of his own.
