Paris St Germain had worked hard at turning this into a revenge mission, with an over-active social media campaign accompanied by the hash-tag slogan: 'A different story'.

It was the sort of behaviour clubs usually shirk away from in fear of tempting fate.

'Revenge is a dish best served one year later,' read one pithy message from the official Twitter account, along with images of PSG scarves on a waxwork model of the Queen and a statue of Winston Churchill.

This constant search for something new is what makes the world wide web go around, but what exactly had they hoped to change?

Last year, Laurent Blanc’s side won 3-1 in the first leg and few who witnessed that game expected Chelsea to recover against this emerging new force in European football.

At times, it seemed to be very much the same old story.

The Londoners took the lead but were unable to kick on and PSG responded with great energy and desire, only to find this time, for all their pressure and clear opportunities, they could not establish a first-leg lead.

The French champions still pose a threat at Stamford Bridge next month, but Jose Mourinho will have been perfectly content as he hopped back across the Channel with his away goal and scores level after a game he could easily have lost.

Ultimately, the story was different in an important detail.

Chelsea are stronger than last year and they resisted, with a bit of luck, the extra midfield muscle of Nemanja Matic and the authority of Thibaut Courtois, who returned to replace Petr Cech and confirm his status as No 1.

Courtois was brilliantly composed and focused and made a splendid save from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the final seconds. David Luiz attributed the 1-1 result to the goalkeeper, as teams often do when they are wasteful in front of goal.

Although rusty, Costa proved an effective weapon for Chelsea, putting a Didier Drogba-like performance

Cesc Fabregas worked hard in midfield and there was, of course, Diego Costa, returning up front, the £32million, 17-goal top-scorer, fresh from three weeks out, serving a hotly-disputed ban for violent conduct.

Fabregas, who had been suffering from a cold and arrived at the ground wrapped up in woollens, ran miles but found it difficult to influence the game and Costa was off the pace, as Mourinho said he might be.

There was zip in Costa’s legs; his touch was heavy and, as Chelsea were stretched defensively in the second-half there were repercussions for the man up front.

Costa became more remote, with his role increasingly limited to irritating those in blue, helping out in defence at set-pieces and trying to stay alert for any scraps that came his way; the sort of performance delivered so many times by Didier Drogba.

For Mourinho, however, regardless of his contribution on the ball, it was important to have him on field, a symbol of the fighting qualities this team boast, proving this squad is stronger and more capable of going all the way.

If anyone expected Costa to keep clear of physical contact they do not know his style. Costa may have been caught on camera and banned for his stamp on Emre Can, but he was not about to surrender his chief asset.

There was a sequence of minor fouls as he set out to make a nuisance of himself. He was late into challenges on Thiago Silva talked his way into a row which had nothing to do with him and pulled Luiz’s hair.

When Mourinho bemoaned his lack of strikers after losing in Paris last season, there was more to it than goals. He also lacked the hardy front man, to carry the team forward when they needed a break.

Chelsea have got rid of five strikers since they were last in the French capital, including Andre Schurrle, the winger who played up front in this fixture. Three have arrived but, not for the first time, it was Chelsea’s defenders scoring the big goals. 

Costa battles to win possession from Van der Viel and Ezequiel Lavezzi

Costa has not found the target in the Champions League since April when he scored for Atletico Madrid at Chelsea. It did not matter. The away goal is vital, and they have learned to appreciate its value over the years.

It gave them hope in the epic fight-back against Napoli, three years ago, and when they overturned the first-leg deficit against PSG last year.

And, no matter how little adventure they show, it is not often Mourinho’s team fail to find the net. The only time this season was back in November, in Sunderland.

It is a valuable asset in Europe and Chelsea are seasoned campaigners these days.

PSG are acquiring these skills. They may be learning, too, that to change the script it is more important to stop conceding goals at home than to stir up mischief and antagonise the opposition.
