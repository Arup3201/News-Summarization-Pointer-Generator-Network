A family in Chicago is claiming that a police officer unjustly shot their seven-month-old miniature bull terrier, Colonel, seriously injuring the dog that they had hoped to enter into competition.

According to the dog's owner, Al Phillips, the officer shot the dog twice, after it followed him out of the house. 'My little bull terrier followed me out,' Phillips told Fox 32 in Chicago. 'Then, all I hear is boom! Boom! Two shots. You shot the dog.'

The officer was giving Phillips a parking ticket in front of his home in the North Side of Chicago.

Shocking: A Chicago family is claiming that a police officer shot their seven-month-old miniature bull terrier Colonel for no reason.

Recovering: The dog had to undergo five hours of surgery to repair a lacerated muscle as well remove shrapnel from his stomach and a spent casing from his leg

According to witnesses, the incident began Saturday afternoon, when a member of the Chicago Police Department began writing a parking ticket for Phillips' van, which had been parked in front of his house.

Upon seeing this, Phillips said that he walked out to meet the officer and was unwittingly followed by his dog.

Witness Charlene Dezengo told Fox 32 that the officer warned Phillips about the dog being loose but said that he didn't sound like he was in any danger.

Meanwhile neighbor Todd McClay told 
DNAinfo in Chicago that the dog came out 'wagging his tail' and that the
 officer 'did not give [Phillips] ample time to get the dog.'

He said that the officer screamed once, 'waited a couple seconds,' screamed again, 'waited a couple seconds,' and then 'he was firing.'

Dezengo said she saw a similar thing. 'All of sudden I heard him say, ‘get your dog,' and then the next 
statement was ‘get your dog,' and then he just pulled out his gun and 
shot twice,' Dezengo said.

After the shooting, witnesses say the officer calmly put his gun back into his holster and finished writing the ticket.

Phillips' wife, Barbara, told DNAInfo that the officer was 'deranged.' 'First of all, the dog is not even 30 pounds,' she said. 'He ran out 
with his tail wagging. He's a puppy. He's little!'

After the shooting, she and her daughter, Morgan, rushed the dog to the vet, where he underwent a five hour surgery to treat the shrapnel in his stomach, shell casing in his leg and a lacerated muscle.

The family said that they planned to enter the dog in competition, but no longer think they will be able to do so. His father was a champion show dog.

Traumatized: Phillips said the family had planned to enter the dog into competition but will not be able to do so anymore. The family is contemplating suing the police department.

To make matters worse, three days after the incident, two officers came by Phillips' home and gave him an addition ticket for not keeping the dog on a leash. They also asked why Phillips had contacted the media about the shooting.

'They were giving us a ticket, three days after the fact,' says 
Phillips. 'So I think they're probably trying to cover their rear ends.'

Residents of the neighborhood were also outraged over the fact that the shooting took place near a preschool and that other individuals, including children, could have been injured by what they see as an unnecessary use of force.

Phillips said that his family is considering a petition drive to get the officer involved in the shooting out of the department.

'I'm mad enough to file a suit,' Phillips said. 'I'm so angered that I 
believe I might be forced to do that. I don't know what my options are. But the 
first thing, this guy should not be on the street. And if he has to be on the 
street, we don't want him in this neighborhood.'

For their part, the police department said the shooting 
is being investigated by an independent police review authority board, and that they are 
taking the matter seriously.
