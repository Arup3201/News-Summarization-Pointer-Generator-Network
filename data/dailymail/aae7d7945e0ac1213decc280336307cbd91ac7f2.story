Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki has put down her racket and slipped on her running shoes to complete the New York Marathon in an impressive three hours, 26 minutes and 33 seconds.

World number nine Wozniacki ran her first ever marathon for children's charity 'Team for Kids' and has raised over $81,000 on fundraising site 'Crowdrise'.

Before the race, she posted a selfie to her Twitter page, alongside the caption, 'Ready or not... Here I come. Few min left! @nycmarathon'.

The photograph showed her, and her fellow runners, wrapped up in plenty of layers ready to tackle the New York Marathon, where the temperature was recorded at just 5.5 degrees on the morning of the race.

Regardless of the difficult conditions, Danish-born Wozniacki completed the race, and was met at the finish line by an emotional Serena Williams.

Williams, who herself is ranked number one in the world, is good friends with her fellow tennis professional, and tweeted explaining that she cried upon greeting Wozniacki at the finish.

In the competitive standings, Wilson Kipsang and Mary Keitany claimed a famous double for Kenya as they raced to victory.

Kipsang crossed the line in two hours, 10 minutes and 59 seconds, the slowest winning time since 1995 on a day when chill winds hampered the competitors, while Keitany made it home in 2.25.07.

She sprinted past compatriot Jemina Sumgong with just a few hundred yards to go, and Portugal's Sara Moreira finished third with the women starting ahead of their male counterparts.

Kipsang followed suit, breaking the tape seven seconds ahead of Lelisa Desisa, who led fellow Ethiopian and 2010 winner Gebre Gebremariam home.
