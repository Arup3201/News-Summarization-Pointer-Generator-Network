It is no faster or bigger than existing jumbo jets.

But, as it took off on its maiden flight yesterday, Boeing’s Dreamliner was hailed as the most revolutionary step in air passenger travel since Concorde.

And that is not just because it is effectively made of plastic, making it lighter and more fuel-efficient than other planes. Its major advance is on the inside, where it offers new levels of passenger comfort.

The bigger windows are obvious, the wider seats and aisles less so.

The cabin hosts specially modified 
levels of air pressure and humidity to help avoid the headaches and 
nausea that can accompany a long-haul flight.

The 787 also boasts 60 per cent lower 
noise levels and comes with anti-turbulence systems and even an advanced
air-filtration system to eliminate unwanted odours.

Yesterday the new 264-seat aircraft 
taxied on to Runway A of Tokyo’s Narita Airport, with Japanese carrier 
Air Nippon Airways inviting the Mail and more than 200 aviation experts 
and enthusiasts for the first flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong.

The 787 looks wider than a conventional aircraft but is no bigger in either height or length.

Inside, it is a different story. As I walked up the gantry, the most notable difference is the eight-foot vaulted ceiling.

The 17ft-wide cabins are supposed to 
give a more spacious environment than similar-sized planes but look just
the same as other aircraft. In economy class, the 787’s aisles are 
typically 55cm wide – 6cm wider than in most twin-aisle airplanes.

In business class, the 65cm aisles are large enough to move past serving trolleys.

Seats: 210 to 250.

Range: 8,800 to 9,400 miles.

Wingspan: 197 feet.

Length: 186 feet.

Height: 56 feet.

Cruise speed: Mach 0.85, about 650 mph.

Cargo volume: 4,400 cubic feet.

Maximum takeoff weight: 502,500 pounds.

List price: $193.5 million (£120million), although airlines often negotiate discounts.

Planes ordered: 797.

Components: 50 per cent carbon fiber, 20 per cent aluminum, 15 per cent titanium, 10 per cent steel, 5 per cent other.

Engines: Rolls Royce or General Electric.

The overhead compartments are 30 per 
cent bigger than those on the Boeing 777, and comfortably take a 
suitcase. Boeing’s plan was to wow passengers with a series of 
groundbreaking innovations made possible by ditching the conventional 
aluminium shell for more modern carbon fibre.

The same light and robust material 
used on Formula One cars is the key to helping airlines shave 20 per 
cent off their fuel bills while freeing up cabin space.

The Dreamliner might not be as big as 
Airbus’s monster A380, but that’s because the 787 is pitched as a 
medium-sized workhorse for long-haul travel. It is being hailed as a 
green passenger jet because it is less fuel-thirsty than its peers.

Boeing claims its Rolls-Royce and 
General Electric engines will emit 20 per cent less carbon dioxide than 
similar-sized planes. Scott Fancher, general manager of the 787 project,
said: ‘Everything from the shape and size of the wings to the design of
the nacelle [the casing around the engine] make the plane more 
aerodynamic and reduce drag.’

UK passengers will have to wait for 
the Dreamliner’s benefits. Thomson Holidays will take delivery of 12 
next year. British Airways has ordered 24, with the first due to arrive 
in 2013, while Virgin Atlantic takes delivery of its first 15 
Dreamliners in the spring of 2014.

There was one thing Boeing didn’t 
improve. As you might expect on a plastic plane, we received a plastic 
meal of unrecognisable meat in an indistinguishable sauce.

For passengers, the changes start with boarding. They enter into a wide-open area with sweeping arches. Eyes instinctively move up. There's an impression of more space. Claustrophobia is reduced just a bit, even if seats are as cramped as ever.

Another physiological trick: lights gradually change colour during long flights to reduce jet lag.

But the biggest changes come thanks to the stronger composite shell, which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminium. Air won't be as dry, with humidity doubled to 16 per cent.

The cabin will be pressurised at the equivalent of 6,000 feet - 2,000 less than most planes. That should lead to fewer headaches and leave passengers with more energy during long trips. A number of passengers said today’s flight was too short to notice any improvement.
