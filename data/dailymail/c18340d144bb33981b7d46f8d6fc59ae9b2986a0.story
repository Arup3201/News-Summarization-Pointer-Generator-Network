Belgium midfielder Eden Hazard will not feature in tonight's Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra due to a toe injury, national coach Marc Wilmots has confirmed.

The 23-year-old joined up with his countrymen despite picking up the knock during Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League win over Arsenal on Sunday, but will not be risked in Brussels with one eye on Monday's clash with Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zenica.

Wilmots tweeted, in French and Dutch: 'As a precaution, @hazardeden10 will not play against Andorra because of a bruised toe. Trying to get him 100% for #bosbel.'

Wilmots also revealed on Twitter on Thursday evening that Hazard's club and international team-mate Thibaut Courtois was feeling no ill-effects from the head injury which ended his weekend involvement against the Gunners.

'@thibautcourtois has trained from the beginning to the end without any problems,' he posted.
