The owner of an English vineyard who crashed his sports car after getting 'tipsy' at a wine tasting is being sued for £300,000 by his injured former girlfriend.

Wine entrepreneur Art Tukker, 24, is one of the most influential people in the British wine industry as the owner of the Tinwood Estate vineyard, near Chichester in Sussex.

Having consumed a 'significant amount of alcohol' at a 5 hour wine tasting at Millbank Tower in London on March 8 2010, Tukker crashed his two-seater TVR convertible on the A286 driving home in West Sussex.

His ex-girlfriend, 26-year-old wine business graduate Lucinda Fleur Stevens from Chichester, had to be cut from the wreckage of the overturned sports car by firemen.

She told the court that she sustained a fractured neck and back, broken ribs and a smashed and dislocated breast bone, while Tukker escaped unharmed.

Stevens is suing Tukker for a minimum of £300,000, blaming the winemaker's decision to drink-drive for the 'serious injuries' she suffered.

However, the young vineyard boss is fighting the case, claiming his girlfriend 'exposed herself to a 
foreseeable risk of injury' by getting in the sports car when she 'knew 
that he had been drinking alcohol.'

Tukker
 is said to have lost control while driving between Haslemere station 
and his vineyard.

His lawyers admit that the accident 
was caused by the viticulturalist's drink driving and he pleaded to 
guilty to driving when he was over the limit.

However, in his Tukker's defence, Roger 
Harris, Mr Tukker's barrister, argued that her 'injuries, loss and 
damage were contributed to by her own negligence' because she decided to
 travel with him in the knowledge he had been drinking that afternoon.

Harris argued that Stevens was aware that Mr Tukker may have been unfit to drive.

Art Tukker has been growing three different grape varieties since 2007 at his vineyard, The Tinwood Estate, on the edge of the South Downs national park in West Sussex.

Tukker's estate grows
 Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, the grapes used to make 
Champagne. He makes his own wine and supplies grapes to winemakers Ridgeview to make their 'world class English sparkling wine.'

Ridgeview provided the wine served at the recent state banquet for President Obama in 2010.

Tukker describes his own brand of wine as having 'aromas of citrus melon fruits with hints of toast and honey.'

He said: 'Miss Stevens knew that, during the course of the tasting, Mr Tukker had, or was likely to have, consumed a significant amount of alcohol.

'Miss Stevens and Mr Tukker had dinner together and had then travelled together to Haslemere station by train.

Mr Tukker appeared 'tipsy' following the wine tasting.'

Therefore Mr Tukker's lawyer claimed that Stevens had 'exposed herself to a forseeable risk of injury,' he claims.

Addressing the extent of the injuries Miss Stevens suffered and the value of her claim, the barrister says: 'It is admitted that Miss Stevens suffered some injury in the accident.

However no admissions are made as to the extent of any injuries suffered.'

On a blog about his career, Mr Tukker wrote that, when he decided to study viticulture: 'I thought I was being extremely clever by doing something where I would get the chance to drink, all in the name of 'education''.

He added that the 'best part' of his job is sampling fine wines.
