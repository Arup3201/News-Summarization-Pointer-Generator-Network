Arsenal may have been leading against Liverpool with just minutes of the game to go but damning statistics from Sunday's Premier League encounter suggest the Gunners were lucky to come away from Merseyside with a point.

Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel towered above the Arsenal defence to power home a header to rob Arsene Wenger's men of three points deep into nine minutes of injury time. 

The Gunners responded swiftly to Philippe Coutinho's opener as Mathieu Debuchy levelled a minute later before taking the lead courtesy of a neat finish from Olivier Giroud only to lose the match at the death.

However, while the sight of Nacho Monreal and Per Mertesacker ducking as  Skrtel rose through the air to level will disappoint Arsenal fans, the post-match stats will be more of a concern.

From goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny having to deal with 27 shots to frontman Alexis Sanchez doing more defensive work than four of Arsenal's five defenders, the Gunners put in a laboured performance on Merseyside and will need to improve ahead of their Boxing Day clash against QPR.

Giroud and Co may have been all smiles after going ahead but statistics from the game make for grim reading

Arsenal faced more shots (27) on Sunday than they have in any other Premier League game for 11 years.

The Gunners have dropped 11 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season. They only dropped nine in the entirety of the 2013/14 campaign.

Alexis Sanchez won more tackles (3) against Liverpool than Mathieu Debuchy, Per Mertesacker, Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs combined (1).

Arsenal's 35 per cent share of possession at Anfield was their lowest since Opta began gathering stats 11 years ago.

The north London club have managed just one win against the Premier League's top seven sides since last Christmas. The full record reads: D L D L D W L D L D D D L L D. 

Arsenal have  not won an away game in which they have conceded since January (when they claimed a 2-1 victory against Aston Villa).
