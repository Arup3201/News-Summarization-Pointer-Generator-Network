Rick Santorum believes U.S. military plans to allow more women to serve closer to the front-line could compromise missions because men have ‘protective emotions’ towards the opposite sex.

New Pentagon rules will continue preventing women from serving as infantry, armour and special operations forces - but they will formally allow them to serve in other jobs at the battalion level.

However the Republican presidential candidate said it’s natural for men to be protective when they see women in harm’s way, which could cause them to lose focus on accomplishing a mission.

‘Men have emotions when you see a woman in harm’s way,’ he told NBC on Friday. ‘It’s something that’s natural that’s very much in our culture to be protective. That’s a concern with all the military.’

Mr Santorum told CNN on Thursday that the idea is ‘not in the best interests of men, women or the mission’. He added on NBC that this is down to the ‘natural inclination to want to protect someone’.

The former Pennsylvania senator said he believes women are capable of fighting alongside men in the heat of battle, but his concern is over how men would react to seeing women ‘in harm’s way’.

Mr Santorum has risen from a non-contender to a major candidate in little over a month, following his win in the first contest in Iowa, and then in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri earlier this week.

His campaign has seen a huge rise in 
donations after his impressive performance in the three states on 
Tuesday and he told NBC’s Ann Curry that he is currently receiving 
around $1million every day.

A Gallup poll now shows him tied for second place across the U.S. with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, although former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney remains slightly ahead of both.

Meanwhile Mr Santorum visited his sick three-year-old daughter Isabella - who suffers from genetic disorder Trisomy 18 and is currently fighting pneumonia - in hospital on Thursday evening.

‘She’s doing great,’ he told NBC. ‘She was on the mend when I (last) left (her). It was just so great to be home last night and get a chance to spend a lot of time with her and the rest of the kids.’

For the past decade women in the U.S. 
military have served, fought and died on the battlefields in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. But Pentagon rules were catching up a bit with reality on 
Thursday.

War has already propelled women to the
 front lines - often as medics, military police or intelligence officers
 - but they couldn't be assigned as an infantryman in a unit going out 
on patrol.

But they could fly the helicopter 
supporting the unit, or move in to provide medical aid if troops were 
injured. Defence officials said the new rules will change that.

They will formally allow women to be 
assigned to a battalion and serve in jobs such as medics, intelligence, 
police or communications officers, with the greatest effect on the Army 
and Marines.

They ban women from more jobs than the 
Navy and Air Force do - largely because of the infantry positions – but 
there long has been opposition to putting women in combat.

'When you have men and women together in combat, I think men have emotions when you see a woman in harm’s way'

Critics ask if they have the strength 
and stamina, or if their presence might hurt unit cohesion, and suggest 
Americans would be unhappy to see large numbers of women coming home in 
body bags.

But the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
where battlefield lines are blurred and insurgents can be around every 
corner, have made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat.

Thousands have served in the two wars, 
and more than 150 have been killed. But a 1994 combat exclusion policy 
bans women from being assigned to ground combat units below the brigade 
level.

A brigade is roughly 3,500 troops, and is
 made up of battalions of about 800 soldiers. This means a woman serving
 as a communications or intelligence officer can be formally assigned to
 a brigade.

But she can't be assigned to the smaller battalion. The military has got around this by ‘attaching’ women to battalions, meaning they could do the work without the credit for being in combat arms.

While the new rules won't open up the Navy SEALS or the Army Delta Force to women, former U.S. defence secretary Robert Gates said in 2010 that the military may eventually be open to that.

Admiral Mike Mullen, ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said in November 2010 that 'large segments of women returning will have been exposed to some form of combat' in Iraq and Afghanistan.
