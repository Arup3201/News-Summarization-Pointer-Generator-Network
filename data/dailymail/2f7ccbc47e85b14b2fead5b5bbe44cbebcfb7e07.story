A transgender TSA agent fired from her job at an airport for using the women’s toilet has received a five-figure pay-out from the agency.

Ashley Yang was fired from her job at Los Angeles International Airport after allegedly being ordered to dress like a man and pat down men.

She had informed human resources that a background check would reveal she was born male and had not undergone sex reassignment surgery.

'I feel female - I don't think anyone considers me male,’ Ms Yang told In The Life.

‘The hormones have given me a very female kind of look. It was obvious people perceived me as female because that's who I am.’

Ms Yang has received back pay in addition to a five-figure award for pain and suffering as part of a civil rights settlement.

'They told me the only way to work at checkpoints for females was I had to go through a complete transition,’ she told In The Life.

‘I'm like: "How do you define a complete transition"?'

In addition to compensation, her settlement requires TSA managers based at the California airport to have transgender sensitivity training.

A TSA spokesman said he cannot discuss details of her case because of privacy rules, but the manager training started this summer.

Ms Yang says she now wants to use her story and lawsuit as a 'leverage' to help other transgender people in the future.

Mara Keisling, of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told In The Life that the employment situation for many trans people is 'catastrophic'.

‘We have an unemployment rate that's twice the national average.

‘When there's a recession and there are lay-offs the people who are most marginalised already in the workplace are the ones most likely to face additional scrutiny.'
