Nick Clegg yesterday accused the Tories of wanting to ‘pull up the drawbridge’ to EU workers as plans for a new migrant cap began to disintegrate.

Documents leaked at the weekend suggested the Home Office wanted to limit the number of workers arriving from the rest of the EU at 75,000 a year.

The idea drew a ferocious response from the Liberal Democrat leader who claimed it was ‘illegal’, ‘unworkable’ and would be a ‘disaster’ for UK business.

Anger: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg tore into the Home Office for leaking 'illegal' ideas instead of focusing on exit checks

And last night Downing Street appeared to agree that, under the EU’s current free movement rules, a cap would be unlawful.

Asked
whether David Cameron agreed that a cap on overall EU immigration would
be ‘illegal and undeliverable’, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman
said: ‘There are clear free movement laws. We have to operate within 
those.’

He added: ‘As the 
Prime Minister has said, do we need to look at free movement? Yes, 
because, as he said, there shouldn’t be  a freedom to move to claim 
[welfare benefits].”

Home 
Secretary Theresa May, under heavy fire over the leaked idea, also 
indicated the idea was open to revision. She suggested that, rather than
focusing on all EU migrants, the target of any new government crackdown
could be new member states.

But
a poll released last night showed Mr Clegg’s position is not shared by 
the overwhelming majority of the British public – and restrictions on 
free movement of EU workers would be supported.

In a survey for the 
British Future think tank, only 15 per cent of voters said they were 
‘comfortable’ with the EU’s free movement directive and thought it was 
‘good for Britain’.

Tough: Senior Conservatives including Home Secretary Theresa May and PM David Cameron have promised further restrictions on immigration

Tensions are rising at Westminster, with Romanians and Bulgarians due to get open access to the UK jobs market next month.

Mr Clegg, at his regular Westminster press conference yesterday, attacked the idea of a cap.

He
said: ‘It would be very unwelcome to the 2million or so Brits who live 
and work abroad, who I don’t think would thank the Conservative Party 
for entering a tit-for-tat race to the bottom where everybody in the EU 
starts pulling up the drawbridge.

‘My
advice to the Home Office is to spend less time leaking policies that 
are illegal and undeliverable and spend more time delivering on the 
policies we have agreed as a Coalition – notably to reinstate exit 
checks.’

An announcement on re-instating the counting of people leaving the UK is expected soon.
