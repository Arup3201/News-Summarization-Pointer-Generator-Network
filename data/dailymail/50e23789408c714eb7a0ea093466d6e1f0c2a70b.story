The FBI is joining an investigation into bogus letters sent to many Florida residents, including the Republican Party of Florida chairman, that raise questions about their eligibility to vote.

The FBI will focus on letters received by voters in 18 counties in central and southwest Florida.

According to the Republican Party of Florida, Chairman Lenny Curry received one of the fake letters on Tuesday.

The fake polling letters raise questions about the voter's citizenship and appear to intend to intimidate people

'This type of activity is not only disgusting, it is criminal, and must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,' Curry said. 

'I call on Florida Democrats to join me in condemning this false letter writing campaign that appears to target likely voters in Florida, and help RPOF get the word out about this false campaign.'

The bogus letters claim to be from county supervisors of elections but are postmarked from Seattle.

They raise questions about the voter's citizenship and appear intended to intimidate people.

Officials on Monday said voters who had received the letters so far are white, registered Republicans who consistently vote in elections.

'This is a major concern,' said Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who received a letter from a voter mailed from Seattle with no return address.

'You should not expect a letter from your elections office saying, 'You're not registered to vote, please don't go to the polls.' That's ridiculous.'

On Tuesday, the state of Florida said there have been reports from more than 20 counties where voters have received fraudulent letters impersonating supervisors of elections.

'We are working with the state’s supervisors of elections as well as law enforcement to find the source of these letters and put a stop to them.

'We have provided all of the information we have received to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement,' said Chris Cate, communications director for the Florida Department of State.

'We have no tolerance for voter fraud or intimidation, and any attempts at fraud or intimidation will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent possible.'

Inside the letter is the resident's supervisor of election's name, the resident's name and address, and a warning that doubts the voter's citizenship, saying the resident is not eligible to vote unless a letter is returned in an enclosed form within 15 days.

'It creates confusion, it's just a big distraction,' said Linda Tanko of the Orange County Supervisor of Elections Office, which has received multiple letters.

Some voters said it's easy to be fooled.

'It looks official,' a Central Florida resident said.

'I would think they were full of it because I would ask for someone to prove it,' said another voter when showed a copy of the fraudulent letter.

East Naples resident Wayne Hoss said he received his letter on Saturday and immediately knew it was a hoax because he was born in the United States.

Hoss says the letter included a form seeking personal information, including his Social Security and driver's license numbers.

The FBI says voters who get a letter should contact their supervisor of elections and then keep the letter for the FBI.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also investigating.

Voter fraud is punishable with up to a 5 year prison sentence.
