The agent of Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has confirmed he could leave the Serie A champions this summer with Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid among potential suitors. 

The 21-year-old has been linked with moves away from the Italian club and agent Mino Raiola feels the sale of Pogba will demand record-breaking money in excess of £80million.

Raiola even likened the France international to priceless artwork, saying 'if there is one Mona Lisa in the world, and she is for sale, it will be a record price'.

Is Pogba - a 21-year-old France international with 22 caps - worth in excess of £80m? 

His agent Raiola thinks so, though he could just be after 10 per cent of the selling fee...

'He wants to make his mark on football history and he is already doing that,' Raiola told Telefoot.

'Not a single player at the age of 21 has shown the world what he can do: lead a team in the palm of his hand. Pogba, he has done it already. His future? He could join any team. 

'If the right time comes this summer, then it will happen.

'If it is not the right time, he could stay for another year or two. He will beat the transfer record. If there is one Mona Lisa in the world, and she is for sale, it will be a record price.' 

It comes following Raiola's claim that six European clubs have been chasing Pogba and that 'if he goes he will break [Cristiano] Ronaldo's transfer record'.
