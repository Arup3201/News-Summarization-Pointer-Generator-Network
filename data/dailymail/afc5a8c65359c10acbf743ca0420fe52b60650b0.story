Many parents hope to protect their offspring from future heartbreak by imparting a few hard-won pearls of their own wisdom.

In Amanda Holden's case, her relationship advice to her daughters is simple - whatever you do, don't follow the example of your mother.

The Britain's Got Talent judge has revealed her regrets over her first failed marriage, saying she hopes they settle down with the right man much earlier than she did.

Motherly advice: Britain's Got Talent Judge Amanda Holden seen leaving Sushi Samba with a friend in London

Now aged 43, she fears it will be another 40 years before she becomes a grandmother if her children Lexi, eight, and Hollie, two, leave motherhood as late as she did.

She told Woman & Home magazine [subs, must credit]: 'My big hope for them is that they find the person they want to be with first time. I think you can handle most things if you've got a happy family life. 'But I said to Chris the other day I might be 80 when I have my first grandchild if Lexi waits till she's 40.

'So the only advice I'll give them about men is “Don't get married before you are 24, but please have children before you're 25'.' Miss Holden - who was 34 when she had the first of her children - married their father, record producer Chris Hughes, in 2008.

Before that, she was better known for her disastrous relationship with comedian Les Dennis.

The couple wed in 1995 when she was just 24, but their marriage was rocked in 2000 when it was revealed she had an affair with actor Neil Morrissey.

Mr Dennis stayed with her for two years, only for her to leave him when he also admitted having an affair with a mutual friend.

After she divorced him in 2003, Miss Holden described his infidelity as her 'passport out' of the relationship.

Now, she says her only regret is they did not split much earlier.

She said: 'We had a good six years but then one of us should have said, "This isn't going to work anymore." I regret how badly he came off. When I first married Les I think I was seen by some as a gold digger and I'd go out of my way to change opinion.

'But my view now is that you just have to give yourself a break and accept that not everyone will like you. I mean, I find myself irritating sometimes - so other people must too.'

She added: 'I had divorced a national treasure and very publicly had an affair, so I think a lot of people must have thought I was a bit of a minx - not least because if you're a woman you're somehow not allowed to do that kind of thing.

'But the reality is I am not that girl and have always been very much a relationship person. I could have let the country when I divorced from Les. But I didn't want to be dictated to. My Mum always said I'd rather walk into trouble than run away from it.'

Miss Holden described Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell, 54, as her 'on screen husband', and said he had taught her never to admit weakness in her relationships.

She said: 'Simon gave me some really good advice once. He said “Have you ever been dumped?' So I said, “Oh God yeah - where do I start?'.

And he said, “Let me give you a tip: Never admit you've been dumped.' 'So about two years later he said, “Have you ever been dumped Amanda?' and I went “No, never'

And he started laughing his head off and I said, “You trained me well, darling. He says my backbone is made of steel. I'd say it's more like titanium.''
