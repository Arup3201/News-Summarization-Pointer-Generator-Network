Failing to get a good night's sleep can make cancer more aggressive and speed its growth, researchers have claimed.

They say that sleep disturbed by constant waking can make a noticeable difference in just four weeks.

The researchers say the key is damage to the immune system, dampening its ability to control or eradicate early cancers.

Researchers say the discovery could lead to new treatments for cancer - but warn people to 'take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account'

Researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells.

As the mice slept during the day, a quiet, motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep.

The other mice were not disturbed as they slept.

After just four weeks, the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally.

In a study published in the journal Cancer Research, researchers experimented with genetically engineered mice that had been injected with tumor cells.

As the mice slept during the day, a quiet, motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes – forcing some of the mice to wake up and go back to sleep.

The other mice were not disturbed as they slept.

After just four weeks, the researchers found that the tumors in the mice with fragmented sleep patterns were twice as large as the tumors in the mice who had slept normally.

The study is the first to demonstrate, in an animal model, the direct effects of fragmented sleep on tumor growth and invasiveness, and it points to a biological mechanism that could serve as a potential target for therapy.

'It’s not the tumor, it’s the immune system,' said David Gozal, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital, who led the study.

'Fragmented sleep changes how the immune system deals with cancer in ways that make the disease more aggressive.

'Fortunately, our study also points to a potential drug target,' he said.

The lead researcher on the project said: 'The take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account.'

'Toll-like receptor 4, a biological messenger, helps control activation of the innate immune system.

'It appears to be a lynchpin for the cancer-promoting effects of sleep loss.

'The effects of fragmented sleep that we focused on were not seen in mice that lacked this protein.'

'This study offers biological plausibility to the epidemiological associations between perturbed sleep and cancer outcomes,' Gozal said.

'The take home message is to take care of your sleep quality and quantity like you take care of your bank account.'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that about 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems.

'Considering the high prevalence of both sleep disorders and cancer in middle age or older populations,' the authors wrote, 'there are far-reaching implications.'

Their next step is to determine whether sleep affects metastasis or resistance to cancer chemotherapy.
