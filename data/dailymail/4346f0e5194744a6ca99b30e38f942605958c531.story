A shopper got quite a shock when she picked up a bag of potatoes to find a snake sleeping inside.

Lewina Stewart, from Toowoomba in Queensland's south-east, had bought the vegetables at her local Woolworths on March 10 before making the find.

Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher 24/7's Ritchie Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia Ms Stewart had the potatoes for a week before she noticed the snake inside when she went to open it.

She found it 'alive and well' and alerted staff members at Woolworths of the 30-centimetre white-crowned snake.

'It was sealed packet so it would have been in there before it was sealed,' Mr Gilbert said. 

'There are tiny holes in the bag but it would have been too small for the snake to get in.'

It is understood Woolworths is taking the incident seriously and are trying to find out what went wrong.

Mr Gilbert also shed light on how the snake got inside the bag.  

'It is a mildly venomous snake. It will burrow under foliage and soil, so I'm not surprised it could have been pulled up with the potatoes,' he said.

In his last 13 years as professional snake catcher, Mr Gilbert said this incident was the most unusual.

'This would have to be the strangest place [to find a snake],' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I find them in people's shoes, under people’s pillows, in people's toilets. 

'You name a place I've done it - cars, everything.

'I caught six today [alone] so it's not wonder I find them in strange places.'

Other strange places Mr Gilbert has found a snake include a box of cup of soup and a set of drawers.

Earlier this year he found a common tree snake at Mountain Creek on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.

Two days before that he posted a photo of a carpet python sleeping in a drawer in Noosa, also on the coast.

This month's incident comes after redback spiders were found in green grapes sold at Woolworths.

A mother from Thornleigh, in Sydney's north-west, found a spider in a bag of Thompson Seedless grapes, while another man found two redbacks in a bag of grapes he bought at a Gold Coast Woolworths.

This comes after another man found two redbacks in a bag of grapes he bought at a Gold Coast Woolworths and a woman in Auckland, New Zealand found a redback in a bag of imported Australian grapes she purchased from the Woolworths-owned Countdown supermarket chain less than a month ago.

'It wasn't until I had picked it up by a leg and it started to wriggle around and turn that I realised what it was and dropped it real quick,' Ms Alexander-de Jersey told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I initially thought it was just a part of the grape stem.

'It had been in the fridge for a few hours prior to me washing them, we think that has possibly slowed it down a bit and luckily for me it was a bit lethargic.'
