Marouane Chamakh admits he is the happiest he has ever been in England - and doesn't want his love affair with Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace to come to an end.

The former Arsenal striker penned a one-year deal at Selhurst Park last summer and has emerged as a fan favourite during their successful fight against relegation.

He is yet to discuss his future with the club, but told Sportsmail: 'I am at the end of my contract now and my priority is to stay at Crystal Palace for maybe one or two more years. This is the happiest I have ever been in England.'

Happy days: Chamakh has scored six goals for Palace this season, and has enjoyed his time at the club

He went on: 'I think he (Pulis) wants me to stay, yeah. If not I don’t know why! Maybe I did something wrong.

'I want to continue to work with him and with Crystal Palace. Everything, the atmosphere, the players I work with, I don’t want to change anything.

'I just want to be better and better with Crystal Palace.'

Chamakh admits the Palace fans are the best he has come across, as he added: 'It's crazy. Sometimes when we play away I have travelled back by train with the fans.

'We were talking for like two hours and I can see how they love this team and this club.

'This has happened four or five times and it is just a moment when we can talk together.

'It is crazy how much they love the team - they are talking about the gaffer, the players, about everything and they don't stop.

Miracle: Tony Pulis is a contender for manager of the season after guiding Palace up the table 

'They even invited me out for a drink!'

New deal or otherwise, Chamakh will be retuning to the south of Morocco this summer where he will be lending a hand in his brother's restaurant.

'It is fun and and I am happy there,' said the 30-year-old.

'Its nice because they are all happy to see me.

'The people sometimes cannot believe it is me and they have to ask. After that we take pictures and it is good.'

Beyond that it is South London where he hopes to be putting smiles on faces.
