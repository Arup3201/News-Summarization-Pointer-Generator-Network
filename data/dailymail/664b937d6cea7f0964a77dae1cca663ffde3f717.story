A Michigan man is celebrating the return of his 2.5 ton footbridge after it was allegedly stolen from his property.

Robert Cortis of Farmington Hills told ABC News that he was 'very sad' and 'emotionally lost' when he discovered the 40-foot steel and wood structure had disappeared.

However, one day after he filed a  report, the garden feature was found by police in Belleville, about 20 miles away from its original location.

Back in the day: Cortis' bridge in action during the Nineties 

Cortis says he discovered the bridge was missing when he stopped by his property near 8 Mile Road with plans to move it this week. 

He wanted to re-install it at his catering business and use it for taking wedding photos.

Cortis says the bridge has sentimental value because his father built it and it has spanned the Taribussi Creek for about 25 years. 

When he saw it had gone, Cortis launched an appeal online. 

Of value: Cortis feared the It 40-foot-long, six-foot-wide and seven-foot-tall bridge, weighing between 5,000 to 10,000, had been taken by scrap metal thieves

With an estimated value of $50,000 to $75,000 it also could have also been cleaned up and sold on

'It had a lot of sentimental value to us so I wanted to use it in a good way that would kind of be a tribute to my dad.'
