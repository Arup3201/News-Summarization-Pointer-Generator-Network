A massive chemical spill along a West Virginia river has triggered a tap water ban for hundreds of thousands of residents - shutting down schools, bars and restaurants and emptying stores of bottled water as more than 300,000 residents have been left without tap water.

Residents were told to not bathe, brush 
their teeth or wash their clothes with tap water after 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol, a foaming agent used in the coal preparation process, spilled on Thursday.

So far, nearly 700 people have called the state's poison control hotline complaining of symptoms of exposure to the chemical. Those symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, skin irritation or rashes.

FEMA: The federal government sent 75 trucks - each carrying 18,500 liters of water - as well as bottled water to help provide water for those in need

Of the 700 calls to poison control, fewer than 10 people have been hospitalized.

Federal authorities began investigating how the foaming agent escaped a chemical plant and seeped into the Elk River. Just how much of the chemical leaked into the river was not yet known.

Officials are working with the company that makes the chemical to determine how much can be in the water without it posing harm to residents, said West Virginia American Water president Jeff McIntyre.

'We don't know that the water's not safe. But I can't say that it is safe,' McIntyre said Friday. For now, there is no way to treat the tainted water aside from flushing the system until it's in low-enough concentrations to be safe, a process that could take days.

Officials and experts said the chemical, even in its most concentrated form, isn't deadly.

President Barack Obama issued an emergency declaration for the state on Friday, ordering federal aid as residents raced to stores to stock up on bags of ice and crates of bottled water.

FEMA is sending 75 trucks - each carrying 18,500 liters of water - will start arriving in the town on Friday evening.

The accident unfolded on the Elk River in
 Charleston, West Virginia's capital and largest city, just upriver from
 the state's largest water treatment plant.

It forced Governor Earl Ray Tomblin to 
declare a state of emergency for nine counties as 300,000 residents were left without water.

Health officials have advised residents to use tap water only for flushing toilets and fighting fires.

'West Virginians in the affected 
service areas are urged not to use tap water for drinking, cooking, 
washing or bathing,' Gov. Earl Tomblin said in a statement. 'Right now, our 
priorities are our hospitals, nursing homes and schools.'

A spokesperson with West Virginia American Water told WSAZ they are carrying out water quality testing every hour to figure out the level of concentration in the water.

But she added that the company is unsure how much of the chemical seeped into the water, and said there is no timetable for when the water will be safe to use.

Emergency workers were transporting water to distribution centers in the affected counties, according to the Charleston Gazette.

Following the chemical spill in the Elk River on Thursday, residents have been told not to use tap water for drinking, bathing or cooking, and were warned that boiling it does not remove the chemicals.

The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said symptoms include: severe burning in throat, severe eye irritation, non-stop vomiting, trouble breathing or severe skin irritation such as skin blistering, WSAZ reported.

The company is unsure how much of the chemical - which is used in the coal preparation process - seeped into the water, and said there is no timetable for when it will be safe to use.

Local media showed pictures of residents lining up at stores for bottled water, and shelves emptied of their supplies.

At a Kroger supermarket in Kanawha City, a Charleston police officer stood guard as shoppers stocked up on bottled water.

'People have been grabbing it like 
crazy,' Kerstin Halstead told the newspaper as she loaded two cases of 
water into her SUV. 'Some people were getting - well, they could have 
shared more.'

The West Virginia National Guard planned to mobilize at an air base at Charleston's Yeager Airport on Friday to distribute bottled drinking water to emergency services agencies in the nine counties, Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety spokesman Lawrence Messina said.

'They're committing all necessary resources to help with this,' Messina said Thursday night.

Messina
 said the drinking water will come from several different suppliers. 
After distribution, the various county agencies 'will use their own game
 plans to distribute it, with hospitals and nursing homes getting 
priority,' Messina said.

Desperate:
 Tanaz Rahin and her mother Farri Rahin of Charleston drove across town 
to find water following the chemical spill on the Elk River that 
compromised the public water supply to eight counties on Thursday

Concern: Laura John of Charleston also drove across town to South Charleston to find water

Dr.
 Rahul Gupta, health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston and the Putnam 
County Health Departments, ordered the closure of all restaurants and 
schools receiving water from the West Virginia American Water company.

Schools
 would be shut on Friday across many counties, including Boone, Cabell, 
Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Pocahontas and Putnam, the West 
Virginia Department of Education said on its website.

Tomblin's spokeswoman, Amy Shuler Goodwin, said she did not know when the ban would be lifted.

The spill originated with Freedom Industries, a Charleston company, according to Laura Jordan, external affairs manager for West Virginia American Water.

It occurred above the intake of the Kanawha Valley water treatment plant in Charleston, which serves 100,000 homes and businesses, or 250,000 to 300,000 people, Jordan said.

'It could be potentially harmful if swallowed and could potentially cause skin and eye irritation,' Jordan said.

The West Virginia Department of Environment Protection got a report of a strange odor on Thursday morning and visited the Freedom Industries site, where they found a leaking storage unit, Shuler Goodwin said.

The company is working with state and federal authorities to get residents access to bottled water, and water distribution sites will be announced through local media, Jordan said.

A representative for Freedom Industries did not respond to requests for comment.

The company says on its website it is a producer of specialty chemicals for the mining, steel and cement industries.
