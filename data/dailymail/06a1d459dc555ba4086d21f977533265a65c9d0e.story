With social media increasingly pervading our everyday lives, it's hardly surprising that couples are going to great lengths to make sure it doesn't ruin their relationships.

A particularly popular new trend is the 'social media prenup' - a contract stipulating that couples cannot share incriminating photos or posts about one another, at the risk of having to fork out thousands of dollars.

'It’s a huge issue because we all know 
this stuff, once it's out there, you can't shake it,' New York-based attorney Ann-Margaret Carrozza told ABC News. 'It
 can be humiliating. It can be painful.  It's really no joke.'

Take no risks: There's currently a rising trend in the 'social media prenup' - a contract stipulating that couples cannot share incriminating photos or posts about one another, at the risk of having to pay money

The most common clause, according to Ms Carrozza, states that couples can't post nude or embarrassing photos that might harm their significant other's reputation - whether it be on Facebook, Instagram or any other website.

The penalty is usually monetary, with well-to-do couples in New York typically paying up to $50,000 each time they break the clause.

While it may seem extreme to have a written contract rather than just a conversation about privacy, many couples say it makes it easier to deal with tricky situations in the future.

That's exactly why Los Angeles-based relationship therapist Sheri Meyers decided to draw up a social media prenup between her and her boyfriend Jonathon Aslay, who works as a relationship coach.

'For me, it was about privacy, what is for us and what is for the world, so we needed that discussion,' explained Dr Meyers.

'What Jonathon and I do is he'll say, "This is an SMP [social media prenup] moment. Is this OK [to post]? Is this crossing the line?" It's two sentences, versus a paragraph or an hour [discussion]. It's not a big deal, anymore.'

She added that it's not about a lack of trust between couples; it's about keeping things simple and clear-cut from the very beginning.

The risk that an angry ex might resort to the disturbing phenomenon of 'revenge porn' is also a motivator for signing this type of prenup, says Dr Meyers.

'It's so easy, especially in anger, in "ex anger," to post things on social media to get even'

'In this day and age, it's really important, almost mandatory, to not assume and to lay it out,' she explained.

'It's one thing when you're all lovely dovely. It's another thing when you're breaking up... It's so easy, especially in anger, in "ex anger," to post things to get even.'

Indeed, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, more than 80per cent of U.S. divorce attorneys say that issues involving social networking are on the rise in divorce proceedings.

Atlanta-based divorce attorney Randy Kessler says that social media clauses may not totally rectify the problem, but they do encourage couples to modify their behavior, especially after a break-up.

'I don't think they hurt, but what's interesting is they are untested. [But] it makes you not want to take the risk,' he said.
