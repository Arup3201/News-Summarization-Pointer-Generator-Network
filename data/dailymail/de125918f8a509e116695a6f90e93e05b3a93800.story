Purina Beneful dog food has caused the illness and possibly the death of thousands of dogs, a new class-action lawsuit filed earlier this month has claimed.

The lawsuit contends the dog food, a Nestlé Purina PetCare Co. product, has dangerous toxins, including propylene glycol and mycotoxins.

Nastle Purina officials say the lawsuit is 'without merit' and based on 'social media-driven misinformation.' Purina Beneful is still being sold on store shelves.

Lawsuit: Beneful dog food, made by Nestle Purina, is being sued for allegedly causing dogs to get sick

The lawsuit was first filed by Frank Lucido in a US District Court in California. 

Lucido says three of his family dogs became ill after eating exclusively Beneful for a period of time. 

Dozer, an eight-year-old English Bulldog, suffered internal bleeding in his stomach and lesions in his liver and died, he says.

According to the suit, Lucido's two other dogs also became ill after eating Beneful. 

He said he fed them only Beneful for less than a month.

The lawsuit says thousands of dogs have suffered internal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, vomiting and other symptoms.

This class action suit concerns 'kibble' dry food, which includes 'Purina Beneful Health Weight'; 'Purina Beneful Original'; 'Purina Beneful Incredibites,' and 'Purina Beneful Healthy Growth for Puppies', 'Purina Beneful Healthy Smile', 'Purina Beneful Health Fiesta', 'Purina Beneful Healthy Raidance', and 'Purina Beneful Playful Life' varieties. 

Harmful? Propylene glycol, a substance the suit says is toxic to cats and dogs, may be included in Beneful’s ingredients list because it helps retain the food’s moisture

The lawsuit lists stomach and related internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, seizures, bloat and kidney failure as symptoms consistently reported by dog-owners feeding their dogs Beneful.

Lucido claims these illnesses, and similar illnesses of other dogs that have become sick and/or died after eating Beneful, were caused by toxic substances found in the food.

'We received hundreds of complaints,' said attorney James Young, of lawfirm Morgan & Morgan out of Tampa, Florida - one of the lawyers filing the suit.

 'Nationally, there have been thousands of complaints about dogs who have eaten this dog food by Purina Beneful and suffered very serious side effects, including death.'

'The issues are pretty similar across the board,' he said, 'liver and kidney problems, which results in diarrhea, bloody stool, vomiting, and secondary harm.'

Specifically, the suit claims that automotive antifreeze component propylene glycol is a primary ingredient in Beneful's dog food.

Defensive: The company responded to the claims, stating that the suit is 'without merit' and that there are 'no product quality problems with Beneful' (stock picture)

The lawsuit is asking that Nestlé Purina Petcare Company pay actual, statutory and punitive damages to all those filed under the class action suit -- as well as forfeit any profits earned from the sale of the product in question. 

The St. Louis Business Journal talked to Nestlé Purina PetCare. 

'We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against it,' Keith Schopp, vice president of corporate public relations, said.

'Like other pet foods, Beneful is occasionally the subject of social media-driven misinformation.'

'We have a very comprehensive quality assurance program to ensure the quality of our products.'

Beneful has been the target of two other class action lawsuits, both of which, Schopp said, were quickly dismissed.
