Schoolchildren who constantly feel they are the smartest in the class tend to be disliked by their fellow pupils, researchers have found. 

Researchers found the more one student feels unrealistically superior to another, the less they are liked. 

They say it explains the stigma attached to being a 'nerd'.

Using a round-robin design, the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates, in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority (i.e. rating on a scale ''I feel academically superior to him/her''). 

They the contrasted those ratings with the students' grades in math, physics, German, and English. Importantly, they conducted the analysis at two different social levels: 'habitual' - the way people act in general - and 'relationship' - the way someone acts around a specific individual.

November 12, 2014 - 'I am the smartest kid in class.' We all want our kids to be self-confident, but unrealistic perceptions of their academic abilities can be harmful. 

In fact, unrealistic views, a new study of eighth-graders finds, can damage the a child's relationship with others in the classroom. 

'There is more to being labeled a nerd than just academic achievement,' said Katrin Rentzsch of the University of Bamberg in Germany, who led the research. 

'I really got interested in the question of whether it is OK to brag about achievements in class or if you should rather not display your achievements in the classroom.'

The research looked at something psychologists call 'self-enhancement' - when a person feels unrealistically superior to someone else.

The poster child for self-enhancement is the character Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory. 

'Although Sheldon is a smart person and receives respect for his scientific work, he still thinks that he is even smarter, brighter, or much better as compared to how he is perceived by others,' says Rentzsch, who is currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University.

Rentzsch and her colleague Michela Schröder-Abé decided to take a closer look at how such self-enhancement affects relationships.

They turned to an eighth-grade classroom to measure differences between actual academic performance, students' perceptions of their performance, and social popularity. 

The 358 students came from 20 eighth-grade classes in schools in southeast Germany.

Using a round-robin design, the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates, in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority (i.e. rating on a scale ''I feel academically superior to him/her''). 

They the contrasted those ratings with the students' grades in math, physics, German, and English. Importantly, they conducted the analysis at two different social levels: 'habitual' - the way people act in general - and 'relationship' - the way someone acts around a specific individual.

The differences between these two levels of analysis were stark: Students who tended to have an inflated view of themselves at the habitual level were neither more or less liked by their classmates. However, self-inflation toward specific individuals changed how the students felt about each other.

'The more a student felt unrealistically superior to a specific other student, the less he or she was liked by the other student in return,' wrote the researchers in a new study in Social Psychological and Personality Science.

Interestingly, at both the habitual and relationship levels, students who self-enhanced disliked their classmates more than those with more realistic views of themselves.

The results show, Rentzsch says, that 'the specific relationship between individuals matters when it comes to the social consequences of self-enhancement.' 

When a person acts superior to someone else specifically, it can be offensive, whereas if someone has an inflated sense of themselves all the time toward everyone, it feels less personal, they say.
