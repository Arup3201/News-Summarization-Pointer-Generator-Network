A supermarket chain has been forced to apologise after a manager suggested an 89-year-old war veteran selling poppies buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to set up a stall to sell them inside.

Bill Daw, 89, was left standing outside the store in Taunton in Somerset on Saturday morning after he claims he was told by a manager: 'you can't come in here, you'll need to stand out there.'

The pensioner, who served with the West Kent regiment added: 'I said to him, "But we've doing been this for years." I couldn't understand the man.'

Veronica Roach, a shopper claimed to have found the pensioner 'freezing' outside the store asked the manager why the elderly man was not selling poppies inside as temperatures dipped to around 14C.

Bill Daw, 89, was forced to sell his poppies outside the supermarket in Taunton because of space issues 

She said once she found the manager he said their current promotion at the doorway meant there was not enough space for a poppy stand as well.

Mr Daw said once Morrisons they found out what had happened they were told we could go in the supermarket. 

Ms Roach argued with the manager and claims he then told her: 'Well, he'll have to wear a warmer coat tomorrow.' 

In a lengthy post of Facebook, which has since gone viral, Veronica Roach, a former member of the Women's Royal Air Force, described meeting the poppy seller outside the supermarket on Saturday morning.

'I took his hand, which was freezing and asked why he'd set up outside,' she wrote. 

'I hunted down the manager and challenged him. He said they had their promotion at the door which meant there was no room for the poppy stand.'

The manager allegedly said Mr Daw should 'get a warmer coat tomorrow' to sell poppies outside 

Mr Daw is the standard bearer for the Taunton branch of the Burma Star Association. The old soldier, who as a 19-year-old private helped form a guard when the Japanese surrendered in Rangoon, is resilient to adversity.

He said: 'We've got over it. It is all sorted out.'

The Royal British Legion said its poppy sellers preferred to collect outside the supermarket rather than in the foyer because of a greater footfall.

Morrisons said there had been a misunderstanding and the manager did not know that by the afternoon there was a different seller outside the supermarket.

The Met Office said temperatures in Taunton on Saturday morning were likely to be between 14C and 15C.  

'The British Legion in the morning confirmed they wanted to collect outside,' Morrisons said in a statement.

'However at lunchtime their volunteer changed to an 89-year-old gentleman. This changes everything.

'We can confirm that our manager did not know this and therefore his comment re 'wrap up warm' is then exceptionally inappropriate and he is very saddened by this.

'We at Morrisons are very sorry at how this misunderstanding has looked, we will of course donate to the British Legion, and will be making a special gift to both Veronica and our 89-year-old veteran.

'Veronica is a very welcome regular in the store and is known by lots of the staff and the store manager and this issue has caused concern to all of them.

'We spoke to the British Legion this morning and the store have removed a number of static items in the foyer to enable the British Legion to be inside the store.

'The British Legion and the store are managing this situation together and are both concerned regarding any adverse reaction towards the store.

Morrisons has been forced to apologise after the manager of the branch in Taunton, Somerset suggested that an 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to  sell them inside

'We can confirm that Veronica, The British Legion and Morrisons have worked together to resolve this matter and would ask you to respect their action.'

A spokeswoman for the Royal British Legion said collectors had been offered positions inside and outside and had opted for the outside position because of the greater footfall. She said collections would continue there. 

She added: 'We are grateful to Morrisons, as we are to all commercial outlets, who permit Poppy Appeal collections on their sites throughout the UK and in doing so strengthen our fundraising efforts which ensure the Legion can continue to offer vital support and care to the Armed Forces community.'
