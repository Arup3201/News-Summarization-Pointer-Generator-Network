University students and riot police clashed in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi today following a protest against tuition fees.

Students threw rocks and debris at police, who returned fire with tear gas and crude hand-carved wooden batons in a display of shockingly violent kettling methods.

Kenyan authorities moved against protesters, who were marching on a highway near Nairobi University, in order to get them to retreat to the campus.

Violent methods: In order to remove the protesters from the highway next to the university, riot police fired tear gas around- and on campus, while chasing both students and staff back into the buildings using batons and crude wooden sticks, in order to detain them

As riot police moved on to the 
university, they fired dozens of rounds of tear gas around and outside 
the buildings, witnesses said.

When innocent staff and students inside the buildings tried to escape, they were beaten by police and forced back inside.

Students
 demonstrated in at least four cities across the country over a proposed
 increase in university fees in Tuesday.

However, according to reports, the protest by students 
from the University of Nairobi, which sits just across the street from 
the downtown business district, was the most violent.

After
 several hours of back-and-forth exchanges on the highway, police chased
 the students into university classrooms and fired tear gas inside.

Some
 people tried to leave the gas-filled rooms with their hands up but 
police chased them back inside, sometimes beating them with batons. 
Staff members who were caught up in the fray and the students were 
eventually allowed out.

A 
Nairobi police Twitter feed said Tuesday evening that the demonstrations
 had ‘largely dissipated and order has been restored.’

One
 of the demonstrating students, Titus Khaemba, said he was angry that 
class fees could rise. He said security forces should be concerned with 
the rise in terror attacks, not protesting students.

‘Right
 now there is no employment along the coast and the government is not 
looking into that. They are looking on how to get the money for the next
 election,’ Khaemba said.

Cruel: Despite holding their hands up and leaving with their faces covered students were forced back inside the university buildings

Trapped: A woman overcome by tear gas holds a cloth to her face as she tries to escape from a tear-gas-filled building inside the main campus
