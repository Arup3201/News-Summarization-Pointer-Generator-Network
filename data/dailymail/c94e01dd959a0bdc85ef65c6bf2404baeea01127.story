Men's brains are wired to make them ignore food when sex is on the menu, researchers have claimed. 

A study found that men can suppress their hunger in order to focus on finding a mate.

The study by the University of Rochester Medical Centre point to how subtle changes in the brain's circuitry dictate differences in behaviour between males and females.

Assistant Professor Douglas Portman said: 'While we know that human behaviour is influenced by numerous factors, including cultural and social norms, these findings point to basic biological mechanisms that may not only help explain some differences in behaviour between males and females, but why different sexes may be more susceptible to certain neurological disorders.'

The research looked at a microscopic roundworm called C. elegans and focussed on a pair of neurones called AWA that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner.

Scientists looked at two genders, males and hermaphrodites, who are mating partners for males and are considered to be the equivalent of females.

They put the worms in a petri dish and gave them food, leaving them the option to either feed or go in search of a mate.

Some worms had been genetically engineered to make them more sensitive to the smell of food by tampering with their neurones.

The findings were made in experiments involving C. elegans, a microscopic roundworm that has long been used by researchers to understand fundamental mechanisms in biology.

Many of the discoveries made using C. elegans apply throughout the animal kingdom and this research has led to a broader understanding of human biology. 

In fact, three Nobel Prizes in medicine and chemistry have been awarded for discoveries involving C. elegans.

C. elegans is particularly useful in the study of the nervous system and scientists understand in great detail the development, function, and multiple connections of its entire neural network.

The research looked at a microscopic roundworm called C. elegans and focussed on a pair of neurones called AWA that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner.

It was revealed that the normal male worms left their food source and went in search of a mate.

However the males who had been genetically engineered to be 'hungrier' were ten times less successful at mating as they wanted to stay by the food source.

The hermaphrodites stayed put and simply waited near the food source.

The study published in the journal Current Biology suggests that the normal worms were able to ignore or even suppress their hunger in favour of finding a mate.

Prof Portman in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and Center for Neural Development and Disease said: 'These findings show that by tuning the properties of a single cell, we can change behaviour.

'This adds to a growing body of evidence that sex-specific regulation of gene expression may play an important role in neural plasticity and, consequently, influence differences in behaviours - and in disease susceptibility - between the sexes.'
