Barcelona are facing a struggle with Louis van Gaal and Manchester United for Thomas Vermaelen and Juan Cuadrado, according to Spanish daily Sport.

They picture the Dutchman on their front page and suggest he could be about to 'torpedo' the Catalan side for both the Arsenal defender and the Fiorentina winger.

Colombian Cuadrado, 26, is on the verge of joining United for a fee of £36m, the paper reports.

Bidding war: Barcelona and Manchester United are going head-to-head for the signatures of Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado and Arsenal centre-back Thomas Vermaelen, according to Sport. Barcelona are confident of tying up a deal for Vermaelen over the weekend 

And they say Vermaelen, 28, is the subject of a sizeable bid from United which Arsenal may find hard to refuse, even though they would prefer he joined Barca.

However, it does appear Vermaelen will join Barca this weekend after Arsenal were unable to agree a swap deal with United involving Chris Smalling going the other way.  

Elsewhere in the Spanish press, Marca are licking their lips at the prospect of Real Madrid in the season to come.

'A Madird made up of cannons,' is their front page headline as they predict plenty of goals from outside the box.

Summer acquisitions James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos join long-range specialists Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the side, meaning the Bernabeu faithful can expect plenty of spectacular goals.

Cannons: Marca say the addition of James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos to the Real Madrid line-up means fans will see more spectacular goals from outside the box this season than ever before

They add that Madrid were already the team that scored the most goals from outside the box last season.

One superstar that won't be moving to Madrid is Radamel Falcao, they report, with the vice-President of his club Monaco saying: 'We have spoken with Madrid many times this ummer and they have never asked about Falcao.'

And another player potentially staying put is Angel Di Maria, according to AS, after his move to Paris Saint-Germain 'hit the brakes.'

The PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi is quoted as saying: 'We have stopped negotiations because it's too expensive.'

The French champions were expected to complete a deal worth in excess of £50m for the Argentine winger, who also interested Man United, but that now appears to be off.

Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, are going to make another bid for Torino striker Alessio Cerci, with the Italian club resigned to losing him.

Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo predict a reduction in Luis Suarez's four-month ban from 'all football-related activity' following his World Cup bite on Giorgio Chiellini.

Barcelona's new £75m striker is due at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne on Friday for an appeal hearing.

The club expect the ban to be cut back to the end of August and to be able to officially present him as a Barcelona player in the next week or two.

Over in Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport report on a flurry of activity behind the scenes at Milan.

'Milan wake up,' they say, as Filippo Inzaghi sets out a list of transfer targets, among them Cerci, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Joel Campbell.

They also report that QPR's Adel Taarabt could make a return after his loan spell at San Siro towards the end of last season.

Corriere dello Sport suggest that Juventus will move for Manchester City's Stevan Jovetic and Inter's Fredy Guarin if Arturo Vidal leaves.

Vidal has been linked with Manchester United and others all summer in what is already becoming quite a tedious transfer saga.

United have also been keen on Guarin for some time.
