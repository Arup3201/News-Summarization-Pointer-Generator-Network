The heroic efforts of a surgeon to save the life of fatally wounded Senator Robert F. Kennedy 45 years ago today have finally come to light - after a deeply personal quest by his news correspondent daughter.

Trauma surgeon Ross Miller's role in the tragic events of June 5, 1968 were relatively unknown to all apart from his family including his daughter, CBS correspondent Michelle Miller.

Senator Kennedy was killed and five others 
wounded in the shooting in the kitchen of the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after the Senator had claimed victory in the California Democratic primary for president.

Dr Miller had been a campaigner for RFK 
and served as a city councilman, believing that the Senator promised the best chance of equality for all in the U.S.

He was there on the night that RFK gave a rousing speech to his jubilant supporters. Shortly after making his victory speech 
in the ballroom, before a crowd from all economic and ethnic 
backgrounds, shots were fired.

There were screams for doctors to come forward - of which Dr Miller was one. He battled courageously in the midst of chaos to save Senator's Kennedy's life.

After digging deep into the archives of 
footage and photography of that fateful night, his daughter found a picture of 
her young father standing helplessly outside Kennedy's hospital room as 
doctors battled in vain to save the Senator. 

There is also footage of the brave young doctor taking to news reporters following the horrifying events.

On camera, he says that the Senator had head 
injuries and that there was a lot of blood. He added that Ethel Kennedy,
Bobby's wife, handled herself 'excellently... and she was not in a 
state of panic'.

Michelle Miller told CBS:'I took my Dad's word... but to see it live and in living color... I am very proud.'

Dr Miller passed away in 1996.

Paul Schrade, another RFK supporter and friend of the Senator, was also shot 45 years ago.

Now 88 years old, Mr Schrade spoke to Michelle Miller about her father's crucial role that evening.

Mr Schrade, who has almost no memory of the events, learned that Dr Miller had also attended to him. 

He told the doctor's daughter: 'This is a
real surprise for me... but now I know that he was there and helping, 
how can I express my gratitude for that, except to say to you that you 
had a great father.'

Photographer Bill Eppridge, who was working on the night RFK was shot, had the photograph of Dr Miller buried in his personal archives - standing in the Good Samaritan hospital. 

Life photographer Mr Eppridge captured the iconic image of the horrifying events of June 5 - when busboy Juan Romero cradled the Senator's head and placed a Rosary in his hand.

RFK was killed and five others wounded during the June 5, 1968 shooting in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.

Kennedy, having just delivered a rousing speech to enraptured supporters after winning California’s Primary Election, was ushered through the kitchen en route to the press room.

Shots rang out– three bullets struck Mr Kennedy, and a fourth grazed his suit coat. He died the next day in the nearby Good Samaritan hospital.

Jordanian national Sirham Sirhan was arrested at the scene and indicted for murder.

After being found guilty at his 1969 trial he was sentenced to death, a decision which was later overturned in 1972 in exchange for life in prison.

He has repeatedly been seeking parole - and denied it - since 1983.
