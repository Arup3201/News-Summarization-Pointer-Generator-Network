In trouble: Sgt Gary Stein is facing dismissal from the Marines after saying he wouldn't follow orders from Obama

A military board has recommended 
dismissal for the Tea Party Marine who wrote on Facebook that he would 
not follow orders from President Obama.

A Marine Corps administrative board 
found that Sergeant Gary Stein had committed misconduct with his online 
campaign against the president.

After a daylong hearing at Camp 
Pendleton, California, board also recommended that Stein's discharge 
from the military be on an other-than-honorable basis.

That would mean that the disgraced sergeant would lose his benefits and would not be allowed back on any military base.

Stein's lawyers had argued that the 
9-year Marine, whose service was to end in four months, was expressing 
his personal views and exercising his First Amendment rights.

But the Marine Corps said it was 
forced to take action after he declared on Facebook that he would not 
follow orders from President Obama.

That statement - which Stein later 
clarified to say he would not follow unlawful orders - was part of an 
online political campaign against the president under the banner of the 
Armed Forces Tea Party.

Stein's defence attorney, Marine Captain James Baehr, said he was 'surprised and disappointed'.

'But it was an honour to fight for a 
hero like Sergeant Stein and every other Marine's right to speak 
freely,' Captain Baehr added.

Stein addressed board members during yesterday 's hearing, telling them he loved the Marine Corps and wanted to
re-enlist, Captain Baehr said.

Captain Baehr expressed hope that the recommendation would be rejected by the general, saying the case will go forward.

'The issues are too important for this to end today,' he said.

Critical: The military has had a policy since the Civil War of restricting the free speech of servicemen, including criticism of the commander in chief

During the hearing, the prosecutor, 
Captain John Torresala, said Stein went as far as superimposing images 
of Obama's face on a poster for the movie 'Jackass.'

He argued that Stein's behavior 
repeatedly violated Pentagon policy that limits the free speech rights 
of service members, and said he should be dismissed after ignoring 
warnings from his superiors about his postings.

The government submitted screen grabs 
of Stein's postings on one Facebook page he created called Armed Forces 
Tea Party, which the prosecutor said included the image of Obama on the 
'Jackass' movie poster.

Stein also superimposed Obama's image 
on a poster for 'The Incredibles' movie that he changed to 'The 
Horribles,' the prosecutor said.

Captain Torresala also said anti-Obama
comments posted by Stein on a Facebook page used by Marine 
meteorologists were prejudicial to good order and discipline, and could 
have influenced junior Marines.

Stein's security clearance was taken 
away and he has no future in the Marine Corps because he can't do his 
job without that clearance, Captain Torresala said.

'The Marine Corps community views the 
command's lack of action as some kind of knock on good order and 
discipline,' Captain Torresala said.

'Our own people are questioning why this Marine is not being held accountable.'

Defensive: Sgt Stein says he did not mean to be 
'disrespectful' but he believes Obama's policies are 'crippling this 
country'

The military has had a policy since 
the Civil War limiting the free speech of service members, including 
criticism of the commander in chief.

Pentagon directives say military 
personnel in uniform cannot sponsor a political club; participate in any
TV or radio program or group discussion that advocates for or against a
political party, candidate or cause; or speak at any event promoting a 
political movement.

Commissioned officers also may not use contemptuous words against senior officials.

Profile: Sgt. Stein says he is a Conservative blogger and 
speaker but adds he does not 'represent the views of the United States Armed 
Forces'

Backed by a team of lawyers and 
congressmen, Stein has said he is fighting for his constitutional rights
and should be allowed to stay in the military.

His lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union contend his views are protected by the First Amendment.

'Think about how dangerous this could
be if the U.S. government can prosecute you for something you say on 
your private Facebook page,' Captain Baehr said.

Response: Sgt Gary Stein posted these comments on Facebook this morning after being told he is facing possible dismissal from the Corps

Stein has said his opinions are his own and has put a disclaimer on his Facebook page saying so.

His attorneys argued service members 
have a right to voice their opinions as long as they do not appear to be
presenting their views as being endorsed by the military.

They say the Pentagon policy is vague and military officials do not understand it.

Representative Duncan Hunter, 
R-Calif., a former Marine, wrote a letter to Stein's commanding officer 
stating the sergeant should not face dismissal for an opinion shared by a
majority of Marines.

Mr Hunter said he was referring to 
Stein's statement that he would not obey unlawful orders. Representative
Darrell Issa, R-Calif., also expressed support for Stein.

Stein said his statement about Obama 
was part of an online debate about NATO allowing U.S. troops to be tried
for the Koran burnings in Afghanistan.

In that context, he said, he was 
stating that he would not follow orders from the president if it 
involved detaining U.S. citizens, disarming them or doing anything else 
that he believes would violate their constitutional rights.
