Steven Gerrard was the best English midfielder since Paul Gascoigne, but you have to ask why England didn’t get more out of him.

People talk about David Beckham and Paul Scholes, but Gerrard had everything — quick as lightning, he covered so much ground, tackled hard and, boy, could he pass.

The first time I saw him was in training at Liverpool when Gerard Houllier brought him up from the youth team. I played the ball into him, expecting this young kid to give it straight back. He turned around and hit a raking 30-yard pass into someone’s feet.

That’s when I knew he would be special.

He had so much skill and, if you ask players who they would want to play like, plenty would say Steven Gerrard.

He was like Roy of the Rovers and when he joined the England squad I thought he would show that same confidence. I soon learned he had the same insecurities as every other player.

When the team met up I was his club captain, so I went to bring him down for dinner. I only discovered later when I read his book that he was terrified to come out of his room. He has always been a selfless individual and a bit of a worrier, almost to a fault.

He never wants to let people down and playing for his country weighed on his shoulders at times.It didn’t help that so many England managers failed to use him properly and it was embarrassing watching him played wide on the left at the 2010 World Cup.

Gerrard has been a fantastic servant for England and his talents deserved a place in the semis or a final but, like so many players of his generation, we never made the best of them.
