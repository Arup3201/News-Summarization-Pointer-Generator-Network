The Liberal Democrats are preventing David Cameron from taking tougher action on immigration and stripping the workshy of benefits, the Prime Minister said.

Mr Cameron firmly rejected claims that only Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was being forced to compromise in the coalition.

'We've all had to make compromises,' he told BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright in the Afternoon.

'If I was running a Conservative-only Government I think we would be making further steps on things like immigration control or making sure that our welfare reforms were absolutely making sure that if you're not prepared to work you can't go on welfare.

'I think we'd be tougher than that,' he said.

'We make compromises, we make agreements, but as a Government I think we're delivering a lot of good things for the country.'

Mr Cameron conceded that the coalition 'has its problems' but that it was generally working well.

He denied that major policy issues were decided between himself and the Deputy Prime Minister in their regular Sunday evening telephone calls.

'We often have a conversation on the phone on a Sunday night to scope the issues that we need to settle, the problems that the Government faces and some of the issues that are under discussion in the following week, but we also have very ordered meetings, as we did this morning,' he said.

'I think the coalition works well. We haven't had one for 65 years, it's very different.

Mr Cameron said Nick Clegg, left, wasn't the only one who had made concessions while he admitted he 'admired' some of Mr Blair's work despite his mistakes

'But the idea of two parties coming together, burying some of their differences and acting in the national interest, for the national good, I think is working. It has it's problems but...'

Mr Cameron defended the Government's tough deficit-reduction package and attacked Labour's calls for a slowdown and tax cuts.

'The programme of cuts is absolutely necessary to keep us out of the danger zone. My worry is that plan B as suggested by Labour, plan B stands for bankruptcy.

'It stands for not living within your means, not paying down your debts. And eventually you can end up in a situation which we see on our television screens, like Greece, where people lose all confidence you're going to be able to pay down your debts.

'I would say the greatest stimulus we can give is to keep those interest rates low, so businesses can borrow money, so people can get on the housing ladder, so investment and the economy can grow.

Cameron hopes to improve his table tennis skills so that next time he plays Barack Obama he can 'thrash' him

'Of course it's choppy, it's difficult. I know that households are suffering because inflation is high and petrol prices have gone up, and food prices are up, and people's budgets are very tight.

'But interest rates are low, the economy is growing and the last unemployment figures were pretty encouraging - the biggest monthly fall I think for 10 years.'

The Prime Minister said he was going to practise his table tennis so he would be able to 'thrash' US President Barack Obama when they next meet.

'I used to play table tennis a bit, I'm going to have to restart so next time he comes I'll thrash him,' he said after being shown up by the president's skills during a visit to a school.

Asked to choose his ideal dinner guests, dead or alive, Mr Cameron plumped for Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth I, to hear her first-hand account of dealing with the Spanish Armada, and celebrity cook Nigella Lawson to prepare the spread because he is 'very greedy' and loves food.

Forced to choose one style of food, he said it would be Italian.

He also said that he 'admired' some of what Tony Blair did in reforming public services but that the former Labour premier had made many mistakes.
