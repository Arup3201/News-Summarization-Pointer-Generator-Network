A teacher has been suspended after he went on a rant in support of two female colleagues suspended for allegedly having sex with male students at a beach party.

Sean Patrick Kane, who teaches art at South Hills High School in West Covina, California, was placed on paid leave on Thursday.

In a lengthy message on his Facebook page, Kane wrote a message directed at the teen victims of the teachers, saying: 'You should have just kept your stupid mouths shut and enjoyed it.'

Art teacher Sean Patrick Kane was suspended from South Hills High School in West Covina, California after ranting on Facebook in defense of his colleagues 

He went on: 'All I want to know is what the f*** is in the heads of the dudes who banged these ladies and then squealed?... Everybody has lost their f****** minds.'

A school district spokeswoman confirmed to NBC that Kane had been placed on leave, adding: 'We would expect teachers to be professional.'

The latest debacle comes after four teaching staff were arrested or facing lawsuits at the school.

Two female teachers were arrested last Saturday for engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with male students, police said. 

Melody Lippert, 38, met up with the boys from South Hills High at a beach in San Clemente  in November 2014.

Lippert reportedly gave the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students. 

During a second liaison, Lippert brought along 30-year-old teacher Michelle Ghirelli.

The high school's wrestling coach, Anthony Vidales, 29, was arrested for alleged sex with a girl, 17

The two spent the night on a beach with a group of boys during which they had sex with two students, police said.

Police were tipped off and Lippert was charged with conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 

Both women were placed on paid leave. The school district gave no comment other than to say the encounters did not take place during events sponsored by the school or district.

On January 7, a part-time wrestling coach at South Hills High was arrested for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl on the team

Anthony Vidales, 29, who does not teach in the district, was placed on paid leave. He posted $20,000 bail. The investigation continues.

A second wrestling coach, Scott McDonald Stragier, was named in a lawsuit by a former student, Joseph Leyba Jr, who alleged that the staff member choked and berated him in front of students during a March 14 incident.
