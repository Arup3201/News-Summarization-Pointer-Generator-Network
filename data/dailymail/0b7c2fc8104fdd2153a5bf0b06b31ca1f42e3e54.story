Axed: Nick Clegg will announce the plan today

A tax break for married couples would be scrapped to pay for free childcare for all two-year-olds, under plans from the Liberal Democrats.

The married couple’s allowance – worth £200 a year to couples where one partner does not pay income tax – is due to be introduced next year.

But Nick Clegg will today announce plans to axe the flagship Conservative policy in the Lib Dem manifesto for next year’s election.

Instead the money will be used to help fund 15 hours of free childcare for all two-year-olds.

It will extend a government scheme that gives free childcare to all three and four-year-olds, and two-year-olds from families who receive certain benefits.

The Deputy Prime Minister will say that the expansion of the scheme is the first step towards delivering the Lib Dems’ longer term plan to extend free childcare to all working parents from the end of parental leave. 

The Lib Dems admit that scrapping the married couple’s allowance would not cover the whole cost of the £800million childcare plan.

According to Treasury figures the tax break will cost £515million a year from its introduction next April, rising to £820million a year by 2018.

More than four million married couples are due to benefit from the extension of the married couple’s allowance, announced in this year’s Budget.

Chancellor George Osborne said the allowance that can be transferred from one partner to another will rise from £1,000 to £1,050 from April next year. Only those on the basic rate of income tax would be eligible for the allowance.

The Lib Dems opposed the allowance in opposition, but in the Coalition agreement agreed to abstain from voting on its introduction.

A party source said last night: ‘We’ve never supported it. We believe it is a penalty on unmarried couples.

'People who lose out include widows, people who have lost their husbands in wars, people whose spouses have walked out on them and people who choose not be married.

'We don’t think they should pay higher taxes than those who are married.’ 

The childcare scheme will be one of more than 300 manifesto policies announced today that will be voted on at Lib Dem conference in Glasgow next month.

Policy: The £200-a-year allowance will help couples of whom one member does not pay income tax

Liberal Democrat Business Minister Jo Swinson MP said: ‘Helping families with the cost of childcare is part of the Liberal Democrat plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society where there is opportunity for everyone to get on in life.

‘Extending free early years education to all two year olds will benefit children and reduce childcare costs for working parents.

'It builds on our record in Government where we have expanded free early years education for every three and four year old and provided it for the first time to two year olds from the most hard pressed families.

‘This is a ultimately a fundamental difference in values. Liberal Democrats want to help all families with childcare support and nursery education right the way through from the end of parental leave to the start of school.

'The Tories are more bothered about helping only some couples through a married couples’ tax break.’

But Lucy Powell MP, Shadow Minister for Childcare and Children, said: ‘There’s no point the Lib Dems making more promises when people remember only too well the promises Nick Clegg and his party have already broken.’

Labour has already said it will scrap tax break if it wins next year’s General Election.
