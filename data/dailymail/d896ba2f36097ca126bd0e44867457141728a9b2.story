The funeral of a Nazi war criminal has been postponed following security fears, after neo-fascists attempted to highjack the event.

There were violent clashes between protesters and far right extremists outside the service for former SS officer Erich Priebke, prompting riot police to set off tear gas canisters.

Authorities were forced to remove around twenty extreme right wing activists from the church, in Albano Laziale, a suburb of Rome.

Priebke, a mass murderer who never repented his crimes, died on Friday aged 100 as he was serving a life sentence in Rome for his part in the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves.

Nazi officers rounded up and shot more than 300 Italian men and boys in a reprisal attack for the killing of German soldiers by resistance fighters. It is considered the worst atrocity of World War II on Italian soil.

Despite being explicitly prohibited by the Vatican and the mayor, an ultra-conservative Christian sect had offered to conduct the ceremony, although not a burial.

The Society of Saint Pius X, which has split from the Vatican gained notoriety in 2009 when a British member, Richard Williamson, denied the Holocaust had taken place.

The funeral came on the 70th anniversary of the emptying of the ghetto in Rome from which only 15 Jews returned alive.

As
 the closed door ceremony was due to begin, demonstrators outside the 
church landed kicks and punches on the hearse and set upon the priest 
until he was rescued by riot police.

Several
 dozen skinheads and right-wing extremists dressed in camouflage clothes
 and combat boots came to pay their last respects to a man who had 
become an icon for the far right.

Some, wearing helmets and scarves over their faces, were removed as they were neither friends nor relatives of Priebke.

Several
 gave fascist salutes, prompting a crowd that included relatives of 
victims,  anti-fascist protesters and Jewish survival groups to surge 
forward chanting ‘Executioner’ and ‘Murderer!’

Protesters
 and right wingers clashed, landing punches and throwing bottles, until 
armed police in full riot gear stepped in, launching tear gas.

Priebke's lawyer Paolo Giachini confirmed that the rites had not taken place.

Outrage: In the lead up to his birthday Jewish groups called for celebrations to be banned

Earlier in the day the mayor of Albano Laziale, Nicola Marini, had signed an order blocking the funeral from taking place.

But he was overruled by the Prefect of Rome who said he had to accede to the family's wishes.

Mr Marini said : ‘We tried to prevent it with the all the methods at our disposal. But we have been overruled by higher powers.

'To
 have to endure this ceremony so near to the scene of the crime is a 
cause of shame for the whole town, which is why we are here to bear 
witness to their pain, their shame.’

The residents of Albano Laziale had turned out in force to oppose the funeral. 

Doctor
 Ugo Piccarreta said: ‘It’s a national disgrace. The wounds that Priebke
 has left in the hearts of the Italian population mean that he cannot be
 compared to any other criminal. He doesn’t even deserve to transit 
through this town.

‘I don’t understand how the church can pardon him – he never even repented. ‘

Local
 resident Giuliana Uccino said: ‘We are afraid that our town will become
 a symbol or even a place of pilgrimage for neo fascists.’

‘This is not a fascist town. Priebke is not welcome here and not welcome in Italy.

A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase

It
 is not known when the ceremony will go ahead as Priebke's coffin will 
remain in the church overnight. A row has raged for days over the 
officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave 
could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase.

Both
 his birth town of Hennigsdord, in Germany and his adopted homeland of 
Argentina have made it clear that his remains are not welcome.

The Jewish Community in Rome threatened renewed protests if Priebke is permitted a tomb in the Italian capital.

‘It would be like killing those victims a second time,’ said Riccardo Pacifici, the Jewish organisation's president.

After the war Priebke had fled justice, making a home in San Carlos de Bariloche, a small town at the foot of the Andes.

He
 managed to escape the Nuremberg Trials and although the Israeli secret 
services hunted him for years, he remained at large until 1994, until an
 American journalist tracked him down.

A
 year later he was extradited to Italy and convicted of mass murder. But
 because of his age he was allowed to serve his sentence under house 
arrest with permission later granted for him to leave the house to go 
shopping, go to Mass and to the pharmacy.

In
 the run up to his 100th birthday in July, Holocaust survivor groups 
argued that he should be prevented from celebrating. Violence ensued 
when protesters clashed with a neo-Nazi supporter who had travelled from
 Germany to bring him a bottle of champagne.
