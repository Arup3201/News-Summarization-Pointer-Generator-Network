It seems that women will place their faith in all manner of weird and wonderful gadgets in their crusade for beauty.

In Japan, the quest for Western-shaped features has seen demand for face-changing gizmos soar recently.

Now the Japan Trend shop has introduced the £30 Hana Twin Nose, a plastic clip they claim will give you a straighter nose through daily wear.

Intriguing device: Japan Trend shop are selling the £30 Hana Twin Nose, a plastic clip they claim will give you a straighter nose after wearing it for 20 minutes

Describing the product on their website, they write: 'Do you have a complex about your nose? Then reach for the Hana Twin Nose, a much cheaper alternative to plastic surgery and it doesn't hurt either.

'The makers reckon that 20 minutes per day is enough to strength and straighten your nose to help you achieve that perfect nasal profile you so desire.'

'Hana' means nose in Japanese, while 'tsun' means to perk or stick up, which makers of the product believe a nose should.

After slipping the clip gently into your nostrils, the supports on either side claims to help balance and push up the bones and contours of your nose, so it has an overall sharper, straighter shape.

This isn't the first quirky device from the online store.

Japan Trend Shop recently unveiled a 'face bra' that promises to help fight the smile lines that grow more prominently with age.

The Hourei Lift Bra is a band that slides over the back of your head 
and then the frame fits easily onto your nose.

Its soft silicone rubber 
curves have been designed to feel comfortable on your skin while the 'wire' design promises to place only gentle pressure on your cheeks.

'If you worry about your smile or laugh
 lines (nasolabial folds), then a simple but effective device like this 
that you can wear daily is your ticket to combating the signs of ageing,' say producers.

The makers also suggest doing mouth exercises while wearing the £25 frame.

The Japanese Trend Shop also sells the wrinkle-busting balaclava and The Faceweaver Exercise Mask, which they describe as 'a new face stretcher from Japan that promises to give users a
 more youthful and energetic look'.

The stretchy accessory wraps around your
 face and claims to help exercise different muscles while you make all 
kinds of bizarre facial expressions.

Other unusual products sold on the 
website include the £80 Eye Slack Haruka, which is aimed at combating 
sagging skin around the eyes with battery-powered vibrating pads, and 
the £70 Beauty Lift High Nose, which applies vibrations to help push the
nose higher and make it firmer.

For those looking to emulate the plumped-up lips of Katie Price, the rather cartoonish Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece slips over
the wearer's own mouth, with the ultimate goal of boosting the lips to a
more prominent pout.
