The horrific incident unfolded early this morning when, according to New York Daily News, the alleged attacker confronted Maren, his ex-girlfriend, in the school's hallway, armed with a kitchen knife he brought from home.

He was reportedly furious that his ex dumped him. He allegedly threw her down the stairs and choked her, before stabbing her in the neck.

'She was screaming,' a student inside 
the building at the time of the attack, told Daily News. 'There were students in 
the hallway when it happened. The kids who saw it are all a wreck.'

'There was blood on her neck. It was awful,' 16-year-old Sam Garcia, a junior at the school, told Chicago Tribune. 'I saw the girl lying on the stretcher when they took her out.'

Students were dismissed at 9am as the school went into lock down, after the alleged attacker was held down by a school resource officer and arrested by police.
