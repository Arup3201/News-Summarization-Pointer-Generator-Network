Most people would be content with simply mowing their grass and decorating their garden with a gnome.

But one neurologist clearly wasn't content with just pruning his garden - and has spent nearly 20 years carving fantastic shapes out of his bushes, including the shape of a skull.

Jeremy Gibbs' latest addition to his eye-catching garden is a macabre-looking skull and a giant pair of hands.

Hands up if you like topiary! Jeremy Gibbs' home in Welwyn Garden City has giant ivy hands that scale the side of building

Shear brilliance: This huge skull adorns the home of the creative brain specialist - and is a joy to his neighbours

Instead of tangled ivy plants climbing his house, his bushes' 15ft green hands creep up the wall.

And forget a friendly row of flowers welcoming visitors up his drive - instead, guests are met with a huge skull.

The brain specialist has also adorned his £800,000 home with elaborate topiary including a series of animals holding hands.

The 57-year-old medic, who works for East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, has been carving 'brilliant' sculptures in his garden for nearly two decades.

His neighbour William Osborne, 65, said: 'I have always thought they are brilliant.

'How nice is it to see something original. It took me a while to realise what they were at first but they are wonderful.'

Residents on his street have been stopping to admire a set of menacing 15ft hands carved onto the side of his £800,000 home

The trend for topiary may have died out during the 18th Century - but there are still parts of the world that have kept the artform blooming.

Levens Hall, in Cumbria, is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as being the oldest topiary garden in the world. Some of the trees and bushes are three hundred years old and the layout of this garden has changed little since their planting and initial training in the 1690s.

The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, is home to a huge West Highland Terrier carved out of flowers, designed by the artist Jeff Koons.

Ladew Topiary Gardens in Maryland, America, are home to elaborate topiary scenes - the most famous being a hunt scene complete with riders, horses, dogs and a fox, inspired by owner and 1930s socialite Harvey Ladew, who spent time in England fox-hunting.

Another neighbour, Gillian Sainsbury, 75, added: 'People seem to enjoy them and they are quite pretty.'

Residents on his street in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, have been stopping to admire the work.

The art of topiary was first used by the Egyptians in 4,000BC, when they began to neatly trim their plants into box hedges, the European and Boxwood Topiary Society said.

The Romans introduced the design to Europe after many of the box hedges were planted in villas during the reign of Emperor Augustus in 100BC.

In the Dark Ages the skill was taken to Europe, where hedges were transformed into different shapes - a popular one being a tiered design now called 'the wedding cake'.

During the Tudor period the art form became very popular in Britain, with Henry VIII's Hampton Court Palace decorated with deer, greyhound and boat designs.

In the 18th Century, famed landscape architect Lancelot 'Capability' Brown preferred a natural garden, moving the trend away from pruned and deliberate shapes.

Dr Gibbs yesterday declined to comment on his spectacular garden.
