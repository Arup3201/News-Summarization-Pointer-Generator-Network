The partner of Sydney siege victim Tori Johnson says the Lindt cafe manager would have been touched by the thousands of floral tributes left by those mourning his tragic death.

Mr Johnson's partner of 14 years, Thomas Zinn, has spoken out for the first time since the horrific events which claimed the 34-year-old's life, describing him as a 'humble, generous' man.

Mr Zinn, who paid solemn visits to the Martin Place flower memorial on Wednesday and Thursday, also expressed how much it would have meant to Mr Johnson in an interview with Today.

'Tori loves flowers and this is probably the most beautiful thing – and I'm sure he can see it – that he has ever seen,' he said.

'When I was down there yesterday I could smell the flowers through Sydney and I think it's just amazing that he has been able to make our city smell like flowers.

'I think there is no more beautiful thing that he could have imagined.'

Mr Johnson, from Redfern, was among three people who died in the Martin Place siege on Tuesday morning, along with barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, 38, and the gunman, Man Haron Monis. 

On Wednesday, Mr Zinn was joined by Mr Johnson's family as they spent 30 minutes at the makeshift memorial at Martin Place where thousands have lined up to pay tribute to the national 'hero'.

In the interview with Today host Lisa Wilkinson, who said Mr Johnson hoped to get married one day, Mr Zinn described his partner as a family-oriented man who made his loved ones a priority.

'He made it very clear that family was the most important thing in our lives and that we have to cherish that and spend enough time with our families,' said Mr Zinn. 

'That was an absolute priority,' he said.

Mr Zinn also read out a statement in which he thanked Australians for their support

'As you can imagine this is a very difficult time for our family,' he said.

'We are experiencing unimaginable grief but when we look at the sea of flowers with all the heartfelt messages and the crowds of supporters at Martin Place we know that this grief is shared by the whole country and the rest of the world.

'This tragedy will remain with us forever but the uniting effects of this week, how they have galvanised our city and our country, makes us even more proud of Tori and Katrina and proud of all Australians.'

Mr Zinn extended his condolences to Ms Dawson's family, saying that they were affected as Mr Johnson's loved ones.

'We haven't obviously had contact with them yet, it's still very early, but we know that they feel exactly like us,' he said.

On Wednesday, police shut off the area to the public as a sea of people watched on in silence as Mr Johnson's family members read the tributes that had been left for the Lindt Cafe manager.

Tears welled up in their eyes as they read the touching words left by strangers for the 34-year-old.

After they finished, the barricades were eventually let down and members of the public hugged members of Mr Johnson's family.

His father, Ken Johnson, expressed his gratitude to people across the country for their kind words. 

Mr Johnson's father said that he would 'like to thank the people in Australia who have given us support... Peace and love on earth.'

'This is all very moving, thank you for supporting us,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  

Joel Herat, who was among the Lindt Cafe employees and customers to be held hostage for almost 17 hours, said that the cries of Mr Johnson's family when they were informed of his death was 'the saddest thing' he had ever heard. 

Mr Zinn added that the family of Mr Johnson was experiencing 'unimaginable grief'

Details from the tragic event has haunted the Australian public since the culmination of the siege, with thousands of mourners flooding to Martin Place to lay flowers in tribute of Mr Johnson and the victims.  

Information released on Wednesday indicates that Mr Johnson was shot in the head at close range, moments before police stormed the Lindt Cafe, killing Man Monis and rescuing the remaining hostage victims. 

Mr Johnson's aunt, Lyn Whittaker, described her nephew as 'everything you could wish for in a son and grandson' and that he was a 'very, very, very brave boy'. 

Tori Johnson was the son of renowned artist Ken Johnson, and had been manager of the Martin Place Lindt Cafe for three years.

He is remembered as a caring and compassionate friend and manager, with many of his Lindt colleagues signing a touching note for him.

Reminding the world of his bravery, they left a handwritten note, a bouquet of flowers and Lindt chocolates among the thousands of tributes that have now taken over Martin Place.

'Tori, you always had time for us long before you came to Lindt,' the note began.

'Always smiling, always friendly. The decision to join the Lindt team will always be cherished by all – because you were not just a manager, you were family.

'There will be a hole in the Lindt family now that your gone. Not a day will go past where we don't think of you.

'Your bravery will forever be remembered, by us and the world. May you rest in peace. Tori, our brother and hero.'
