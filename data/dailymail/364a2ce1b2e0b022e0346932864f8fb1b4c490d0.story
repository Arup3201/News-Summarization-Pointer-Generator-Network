Surgically removing deep fat from around the waist could reduce obese women's risk of bowel cancer, a study suggests.

Obese people with an oversized waistline have a higher chance of developing bowel cancer, but the results of a U.S. study indicated that the risk was reduced in women who had visceral fat removed from around the waist.

Dieting, which had little effect on visceral or abdominal fat - that which accumulates around the organs - did not remove the risk, the study found.

'Pot belly': The surgical removal of visceral fat from around the waist reduces obese women's risk of developing intestinal tumours, a study suggests

In contrast, calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours in men, but removal of visceral fat did not.

An excess of visceral fat results in individuals developing a protruding abdomen, often described as a 'pot' or 'beer' belly.

Obesity has long been closely linked to many cancers. The study saw a team from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York set out to examine the role of visceral fat in mice genetically prone to developing colon cancer.

Risk: Researchers say they have proved that too much abdominal fat actually causes the disease, rather than the habits that fuel obesity

Researcher Dr Derek Huffman said: 'There has been some scepticism as to whether obesity per se is a bona fide cancer risk factor, rather than the habits that fuel it, including a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.

'Although those other lifestyle choices play a role, this study unequivocally demonstrates that visceral adiposity is causally linked to intestinal cancer.'

The study randomly assigned the mice to one of three groups. Mice in the first group underwent a sham surgery and were allowed to eat an unrestricted 'buffet style' diet, for the entirety of the study, which resulted in these mice becoming obese. Those in the second group were also provided an unrestricted diet and became obese, but they had their visceral fat surgically removed at the outset of the study. Mice in the third group also underwent a sham surgery, but were provided only 60 per cent of the calories consumed by the other mice in order to reduce their visceral fat by dieting.

Dr Huffman said: 'Our sham-operated obese mice had the most visceral fat, developed the greatest number of intestinal tumours, and had the worst overall survival.

'However, mice that had less visceral fat, either by surgical removal or a calorie-restricted diet, had a reduction in the number of intestinal tumours. This was particularly remarkable in the case of our group where visceral fat was surgically removed, because these mice were still obese, they just had very little abdominal fat.'

The researchers then subdivided the groups by gender. In female mice, the removal of visceral fat was significantly related to a reduction in intestinal tumours, but calorie restriction was not.

In male mice, calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours, but removal of visceral fat did not.

He added: 'This suggests that there are important gender differences in how adiposity and nutrients interact with the tumour environment. In addition, the study emphasizes the need to promote strategies that reduce visceral fat in abdominally obese individuals.'

The team said more studies were needed to uncover the mechanisms behind the causality between visceral fat and intestinal cancer, to determine how abdominal obesity and nutrient availability act independently during the stages of tumour promotion and progression, and to determine how other strategies to promote weight loss, such as bariatric surgery, affect cancer risk.

The findings are published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research.
