Belgian royals turned out in blustery wind and snow today to commemorate the Battle of Bulge fought between the Nazis and allied forces 70 years ago.

The country's King Philippe and his wife, Queen Mathilde, threw nuts into crowds of revellers as veterans were pushed in wheelchairs through the streets of Bastogne in southern Belgium. 

Well-wishers dressed in GI uniforms to pay tribute to the American divisions which tirelessly defended the 70-mile stretch of woodland in the 1944 battle, known for having been fought under thick, cold mist.

In homage to the U.S. Army General Anthony McAuliffe, who responded: 'Nuts!' when confronted with an ultimatum by the German army, the Belgian royal family threw nuts into the crowds today

More than 10,000 troops were killed in the conflict launched by Hitler in a final bid to infiltrate the west by infiltrating one of its quietest fronts. 

Over the course of four days from December 16, American divisions of the alliance came under the siege of Nazis, with German troops switching uniforms to cut telephone wires and sabotage their resources. 

After weeks of bloodshed, western forces triumphed in what was hailed by Winston Churchill as 'an ever-famous American victory'.

Dressed in black, the Belgian royal family today braved blizzards and freezing temperatures to lay wreaths at the McAuliffe monument in Bastogne, named after the American general who spearheaded the ferocious defence.

Famously, when offered an ultimatum by the Germans in the final stages of the battle whether to surrender or face further blows, he replied: 'Nuts!'

In the final months of 1944 and keen to take control of the crucial port of Antwerp, Hitler launched one of the Nazis' bloodiest offensives on the West. 

Taking US forces by surprise, tens of thousands of German troops descended on Ardennes - a heavily forested region stretching through Luxembourg and Belgium. 

Thick winter fog plagued the allied forces' efforts to destroy German strong-holds, and with Nazi troops donning US Army uniforms to sabotage communications between divisions by snapping phone lines, victory was unlikely. 

However after depleting the German's armored tanks and resources, Western allied forces triumphed. 

His impassioned response is honoured by the tradition of throwing nuts into the crowds, an act carried out by the King and Queen today. 

King Philippe also greeted veterans who took part in the courageous battle who had travelled to Bastogne for the festivities. 

Among them was Bob Izumy who, alongside his fellow veterans, received rapturous applause when wheeled down the city's streets in a wheelchair during the parade.  

Hundreds of European well-wishers donned United States Army uniforms to take part in the celebrations.

'We must never forget what happened in 1944. Many American soldiers came here to defend Europe. We must honor them for what they did,' said 62-year-old Jean-Claude Klepper of Virton. 

Shops and local restaurants adorned drawings and American flags in respect of the battle.  

One local restaurant posted a drawing of an American flag and the message 'thank you.'
