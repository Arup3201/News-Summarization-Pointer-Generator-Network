Moaning with culinary pleasure as they give a running commentary on their meals, these are the 'dinner porn' stars of South Korea - who live-stream themselves gorging on food for money.

The bizarre craze is called mok-bang, a mash-up of the words 'dinner' and 'broadcast', and can earn serious money for the biggest eaters.

One, 'beautiful glutton' The Diva, makes thousands of pounds from her daily work as an internet star - which she balances with a day job with a consulting firm.

Dinner porn: South Korean stars like The Diva, pictured, make a fortune letting people watch them eat online

Gluttony: The Diva can eat more than 30 eggs in one sitting, which takes several hours and is streamed live

Paid: The stars' gluttinous antics are rewarded with credits which cost their fans about seven pence each

The craze is called mok-bang, a mashup of the words 'dinner' and 'broadcast' in Korean

Every night when the 'broadcast jockey' gets home from work, thousands of people log onto live-streaming site Afreeca TV for hours to watch her wolfing down enormous meals.

Her plates of choice range from two medium pizzas to 30 fried eggs and a box of crab legs, or five packets of instant noodles.

She spends almost £2,000 a month on food and has put on one and a half stone since winning her fame - but reportedly makes thousands of pounds a month from her broadcasts.

Some professional eaters make 30 times the average salary by getting 'Star Balloons' from their fans for a good show, The Diva told the Korean website Lady.

The balloons are then traded into South Korean Wons which can be spent in the real world.

The Diva insisted she did not have an eating disorder, was not regurgitating her meals and had no health problems.

Participants are rewarded not just for their quantity of food, but the way they engage with their audience

She added she began broadcasting her dinners because she was 'bored and needed a hobby'.

The Diva is just one of a host of people who have started broadcasting themselves eating over-the-top meals.

Another, BJ Lebi, devours plates of food the size of her head while answering questions from her fans, including how much she can eat and how often she uses the toilet, all live on air.

The videos have now swept onto YouTube, where they have several thousands views - more than 200,000 in one case.

People have been mystified as to what has caused the craze for over-eating, which jars with the poverty and hunger of people living just a few hundred miles north in totalitarian North Korea.

Their best guess is that it helps make eating alone a little less miserable - even if the only people the live-eaters have for company is thousands of fans on the web.
