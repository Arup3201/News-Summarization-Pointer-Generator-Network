Hate preacher Abu Qatada was refused bail by a military court in Jordan yesterday.

The radical cleric, who had been deported from Britain to his homeland earlier this month to face a retrial on terrorism charges, is being held in a high-security prison near the capital Amman. 

He had been convicted in his absence of conspiring to carry out terrorist attacks against Israelis, Americans and other Westerners in Jordan in two foiled plots in 1999 and 2000.

However now the 53-year-old Muslim preacher is receiving a new trial.

The prosecutor, who cannot be identified under court regulations, did not elaborate on the reason for his decision, although terrorism suspects are rarely granted bail.

Qatada is currently being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates.

Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security. Muwaqqar is known as one of Jordan's best-kept prisons.

Gone at last: Abu Qatada' deportation was a coup for Home Secretary Theresa May

Colour-coded textbooks and maps are lined up in the prison's libraries and there is a computer room for the inmates.

The prison has 240 solitary confinement cells, but Qatada has been placed in a communal cell, where he will bunk with other inmates.

Home Secretary Theresa May did what so many politicians 
have failed to do and saw Qatada finally flown out of Britain, leaving 
RAF Northolt at 2.46am on Sunday July 7.

The
Al Qaeda fanatic – who was pictured smirking through the window as his 
plane took off – is now locked in a Jordanian jail after being formally 
charged with two terrorist conspiracies.

He was transferred there from Belmarsh prison in South East London.

Qatada's deportation brought to a close a 
legal circus which lasted for almost ten years and cost the British 
taxpayer £1.7million.

Millions more were spent on surveillance and will 
continue to be spent on state handouts for his wife and five children, 
who remain in the UK.

The 
payments were made despite the UK government trying to have Qatada 
removed because he was wanted on terror charges in Jordan.

The controversial preacher has been 
charged with plotting al Qaeda-inspired terror attacks and detained in a
prison in Jordan's capital Amman.

Charges
faced by Qatada cover a foiled plot against the American school in 
Amman and an alleged attack on Israeli and American tourists during new 
year celebrations.
