The chain now has a stable of 32 
internationally renowned designers, including Betty Jackson, Jasper Conran, Ben de Lisi, Jeff Banks, Jasper 
Conran, FrostFrench, Jonathan Kelsey, Jane Packer, Pearce Fionda, 
Stephen Jones, Preen, Janet Reger, Jonathan Saunders and Marios
Schwab.

The limited edition 200-year collection comprise glamorous dresses, coats and leather accessories from some of fashion week's favourites. Some of the pieces' journeys can here be seen in the designers' preliminary sketches.

Launching online today, the collection has already generated a waiting list of customers eager to pre-order pieces from some of Britain's best-loved designers.

Hero pieces include a floor-length gold sequin glamorous dress from Star by Julien Macdonald; a luxury leather nude coat from Betty Jackson, Black, and a collection of premium leather handbags and purses.

The exclusive collection also 
includes decorative plates and mugs from Star by Julien Macdonald; 
Rocha by John Rocha; Ben de Lisi and Butterfly by Matthew Williamson.

Designer at Debenhams Henry Holland 
said: 'Working with Debenhams has allowed me to reach out to women 
through my designs and dress them in exciting, affordable fashion. I 
hope our partnership continues for many years to come.'
