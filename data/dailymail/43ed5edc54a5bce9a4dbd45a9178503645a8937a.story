The best in the world? For £5.136billion, the astronomical numbers from the latest TV deal, it would be easy to say that about the Barclays Premier League.

But is it really ‘the best’? At this moment, I have to say no. We absolutely have the best football product in the business and that’s why the fight between TV companies to secure the rights was ferocious.

On the day the deal was announced, Liverpool and Tottenham conjured up a thrilling contest, advertising all that is good about the Premier League, but, in terms of pure quality, I don’t think we can make the boast of being the best.

With the money that has flooded in, our teams should be carrying all before them in Europe. In the not-too-distant future, some clubs will be in a position where they will not only be able to get into bidding wars with Real Madrid and Barcelona but actually trump them.

At the minute, however, we don’t have the strength and depth of other leagues on the continent and the resumption of both European competitions next week brings that sharply into focus. With the financial power English clubs have, we should be favourites to do a clean sweep.

The Europa League, in particular, is something we should be stamping our presence all over. That tournament gets criticised but I believe it is the real indicator of how strong a country’s league is. England’s performance in the last 15 years has, frankly, been awful.

Only Liverpool (2001) and Chelsea (2013) have lifted the trophy; Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) are the others who have contested the final. Spanish teams, in the same period, have provided six winners and three other finalists. We have grossly underperformed.

It is the same in the Champions League. With Borussia Dortmund in the bottom three of the Bundesliga, Germany only has one team (Bayern Munich) capable of winning it. With the threat from Italy and France also minimal, the path should be clear but, of our three remaining candidates, only Chelsea look capable of going all the way.

So it throws up the question of how clubs are investing their riches. And that is one of my big concerns: recruitment. Have these incredible figures put agents and players around the globe on alert that England is the place to come and make a killing?

This is not just a deal for English football. Some will see it as a deal for world football but will our clubs now get kidded when they go looking for players? Only Chelsea have recruited well recently. Can Liverpool, Tottenham or Manchester United say the same?

Is it too easy for these clubs to say ‘we’ve got the money’ rather than scouting properly?

Do not confuse this for me saying clubs should only be buying British: I want to see clubs continue to buy stars such as Diego Costa, Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria; performers like Marco Reus and Paul Pogba would be welcome additions in the future and we want the best managers here, too.

My worry is we will see an influx of dross arriving, players who know they will get lavishly rewarded for not doing much but will block the development of young local talent. They are the most worrying transfers. Clubs cannot fall into a trap of thinking success will come just by throwing money around. 

I spoke to a respected figure who works in development football and he conducted a study of the top Premier League clubs’ use of players within their 25-man squads; essentially, there tends to be 14 or 15 players within each group — the mainstays — who play 75 per cent of all matches. We want the best players coming in to challenge them, the concern is the players who occupy the other eight to 10 places. We don’t want players to come in and snuff out the chances of local kids at the club, just because they have cost money. They add nothing and stop progress.

Watching Jordon Ibe and Harry Kane in midweek put that into focus. Both players have had spells out on loan and such moves are becoming increasingly crucial in a young player’s education as they are competing against men for points and fighting to show they are good enough. With that experience, they should be given the chance to support the regulars. Only rarely do we get young English stars such as Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney or Raheem Sterling, who go straight into the team as a teenager. Clubs have a duty to give those who have put 10 years or more in at an academy a proper opportunity to succeed.

One aspect that should be looked at accordingly is the ‘homegrown’ rule. It is a nonsense that players such as Wojciech Szczesny and Cesc Fabregas, for instance, can be classed as being locally produced even though they were recruited from abroad.

The added spin-off of that will help benefit the England team in the long term. I’ve heard it said that the Premier League has hindered England’s performances in the last two decades but let’s not kid ourselves on that — England were struggling at tournaments long before 1992.

What we should not lose sight of, either, is how supporters should be treated and surely now is the time for clubs to give something back to those who have stood by them through thick and thin?

Can clubs find a way of providing subsidies for away travel and agree that £20 for an away ticket is the top limit? Why can’t the 20 chairmen make that the fair price? For the money they are going to earn, any fall in gate receipts would be minimal.

They are all issues that, in time, will be addressed. The Premier League is the best concept in football, one that we should be proud of. But is it the best in all areas? No. Not yet.

RODGERS MUST FACE DOWN BOGEYMEN

Some games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Crystal Palace is one that has stayed with me.

I remember coming in from playing Sunday League football and being completely stunned that Liverpool could lose 4-3 to opponents like Palace. It was a defeat that stripped Liverpool’s aura of invincibility and, I felt, started the club’s demise.

There is no doubt Palace have been a bogey team for Liverpool. They shattered Brendan Rodgers’s hopes of bringing the title back to Anfield and the effects of that 3-3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last November, when Liverpool folded at Selhurst Park and were beaten 3-1.

Only after that defeat were Liverpool able to start recovering and while they head into Saturday night's FA Cup fifth-round tie with an opportunity to really build some momentum, the squad will be conscious of the threat Alan Pardew’s men pose.

It is the tie of the weekend, as Palace will be aiming to inflict further misery on Liverpool and dreaming of the chance to repeat their achievements of 1990 and get back to Wembley. They can be difficult opposition when the home crowd get behind them. This match, however, is huge for Liverpool.

With their hopes of getting into the top four still delicately balanced and a tough Europa League fixture against Besiktas looming, they cannot afford to let the FA Cup slip away.

They cannot suffer at the hands of their bogeymen again.

THIS WEEK I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO... LOUIS VAN GAAL'S NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE

Manchester United's manager came in for criticism this week for how he handled some barbs from Sam Allardyce after the sides drew 1-1 at Upton Park.

As soon as Van Gaal started handing out sheets at his conference before the game with Burnley you could hear people say ‘he’s lost it’, because it’s not something you see a manager do every day. But I applauded him for standing up for his beliefs.

It was also hilarious when he was passing around the sheets with his tactics on and came out with the line: ‘Give this to Big Sam!’.

How many of these press conferences do we see that are filled with endless cliches and quotes you have heard 100 times before? Full marks to Van Gaal for standing up for himself and having a go back at one of his rivals. He didn’t overstep the mark, he just argued for what he believed in.

Van Gaal is not afraid to speak his mind and though he is still trying to find a way to get United playing dynamic football, he has added to our game with his pre- and post-match observations and there was nothing wrong with the way he answered back to Allardyce. Long may it continue.
