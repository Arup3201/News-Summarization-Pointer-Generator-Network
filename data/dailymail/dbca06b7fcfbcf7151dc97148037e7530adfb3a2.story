One in five Tory members is thinking of voting for the UK Independence Party at the next election, a poll has revealed.

More than half feel they are not respected by David Cameron, despite years of service to their local Conservative associations.

And many feel alienated by some of the Prime Minister’s flagship policies, with 59 per cent saying they oppose gay marriage and 67 per cent opposed to increases in the budget for foreign aid.

Switching: More than 800 Conservative party members were asked to rate how likely they were to vote for UKIP at the 2015 election from 0 to 10

Threat: David Cameron, pictured at Wimbledon yesterday, is warned his party members are ready to defect to support Nigel Farage's UKIP

The findings came in a YouGov poll of 
852 members for Queen Mary, University of London, Sussex University and 
the McDougall Trust pressure group.

The survey revealed only 19 per cent
of members believe Mr Cameron will lead the party to victory in 2015.

The rare insight into feeling among the Tory activists will make for worrying reading for party strategists.

It reveals a growing disconnect between Mr
Cameron and his members, with almost half saying they now spend no time
campaigning for his re-election as Prime Minister.

Many of them are actively considering switching to back UKIP, in a major boost for Nigel Farage’s party.

The damning verdict comes just two months after party relations were shattered by claims a senior Tory figure had dismissed activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'.

Mr Cameron was forced to publicly declare his support for party members after the insult was used to explain why Tory MPs voted against gay marriage plans, under pressure from their local associations.

Unpopular: Coalition policies on gay marriage and ring-fencing international development from cuts are opposed by Conservative activists

The research was carried out by YouGov for Queen Mary, University of London, Sussex University and the McDougall Trust.

It is unusual to see surveys of party 
members because lists of names are not released, but the polling firm 
has identified 852 individuals from its previous work.

The
study emerged as former Defence Secretary Liam Fox stepped up his 
attacks on the European Union, attacking the political class in Brussels
for 'fanning the flames of frustration' by failing to listen to fears 
about immigration across the EU.

European commissioners are ‘paving the way for extremists’ by turning a blind eye to increasing concerns about immigration, Liam Fox warned today as he called for a policy that puts ‘the British people first’.

The former Defence Secretary attacked the political class in Brussels for ‘fanning the flames of frustration’ by failing to listen to fears across the EU and warned it could have ‘dangerous’ consequences.

In a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies in London he also called for reforms that would make it easier for international workers with skills needed in Britain to enter the country but tougher for those that are a ‘burden’ on the state.

He indicated a green-card style system could be introduced as part of an ‘open and shut’ immigration system.

‘Nobody should assume they have the right to come to our country because they have relatives already here or because they happen to reside in some remote corner of the European Union,’ he said.

Respondents were asked to say whether 
they would consider voting for UKIP on a scale of one to 10, with the 
top rating indicating a definite ‘yes’ and 0 meaning they would ‘never’ 
defect.

Some 19 per cent gave a score of eight or above, while nine per cent said they would definitely switch.

Only a fifth (19 per cent) think the 
Conservatives will win an overall majority in the 2015 general election,
with 10 per cent predicting a second coalition with the Lib Dems.

A further 12 per cent think the Tories could forge a coalition without the Lib Dems or Labour, but relying on the support of smaller parties.

Almost a third (31 per cent) think the Conservatives could plough ahead as a minority government.

Just 24 per cent support the introduction of gay marriage, while 59 per cent are opposed.

The coalition policy to protect the overseas aid budget from spending cuts is also opposed by 67 per cent of party members, compared to just 18 per cent who back it.

Only seven per cent of those surveyed thought the party leadership 'respects them a lot', while 42 per cent feel it 'does not respect them very much' and 11 per cent said it 'does not respect them at all'.

More than two in five (44 per cent) say they spend no time at all on campaign activity, while 30 per cent say they give up to five hours a month for leafleting, social events and meetings.

Almost 40 per cent say they are now less active within the party than five years ago.

The polling was carried out between May 31 and June 11, and they were not able to weight the results to reflect the estimated 100,000 Conservative Party members.
