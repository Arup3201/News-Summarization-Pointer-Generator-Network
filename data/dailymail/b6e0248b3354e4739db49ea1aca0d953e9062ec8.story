Pensioner Jose Hampson leaves court on her Zimmer frame after being found guilty of racially abusing a family of gypsies

A grandmother aged 78 was yesterday convicted of racially abusing a family of gipsies as a long-running dispute over an illegal caravan site boiled over.

Former Sunday school teacher and community stalwart José Hampson claimed she was sworn at and intimidated when she backed her Jaguar through the gates of their camp to turn it around.

But the respected toyshop owner was fingerprinted and ordered to provide a DNA sample after the gipsies told police she had shouted racist abuse at them.

Yesterday she found herself with a criminal record for the first time in her life after a district judge rejected her account and found her guilty of racially-aggravated harassment.

Afterwards the widow - who arrived at court in a wheelchair after suffering a fall - said she was 'stunned' by the verdict and said she was considering lodging an appeal.

The ex-school governor claimed she was driving back from the toyshop she has run for six decades in a Lancashire market town when she found the narrow lane to her home of 40 years partially blocked by a van.

She said she had previously seen it parked on an illegal traveller site built on green belt land beside the lane which the local council has spent tens of thousands of pounds in an unsuccessful attempt to evict.

The former secretary of the local chamber of trade told Preston magistrates court she scraped her car trying to squeeze past, so decided to reverse back down the lane and turn around in the entrance to the site then return to nearby Chorley.

Hampson told the court one of the Romany gipsies who owns the camp, Michael Linfoot, came running over shouting: 'What the f****** hell are you doing on my land?' The 5ft pensioner claimed she felt 'intimidated' by Mr Linfoot and his 72-year-old father-in-law Walter Bird 'towering' over her but told them: 'You're not supposed to be on this land, it's green belt.' Hampson claimed the only time she swore was when she asked them what the 'f****** nuisance' was about, and denied using racist language before she drove off.

However Mr Linfoot told the court he had merely walked over to see why she had driven onto the plot and that Hampson confronted him over the damage her car had suffered.

The self-employed builder said he had told her the van blocking the lane wasn't his, at which she started 'shouting and screaming' and saying: 'Look at my f****** wheel.' Mr Linfoot said he again denied responsibility, at which she said: 'I'm f****** sick of you lot, you're illegal, you should all f*** off you dirty f****** gypos.' 'Romany gipsies are probably the only ethnic minorities left that still gets abused - people think it's ok,' he told the court.

Victim: Patty Linfoot

Abused: Husband Michael Linfoot

Insulted: Walter Bird

'My mother-in-law's a similar age and if she came out with that sort of language I'd be disgusted.' Mr Bird's wife Sylvia, who was watching from beside her caravan, told the court: 'My husband was so upset I had to make him a cup of tea.' Shortly afterwards the Linfoot family called the police who took statements from both sides, and Hampson was charged with racially abusing them.

Vindicated: Patty Linfoot and her mother Sylvia Bird leave court after their abuser Jose Hampson was fined nearly £700 and ordered to pay costs

She denied his account, telling yesterday's trial: 'I would never dream of using language like that.' Her solicitor, James Towey, suggested in cross-examination that Mr Linfoot had made up his account to discredit local residents opposed to the camp, pointing out he had told police: 'If we can stop one of them, it may have the desired effect on the others'.

However the father-of-three insisted Hampson had 'lost it' during the incident in April and caused him and his father-in-law distress.

Deputy district judge James Hatton 
said he found it 'improbable' that Hampson wouldn't have simply driven 
off had she felt as intimidated as she claimed, describing the evidence 
given by Mr Linfoot and his family as 'cogent and believable'.

He
told her he was convinced that 'in the heat of the moment you have lost
your temper and used the language described in court today'.

Finding
her guilty of using racially aggravated threatening words or behaviour,
he fined her £690 and ordered to pay her £620 prosecution costs plus a 
£69 victims' surcharge.

Afterwards Hampson, of Heath Charnock, said she hoped to lodge an appeal.

'I'm
absolutely stunned but I'm considering the way forward - it's taken a 
lot out of me,' she said. 'I know perfectly well that I'm innocent.' 
Chorley council has set aside £145,000 in a vain battle to evict the 
Linfoots since they moved onto the plot in 2009, provoking anger towards
the family from some local residents.

They
refused to move despite being denied planning permission and being 
served with an enforcement order, but were recently given a two-year 
reprieve after successfully arguing there wasn't enough provision for 
travellers in the area.
