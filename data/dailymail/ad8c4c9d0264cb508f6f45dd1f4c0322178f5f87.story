Hennepin County filed a petition Friday for a child protection order to keep Adrian Peterson away from his son, with no 'unsupervised or unauthorized contact.' 

The petition laid out a safety plan for the court to approve that would include restrictions on the conditions under which Peterson can see his son, as well as prohibit any 'corporal punishment and/or physical discipline.'

On September 12, Peterson was indicted in Montgomery County, Texas, for felony injury to a child.

Brutal: Peterson has spoken out about whipping another of his children with a wooden switch, seen above, police released these images of the boy's wounds

During interviews with Child Protective Services and Texas law enforcement, Peterson admitted to giving his son two spankings, one with a belt and the other with a switch, as 'physical discipline,' according to the complaint.

Peterson reportedly took a stick from a tree and removed the leaves before striking his son with his pants pulled down.

According to Forbes, text messages sent from Peterson to his four-year-old son's mother show Peterson's nonchalant attitude about the wounds. 

In one text, he said one mark would make the mother 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch.'

'Got him in nuts once I noticed,' started another. 'But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!'

The physical marks were noticed by the four-year-old's mother after he returned from Texas to her home in Minnesota.

On May 22, the mother took him to the pediatrician, where the four-year-old underwent a well-child check and showed the doctor his 'owies.'

These included switch marks, some of which were described as cuts, to the child's thighs, buttocks, scrotum, back and right hand.

When asked what happened, the child said, 'I got whooped by a switch,' and said it was his father who did it.

Sponsorship: Nike suspended its endorsement of Adrian Peterson, one of the NFL's biggest stars following the allegations of child abuse

Since details of the allegations have emerged, Peterson has been dropped from the Vikings' active roster while the criminal case against him is pending in Texas, where he has an October 8 arraignment.

The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, taking him off the roster and bowing to pressure from outraged fans and sponsors. 

Hennepin County juvenile court staff attorney Maggie Skelton said prosecutors have asked that the order be suspended until the Texas case is resolved.

County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement that the petition was required by law once criminal charges were filed, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

The fallout from the abuse allegations have led to major sponsors dropping the NFL star from lucrative endorsement deals. 

Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well.

Castrol Motor Oil was the first of Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing Tuesday that the contract was suspended. 

On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed Peterson back on the field following his arrest.

Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, has not responded to an email seeking comment. 

But the NFL and team owners are currently dealing with three other high profile domestic abuse cases. 

Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son.

On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. 

And, a security video emerged last week of Ray Rice knocking his wife Janay Rice out cold.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely and said he had not seen that video when he handed down his original two-game ban in July.

He had, however, seen a previous video showing Rice dragging an unconscious Janay out of the elevator.

Scandal: The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee Janay

Staying power: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized at today's tense press conference, but refused to resign 

Today, Goodell apologized for his handling of the Rice scandal - but refused to step down from his position.

As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision making in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving players.  

Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator.

'Unfortunately over the past several weeks we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong and that starts with me,' Goodell said.
