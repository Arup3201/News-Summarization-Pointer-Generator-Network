It was only on Friday that Sam Allardyce was mentioning Alex Song in the same breath as Yaya Toure.

'We've got a top quality player of the highest calibre and he's going to provide the sort of service our front line needs,' the West Ham manager gushed after happily making the Toure comparison.

Like pretty much everything else he's done so far this season, Allardyce was right on the money.

Barely 24 hours later, Song turned in a Toure-esque performance against Toure as West Ham preserved their place in the Champions League places with a 2-1 win over Manchester City.

Song was simply immense, patrolling the midfield, fetching and carrying, disrupting City's creative play and acting as the battering ram for West Ham's forward play.

There were moments of brilliance, too. It was Song who delivered the pass that unlocked the City defence and set Enner Valencia free in the build-up to their first goal, converted at close range by Morgan Amalfitano.

And he even pulled out the most popular trick of the week - the 'Rabona' - to deliver a cross during the second-half.

By contrast, Toure, as so often this season, simply wasn't up for the battle.

When Cameroon international Song, 27, was made available by Barcelona in the summer, Allardyce saw off competition from the likes of Napoli and Galatasaray to sign a player who had not been able to hold down a first-team place at the Nou Camp.

But when Song said shortly after his arrival that West Ham could 'maybe catch the European positions,' most mocked his ambition, especially following their troubles last season. He had just joined a new club and wanted to say the right things, they claimed.

That aim is looking a whole lot more likely now as, following five wins from nine matches, the resurgent Hammers are fourth in the Premier League, a single point behind defending champions City.

West Ham are a team transformed, the negative and conservative approach of the last few years replaced by something a little closer to their attacking tradition.

If Song has as much influence in and around the training ground as he does on matchday, then he has proved a shrewd acquisition.

Allardyce said as much on Friday: 'On the training ground he is a massive influence and in the changing room it's his dress sense that's the massive influence.

Jokes about his fashion tastes aside, what a presence to have in the squad. A man who competed at the highest level for Arsenal and Barcelona, a La Liga champion and a man with 47 caps for his country. Song can only bring benefit. 

There are plenty of other clubs in the Premier League - Arsenal included - who would have valued a Song-like figure this season.

The Gunners are crying out for a defensive shield, while even Liverpool and Manchester United would have benefitted from such a grafter to protect the back line.

Just look at his statistics from Saturday at Upton Park - he recovered possession on 11 occasions, stifling a potentially dangerous City move on each occasion.

Diafra Sakho continued his hot scoring streak with the goal that proved to be the winner at Upton Park

His heat map shows Song covered the full sweep of the midfield and he covered 10.7km during the course of his 90 minutes.

Song's efforts proved key and he was rightly selected as the man of the match.

While the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho, again on target on Saturday, may steal the headlines, Song's influence at revitalised West Ham must not be overlooked.
