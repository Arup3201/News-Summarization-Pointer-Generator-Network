She is the voluptuous swimwear model whose blonde locks, endless legs and womanly curves 
made her a household name almost overnight.

And now the secrets behind the body that propelled her to the cover of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Edition have been revealed.

Kate Upton's personal trainer has divulged the model's diet and fitness secrets, and whilst he admits it takes hard work and motivation, he claims that a body like Kate's can be achieved by almost anyone.

So THAT's her secret! Kate Upton, who is famed for her perfect curves, has been following a ModelFIT programme- a fusion of fitness specialities including zumba, martial arts and yoga

Personal trainer and model workout guru Justin Gelband told Shape magazine: 'Since the first day I met her, she wanted to come in and change the industry by saying curves are sexy,

'She's such a great role model for all the young girls out there.'

American-born Kate works out using a tailored ModelFIT programme by Justin - who has even been dubbed the 'model whisperer' by grateful clients.

ModelFIT is a fusion of fitness 
specialities including zumba, martial arts and functional training, 
capoeira, pilates and yoga.

It claims to stretch, strengthen and tone 
your entire body, as well as firming up your thighs and flatten your abs.

Model whisperer: Justin Gelband created the class for the likes of Victoria's Secret Angels Candice Swanepoel and Erin Heatherton

And Kate isn't alone, because Justin Gelband created the class for the likes of Irina Shayk, Miranda Kerr, Candice Swanepoel, Erin Heatherton and Lily Aldridge.

The £30 classes, which are taught at a fitness studio in New York, are 45-50 min long and limited to 10 clients.

And she compliments her rigorous exercise regime with a healthy diet.

'Food is absolutely number one,' Gelband told Harper's Bazaar.

'When I sit down with anyone to discuss their workout regimen, the first thing I say to them is, "The one thing I really want you to concentrate on now is limiting the amount of things you are putting into your body that you do not need. No sugar (except for berries), no salt, no alcohol, limit your carbs."'

He believes completely banning carbs isn't a good idea, and instead advises people yearning for an Upton-esque figure to indulge in the carbohydrates that you get from vegetables, brown rice and Ezekiel breads.

He does, however, advise dieters to limit these carbs to only twice a week, especially if you're attempting to emulate Kate's curves.

Dedicated: Kate says no matter how busy her schedule is, she always makes time for exercise

Speaking about her envied physique in the past, Kate said it is all down to making time to exercise, no matter how busy she can be.

'My
schedule can be pretty gruelling, but I always make time for fitness 
and relaxing. I get facials regularly when I’m in NYC, and my trainer 
helps me to plan work outs when I’m travelling.

'A lot of sleep and water is important too, especially when adjusting to time changes,' she said.
