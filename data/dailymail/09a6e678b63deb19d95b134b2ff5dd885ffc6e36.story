Lance Hohaia has accepted a one-match ban for his forearm strike which sparked the punches from Ben Flower during a brutal opening to Saturday's Super League Grand Final between St Helens and Wigan.

The 31-year-old New Zealand stand-off, who caught Flower off the ball, was knocked to the ground by the Wigan prop's first punch and then lay motionless as Flower landed a second on his face.

Flower will face a Rugby Football League disciplinary tribunal on Tuesday evening charged with a grade F offence, which carries a minimum eight-match ban.

Hohaia was charged with a grade B offence of striking which normally carries a suspension of one or two matches.

Because of his previous record, the St Helens half-back was entitled to submit an early guilty plea to receive the smallest sanction and avoid a hearing.

'Lance Hohaia has accepted the EGP and will miss the first warm-up game of next season,' a St Helens spokesman said.
