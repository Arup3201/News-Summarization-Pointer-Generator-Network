A Tory MP last night clashed with the Prime Minister’s description of the Woolwich murder as ‘terrorism’.

Alec Shelbrooke, a ministerial aide, said the fact that the attackers cited Allah to horrified onlookers should not mean the incident be classified as a ‘terrorist’ incident.

Alec Shelbrooke said that the incident should not be considered terror, it is murder

‘Just because someone says they have done it in the name of Islam does not make them terrorists,’ he said.

‘I do not think this should be described as terror.

‘Just because you stand up and say “God is Great” to everybody, it does not mean it’s Islamic terror.’

Shelbrooke said that just because it was done in the name of God does not make it terrorism

Mr Shelbrooke, Parliamentary Private 
Secretary to Northern Ireland Minister Mike Penning, compared the 
killers to the Yorkshire Ripper.

He said: ‘What’s the difference between Peter Sutcliffe saying he killed prostitutes because God told him to, and these people who are saying they are doing it in the name of Allah? It’s murder.’

Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was killed in the 'terrorist' attack last week

The MP for Elmet and Rothwell, West Yorkshire, said he had been bombarded with angry messages from constituents.

‘The implication is anybody who has not got a white face is implicated. If people have those views they must visit Auschwitz to understand where intolerance leads.

'People should draw the connection between what happened in the 1920 and 1930s in Germany, and the conversations people think are acceptable now. We live in a cohesive society.’
