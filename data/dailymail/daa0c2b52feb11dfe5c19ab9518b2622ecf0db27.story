Tropical Storm Arthur is the first storm of the hurricane season - and it's roaring up the eastern seaboard just in time to ruin Fourth of July cookouts and fireworks for most of the Northeast. 

The squall, which is currently about 95 miles off Cape Canaveral, Florida, was upgraded to a tropical storm late this morning and has the potential to strength into a hurricane as it approaches the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

Arthur will bring coastal flooding, rough surf, thunderstorms and heavy downpours from the Carolinas to New England later on Friday, with the worst of the weather expected to hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina early on Independence Day.

Rains are expected to drench most of the Interstate 95 corridor during the holiday commute on Thursday, as well.

The tropical storm could hit Friday night in the New York City area - turning fireworks shows in a damp squib

Tropical Storm Arthur was centered about 95 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Tuesday. It was upgraded from a tropical depression on Tuesday morning

'Right now it’s predicted to be a strong tropical storm, possibly a hurricane as it moves through the Outer Banks. And that’s going to cause a lot of problems for people to get out onto some of those roads and beaches out there,' AccuWeather senior meteorologist Paul Walker told MailOnline Tuesday.

Most of the East Coast will also experience rough, possibly dangerous, conditions on the beaches as the storm passes by.

'All along the Eastern Seaboard, there is going to be rough surf and rip currents. It's going to be a threat for swimmers,' Mr Walker said.

Forecasters hope the storm will break for the Mid-Atlantic on Friday night in time for some fireworks displays.

However, it's remains possible that Arthur will turn the Fourth of July into a damp squib.

The tropical storm will also likely rub up against a storm front that's rolling eastward from the Midwest, resulting in even more rain and thunderstorms.

Tropical Depression One has since been upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur. It is expected to batter the Outer Banks on Friday

The storm could cause havoc from North Carolina to New England, through it appears the heaviest rain and strongest winds will hit North Carolina and Virginia

'As tropical moisture interacts with the front, very heavy downpours may erupt along the I-95 corridor late in the week,' AccuWeather Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok said.

There's still hope for a break in the weather just in time for Friday night's Fourth of July celebrations for much of the northeast corridor.

'If the tropical system takes a northeastward turn late in the week, as we suspect, rain and thunderstorms will begin to shift eastward and out to sea Friday afternoon and evening so that the weather improves for fireworks Friday night from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia and New York City,' Pastelok said.

The tropical storm is expected to push out to sea on Saturday - leaving the rest of the holiday weekend sunny and pleasantly warm.

A rainy Thursday commute will greet many East Coast travelers who are hoping to make it to their holiday destinations

Rain is expected across much of the East Coast, Southeast and in the Rocky Mountains on Friday - though it could clear up in time for fireworks

A tropical storm watch is in effect for Florida's east coast from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach. The depression is centered about 95 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.

It's been nearly stationary over the last few hours but a northwestward motion is expected to begin later in the day.

Elsewhere in the country, scattered thunderstorms are predicted on Friday for parts of the Rocky Mountains and Texas and Oklahoma, Mr Walker said.

Meanwhile in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Elida is meandering off Mexico's southwestern coast. Elida's maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph with some weakening forecast.

A tropical storm warning is effect for Mexico's coast from Lazaro Cardenas to Cabo Corrientes.
