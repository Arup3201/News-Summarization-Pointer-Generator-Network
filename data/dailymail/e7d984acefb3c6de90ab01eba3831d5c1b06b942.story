Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is set to spend his second night sleeping under the stars in Arnhem Land on Monday evening as part of his week-long stay in the Indigenous region.

A village of tents has been erected as the base from which the country will be run for the week as Mr Abbott and his ministers settle in to their new temporary office in remote Australia.

Mr Abbott arrived in the Northern Territory's north-east on Sunday after announcing hundreds of troops would be deployed to the Middle East to join the fight against Islamic State militants.

Despite the fact Australia's terror rating has just been increased to high, the Prime Minister maintained he would run the country from Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory for the planned week.

It is the same site where the annual Garma Festival is hosted, on the Yolngu ceremonial ground.

This stay was an election promise made by Mr Abbott, in which he said he would - along with ministers and parliamentary secretaries - spend time in remote Indigenous communities.

He was greeted on Sunday with a traditional Welcome to Country ceremony by the Yirrkala community on the Gove Peninsula in North East Arnhem Land by young and old community members.

The ceremony included traditional dance performed by Indigenous Australians adorned in body paint and playing didgeridoos.

Later that afternoon the Prime Minister had tea with Indigenous leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who he also had dinner with on Monday night.

Mr Abbott's second day in Arnhem Land was spent visiting local employers at a potential bauxite mine site, a timber mill and a cattle station.

Those projects are run by the Gumatj Corporation, chaired by Mr Yunupingu, and designed to get Yolngu people off welfare and into work.

The region was dealt a blow recently when Rio Tinto suspended work at its alumina refinery - costing about 1000 jobs, which is about a quarter of the town's population.

In the coming days Mr Abbott will be joined by his entire Indigenous advisory council and Aboriginal Australia lawyer and land rights advocate Noel Pearson for a dinner on Wednesday evening.

Constitutional recognition is sure to be discussed at the dinner and at other stages during Mr Abbott's stay in Arnhem Land, and while it's a priority for Indigenous leaders it's not often discussed among local workers.

'For the Yolngu on the ground they concentrate on their lives,' Gumatj Corporation chief executive Klaus Helms told AAP.

'They focus on getting a house, on getting less than 15 people under their roof and being able to buy a car.'

Despite this, a time frame for a vote on the recognition could be revealed in coming weeks, though it is unlikely this announcement will be made while Mr Abbott is visiting.

'I think it's important that everyone know where our country is hoping to go,' he told reporters from his Arnhem Land campsite.

'There does need to be a clear process in place with an end point for our consideration.'

Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion says 2017 is the likely date for a referendum, which would fall outside the Abbott government's first term.

It would also mark 50 years since 90 per cent of Australians voted to remove indigenous discrimination from the constitution.

The original intention of this trip was for Mr Abbott to be completely immersed in Indigenous communities for the entire week, but the crisis overseas is said to have altered that.

The Prime Minister will be in regular contact with Canberra and other world leaders for the duration of his stay via secure connections provided by the Australian Defence Force, SBS reported.
