Fresh from having her paleo baby food book canned earlier this month Charlotte Carr has come in for more negative headlines after it was revealed that she has been doing voice-overs for fast-food favourites KFC, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's.

Carr is co-author with celebrity chef Pete Evans and Helen Padarin of cookbook Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, which was dumped by its publisher after it was reportedly deemed 'potentially deadly for babies' by health experts.

The baby food blogger’s website Bubba Yum Yum makes statements such as: 'My focus is on fresh and organic produce. No numbers, no additives. Just real food!' 

However the Herald Sun reports Carr is also making money doing voice-overs on adverts for fast food, soft drink and sugar-laden products.

Celebrity chef Pete Evans has been embroiled in controversy over his paleo diet book designed for children

Mrs Carr is a big advocate of the paleo children's diet for the likes of her son Willow  

She has been with KFC for more then seven years Carr’s agency RMK Voices confirmed. Most recently she worked on a ­KFC nuggets advert.

On the agency’s website her profile also states she has 'voiced some of the country’s most well-known campaigns' which includes Diet Coke, Uncle Toby’s and Cadbury.

Carr, who has appeared on Aussie TV staples including All Saints and Offspring and, in 2006, Home and Away, has long been a vocal advocate for the 'paleo way' for children. She married Wes Carr, the winner of Australian Idol 2008, in 2012.

Her cookbook with MKR host Pete Evans, was due to hit the shelves in weeks, but was canned by publisher Pan Macmillan after heavy criticism from health experts. 

The book will still get a worldwide digital release in April, according to a post on the chef's Instagram page. He said a print version of the book would also be published eventually.

'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that "Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way” will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' post read. 

Charlotte married Wes Carr in 2012. Wes is best known for winning the sixth season of Australian Idol in 2008

The book's publishers, Pan Macmillan Australia, cancelled the release of the book amid growing concerns from health experts and dietitians. Evans and his co-authors announced they would be releasing the book independently, and it would get a digital and print release

'We didn’t want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support.

'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.'

Earlier publisher Pan Macmillan Australia announced it was ditching plans to publish the book. The cookbook was first delayed before being cancelled. 

'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' the statement read. 

Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been panned by dietitians and doctors over the past week.

The Public Health Association of Australia said the book could lead to the deaths of children across the country.

'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. 

Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet

One recipe in the book - a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - was said to have the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development.

The criticism came as it emerged Evans' Facebook page was being scrubbed clean, with comments that were negative towards the paleo lifestyle were being deleted.

After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete.

Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page.

Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page.

'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia.

'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.'

Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page.

'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said.

Evans visited a primary school in Ballarat, Victoria, last week to promote the paleo diet to children

The cancellation of the book comes as critics of Evans and the diet have claimed the chef deletes negative comments from his official Facebook page

'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.'

Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism.

'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia.

Despite the criticisms, Evans has been a passionate defender of the paleo lifestyle

Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.'

Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. 

Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website.

Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13.

The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention.

'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said.

Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day

A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.'

Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'
