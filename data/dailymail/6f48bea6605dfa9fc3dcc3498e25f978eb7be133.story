British Airways took on its first female pilot in 1987 and has been actively recruiting more women to its top ranks ever since.

As of 2013, the airline had more female pilots than any other UK carrier, though BA's Director of Flight Operations, Captain Stephen Riley insists that the 'number doesn't nearly represent the general population.'

In response to the lack of women pilots, BA has launched an 18-month 'Future Pilot Programme' in recent years - a cadet training scheme, which is open to all.

Anyone between the ages of 18 and 55 is welcome to apply and no previous flying experience is necessary.

As of 2013, the programme had attracted over 5,000 applicants for fewer than 100 places. 

Nevertheless, the number of male pilots continues to outnumber female pilots 18 to one, with just 200 women pilots out of 3,500 flying for BA.

With hopes that the numbers will continue to rise, we take a look back at the profound shift in recruitment tactics that has taken place over the years.

It's clear that many airlines used to look to females as 'trolley dollies' or 'mothers' who were there to serve you while on-board.

Men, on the other hand, were encouraged to try their hand at flying, using military-inspired language to make the job that much more appealing.

Advertisements for male pilots, however, made references to the military and inevitable in-air romances

And though some airlines still show sexualised images of female flight attendants in their adverts, the push toward women taking on high-flying pilot roles is evident.

One of the most notable female-helmed flights in recent memory took place in March 2008 when British Airways' first female pilot, Capt Lynn Barton, was selected to land the initial flight to touch down at Heathrow's Terminal 5 on March 27, 2008. 

And for all those ladies looking to take to the skies, the next application window for the Future Pilot Programme is expected to open in February 2015.
