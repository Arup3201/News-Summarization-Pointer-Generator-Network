Australia’s biggest selling Sunday newspaper carried a surprising message regarding its owner Rupert Murdoch, hidden in a children’s game.

The Sunday Telegraph’s regular word puzzle asks children to find 'hidden words' among deliberately jumbled up letters, however this week it took some skill to find one of them.

The 'animals of Indonesia' themed puzzle had the letters LIVESIHCODRUM on the third line – which is ‘Murdoch is evil’ written backwards.

The Sunday Telegraph has refused to comment after the interesting message was spotted by reporters on Tuesday.

Twitter was quickly-abuzz, with several users making fun of the wordplay.

‘I fear someone is about to get fired ... Sunday Tele puts “Murdoch is Evil” in the kids’ puzzle,’ said one tweet.

Murdoch's key rival in Australia, Fairfax Media, joined in, with the Sydney Morning Herald tweeting: ‘Someone's been having some fun in the Sunday Telegraph.’

The Australian media mogul has not 
commented on the incident, his last tweet posted three days ago was in 
response to the Pope speaking against poverty.

'Pope
Francis messages great and needed, but forgets free markets, with all 
their faults, have recently lifted one billion out of poverty,' the 
82-year-old wrote.

Mr 
Murdoch, from Melbourne, Australia, owns News Corp and 21st Century Fox,
which before their creation in June this year both fell under News 
Corporation, the world's second-largest media conglomerate.

Its Australian chapter owns more than 140 newspapers and magazines including The Australian, The Sunday Telegraph and the Herald Sun.
