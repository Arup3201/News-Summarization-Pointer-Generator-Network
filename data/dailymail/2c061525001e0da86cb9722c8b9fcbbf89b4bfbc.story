Manchester City will throw their hat into the ring for former England captain Steven Gerrard if he fails to sign a new contract at Liverpool.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini, whose move for another thirty-something Frank Lampard has proved successful this season, believes Gerrard can carry on playing at the top level for at least another two years and said: ‘I don’t ever rate players on their age.’

Kop legend Gerrard, 34, revealed last week that with his current Anfield contract running out next summer he has no plans to retire so would be happy to play for someone else.

The club have reacted quickly to give Gerrard private assurances they want him to stay and on Saturday manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I had a meeting with Steven’s representative explaining the situation. 

'I very much want him to be a part of what we are doing here. He’s been a brilliant captain for me. I relayed that to the ownership.’

But until a contract is signed, clubs like City will watch with interest. 

Pellegrini needs bargains with City hamstrung by Financial Fair Play rules and the need to include more Englishmen in their Premier League squad.

City’s manager said: ‘I don’t ever rate players on their age. It depends on the money they cost and the number of years they can play for. 

'Like Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard is a top player and he can continue at a high level for a couple more years.’

Pellegrini could not challenge Manchester United for Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria this summer with City forced to name a reduced-sized squad for the Champions League as a punishment for breaching FFP.
