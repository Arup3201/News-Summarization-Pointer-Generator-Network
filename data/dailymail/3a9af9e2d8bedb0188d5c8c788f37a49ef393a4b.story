British No 1 and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray is engaged to Kim Sears, his girlfriend of more than nine years.

Murray's representatives have confirmed the engagement of 27-year-old Murray and Sears, aged 26, but have not released any details or where the proposal took place.

Sussex-born Miss Sears, who has an English Literature degree, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. Her father is player-turned-coach Nigel Sears.

Murray was on his way to the Philippines on Wednesday to play in the International Premier Tennis League.

But he gave no indication of his big news, instead tweeting: 'Off to the Philippines for the first time today, should be a fun trip... Anyone got some suggestions for first time tourists in Manila?'

The couple met in 2005 at the US Open when Kim was travelling with her dad Nigel, who is a tennis coach. 

Their meeting came long before he acquired fame and fortune. She was only 17 at the time and Andy was her first serious boyfriend.

He said: 'I'm lucky. I know she isn't with me because I'm in the spotlight.'

The couple briefly split for six months in 2009 but they now share a multi-million pound mansion in Oxshott, Surrey with their dogs Maggie and Rusty.

In the past Murray has been notoriously reluctant to answer questions about his relationship with Sears but earlier this year he was forced to deny that he planned to marry her after joking about his love life on Twitter.

Asked when he plans to marry Miss Sears during a Twitter Q&A with fans in January, Murray responded: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.'

But just hours later, Murray was forced to issue another tweet explaining that his words were said with his tongue firmly in cheek after the original message went viral. 

He tweeted: '3 things.. I don't smoke grass, I'm not getting married(yet) and I don't want to kill rafael Nadal.. [sic]'

In June it was reported that bookies believed the Scot had asked Sears to marry him - after a flurry of betting on him popping the question at Wimbledon.

Tennis fans bet heavily on the champion to both retain his 2013 title and get engaged at 8/1 with bookmaker William Hill, which eventually stopped taking bets on it.

Murray may have caught the love bug on Saturday when he was best man at Ross Hutchins’ wedding, his former doubles partner who has battled back from Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The announcement followed Murray dispensing with the services of his longstanding assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and physical trainer Jez Green.

The two have been working with him for five and seven years respectively, and were key members of his team when Ivan Lendl became head coach and Murray enjoyed success including a U.S. Open title, Olympic gold medal and his historic Wimbledon triumph.

In releasing a statement on Wednesday, he reaffirmed his commitment to working with Amelie Mauresmo next year, with whom he teamed up at the start of this summer's grass court season.
