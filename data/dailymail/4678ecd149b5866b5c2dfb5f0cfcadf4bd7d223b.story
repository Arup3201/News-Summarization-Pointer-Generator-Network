It isn't what Freddie Burns would have hoped for when he imagined today's return to Kingsholm — a place on the bench, the grim predicament he thought he had left behind.

The 24-year-old fly-half will be on the other side of the halfway line and no longer in the cherry and white of Gloucester, but his seat among Leicester's replacements will bring back sombre memories. Burns spent a prolonged period watching games unfold from that vantage point last season, biding his time, trying gamely to suppress his frustration. He faces the same challenge this afternoon.

The England No 10 contender has been dropped from the Tigers' starting XV for the Aviva Premiership clash against his former club and the demotion couldn't have come at a worse time. He would have desperately craved a leading role in his first encounter with so many familiar faces and also a chance to enhance his Test case.

Freddie Burns was recently dropped from the Leicester XV but wants to be considered for England

Instead, he has been usurped by Welshman Owen Williams, for a fixture which comes 18 days before England coach Stuart Lancaster names his senior squad for the autumn internationals.

Competition for the playmaker places is especially fierce at present and all the candidates will be determined to avoid disruption to their momentum.

Owen Farrell is the preferred stand-off, but he remains unavailable to Saracens as he recovers from a hamstring strain. In his absence, Burns is vying with three other men for a possible two places in the England squad. He has the benefit of being the incumbent at No 10, but that last Test came in Hamilton where the national team were crushed by the All Blacks, so involvement there is not a feather in the cap.

FREDDIE BURNS (Leicester)

Strengths: Unpredictable creative threat, with vision and all the tricks.

Weaknesses: Dropped by his club and recovering from form slump.

DANNY CIPRIANI (Sale)

Strengths: Clever runner armed with a glorious attacking repertoire.

Weaknesses: Less established in England set-up than rivals.

OWEN FARRELL (Saracens)

Strengths: Competitive streak and composure in DNA. Supreme kicker.

Weaknesses: Injuries, and doubts persist about all-round ability.

GEORGE FORD (Bath)

Strengths: Major talent who can stand flat or deep to torment teams.

Weaknesses: Relatively small frame makes him a target.

STEPHEN MYLER (Northampton)

Strengths: Calm playmaker and kicker with layer of off-loading class.

Weaknesses: Understated qualities are sometimes overlooked.

Last season, once he had decided to leave Gloucester, Burns was marginalised by the then director of rugby, Nigel Davies. His form collapsed, as did his confidence. Starting for England against New Zealand at Eden Park — armed with Lancaster's endorsements — brought the belief and conviction back, but he must strive to overcome this latest setback quickly.

The new campaign began brightly, with four starts and a particularly impressive display in the win over Exeter at Sandy Park. But when Leicester were smashed 45-0 at Bath, Burns was on that sinking ship and he was unable to prevent another defeat last weekend, at home to London Irish.

Individual ambitions are intrinsically linked to collective fortunes, as the Tigers' recruit appreciates. Asked to assess his England prospects, he said poignantly: 'Hopefully, if Leicester are winning and I'm playing well I will be there or thereabouts. It's all I can do.'

Thus, Burns needs to play some part in a revival today. His hope must be he comes off the bench to help the Tigers arrest their mini-slump with a win. While he bides his time, in the back of his mind will be the realisation his England rivals have a chance to force him out of the autumn reckoning.

Last night's Bath-Saracens match presented George Ford with another high-profile stage to advance his own burgeoning international claims, after missing the summer tour following surgery. Today, Northampton's Stephen Myler will aim to catch the eye at London Irish, while Danny Cipriani will be determined to lower the colours of his former club, Wasps, in Salford tomorrow.Jonny Wilkinson yesterday gave his backing to Farrell to continue in the conductor's role, but also suggested the challengers need game-time. Speaking in Newcastle in his role as a 2015 World Cup ambassador, he told Sky Sports News: 'I think Owen Farrell has done a fantastic job and deserves to be leading the team. George Ford, Freddie Burns and Danny Cipriani are doing all they can — showing they deserve a shot.

'World Cup squads don't include just one No 10. You can't have one 10 who's played all the games and one who hasn't touched the ball.' Lancaster and his coaches await further medial bulletins after a damaging week.

Danny Cipriani is also a contender for the England No 10 position after impressing for Sale 

With Alex Corbisiero, Geoff Parling and Tom Johnson out of their autumn plans, they will seek assurances about Tom Wood's back, after Northampton confirmed the flanker will miss a third successive match.

Saints captain Dylan Hartley is also missing for the champions, but his absence is precautionary due to a minor back problem.
