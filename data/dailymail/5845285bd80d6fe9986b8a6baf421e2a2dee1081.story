This unfortunate motorist may not be amused by the irony of the situation, but his 40mph car crash certainly made for a rather comical picture.

Douglas Southard, 21, of Hickory, North Carolina, crashed into the back of a ‘Booze it and Lose it’ drink-driving mobile unit on Sunday morning.

Authorities claim Southard had drunk alcohol before he crashed into the testing lab bus and are now deciding whether to press charges.

Chevrolet crash: Douglas Southard, 21, of Hickory, North Carolina, ploughed into the back of a 'Booze it and Lose it' drink-driving mobile unit on Sunday

Southard was driving a 1989 red Chevrolet Camaro along U.S. Highway 321 at around 2:45am when the crash happened, police said.

He went into the back of the testing lab, which had a magistrate, several officers and two drink-driving suspects inside at the time.

He was allegedly driving with a revoked licence when he crashed into the DWI (driving while intoxicated) unit, reported WSOC TV.

The officers from four local law enforcement agencies were closing down the checkpoint at the time of the crash, but nobody inside was hurt.

Charges? Douglas Southard, 21, of Hickory, North Carolina, was allegedly driving with a revoked licence when he crashed

Vehicle: The testing lab, known as the 'BAT Mobile', had been stationed at a junction for around three hours when the crash happened (file picture)

The mobile units go out on patrol in North Carolina as authorities try to get drunk-drivers off the roads.

They contain a laboratory for testing alcohol levels in drivers and a magistrate's office on board.

The units also come equipped with phones, computers, traffic cones, search batons and a lavatory.

Southard meanwhile was drifting in and out of consciousness after the crash and an ambulance took him to Catawba Valley Medical Center.

He did not have life-threatening injuries but authorities believe he consumed alcohol before the crash, reported the Charlotte Observer.

The testing lab, known as the ‘BAT Mobile’, had been stationed at a junction for around three hours when the crash happened.

Authorities say Southard was driving at between 35mph and 40mph when the crash happened. Charges could be filed after an investigation.
