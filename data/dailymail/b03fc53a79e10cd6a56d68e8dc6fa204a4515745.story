The U.S. are achieving football success again on the international stage after beating France 3-1 to reach the Women’s World Cup Final, prompting wild celebrations across America.

The Americans, who have never finished below third place at the competition and won it in 1991 and 1999, took an early lead when Lauren Cheney flicked in a Carli Lloyd cross in the ninth minute.

France levelled after the break with a Sonia Bompastor cross that bounced past goalkeeper Hope Solo, and fans of both sides watched on anxiously until the deadlock was broken in the 79th minute.

Two goals in three minutes from Abby 
Wambach and Alex Morgan in front of 25,676 fans secured a third World 
Cup final appearance for the Americans, where they will play Japan on Sunday.

The Americans’ road to the final has 
attracted much attention from Hollywood celebrities and professional 
athletes who have never ever watched a football game before.

TV star Ellen DeGeneres wished the 
team good luck before the game, dozens in airports were glued to TVs and
Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers tagged a tweet with 
‘worldcupfinalherewecome’.

Hundreds of people also watched a live outdoor telecast of the game in San Francisco, California.

'This is our journey, this is our 
dream,' a beaming Wambach said. 'France are a great team. There were 
moments they were outplaying us but I am so proud of this team.

Final match: USA v Japan (Frankfurt, Sunday)

'I know we are going to pull through. I have belief in this team. Everybody is working for each other.'

U.S. coach Pia Sundhage, whose team 
needed a penalty shootout to overcome Brazil in the last eight and now 
go to Frankfurt on Sunday, said: ‘We lost our legs a bit but we picked 
up the fight’.

'I think it was obvious we had heavy legs so we had to adjust.'

The Americans, under pressure from 
the start, scored against the run of play through Cheney but immediately
fell back with some sloppy passing allowing France to come forward 
repeatedly.

With Sundhage sensing danger and 
bellowing from her coaching area, the French dominance almost paid off 
on the half hour when Gaetane Thiney tested Solo with a close-range 
effort.

Bompastor then rattled the bar with a fierce drive seconds later as France took complete control.

The USA have never lost in 22 women's first-team football games against Japan, running out winners 19 times and drawing 3.

They have scored 70 goals and shipped 10.

The two have faced off twice in the Women's World Cup, with the U.S. winning 4-0 in a 1995 quarter-final and 3-0 in a 1991 group match.

Their last meeting was in North Carolina in May, with the USA winning 2-0 in a friendly.

Wambach, who had scored an equaliser 
deep into extra time against Brazil, should have put the Americans 
further in front before the break but headed along the goal line from a 
metre.

The French got their just reward 
after 55 minutes when Bompastor levelled after whipping in a cross from 
the left that deceived Solo.

With France coach Bruno Bini bringing
on another striker in the speedy Elodie Thomis as they went in search 
of the winner, the Americans struck at just the right time with Wambach 
making amends and heading in at the far post in the 79th minute.

A smooth chip over keeper Berangere Sapowicz from Morgan three minutes later put the game beyond the French.

'We had our chances and we had a lot,' Bini said. 'We were as good as we could have been. But they have a lot of experience.'

'This is our journey, this is our 
dream.  I am so proud of this team'

Abby Wambach, U.S. footballer

Though the Americans are two-time 
World Cup champions, they haven't made the final since Mia Hamm, Julie 
Foudy and Brandi Chastain won it all in 1999.

The Americans had only two days' rest
following the Brazil game, their quickest turnaround of the tournament,
and there had been concern that fatigue or emotions might get the best 
of them.
