Nick Clegg is to announce new plans that could see free TV licences and winter fuel payments stripped from well-off pensioners

Free TV licences and winter fuel payments would be stripped from hundreds of thousands of well-off pensioners to subsidise bus fares for under-21s in Lib Dem plans being unveiled today.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will insist benefits for 'the rich and retired' are unjustifiable as he launches his 'pre-manifesto' for next year's general election.

The Lib Dems say they will withdraw the perks from all pensioners in the higher-rate tax band, affecting more than 600,000 who pay tax at the 40p rate.

The cuts would save £125million a year, the Lib Dems said, which would give all those in England aged 16 to 21 a bus pass entitling them to two-thirds off tickets.

The Lib Dems and Labour are committed to scrapping perks for better-off pensioners – one of dozens of policy areas where they agree, paving the way for a potential Lib-Lab coalition next year.

Most of the Cabinet is also thought to favour cutting universal benefits for pensioners at the election, Government sources say, and research for No 10 suggests the majority of voters back the idea.

Mr Clegg will say today: 'Young people are required to stay in school until they are 18, but we haven't done enough to give them the support they need to do that – literally to help them get from A to B.

'I know there are people who say you mustn't touch so-called universal pensioner benefits because politically it's too risky. We don't agree: what are effectively benefits for the rich and retired cannot be justified when there are so many young people struggling to get on their feet.'

The move would be delivered by bus operating companies, who would then be reimbursed by local government, the Lib Dems added.

The party earlier announced it would abolish the married tax allowance to fund free childcare for every two-year-old in England if they are in government after next year's general election.

The plan is a central plank of around 300 policies being unveiled Mr Clegg under the slogan 'Stronger Economy, Fairer Society', and is likely to be a sticking point for the party in any coalition negotiations if the election result is inconclusive.

The 80-page document will form the basis of the Lib Dem manifesto for the May 2015 poll, subject to approval by the party's annual conference in Glasgow next month. 

Activists will be able to amend the policies and, while their votes are not binding, it is unlikely the leadership would press ahead with any which are roundly rejected.

Lib Dems would guarantee to extend the 15 hours a week of free childcare, currently available to two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, to all two-year-olds by the end of the parliament in 2020 - with the ambition of achieving it within one or two years
