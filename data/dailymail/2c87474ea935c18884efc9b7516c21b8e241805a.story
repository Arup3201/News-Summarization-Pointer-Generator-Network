A male model accused of beating up his girlfriend for sleeping with a stranger at a sex party is 'paying the price for rejecting her', a court heard today.

Patrick Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of repeatedly hitting Wachiraporn Sara-Pod in the face during their two-hour journey home from the 'Killing Kittens' event in London's West End, leaving her  struggling to see.

But Ribbsaeter denied he was responsible for causing her injuries and said she was making up the accusation out of spite, claiming that he had no reason to be angry with her

He told the court: 'It was a sex party, everyone's having sex everywhere with everyone. I had nothing to be angry about.'

Defence: Patrick Ribbsaeter (left) told the Old Bailey that he only slapped Wachiraporn Sara-Pod (right) because she was 'wasted' on drugs

Miss Sara-Pod claims she was forced 
to jump out of the car wearing only a fur coat after he told her: 'I'm 
going to hit you until you cannot remember your name.'

The Old Bailey heard the Thai woman 
was hardly able to see out of one eye and had a blood streaming down her
face when she sought help from a mechanic.

But Ribbsaeter  claimed they must have been inflicted by two men Miss Sara-Pod went with to another party in Forest Hill south London.

He told jurors: 'She was doing coke in the car and she wanted to go to the party. I didn't feel like partying.

'I go to eat something at a chicken 
shop in the same area and then go back home. They seemed like normal 
guys, party people like you might see clubbing.'

Ribbsaeter described Miss Sara-Pod's claims that he hit her repeatedly in the back of his car as 'complete lies'.

'I feel sad for her, what happened to her. I would never do that to her.'

Asked why she would make it up, he 
said: 'I don't know why she is so angry. My lifestyle, I was around with
girls, sometimes when I go to my events if I don't invite her she 
questions me.

'If I do she gets angry asking who is this girl. She's very very possessive.'

On trial: Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of beating his girlfriend repeatedly, forcing her to flee her car wearing just a fur coat

Ribbsaeter said he told one of their mutual friends that he wanted to break up with Miss Sara-Pod.

'I just said I don't want anything to
do with her, it's finished. I feel sad for her but I can't do things I 
want to, she's possessive, it's affecting what I do, my work. We have 
been on and off, this time that's it.'

Prosecutor Camilla De Silva said in her closing speech that Ribbsaeter's story of the two men was 'unbelievable'.

She told the jury he made up the story in a bid to 'cover his tracks'.

'The two men are a fiction. We say 
you can be sure that Miss Sara-Pod is an honest witness. You might think
she was a young vulnerable woman in love with Mr Ribbsaeter.

'She spent her whole time trying to placate him. What happened was he assaulted her.

'She has been punched and beaten repeatedly for about three hours by her boyfriend. '

Ribbsaeter's defence barrister Safora Syed suggested that he had been falsely accused by Miss Sara-Pod.

'Hell hath no fury like a woman 
scorned is a saying that has applies to this case. She was very angry 
and she was very jealous and she could not control her emotions.

'Today Mr Ribbsaeter is paying the price for rejecting Miss Sara-Pod by sitting in the dock.

'She is feeling rejected, deprived of the attention she desperate wanted from him, of course she is going to be angry. '

In cross-examination Ribbsaeter 
admitted he had repeatedly lied to police during his first interview 
when he claimed he went home in a taxi without his girlfriend.

He said: 'That's because I'm not allowed to drive, I'm disqualified to drive.'

But Ribbsaeter said he did not have any problem with his girlfriend having sex with someone else at the event.

But
he told the court he was 'surprised' that she sent him a text message 
asking where he was and saying she would have sex with someone if he did
not turn up.

Evidence: Patrick Ribbsaeter, pictured in a 2006 promotion for animal rights organisation PETA with a model unrelated to the case, told the court he lived life 'in the fast lane'

Ribbsaeter
said: ‘I go to look for her on the fourth floor. I wanted to use the 
toilet and I hear a girl, I could recognise the voice, it sounded like 
Anna.

‘A man opened the door and he was standing there in his boxers, with his pants down. Anna was leaning against the wall.

‘I was worried because I see her, she was wasted, she was gone. I took her out to the sofa.’

Ribbsaeter
left her there and went to the British Luxury Club in Mayfair with a 
friend but arranged to meet his girlfriend back at the car in Chinatown 
later that morning.

He said: ‘She was very hyper. She slapped me in the face and said “Why did you leave me at the party?”

‘I told her “Get a hold of yourself” and I slapped her. It was not like to hurt her, it was like get a grip.

‘She stumbled back. I said “Anna get a grip on yourself” and slapped her... It’s hard to explain what she’s like on cocaine.’

Ribbsaeter admits that he slapped his girlfriend twice when she became hysterical in the car park in Chinatown at around 6.30am.

'She was very high on cocaine, she 
was wired. She punched me. I did not assault her. I tried to shake her 
up, I just tried to get her attention.'

Two men who saw the slap and ran over to punch Ribbsaeter in the face, the court heard.

‘I was upset she had put me in this situation,’ he added.

Ribbsaeter, of Streatham, south London, denies grievous bodily harm.

The judge, Richard Hone QC, told the jury he would sum up the evidence and send them out to consider their verdict on Monday.
