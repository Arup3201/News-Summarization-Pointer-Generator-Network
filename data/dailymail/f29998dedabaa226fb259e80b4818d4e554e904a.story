Google is set to to launch an online streaming music service later this year to take on Spotify, it has been claimed.

The move is also seen as a pre-emptive strike on Apple, which is also believed to be working on a music streaming service.

Negotiations for the Google service have been underway for several months and it will launch later this year, according to reports.

The new Google service would compete with Spotify (pictured) which offers a free service with ads alongside a £9.99 per month ad free service

'Negotiations are under way with major record labels to license their music' Bloomberg claimed.

'Google, which also owns the YouTube video website, is also discussing renewing deals that cover the use of songs in videos made by consumers,' Bloomberg's sources claimed.

The service could expand on Google's existing cloud-based music service, which launched in 2011 to compete directly with Apple's 
iTunes, which commands more than 60 per cent of all digital sales.

Last year, 
the service expanded to the UK, Germany and other European markets, and 
today a new iPad version of the app needed to access files was launched in the UK.

The app allows customers to play or 
download music stored in Cloud Player to their iPad, play music that is 
already stored on their device, and manage or create playlists.

'We introduced our Cloud Player app 
for iPhone and iPod touch last summer and it’s been incredibly popular 
with our customers so we’ve now expanded it to iPad,' said Steve Boom, 
Vice President of Digital Music for Amazon.

'Our goal is to make Cloud Player the
most widely compatible cloud playback solution available, giving our 
customers the ability to buy their music once and enjoy it everywhere.'

However, a streaming version would make the service much more appealing to the milliom users who activate Android handsets every day.

Francis Keeling, global head of digital business at Universal Music Group, said Google's scale could make a streaming product a huge success.

Speaking in London at the launch of 
industry body IFPI's annual report on Tuesday, Keeling told the Guardian: 'We talk 
about subscription services, the need to have a funnel.

'Google, with
its hundreds of millions of users through search, YouTube with its more
than 800 million users, arguably is the biggest funnel we could have.

'Clearly if we could get consumers 
into a legal funnel through that route and encourage them to 
subscription, that would have a very positive impact on the business.'

Google's biggest rival would be Spotify, the Swedish service which lists five million paying subscribers and 20 million users of its ad-supported service in 17 countries.

Deezer, Rdio and Spotify all offer a free, ad-supported service alongside a £9.99-a-month subscription for premium users.

The area is seen as the future of the music industry, and is expected to have contributed more than ten per cent of the music industry's digital revenue for the first time in 2012, while the number of paying subscribers surged by 44 per cent last year to 20 million people globally.
