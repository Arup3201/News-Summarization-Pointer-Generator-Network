There's a new game this year called the 'Selfie Olympics' and after three days, it's already become an internet sensation among teenagers and those who are young and careless at heart.

Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter users are asked to join in the game of making the most dangerous and outlandish selfie ever and to then post it on social media.

Business Insider reports that a facebook page created this morning already has 30,000 likes. There are over 28,000 pictures on Instragram already, and the selfie game is trending on twitter.

The photos display anything from a girl riskily hanging by the door from her shirt snapping a selfie, to an older man with six-pack abs taking a photo without his shirt.

One popular selfie olympics photo teenagers are taking displays the photographer throwing an i-phone or i-pad into the air to take a selfie mid-flight--hopefully not pre-break.

Selfie daredevils have gone as far as to do a headstand in the sink or even somehow levitate in the air.

Previous photo trends have included 'Planking' in 2011 and 'Vadering' in 2013, reports the website Voxxie. The 'Selfie Olympics' seem to be the most dangerous social media trend yet.
