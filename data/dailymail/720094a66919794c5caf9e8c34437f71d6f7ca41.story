The son of Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has 
pleaded guilty to burglary and breaking into cars in Colorado under a 
deferred judgment agreement.

Jedediah
 Fox-Udall, 26, entered his plea Thursday and was sentenced to four years 
of supervision.

If he stays out of trouble and meets the terms of his 
supervision, including paying restitution, the case will be dismissed 
and he will not be convicted.

The Colorado senator's son was arrested in January after he was accused of breaking into a home 
and cars in Eldorado Springs in Boulder County.

At the time, 
investigators say he admitted using heroin in the previous two days. He 
later enrolled in an addiction treatment program.

Fox-Udall pleaded guilty to two felonies — burglary and auto trespass.

'I fully accept responsibility for my actions,' Fox-Udall said in a statement after his sentencing. 'I am deeply sorry for the toll they have taken on the individuals impacted in this incident, and my family and friends.

'I am continuing to work on learning from my mistakes and will put in the work going forward that is necessary and required of me. I am committed to putting my life back into healthy balance.'

Prosecutors say deferred judgments are common for people who commit non-violent crimes.

Deputies say after they arrested Fox-Udall January 30, he told them he had recently used heroin, but prosecutors say no heroin was found and he wasn't charged with drug possession.

His lawyer, Alex Garlin, said during a hearing in February that Fox-Udall was 'dedicated to turning his life around.'

'Maggie and I are deeply distressed to learn of our son's arrest,’ Sen. Mark Udall said in a statement to the Boulder Daily Camera following the arrest.

‘We love our son and stand with him in his commitment to getting the treatment he needs. We appreciate the private space to deal with this as a family.’

Udall is a Democrat from Colorado who represented the region in the House of Representatives before winning his Senate seat in 2008.

Senator Udall is running for re-election this year.

Last July, Senator Udall's brother James 'Randy' Udall, 61, was found dead after a hiking trip in Pinedale, Wyoming.

The Udalls have a long, illustrious history as politicians in Western states.

The Senator’s cousin Tom Udall is the senior U.S. Senator from New Mexico and cousin Gordon Smith was a U.S. Senator from Oregon until 2008.

His uncle, Stewart Udall, was Interior secretary in the 1960s. His father was the late U.S. Rep. Morris ‘Mo’ Udall of Arizona.
