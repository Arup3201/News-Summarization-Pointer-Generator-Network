When Laura Dekker set sail on a solo trip around the world at just 14 years of age, some critics thought she would die trying.

But the teenager, who was born on a boat in New Zealand, had the last laugh when she became the youngest person to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe in 2012 at just 16. 

Ms Dekker managed to brave 518 days of high and wild seas, long weeks of solitude, many sleepless nights and a number of wildlife encounters, including flying fish and a lone seal that decided to set up camp on her deck.

Her long-haul journey on board the 12-metre yacht named Guppy was documented and Ms Dekker has now published her daily account of life at sea two years after her feat.

Ms Dekker, who comes from a sailing enthusiast family and has lived on a boat for all but one year of her life, started mapping out her route across the world when she was just 10 years old.

She bravely sailed the English Channel alone when she was 13 and decided she was going to sail around the world immediately after. 

But her ambitious task didn't come without hurdles, despite the support of her parents.

After word got out of her plans, Ms Dekker landed herself in the custody of Dutch child services, which sparked numerous court cases and global debate about parental responsibility.

During her 518 day trek, Ms Dekker repeatedly anchored at ports along the way to sleep, study and repair her sail boat

Remarkably, she said the court cases and dealing with harsh critics before she set off was actually tougher to handle than sailing around the world.

'I’m capable of sailing, I've been doing it for years. It's very natural to me. I only lived in a house on land for one year of my whole life... the rest I've lived on a boat,' Ms Dekker told Daily Mail Australia.

'I just wanted to sail but my dream became very well known – that was not my intention, so it made it difficult.'

During her 518 day trek, Ms Dekker repeatedly anchored at ports along the way to sleep, study and repair her sail boat.

She had two birthdays during her long haul adventure, including her 16th which she celebrated by eating donuts in Darwin with a balloon decorated boat.

She was given her first boat when she turned six and she hasn't stopped sailing on her own since

'I was very happy to be doing what I loved. I met a lot of people along the way. There were of course moments where I missed my parents and friends, but not enough to turn around,' she said. 

'The weather really decided what my day was going to be like. If it’s rough you’re really busy, but if it’s calm you have more free time... I did home schooling on the trip.

'Whatever you do it’s like doing it on a rollercoaster so I waited for it to be quiet to make food. 

'I slept whenever I could. I had to keep checking on things and there are other boats out there… so I could only sleep for an hour at a time.'

Ms Dekker concluded her global journey at Saint Maarten in the Caribbean in January 2012.

Just a week after she finished, the then 16-year-old decided to sail across the world again to her birthplace of New Zealand. 

'It wasn't about proving people wrong or being the youngest… It was my trip and I just wanted to do it. I didn’t really care about what people thought,' she said. 

Now two years later, Ms Dekker still lives on board her boat in the marina at Whangarei, north of Auckland. 

She spends her time giving motivational speeches across the world about her adventure and ferrying boats to various destinations. 

Ms Dekker, now 19, hasn't ruled out another around the world trip. 

Australia's Jessica Watson completed a 210-day solo voyage when she was 16, a few months older than Ms Dekker.

One Girl, One Dream by Laura Dekker is available now online or in stores for $24.99.
