David Cameron and Ed Miliband are being told to ‘wake up’ to public anger over uncontrolled migration following Ukip’s stunning by-election advances.

Nigel Farage’s party caused a political earthquake by seizing one Tory safe seat and coming within a few hundred votes of taking another from Labour.

Conservative MPs warned the Prime Minister that he must now harden his stance on free movement within the European Union.

There have been calls for David Cameron to break up the coalition early and make a pact with Ukip at the next election, while Jack Straw told Ed Miliband he has a 'lot more' to do

Nigel Farage was celebrating the election of their first MP yesterday after Douglas Carswell was elected in Clacton with a majority of 12,404, larger than the one he achieved under the Conservatives

Some also called for pacts with Ukip at next year’s general election and an early break-up of the coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

The shock results raised further questions about Mr Miliband’s leadership of the Labour Party. Jack Straw said he should do a ‘lot more’ and take a stronger stance on immigration to win back traditional voters.

Frank Field, another Labour ex-minister, warned the party’s core vote had been so neglected that even supposedly safe seats could be lost next May. 

On a day of extraordinary political drama:

Early yesterday, Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories over the summer, became Ukip’s first elected MP, cruising to victory in Clacton, Essex, with nearly 60 per cent of the vote.

His majority of 12,404 was higher than he achieved as a Tory in 2010, with the Conservatives in second on 8,709 votes, Labour in third and the Greens pushing the Lib Dems into fifth. 

In Heywood and Middleton, Labour suffered embarrassment when, after a recount, Ukip came within 617 votes of defeating its candidate Liz McInnes.

Despite posing for pictures together, there were signs of an early rift between Farage and Carswell, after the Ukip leader called for people with HIV to be banned from entering the UK, and the new MP refused to back him

Mr Farage, who celebrated the results by staying out drinking until 4.45am, declared Ukip was now a national party.

‘We could find ourselves next May in a position where we hold the balance of power,’ he claimed.

Mr Cameron said the general election would be the most important in a generation. ‘If you see a big Ukip vote, what you will end up with is Ed Miliband as PM, Ed Balls as Chancellor, Labour in power,’ the Prime Minister said.

Mr Straw said his party had ‘to do a lot more’ to convince ordinary voters ‘that we’re on their side’. He added: ‘There’s also this critical issue of immigration.’

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, increasingly tipped as a replacement for Mr Miliband, insisted the results had not been a ‘disaster’ for Labour.

Liz McInnes hailed yesterday's win in Heywood and Middleton as a victory for Ed Miliband's policies despite coming within 617 votes of defeat after Ukip asked for a recount

But he added: ‘There is more we need to do to listen to people who are voting Ukip, particularly on immigration. I can’t defend on the doorstep, and actually I haven’t tried, the sending back of benefits to people who come to work here.

‘It doesn’t meet most people’s test of basic fairness, you know, that you haven’t contributed but then you can take out.’

Veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh said Mr Cameron should collapse the coalition with the Lib Dems and set out clearer ‘red lines’ for a proposed renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU.

A Populus poll last night put the Tories on 34 per cent, Labour on 35, Ukip on 13 and the Lib Dems up one on nine.
