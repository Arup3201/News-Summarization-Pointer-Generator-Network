It is as close as you will come in Brazil to an Argentinian receiving a compliment.

Lance! — the nation’s leading sports newspaper — wanted to reflect the supreme performance of Leo Messi against Nigeria last week.

‘From another planet!’ read its headline before listing, in order, the footballers it thought worthy of that accolade.

Out of this world: Messi has made a blistering start to this World Cup, with four goals in three group games

Holy trinity: Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona honoured by Argentina fans who compare the pair to Gods

No 1 was Pele; No 2 Garrincha; No 3 Romario; No 4 Ronaldo (the Brazilian one); No 5 Maradona; No 6 Messi.

‘And before long Messi will overtake Maradona as the greatest Argentinian of all time,’ it went on. ‘As for overtaking the others, well that’s just too much!’

But Messi knows — and all of Brazil, even with their love for Neymar, knows — that this is his World Cup.

The tens of thousands of Argentinians who are colonising Brazil this month, camping out in their cars on Copacabana or overwhelming Porto Alegre, are all anticipating it.

Everyone senses it. Video footage emerged of Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama jokingly berating Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli at half-time for giving Messi too many fouls.

Magician: Maradona led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup and is still regarded more highly than Messi

God amongst men: If Argentina triumph in Brazil Messi may start to compare to the legend of Maradona

‘I know your job is difficult,’ says Rizzoli and Enyeama rolls his eyes and says: ‘He’s so good!’

Never has a World Cup been so accommodating for Messi.

‘In 2006 and 2010 we already knew he had enormous talent, but he was still young and had to mature,’ said Javier Zanetti, the former Inter right-back.

‘In the last three to four years he has grown a lot and is now the captain and takes more responsibility. It seems that this will be Leo’s World Cup.’

For now, Messi has to defer to the original great of Argentina. In Brazil, Argentina fans parade a banner that depicts Maradona, the Pope and Messi; all three are considered national icons but only one is referred to on the banner as ‘God’ and it’s not the man from St Peter’s, nor the man from Barcelona.

And for some of the old school, the quietness, the modesty of Messi wil never compare with the charisma that surrounded Maradona.

Responsibility: Becoming captain seems to have raised the Barcelona star's game in international football

Supported: Messi is the centre of the Argentina team, but needs them to provide him a solid base to shine

Hector Enrique, part of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup-winning team and an assistant in 2010 when Maradona managed Messi and the national team, said: ‘Messi does not have anything on Maradona.

'I love Messi and I would be happy if my son had one per cent of his ability, but Maradona was unique.

'There will never be anyone like him again, not even if Messi wins three World Cups in succession or scores a bicycle kick from midfield.’

And there has been an equivocation about Messi in Argentina in the past. After all, he left for Europe when he was just 13 and so has spent more of his life in Barcelona than in his homeland.

The fact he couldn’t replicate his Barca form with the national side has been held against him. He had to fight against those who claimed he didn’t care for his country as much as his club. The subtext was: ‘Unlike Maradona.’

The situation reached a nadir when Argentina hosted the 2011 Copa America, played poorly and were knocked out by Uruguay on penalties.

Double delight: A sumptuous free-kick made Messi the joint top scorer in the group stages in Brazil

Messi was asked why he didn’t sing the national anthem, the malicious explanation being that he didn’t know the words, and was whistled by the home crowd, prompting his father, Jorge, to speak of the ‘terrible pressure’ his son endured playing for his country.

That has dissipated in recent years, though Jorge Valdano, another 1986 winner, touched on the darker elements of a nation placing so much faith in an individual.

‘As in politics, in Argentina we are always looking for one man to save us,’ wrote Valdano in his newspaper column.

‘If Argentina win the World Cup, the people will crown him with laurels. Otherwise, they will put a crown of thorns on him.’

That said, from the moment he announced himself at the World Cup with his goal at the Maracana, to his last-minute strike to salvage a win against Iran and his utter domination of the game against Nigeria, it has seemed likely he would lead an otherwise under-performing Argentina side to the final.

Inspiration: Messi's performances have silenced critics who said he could not perform on the world stage

Switzerland stand in their way on Tuesday and after that, should they win, a potential quarter-final against Belgium or the USA and then a possible semi against Holland.

His team-mates are in little doubt as to his importance. ‘Messi is the best in the world — there is no question about that,’ said Angel di Maria.

‘When I am an old man I will tell my grandchildren bedtimes stories about when I won the Champions League and hopefully about when I won the World Cup.

'But most of all I will tell them that their grandfather used to play with Lionel Messi — that is an indication of how special he is.

‘The problem is that when Argentina or Barcelona doesn’t play well, the press think it is easy to blame Messi.’

Surrounded: No defence has yet managed to shackle the Argetinian star, and Switzerland have a tough ask

Right now, this is not an issue. He is absolutely rising to the occasion; it is his team-mates who have yet to impress.

Defensively they have looked shocking. ‘He cannot win every game alone,’ said former Argentina forward Claudio Caniggia. ‘He needs the team to defend.’

But if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast, then perhaps Messi can lead them to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.

Then he might even knock Romario and Ronaldo off that Brazilian list; not Garrincha and Pele though — that really would be too much.
