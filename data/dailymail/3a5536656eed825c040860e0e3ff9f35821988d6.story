A judge has rejected claims by former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega that a depiction of him in a hit video game which portrays him as a murderous, psychopathic traitor, had 'harmed his reputation'.

In the 2012 game Call of Duty Black Ops II, Noriega is seen shooting his own soldiers at random and helping the CIA capture a Nicaraguan drug lord before switching sides.

He also is referred to in the game as 'old pineapple face' which is an actual nickname used by Panamanians.

The 80-year-old,   currently serving a jail sentence in Panama for crimes  including murder, filed the suit from prison  claiming he is portrayed as 'a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state'.

He  filed suit in July claiming Call of Duty's maker Activision had infringed his right to his own publicity, and sought unspecified damages.

Noriega said in court documents that he was unaware that his image was being used in the game until his grandchildren played it and asked him about it.

But Judge William Fahey of Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed the suit and granted  Activision's special motion to strike the case under a
California statute that seeks to prevent lawsuits stifling free
speech.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who represented Activision said: 'This was an absurd lawsuit from the very beginning and we're gratified that in the end, a notorious criminal didn't win.'

Mr Giuliani had argued that Noriega's status as a public figure in the 1980s prevented him from suing over his inclusion in the game which earned more than $1 billion in sales within 15 days of its release.

Activision which has featured historical figures such as President John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro in previous 'Call of Duty' games said the use of the character was protected under the right to free speech.

Judge Fahey agreed saying: 'Given the world-wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists.'

He said Noriega's right of publicity was outweighed by the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression, and that there was no evidence of harm to Noriega's reputation. 

 Activision had warned that if Noriega prevailed, it would have a chilling effect on movies and works of art that portray historical and political figures.

'Today's ruling is a victory for the 40 million dedicated members of our "Call of Duty" community and global audiences who enjoy historical fiction across all works of art,' Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard's CEO wrote in a statement. 

Noriega was the military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989 when he was toppled  by a U.S. invasion. He served a 17-year drug trafficking sentence in the United States.

The part of the game in which he helps capture the drug lord is thought to refer to a time in the 1980s when he was a paid CIA informant.  

Following his release in 2010 he was 
extradited to France to serve a sentence there. France then sent
him to Panama, where he remains in prison for crimes committed
during his rule.

He has had health issues in recent months and has been treated for high blood pressure, flu and bronchitis. His family said he has a benign brain tumor and heart trouble.

Noriega is not the only public figure to sue a video game company. 

Actress Lindsay Lohan has filed a lawsuit against the creators of Grand Theft Auto V arguing they used her image for a character named Lacey Jonas without her permission.

 The star's lookalike alter-ego parties at infamous celebrity haunt, the Hotel Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, 'a place where the plaintiff once lived and often frequents', according to the case documents.

The legal papers claim the 'game features a mission where the plaintiff's look-alike asks another character to take her home and escape the paparazzi' and features a character sporting the same ' likeness, clothing, outfits, clothing line products, ensemble in the form of hats, hair style, sunglasses, jean shorts worn by [Lohan]...before the release of the GTA V video game.'

The video game cover also strikingly resembles a famous picture of Lindsay in a swimsuit taking a selfie and making a peace sign.
