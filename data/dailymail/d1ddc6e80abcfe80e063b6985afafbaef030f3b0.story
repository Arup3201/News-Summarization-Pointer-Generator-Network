It could be the ultimate day out for cookery programme fans everywhere.

The BBC Television Centre is to be transformed into a village based on popular shows that have been made at the building for the last 53 years.

Possibilities for the £1bn project include a Great British Bake-Off Bakery and a Hairy Bikers restaurant.

Development: The BBC'S historic Television Centre will be transformed into flats, offices and a hotel as part of a £200 million deal, it was announced today. This is an artist's impression of how Television Centre will look

Changes: As part of the deal, the BBC will continue making programmes in three studios at the west London site. This artist's impression shows an aerial view of the development

Attractions could also be based on Fawlty Towers and Blue Peter, according to the Daily Telegraph.
The broadcaster wants entertainment-themed ideas, the developer Stanhope confirmed to the paper.

Not only could there be an 
entertainment-themed village, but it will also be transformed into 
flats, offices and a hotel as part of a £200 million deal, it was 
announced today.

Details of the plan show that the forecourt of the building in west London will be opened up to 
the public, and its inner ring - part of the main circular building known
to generations of BBC employees as 'the doughnut' - will become a hotel
and apartments.

Other buildings on the 14-acre site will be converted into offices and houses.

As part of the deal, the BBC will continue making programmes in three studios at the west London site.

Plans: The BBC originally announced in 2007 that it wanted to sell the building, which opened in 1960. This is how Television Centre looks today

Studios One, Two and Three will be 
refitted and continue to be used by the BBC and the site will be home to
the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.

David
Camp, chief executive of developers Stanhope, said: 'The BBC will 
continue to have a significant presence at Television Centre and we will
be bringing new life into the site with new public routes, spaces and 
uses.

'We will be 
introducing a vibrant and exciting mix of new retail, leisure, office 
and residential uses whilst keeping and enhancing the famous original 
BBC buildings and retaining key operational BBC studio and office 
facilities on site.

'Television Centre will be a great place to live, work and visit.'

The BBC originally announced in 2007 that it wanted to sell the building and some parts are Grade II listed.

Television Centre was officially opened on June 29, 1960 and it swiftly became one of the most recognisable facilities of its type.

It is the second oldest operating television studio in the UK after Granada Studios in Manchester.

The majority of the BBC's national TV and radio news output comes from Television Centre. Most of the recorded television output comes from the nearby Broadcast Centre.

Among the shows recorded there are Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Blue Peter, Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing.
