Four was the magic number for Manchester City today with their star striker Sergio Aguero scoring all his side's goals in their 4-1 victory over Spurs today. 

But it was also a prominent number for referee Jon Moss who awarded four penalties in today’s game. 

The last time that many spot-kicks were awarded was back in the 1999-2000 season when a quartet of penalties featured in a frantic contest during Bradford City's frantic 4-4 draw with Derby County. 

PENALTY NO 1 - SERGIO AGUERO SCORES (2-1)

With the scores tied at 1-1 apiece after Aguero's early strike and Christian Eriksen's unstoppable equaliser, City midfielder Frank Lampard is brought down by Erik Lamela and Moss awards his first spot-kick of the day. Aguero steps up to make it 2-1.

TV replays show defender Federico Fazio tugging on the striker's shirt as he attempts to get to the ball. Referee Moss has no hesitation in pointing to the spot.
