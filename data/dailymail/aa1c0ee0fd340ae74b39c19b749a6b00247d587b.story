Diego Costa followed in Radamel Falcao’s footsteps at Atletico Madrid; now the tables are turned in the Premier League, and this time it’s the Colombian who has it all to prove.

When Falcao joined Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 Costa was on his way out of the club. He had done well enough the season before as a back-up for Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero but Atletico had four non EU players, one had to leave, and Diego Simeone had reluctantly decided it had to be Costa. 

The player agreed to move to Turkish side Besiktas, only to suffer a cruciate ligament injury in his right knee in pre-season which ruled him out for six months and stopped the switch to Turkey.

When he returned to full-fitness in January Falcao was already well on the way to writing himself into Atletico Madrid’s record books and Costa was packed off to relegation-threatened Rayo Vallecano on loan for the second half of the season.

He shocked both his loan club and his parent club by coming back so strongly from such a long lay-off scoring 10 goals in the second half of the season and playing an important part of Rayo’s last day of the season great escape.

He was welcomed back by Atletico but he was still only Corporal Costa marching behind Field Marshall Falcao. At the start of the season Costa watched from the bench as an unused substitute, as Falcao scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 European Super Cup win over Chelsea.

Goalscorer: Falcao scored 52 league goals in 68 games during his time at Atletico Madrid

Cristiano Ronaldo (31 goals in 30 games, 82 minutes per goal)

Lionel Messi (28 goals in 31 games, 89 minutes per goal)

Sergio Aguero (17 goals in 23 games, 91 minutes per goal)

Luis Suarez (31 goals in 33 games, 96 minutes per goal)

Diego Costa (27 goals in 35 games, 110 minutes per goal)

Robin van Persie (12 goals in 21 games, 132 minutes per goal)

Robert Lewandowski (20 goals in in 33 games, 140 minutes per goal)

Falcao (Nine goals in 17 games, 155 minutes per goal)

Thomas Muller (13 goals in 31 games, 167 minutes per goal)

Neymar (Nine goals in 26 games, 193 minutes per goal)

Despite that performance from Falcao in 2012, and despite the fact that Costa watched it from the bench, it was to be Costa and not Falcao that Jose Mourinho would opt for two years later despite having his pick of the pair as he went in search of a new Chelsea centre-forward.

His decision was based in part on Costa’s over-all game; his work off the ball; his durability – all qualities that he was to show over the next two seasons, first with Falcao alongside him, and then as his replacement.

Costa gradually edged his way into the team alongside Falcao in the 2012-13 season – running the channels either side of the penalty box predator. The two formed a good partnership with many of the 34 goals Falcao scored that season coming from Costa assists, but in the 2013 Spanish Cup final, roles were reversed as Falcao played the pass and Costa applied the deadly finish that helped Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid.

It was a reminder to Atletico Madrid’s directors that with Falcao leaving at the end of the season bound for Monaco, Costa had enough about him to fill the Colombian’s boots.

The following season, finally out of Falcao’s shadow, Costa’s goals didn’t take Atletico Madrid to the King’s Cup final; instead they took them to the European Cup final and to the league title. 

Most supporters would now say he was the better of the two strikers – not quite as good in the air as Manchester United’s new number nine but just as prolific in front of goal and with a greater all-round game. Falcao now has the chance to prove those supporters and Mourinho wrong.

The two forwards are in very good company these days – there was no Di Maria, Mata and Rooney at Atletico Madrid for Falcao; and there was no Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and Oscar at the Vicente Calderon for Costa. Both can emulate previous Atletico Madrid centre-forwards, Fernando Torres and Sergio Aguero, and steal the show this season in the Premier League.

Quiet, introverted men away from the pitch their relationship in Madrid was a largely football one. There will be a lot more to talk about when they meet again on Sunday October 26 – both before and after they have set-about each other’s team’s defences.
