Have you ever fantasised about owning the perfect capsule wardrobe? I do. Every season.

In my fantasy wardrobe, all the items not only suit me perfectly, but suit each other perfectly, too. They can be worn in any combination, each resulting in a polished, stylish look.

But it would cost a fortune to chuck out all your mis-matched fashion mistakes and start over, wouldn't it?

Well, actually, no. As the battle for 'non-food sales' between the big-name supermarkets gets ever more intense, so their affordable fashion offerings go from strength to strength.

So I set myself a challenge. Could I assemble the perfect capsule wardrobe for autumn - including shoes and accessories - from only supermarket ranges?

And could I do so by spending no more than I would on my weekly food shop for a family of four, £150? The results might surprise you...

The look: A sweater and trousers under a camel wrap-coat fits perfectly with this autumn's trend for all things ladylike.

Why did I pick it? The sandals and sweater can easily be replaced with ankle boots and a polo neck (which you may already own) once winter sets in.

Supermarket strengths: F&F is the strongest supermarket for knitwear. This camel number I picked out is sleek and doesn’t look prone to sagging or bobbling.

Wow factor: My girlfriends love this look - two of them have already ordered the coat.

Styling Tip: Supermarket coats and jackets are sometimes let down by cheap buttons or belt buckles, so pick a style like this with as few fastenings as possible.

The look: Leather is big this autumn, as is off-white - so this outfit ticked two boxes.

Why did I pick it? The blouse can be swapped for the camel sweater, and the sandals for boots if you have some, when it gets colder.

Supermarket strengths: F&F does skirts extremely well, and is also strong on footwear. These sandals are surprisingly wearable.

Wow factor: The skirt provoked a mixed reaction among my friends - some felt leather should be left alone by the  over-25s - but I love it.

Styling Tips: The skirt is 'pleather'(plastic leather), but is that a bad thing? Real leather skirts and trousers tend to bag around the knees and the bottom.

The look: High-end designers sent a myriad of prints down catwalks for autumn/winter 2013. Super-markets have picked up the trend.

Why did I pick it? I particularly like the fabric of this dress, which sucks in my body in all the right places. Although it’s only £25, its fabric feels far more expensive.

Supermarket strengths: F&F is the strongest brand for dresses when it comes to fabric and fit.

Wow factor: My husband was a fan of this dress (no surprises there), but he said the skirt was rather long (no surprises there, either!).

Styling Tip: Although this one has thick fabric, supermarket dresses can feel flimsy. If this is the case, go up a size from your usual fitting — the extra fabric will give a more luxurious feel.

The look: I love this Audrey Hepburn vibe - I wore it on a night out with some fashion-forward girlfriends who wear high-end High Street or designer clothes. And I didn't feel in the slightest bit self-conscious.

Why did I pick it? A special thank you to Asda for producing a pair of tailored trousers that aren't several yards too long (at 5ft 3in, I often struggle with unwanted trouser fabric).

Supermarket strengths: George does the best trousers for shorter women.

Wow factor: My girlfriends quizzed me relentlessly about the provenance of my outfit. Their final guess was Reiss - they were stunned when I revealed that every item was from a supermarket.

Styling Tips: If you choose a boxy-shaped blouse (as opposed to a longer one or something with a ducktail back), then you can wear it tucked in, too.

The look: This is my First Lady outfit. I’m channelling Michelle Obama — after all, she understands the ladylike trend better than most.

Why did I pick it? There’s a big trend for capes at the moment, so why not try draping your coat to achieve the same effect?

Supermarket strengths: Tu at Sainsbury’s is very strong for coats. I picked out this wrap-coat for my capsule wardrobe but was also tempted by a monochrome cocoon coat (a key shape this autumn).

Wow factor: This look was a hit with male and female friends. It’s sexy but sophisticated.

Styling Tip:  When buying a coat from a supermarket, it’s worth sitting down in it and then looking at the back before you buy it. Some of the cheaper fabrics are very prone to creasing.
