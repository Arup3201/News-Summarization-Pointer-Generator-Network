The BBC quite literally burned through £20,000-worth of candles during the filming of its hit period drama Wolf Hall.

Hi-tech cameras meant director Peter Kosminsky could film the BBC2 show without using traditional studio lighting.

He told the Royal Television Society's magazine Television: 'With the Arri Alexa camera, for the first time on television it has become possible to shoot exclusively by candlelight.

'Some scenes were shot with just one candle.'

Mood lighting: High-tech cameras meant the BBC2 drama Wolf Hall could be filmed simply by candles, which ended up costing over £20,000 and enraging some viewers

The lack of lighting has not impressed every viewer with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell tweeting: 'Not entirely persuaded by the lighting strategy.'

While comedian Jason Manford wrote: 'Trying to watch Wolf Hall but can't see a fecking thing!'

The series based on Hilary Mantel's award-winning novels stars Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII.

Kosminsky also revealed his conversations with corporation bosses over his desire to air the show on BBC1, because he was worried it would not attract enough people on its sister channel.

He told the magazine: 'I am glad it is on BBC2. When we first started submitting the rushes there was a discussion, at a fairly high level within the BBC, about whether the show should move to BBC1.

'I argued with the producers that this would be a mistake. It wouldn't meet the slot average and therefore the BBC would be put on the defensive.

'Transmitting it on BBC1 would open it to illegitimate criticism because it is aimed at a thoughtful audience and one prepared to give things a bit more time.' 

All about the numbers: Wolf Hall's director Peter Kosminsky also reveled he initially wanted the show to be aired on BBC1, because he was worried it would not attract as many viewers on its sister channel

Not happy: Mr Kosminsky said: 'I argued with the producers that this would be a mistake. It wouldn't meet the slot average and therefore the BBC would be put on the defensive'

The six-part series which began on BBC2 last month is based on Hilary Mantel’s Booker-winning novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.

Featuring more than 100 characters, the shows is rumoured to have cost £7million and attempted to be the most historically accurate depiction of the 16th Century ever filmed.

The Tudor drama became BBC2's most successful new series for a decade after attracting around four million viewers for the opening episode.

It charts the rise of Thomas Cromwell from butcher’s son to the highest echelons of Henry’s VIII’s court in the 1530s when he became the King’s chief adviser.
