Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Eddie Clein said some poor families find the money for gadgets but not food

People who use food banks would rather spend their money on iPhones than feeding their families, a former city Lord Mayor has claimed.

Lib Dem Eddie Clein accused people in Liverpool of always having money for the ‘non-necessities of life’ but then struggled to put meals on the table.

The comments sparked a fresh row about why poor families turn to food banks, after Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested they have only their own bad financial ‘decisions’.

More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities.

Mr Clein, a former councillor for four decades and ex-Lord Mayor of Liverpool, said that those struggling financial still found the money for expensive gadgets.

The pharmacist told BBC Radio Merseyside: ‘I go to some of these homes, I do prescriptions for them ... and what makes me feel uncomfortable is they’re all standing their with their iPhones.

‘This is what Michael Gove was talking about. They don’t seem to have a shortage of money for the non-necessities of life, but when it comes to choosing whether to put food on the table or buy some stuff to make some meals ... I don’t know.’

He later added: ‘What I can’t come to terms with is that I see so many people who are claiming poverty, and may well be using food banks, who are standing their using an iPhone, even when you are talking to them.’

But the remarks were condemned by Labour MPs in the city. Luciana Berger said: ‘Eddie Clein’s comments are an absolute disgrace.

‘I have visited several food banks in Liverpool and across the country and had many conversations with people who’ve been forced to turn to them.

‘I vehemently disagree with Eddie Clein that food bank users are making a lifestyle choice. No-one goes into a food bank with their head held high.’

Row: Labour MP Luciana Berger has challenged criticism of people who use food banks, including Education Secretary Michael Gove who blamed bad financial 'decisions'

Walton MP Steve Rotheram added: ‘How does he know people haven’t been given these iPhones as Christmas or birthday presents. He’s incredible.’

A furious political row erupted this week after Tory Education Secretary Mr Gove argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’.

Speaking in the Commons he said: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.

‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.

‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband condemned the minister as an ‘absolute disgrace’.
