Families have seen their energy bills soar by 55 per cent in a decade, despite them cutting the amount of gas and electricity they use by almost a fifth.

Rising prices from the Big Six suppliers have seen inflation-busting rises every year since 2002, squeezing incomes particularly since the 2007 crash.

Ministers have repeatedly urged households to reduce their consumption to cut bills, but the Office for National Statistics said the increase in spending is ‘explained solely by rises in energy prices’.

How average monthly spend on energy rose by 55 per cent in a decade, but usage has fallen by 17 per cent

In 2012 families spent £106 each month on energy, up 55 per cent from £69 in 2002.

At the same time energy usage has dropped by 17 per cent, the ONS said.

An ONS report on Household Energy Spending said: ‘UK households spent an average of £106 a month on household energy in 2012. This was a 55 per cent rise on the 2002 monthly spend, after accounting for inflation. This is despite a decline in average energy usage.

‘Over this same time period, household energy use has fallen. The average amount of energy used per household was 17 per cent lower in 2012 than in 2002. This means the increase in the average amount households are spending is explained solely by rises in energy prices.’

Households in Northern Ireland pay substantially more

Overall Scottish households have the highest energy costs in Britain.

The ONS said average spend in Scottish homes is £112 a month, compared with £105 in Wales and £103 in England.

But all three nations are substantially lower than Northern Ireland, where the average household spend is £154 a month.

ONS said: ‘The higher average spend in Northern Ireland may be partly explained by the different nature and size of the energy market there.

‘Across the rest of the UK, any differences in the average energy spend are very small. The average monthly spend in Scotland is slightly higher than in England and Wales, consistent with DECC figures on energy consumption per household.’

Spending on electricity is up 43 per cent in a decade and 56 per cent for gas

Percentage of household disposable income spent on energy

The ONS figures come on the day Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess announced a £60 million fund to cut fuel poverty.

Councils will each get a share of £42 million from the fund for this work, with the remaining £18 million made available to local authorities to develop large-scale schemes.
