Close: Twins are said to have a special connection from birth. The five sets at Crosthwaite primary are good friends

A Cumbria primary school with only 61 pupils now has five sets of twins in attendance.

The small village school near Kendal hit double figures when three-year-old identical twins started in their first year of nursery.

This year, one sixth of the school's student body is a twin.

Harry and Reuben Fife, 3 are the youngest twins at the school and 10-year-old Chloe and Sophie Richards are the oldest.

The sets of twins include one girl/boy pair, Hannah and William Jefferson.

With two sets of girls and two sets of boys, the twins at Crosthwaite primary school are evenly split.

Early years teacher Sophie Burn said the school's newest twins have been welcomed into the school, which is well-versed in dealing with twins.

She said: 'Their mum always dresses Harry in green, and Reuben in red, so we can tell them apart.

'They love it and are quite set on which colour is theirs, and what they like.

'It seems a lot easier for twins starting here to settle because they have a friend right from the start.'

Staff said they could not remember so many sets of twins at the school, which has just 61 pupils across all its year groups and nursery.

Year 1 and 2 teacher Paul Johnson teaches two sets of twins- six-year-old Autumn and Kestral Platts and brothers Luca and Dylan Read, 7.

He said: 'Even the unidentical ones look very similar, and it can be hard to see which is which when they are apart.

'They all have completely different personalities though.'

Telling them apart: There are a surprising number of twins at such a small school. (Left to Right: Chloe and Sophie Richards; Hannah and William Jefferson; Autumn and Kestral Platts; Harry and Reuben Fife; Luca and Dylan Reed)

Firm friends: Teachers at Crosthwaite primary in Kendal, Cumbria say the twins have an easier time settling in to school because they have a companion from the start

Julia Porter, a teaching assistant who has been at the school for almost 20 years said she is amazed by the phenomenon.

She said: 'We have had twins through before, but not as many as this.

'All of the families are from quite a small area around the school, with one set from the top of Kendal.

'What's lovely is all the sets of twins get on really well with each other.'
