She's a poster girl for curvy women and even launched a clothing collection catering for fuller-figured women last year, but Kelly Brook is embarking on a New Year's diet.

The model and TV star has announced that she is following the New Atkins Nutritional Approach to help her 'get fit and feel great' after a hectic 2014.

The 35-year-old, who is the new ambassador for the diet, is apparently starting the low-carb programme to curb her sweet tooth and lose a few pounds.

Kelly Brook has been unveiled as the ambassador for the New Atkins Nutritional Approach to help her get fit

Speaking about her decision, Kelly, who is reportedly house-hunting in North England to be closer to on-again beau David McIntosh, said: '2014 was a crazy year; I don’t feel like I’ve been able to focus on me or maintain a healthy diet.

'On the set of my new TV show, it was really easy to reach for the naughty treats, so I’ve noticed the changes in my body.

'I’m guilty of having at least five cups of tea a day with two sugars in, that’s 10 spoons of sugar every day, just in my tea. I’ve also had a brilliant Christmas but I have over-indulged a little, which I’m sure many people can relate to.'

Kelly, who has been soaking up the New Year sun in Australia over the last week with David, continued: 'In the new year I'm determined to carry on with my training at the gym and will be following New Atkins to boost my energy levels while helping me slim down.

'I’m looking to lose a few pounds, but a more important goal for me is staying fit and healthy without having to deprive myself.'

Kelly says she is following this approach because she believes it is really about cutting down on the bad things, like sugar and starchy carbs, while still enjoying tasty foods like chicken, fish, fibrous vegetables and red fruits.
