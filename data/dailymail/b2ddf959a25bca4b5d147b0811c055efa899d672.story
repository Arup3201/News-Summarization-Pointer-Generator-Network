 A quarter of pensioners paying for residential care will end up losing their home and almost all their savings, a report warned yesterday.

As many as 40,000 people who fund their own fees will see their assets so depleted they will have to fall back on the mercy of their local council.

Many of them will face the trauma of being moved to a lower-quality home. Care firms may even pressure children to find cash so their parents can stay in the home they feel familiar in.

Some self-funders will be forced to take lesser quality accommodation as a result of the pressures

The vulnerable may also be told to move into a smaller room or share.

The findings, by the Local Government Information Unit, lay bare the scandal of elderly people who have saved all their lives losing almost everything at the very end, and leaving them little to pass on to their children.

Experts warn that the ageing population, coupled with council cuts, mean the number of people losing everything will increase – unless the Coalition caps the amount individuals need to contribute to their own care.

Ros Altmann, of over-50s group Saga, said: 'It is outrageous that we are in a position, in our advanced economy, where we can't say to someone that – no matter how much you have paid, no matter how much you have saved – we can guarantee you will be able to stay in the same place to get the care you need.'

A year in a home costs an average of £27,000. Self-funders typically spend four years in residential care, with 12 per cent staying there for eight years.

The elderly must fund the full cost if they have more than £23,250 in assets – including the value of their home.

A council will step in to help pay only when assets fall to the £23,250 level. At £14,000, it will fund the full costs.

Ministers say that although they agree in principle with the idea of a cap, proposed last year by economist Andrew Dilnot, there isn't enough money in Treasury coffers to fund the £1.7billion annual cost.

Jonathan Carr-West, of the LGIU, said: 'It is not a good situation to be in when you run out of cash, you have nothing to leave to your family, and you end up in a situation where the council – and not you – are making decisions on your care.

'You could find you've depleted your assets and suddenly you are living somewhere else. If you run out of money you will not necessarily be able to stay in your home.'

Chris Horlick, of insurance firm Partnership, which worked on the report with the LGIU, said the huge costs are alarming for lifelong savers. 'They've lost everything – everything they've worked for,' he said.

'Ultimately they lose their dignity, they lose any choice over where they can live. This is a devastating position for anyone to be in.'

The report – Independent Ageing: Council Support for Care Self-funders – warns of the threat to town halls of the increasing number of people falling back on the state for care when their resources are depleted.

Outrageous: Many self-funders have no one else to turn to and risk becoming fully dependent on the state

It is estimated that some 171,000 of the 419,000 residents of care homes are self-funders.

A survey of more than 100 councils, carried out by the LGIU think tank, and a series of detailed interviews with some of them, found that around 25 per cent of those who fund their own care end up relying on the state.

This would equate to almost 43,000. It warned councils they will have to find around £500million to fund those who fall back on the state.

'The cost of self-funders running out of money is considerable,' it said.

'These costs are real and immediate.

'Individuals are often unaware that if they run out of funds, and fall back on state provision, they may have to move to cheaper care facilities.'

Mr Horlick said he knew of a woman in Kent who was paying £1,000 a week for residential care. But her local authority will pay only £470 a week.

'The company wouldn't need too many such cases for the care home to become marginal in terms of profitability,' he said.

'The lady doesn't have any family – if she runs out, that's it.'
