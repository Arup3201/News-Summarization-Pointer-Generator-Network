Floyd Mayweather has hit back at Amir Khan after he claimed that the American's hotly anticipated fight with Manny Pacquiao could turn out to be 'boring' and 'dull'.

Khan has criticised Mayweather's decision to finally fight Pacquiao instead of taking him on, describing the 38-year-old's choice as 'the easy route'.

He also took aim at the timing of the fight, stating that it should have when both boxers were in top condition and not getting towards the end of their careers.

Khan told The Sun: 'The thing is when they were both at their peak - which was six years ago - this fight was talked about then and it should have happened then.

'That's when it would have been a great fight because they were both explosive. They were both at their peak and the fight would have been massive. They both seemed unbeatable back then.

'Six years later Manny Pacquiao has had two defeats and been knocked out. Mayweather has had some good fights but he is getting old and he's showing signs of ageing now. He is getting caught a lot more frequently.

'For me, this fight isn't going to be as explosive or as good as it would have been five or six years ago. Who knows, styles make fights.

'They're both very experienced but it could turn out to be a boring fight because there is just so much expectation on it.'

But Mayweather has disputed Khan's claims, instead promising that the Las Vegas bout on May 2 will live up to the hype.

'I am touched that Amir is concerned about the fight, and that it might be boring for the fans,' said Mayweather. 

'He doesn't need to worry, the fact this has taken so long to happen only makes the anticipation and build up of the fight that much greater. 

'I can even get him a ticket if he wants - so he can see what the biggest fight in the history of boxing looks like - and to appease any fears he might have about a boring fight.'

Khan claims he was close to agreeing fights with both Mayweather and Pacquiao, but the unbeaten American believes the boxing world was not interested in seeing himself or Pacquiao take on the Bolton-born fighter.

'Of course he wanted to fight me, of course he wanted to fight Manny, I get that, I really do,' added Mayweather. 

'The reality is that this is only fight the public were demanding and we had no choice but to give it to them. 

'The world was not calling for Mayweather vs Khan or Pacquiao vs Khan. He knows that, he is a smart kid. He knows this fight had to happen.

'He (Amir) is a good fighter, I've got a lot of time for what he does in the ring. He is going to get big fights I am sure of that, but nothing or nobody was going to stand in the way of this fight - we are going to make history.'
