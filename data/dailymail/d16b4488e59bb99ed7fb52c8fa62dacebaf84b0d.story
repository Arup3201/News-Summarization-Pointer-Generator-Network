Ex-Minnesota Vikings 
punter Chris Kluwe has said he is ‘pretty confident’ that he was cut 
from the team last May for being an out-spoken advocate for same-sex 
marriage.

Kluwe has also
 accused Vikings coach Mike Priefer - currently a contender to 
become the team’s next head coach - of being a bigot who repeatedly used
 homophobic language in front him and told him he would ‘wind up burning 
in hell with the gays.’

The
 player, whose playing stats were above average, believes his 
problems began in the fall of 2012 when he started to speak out against 
the Minnesota Gay Marriage Amendment which attempted to have marriage 
defined as ‘only a union of one man and one woman.’

Along with a group called Minnesotans for Marriage Equality, Kluwe helped have the amendment voted down. Same-sex marriage is now legal in Minnesota, but Kluwe says he lost his career because of his beliefs.

He
 has written a scathing account of his final months at the Vikings in an
 article posted to Deadspin entitled I Was An NFL Player Until I Was 
Fired By Two Cowards And A Bigot.

He
 savages several of his coaches, but saves his worst criticism for 
special teams coordinator Mike Priefer, who he claims would use anti-gay
 slurs around him and unfairly criticize his performance.

‘It’s
 my belief, based on everything that happened over the course of 2012, 
that I was fired by Mike Priefer, a bigot who didn’t agree with the 
cause I was working for, and two cowards, [head coach] Leslie Frazier 
and [general manager] Rick Spielman, both of whom knew I was a good 
punter and would remain a good punter for the foreseeable future, as my 
numbers over my eight-year career had shown, but who lacked the 
fortitude to disagree with Mike Priefer on a touchy subject matter,’ he 
writes.

During his final season as a Vikings player, Chris Kluwe was an outspoken advocate for same-sex marriage

Kluwe cites one example where Priefer told him in front of his teammates that 'We 
should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it 
until it glows.'

He 
continued: ‘Mike Priefer also said on multiple occasions that I would 
wind up burning in hell with the gays, and that the only truth was Jesus
 Christ and the Bible.

'He said all this in a semi-joking tone, and I 
responded in kind, as I felt a yelling match with my coach over human 
rights would greatly diminish my chances of remaining employed.’

Kluwe
 also claims that Priefer instructed him to start kicking shorter punts 
with more hangtime because his coverage team was so slow. When Kluwe 
followed those instructions, Priefer gave him negative scores in his 
evaluation.

Kluwe, who 
acknowledged that his revelations would mean he will never get another 
NFL job, said his motivation was ‘to make sure 
that Mike Priefer never holds a coaching position again in the NFL, and 
ideally never coaches at any level.’

Cowards: Kluwe has also spoken out against General Manager Rick Spielman, left, and Leslie Frazier, right, who was fired as head coach on Monday

The
 Vikings sacked head coach Frazier at the end of 2012 after they 
failed to make the play-offs and Priefer has been described as 'the only
 in-house candidate with a chance' at the head-coaching job by Pioneer 
Press.

‘It's inexcusable
 that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to 
proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance, and I hope he 
never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone 
else,’ wrote Kluwe.

The Vikings have previously denied cutting Kluwe for off-field reasons. Last June, Priefer refused to go into specifics about Kluwe’s release, 
but said he felt 'very strongly' that the Vikings needed to part ways 
with the punter.

'It was
 more consistency and productivity,' Priefer said in a response to a 
question about what factors, statistical or otherwise, contributed to 
the decision.

Asked if Kluwe could have improved his production, Priefer said simply, 'I just felt like we needed to make a change there.'

Kluwe did make the point that team owner Zygi Wilf had voiced his support for Kluwe’s public stance.
