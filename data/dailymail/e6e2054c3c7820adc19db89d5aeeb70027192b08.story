He has already received a string of accolades for his portrayal of Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

But it seems an Oscar nomination is the icing on the cake – for Eddie Redmayne’s mother, at least.

As the British star was announced as a contender for the Best Actor gong yesterday, his ecstatic mother Patricia, 65, admitted she ‘hadn’t dared hope’ her son would be acknowledged by the world’s biggest film awards.

She said: ‘We’re absolutely delighted and over the moon with the news.

‘I found out this afternoon and I had some champagne with some friends to celebrate. I think there are so many great actors out there at the moment, I think he has done so well to be nominated. I’ve spoken to him on the phone and he is just very, very excited.’

Speaking outside her home in Chelsea, she added: ‘I think it was an extraordinary film and after a time watching it I forgot it was Eddie. I just thought it was Stephen Hawking.

His mother said the family were over the moon with the nomination and Redmayne, pictured wife Hannah Bagshawe attend the 2015 InStyle And Warner Bros. 72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards Post-Party, admitted he felt 'pretty damn good' when he was announced as a contender

‘He’s a performer and has been ever since he was five and he first started singing at school. I remember at his 21st birthday one of his friends gave a speech saying they were looking forward to seeing him at the Oscars. He’s coming home soon, and I think we will all be going out for a meal to celebrate.’

Eton-educated Redmayne, 33, is joined in the running for this year’s Academy Awards by a host of other British stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, 38, Felicity Jones, 31, and Rosamund Pike, 35, who are all celebrating their first Oscar nominations, and Keira Knightley, 29, who was nominated in 2006 for her part in Pride and Prejudice.

Miss Knightley will battle it out in the Best Supporting Actress category with Hollywood legend Meryl Streep – who was yesterday celebrating her 19th Oscar nomination. 

The 65-year-old, who has taken home three Academy Awards, now holds the record as the most Oscar-nominated actress.

Meanwhile, Cumberbatch will be up against Redmayne in the Best Actor category at next month’s ceremony. The Sherlock star has been nominated for playing codebreaker Alan Turing in The Imitation Game.

Cumberbatch said telling his parents about his nomination was ‘one of the proudest moments of my life’, adding: ‘I am knocked for six by this. So excited and honoured to receive this recognition. 

'It’s wonderful to be included by the Academy in this exceptional year of performances.’

Redmayne said: ‘[An Oscar nomination is] not something you take for granted … I feel pretty damn good.’
