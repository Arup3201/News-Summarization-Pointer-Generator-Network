Everton are closing in on the signing of Bosnia international Muhamed Besic in a deal rising to £4million.

Midfielder Besic, who plays for Hungarian side Ferencvaros, has been training with the Toffees and was spotted dining in Liverpool city centre on Wednesday.

Swansea have also bid for the 21-year-old but the player prefers a move to Everton.
