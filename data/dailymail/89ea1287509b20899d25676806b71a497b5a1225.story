Harry Redknapp has admitted that QPR have been more solid recently when Rio Ferdinand has been out of the team. 

Ferdinand is available again to the QPR manager after serving a three-match ban for using the word 'sket' on twitter, which also cost him a £25,000 fine, and the defender hopes to return to the starting lineup for Saturday's match at home to fellow strugglers Leicester. 

The former Manchester United and England man was left on the bench for the R's matches against Liverpool and Aston Villa before missing games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle.

And his manager admits that Ferdinand has struggled to adapt to life at Loftus Road and that the R's have looked better defensively in his absence.

'It's been difficult,' Redknapp said. 'He's come from a team used to winning every week and everything to a team out of the championship and has found it more difficult. 

'So it's a more difficult period. Maybe he wasn't getting an awful lot of protection in the early games either. Him, Steven Caulker, whoever played at the back – it wasn't just Rio. They found it difficult in them early in them early games. I think we've looked more solid recently but no, I've got no problems with Rio.'

Ferdinand has been carrying a knock recently which he should shake off for the visit of the Foxes and if he does then Redknapp insists he has nothing to prove. 

He added: 'Rio is hopefully going to be fit. We'll have a look and assess hit fitness and see how he is but Rio doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, he's been a fantastic player for so many years so there's no problem, he's not one that I have to worry about.' 

Redknapp has been dealt a blow with the news Sandro will be out until 2015 after injuring his medial knee ligaments in the 1-0 defeat at Newcastle last weekend, and he revealed that the Brazilian midfielder could have been out for a year having viewed the incident a slow-motion replay of the incident.

Redknapp added: 'It could have been a real damaging one for him and could have put him out for a year. That is a big blow to us, losing him until after the Christmas period. 

'He took a bad bang on his knee. We looked the video of it and it could have been even worse. 

'The bang he took on that knee, it could have been an awful lot worse, and his knee must have been very strong to take that. It is not easy for him but he has got to come back stronger.
