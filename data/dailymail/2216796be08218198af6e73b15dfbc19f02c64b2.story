They went with high hopes of a medal, but at the very least came back with hearts of gold.

Moved by the desperate plight of Russia's stray dogs, a number of athletes at this year's Winter Olympics returned home with a little extra in their possession - a very grateful puppy or two.

It was as issue that tugged on the heartstrings almost as soon as they arrived in Sochi.

'It brought me to tears seeing men put the dogs in the trucks,' said Kelli Stack, who won silver as a forward on the U.S. women's hockey team.

Tugged on his heartstrings: U.S. skier Gus Kenworthy with two of the three dogs he rescued - Jake (left) and Mishka - from Sochi after he found them huddling for shelter near the slopes where he was competing

'They were so friendly, it just broke your heart': Former bobsledder Amanda Bird with the puppy she named Sochi who she rescued with the help of actress Katherine Heigl

Former bobsledder Amanda Bird also found herself overcome with emotion.

'As soon as you left the airport, there were stray dogs everywhere,' said Bird, who is now the director of marketing and communications for the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation.

'They were so friendly, it just broke your heart.'

Such was the shame these dogs had placed on the Russian government, some
 4,000 strays were killed by 
officials in the run-up to the Games, according to the Companion Animals and Engagement division of Humane Society 
International.

But the Olympians were determined to do what they could to save at least some of them.

Fate: Snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis felt she was destined to take her puppy home with her after the dog she would later name Sochi jumped on her snowboard bag as she headed out of her hotel

Stack found her five-month-old German Shepherd at a nearby shelter.

She has named her Shayba - after the ice rink in Sochi where she competed. Bird named hers Sochi, appropriately, she told the New York Post.

Meanwhile, snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis felt she was destined to take her puppy home with her.

She
 was heading out of her hotel one day when she said the dog 'jumped onto
 my snowboard bag and I was suddenly wheeling him to the door!'

Puppy love: Gus Kenworthy with four strays he found sheltering under a tent in Sochi. One of them sadly died, but was was able to bring three back to the U.S. with him

She kept the dog that she would later 
name Sochi - and his Chihuahua friend - in the bathroom of her hotel 
room which provided a 'nice distraction' to the stress of competition.

But like
 many of the athletes, skier Gus Kenworthy encountered a host of 
obstacles when trying to get his dogs back home in the United States.

He fell in love with four dogs sheltering under a security tent near the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center where he was competing.

'They were literally the cutest puppies I’ve ever seen,' said the 22-year-old.

Joy: Lindsey Jacobellis with her rescued puppy Sochi who she says is '30lbs and has more energy than ever'

Moved to tears: Kelli Stack, who won silver as a forward on the U.S. women's hockey team, adopted Shayba — named after the rink in Sochi where she competed

But Kenworthy said officials forced him to put them in a government facility where conditions were 'horrific' when he made his intentions known about taking them back with him.

After a month-long battle with the help of his photographer friend Robin Macdonald, the government eventually caved in and after wading through a 'bunch of red tape' the puppies were released.

One of them sadly died before they left the country after suffering aggressive seizures.

But two others - Mishka and Jake - are now at home with Kenworthy in Denver and the other is with his mother.
