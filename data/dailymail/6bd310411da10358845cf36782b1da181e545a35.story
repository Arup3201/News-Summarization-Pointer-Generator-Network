Fears have been raised over safety at the 2014 Brazil World Cup after a British oil worker was shot dead in an attempted carjacking.

Scot Peter Campsie, 48, was killed by two gunmen in Rio de Janeiro as he returned home to his family following a business meeting.

The operations manager for Diamond Offshore Drilling International was shot twice as he tried to flee his Lexus on Wednesday, it has been reported.

His death comes just three months before the start of the World Cup tournament - and as officials desperately try to reassure the world they will host a safe competition.

Mr Campsie moved to the country 16 years ago from Scotland where the rest of his family live

Mr Campsie, from Montrose, Angus, had worked in Brazil for 16 years and lived in the city of Macae, north of Rio, with his wife and 10-year-old daughter.

He is survived by two sons and his mother, brother and sister in Scotland.

In a family statement to the Press & Journal, they said: 'He was a man who loved life and and brought so much joy and laughter to those around him.

'Wherever Pete went, the good times 
followed. A darkness has fallen on us all as we try and make sense of 
why Pete had to die in the prime of his life.

'He was a loyal friend and father, 
brother and son who cared deeply about making sure everyone got the best
 out of their lives. Our anchor has been pulled away so cruelly.'
