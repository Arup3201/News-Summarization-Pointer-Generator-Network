Britain's first pay-as-you-go motorway is proving to be a flop with traffic dropping by 40 percent in just seven years.

The head of the region's local transport authority says the M6 toll road which runs through the West Midlands, has not relieved congestion on the motorway around Birmingham.

Geoff Inskip, chief executive of Centro, the West Midlands transport authority, called on the Government to take the M6 toll road out of private hands to ease congestion around Britain’s second largest city, after evidence emerged that traffic on the toll road has fallen since its peak of 55,000 vehicles a day in 2006.

Under used: the M6 Toll Road should be nationalised rather than expanding the original M6 to cope with the projected 25 per cent increase in traffic over the next 15 years, transport chief Geoff Inskip said

When the £900m road was completed ten years ago 
it was hoped the 27 mile stretch would relieve traffic congestion around 
Birmingham with around 74,000 vehicles predicted to use the road each 
day.

Currently, around little more than half – 34,360 - the number of vehicles expected to use the road each day actually do, with congestion costing the West Midlands economy £2 billion a year.

It was thought to be an ideal alternative to traffic jams for drivers, but when traffic is clear on the original M6, the cost deters motorists and the toll route is marginally longer than the free motorway.

Congestion around Birmingham has now become 
so bad that the Highways Agency has already begun work on converting the
hard shoulder of the original M6 motorway into a new lane in order to 
deal with the additional traffic.

Mr Inskip told The Independent: 'If the M6 Toll cannot 
be made to work in terms of attracting more vehicles off the M6 then one
solution is to take it into public ownership. This would give us the 
option of setting a level of charge that does encourage through 
traffic.'

Falling numbers: Traffic on the toll road has dropped by 45 per cent since 2006, it has been reported

Midland Expressway – a subsidiary of 
Macquarie Bank – which owns and operates the M6 toll road has blamed the
economic downturn for the fall in traffic on the road. 

But critics have also pointed to 
excessive charges to use the road.  It costs £5.50 for a car to use the 
27-mile stretch of motorway but for HGVs its costs double this amount.

Mr Inskip said that nine out of 10 lorries now use the original motorway.

'We believe this is due to the price 
hauliers and motorists are being asked to pay. It’s important we keep 
the region moving and one way of doing that is to get HGVs, which are 
not stopping in Birmingham, off the M6 and onto the toll road,' he said.

There have been eight price rises in the
ten years since the toll road opened in December 2003 when a car could 
travel on the road for just £2.

HGVs were charged £10 for use of 
the road before the charge fell to £6 the next year only for prices to begin rising again in 2005.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said:

'The problem is not private sector involvement but that ministers never insisted on regulated tolls. In a way, who can blame the operator? If they can maximise their income by having fewer cars paying more then why wouldn’t they? There’s less wear and tear on the road, and you need fewer staff and toll booths. Unfortunately what is good news for the company running the road is bad news for most drivers.'

The call to nationalise the road comes 
amid a debate on how to finance new road building in Britain, with tolls
being one option given consideration by the Coalition, although the 
Government has ruled this option out for existing roads. Plans to 
privatise the motorway network have also been shelved.

The M6 toll road's owner, Macquarie faces the additional problem 
of a £1billion debt burden associated with the road following a 
refinancing in 2006. The bank is currently in talks with its creditors 
to restructure the debt. 

In July, Midland Expressway is making 
the toll road free to use for all haulage vehicles in an effort to 
attract more hauliers to use it. The toll is due to remain in 
private hands until 2054 and the Department for Transport said the 
Government had no plans to nationalise the road before this.
