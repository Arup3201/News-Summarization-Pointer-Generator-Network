At the height of his career he was one of the most instantly recognisable figures in the music world, adored by fans and revelling in all the trappings of fame.

Now, ageing in a costly retirement home, he remembers his heyday by listening to the records that made him famous, while his carers try to fund his expensive stay.

But unlike other fallen popstars, Bubbles the chimp won't be attempting to make a comeback any time soon.

Memories: Bubbles is pictured clutching a picture of Michael Jackson and himself

Michael Jackson's loyal sidekick for more than a decade, the 27-year-old animal once accompanied the Thriller star to star-studded premieres and gigs.

He even starred in the promo video for Bad in 1987 and accompanied Jackson on his subsequent album tour of Japan, where he shared a cup of green tea with the then-mayor of Osaka.

Saved by Jackson from a Texas animal testing laboratory, Bubbles became one of the family, is said to have lived in a cot beside the Thriller star's bed and, according to Michael's sister La Toya, even ate at the family dining table.

He is even said to have learned to mimic the icon's famous moonwalk dance.

But less than four years after his master's death, lonely Bubbles sits in a Florida wildlife sanctuary passing the time watching television and snacking.

Sad: An ageing Bubbles has been all but forgotten by the Jackson family in the years after Michael's death

The common chimpanzee was not provided for in the popstar's will and sanctuary bosses at Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, his home since 2005, struggle to raise $13,000 dollars each year to pay for his care.

Only visitor: Michael Jackson's sister La Toya visited Bubbles at the wildlife sanctuary in 2010 while filming a documentary for Animal Planet

All but forgotten by the Jackson family, only La Toya Jackson has paid a visit to see him there as part of an Animal Planet documentary filmed in 2010.

She told the animal on camera that she missed her brother's former pet.

He originally had to move out of Jackson's Neverland ranch in 2003 because he became overly pugnacious sparking fears that he could hurt the popstar's newborn son Prince Michael.

He was initially cared for by Hollywood trainer Bob Dunn.

But Bubbles was moved again to the sanctuary, which cares for more than 40 other chimpanzees and orangutans, in 2005 and has remained there since.

None of Michael's children are said to have visited the animal.

A source at the sanctuary told The Sun: 'It is a world away from the life he once knew, but Bubbles seems all the happier for it. Itâ€™s just sad that no one visits.

'He is exceptionally well-looked after by the sanctuary but has effectively been abandoned by the Jacksons, despite their vast wealth.'

Bubbles was one of a number of exotic animals moved from Jackson's Neverland ranch to pastures new when he encountered financial difficulties.

But the pair's friendship was immortalised in three porcelain sculptures by Jeff Koons.

At the time of their production in 1988, the sculptures were each said to be worth around $250,000.

But when auctioned in 2001, one of the figures fetched a staggering $5.6million.
