A miracle cat survived a terrifying motorway journey after it became wedged inside the engine bay of a parked car. 

The black cat, who has now been nicknamed Lucky, crawled inside the engine of Maria Locher's blue Mazda while it was parked at Manchester Airport for the day.

Several hours later, when Ms Locher, who works at the airport, returned to the car, Lucky the cat was unable to extricate himself from his resting place and was carried for a 30-mile motorway journey at speeds of up to 60 miles-per-hour.

As Ms Locher approached her home in Stockport she could smell burning and when she opened up her bonnet she could hear Lucky the cat, top, meowing desperately for help 

Ms Locher was travelling home at the end of the day when she noticed a burning smell as she struggled to get the car into gear.

But when she pulled over and peered into the bonnet with her torch, she was amazed to hear a cat meowing for help.

Ms Locher said: 'The car had been parked up all day so I have no idea when the cat crawled in there, I certainly didn't see him before I got in.

'I noticed a smell of fire coming from the bonnet and when I stopped I got a torch and looked under my bonnet - that was when I heard the meowing. I'd been driving on the motorway so I think it's amazing Lucky is still alive.'

The RSCPA in Manchester is currently looking to reunite Lucky with his owner 

She called the RSPCA as soon as she spotted Lucky trapped near the engine, and Inspector Steve Wickham was sent to the rescue.

But Lucky had become so wedged in place that Mr Wickham could not coax him out. He decided the only way to rescue the moggy was to dismantle the car.

After calling various breakdown companies, Mr Wickham was finally forced to call the fire brigade, who were able to release Lucky.

Mr Wickham said: 'He was literally wedged in right at the back of the engine, and we were hoping that if we lifted the car we could just pull him out, but there wasn't enough room around the engine to grab him. 

'Green Watch fire team from Stockport came out and it took about two hours to eventually set him free. 

'I've since found out that Lucky did have some burns on his left hip which were operated on.'

Lucky is now being cared for at the RSPCA Greater Manchester General Hospital, who are looking to reunite him with his owners.

Mr Wickham added: 'He's a really friendly cat, and not what we call a feral, so if anyone recognises him call 03001238018.'

Lucky is currently being treated at the RSCPA's Greater Manchester Hosptial by nurse Laura Gorton, right
