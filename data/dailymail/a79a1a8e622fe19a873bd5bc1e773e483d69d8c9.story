Celebrities Katie Price and Amanda Holden have been given an 'ugly makeover' with a hilarious new phone app.

The UglyBooth is designed to give those iPhone users who are insecure about their looks a boost - by showing them how bad it could be.

Using a photograph, the programme rearranges the face to produce hilarious results.

Hilarious results: Katie Price pictured before, left, and after, right, the UglyBooth treatment

Ugly: The app has distorted Amanda Holden's perfect complexion and delicate button nose beyond recognition

Those with perfect complexion suddenly find they're covered in spots and dainty features are enlarged while the eyes are brought closer together.

In these hilarious pictures, glamour model Katie Price looks a far cry from her usual preened self.

And Peter Crouch certainly wouldn't have landed beautiful wife Abbey Clancy if he was really given this 'ugly' transformation.

Celebs Gordon Ramsay, Peter Andre, Darcey Bussell and Gemma Arterton also look almost unrecognisable in the shots.

And Formula One hunk Jenson Button would no doubt cringe if he caught sight of his 'ugly' self.

Even David Cameron, Nick Clegg and the Countess of Wessex have been given the 'ugly' treatment with the new app, which costs 69p.

Mashed up: Would Abbey Clancy gone for Peter Crouch if he looked like his UglyBooth equivalent?

Distorted: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay cares about his looks. He wouldn't want to see this

Spotty: Celeb hunk Peter Andre wouldn't get close to many mysterious girls looking like this

Clumsy: Would Darcy Bussell scaled the heights of ballet superstardom with a face like the one on the right?

Uglyfied: Gemma Arterton's model good looks have been completely destroyed by the app

Not so hunky now: Formula 1 hunk Jenson Button looks like a cartoon character after the UglyBooth treatment

The photo can be shared via text, email, Facebook or Twitter so you can share the makeover with friends - if you dare.

The app, which can also be downloaded on iPod touch and the iPad, comes from PiVi & Co, the makers of the popular FatBooth and AgingBooth.

Released on October 17, it is already proving popular.

One user, Eric Guzman, said: 'Hilarious. It makes even the best looking celebrities look hideous. LOL great app!'

A PiVi & Co spokesman said: 'The inspiration was to provide an easy to use app that let the user instantly have fun with it.

'We are the team behind AgingBooth and FatBooth.

'And, as with our other booths, simplicity of use and realism of the result were our top priority.'

They say politics is showbusiness for ugly people: But this makeover of David Cameron takes the biscuit

Eyes too close: Would anyone have voted for Nick Clegg's party if he looked like this?

Horrific: The Countess of Wessex has been distorted beyond recognition

Seen better days: Labour MP John Prescott is made to look worse
