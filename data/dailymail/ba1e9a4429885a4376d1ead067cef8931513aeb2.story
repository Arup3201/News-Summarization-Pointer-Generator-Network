Manchester City have announced they will expand the capacity of the Etihad Stadium to more than 55,000 - allowing them to sell even more season tickets for less than £300.

Seasoncards to watch the Premier League champions in the new seats will cost just £299, the cheapest price available to watch top-level football in England.

Three new rows of seats will be added to all four stands at the ground and on-site hospitality will also be improved.

Seating: Three rows are being added at pitch level around the ground to increase capacity

Increase: The South Stand is also having 6,000 seats installed during the project

Plans: Manchester City are proposing to add three additional pitch-level rows to the Etihad Stadium

Additional: City are already in the process of installing 6,000 more seats into the South Stand

Sky Blues' the limit: City's ground will become the third largest after Old Trafford and the Etihad

This will further increase the capacity 
alongside the already-announced 6,000 additional seats which are 
currently being installed into the South Stand and will make the Etihad 
the third largest stadium in the Premier League.

Only Manchester United's Old Trafford and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium will hold more.

Currently
 Newcastle United's St James' Park and Sunderland's Stadium of Light 
also have a bigger capacity than the Etihad, which holds 47,405 
supporters at present.

The work is due to be completed before the start of the 2015-16 season.

Tom
 Glick, City's chief commercial officer, said on the club's website: 'We
 have always been committed to bringing fans closer to Manchester City, 
to the players and to the pitch.

'Whether
 that's through digital innovation, community work, international tours,
 or as in this case, physically allowing fans to be right next to the 
action, it is our top priority.

'We are already looking forward to seeing the expanded stadium in action for the 15-16 season.'

Champions: City won the Premier League and League Cup last season and fans can get more cheap tickets

Glory: City manager Manuel Pellegrini led the club to their second Premier League title in three seasons

Celebrate: City players huddle together during the win against Aston Villa that all but secured the title

Premier 
League champions City, who were led to their second title in two seasons
 by manager Manuel Pellegrini, have also been granted planning 
permission to add an additional 6,000 seats to the North Stand in future
 if they choose to undertake a third stage of expansion.

This would eventually see the capacity rise to more than 61,000 if carried out.
