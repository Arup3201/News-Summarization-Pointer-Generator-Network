Amid all the fashion models and concept cars at the Paris motor show, Kia's new, third-generation Sorrento sports utility vehicle, brought a refreshing sense of reality.

Designed for families on the move who need space, the seven-seater promises improved ride, handling and crash safety and a higher quality interior and design. Kia says it features a higher level of sophistication than the present model.

The Korean company's European design team, based in Frankfurt, is behind the move upmarket. A spokesman says: 'A higher proportion of soft-touch materials and leather creates a modern luxury feel to the cabin and premium vehicle ambience.' Buyers will be offered a menu of safety technologies, including a lane departure warning system, which audibly alerts drivers who stray from the chosen lane without using indicators.

Amid all the fashion models and concept cars at the Paris motor show, Kia's new, third-generation Sorrento sports utility vehicle stood out

A blind-spot detection system flashes a warning in the door mirror when another car is in the driver's blind spot, and rear cross-traffic alert warns against other cars driving behind the vehicle in a car park.

There's also a feature once found only in limos — the speed limit is displayed on the dashboard console, constantly relayed from onboard cameras that read roadside signs.

Its second row of seats can split several ways and can slide away to allow easier access to the third. All passengers are promised more legroom and greater baggage space. There's also a 'smart' power tailgate. A spokesman says: 'This system opens the tailgate automatically when the key is sensed close to the boot, so owners can put shopping bags or heavy objects straight into the vehicle.' A new soundproofing material for the transmission tunnel and a 29 per cent thicker panel combine to help cut cabin noise by 3 to 6 per cent, depending on the driving conditions.

Three engines are available, including a 2.4-litre petrol direct injection (GDI) and two turbodiesel engines — two-litre and 2.2-litre.

However, UK models on sale next spring from around £40,000 will be available only with the 2.2 CRDi engine. The UK version has also been designed to give a softer ride over bumps to reduce the stress and possible discomfort on long journeys.

Kia is on a bit of a roll, enjoying its best ever September UK sales. It delivered 13,292 new cars, taking the total so far this year to 62,538 — more than 7 per cent up on 2013. It aims to surpass its 2014 target of 78,000.

Its biggest seller, the Sportage, had almost 3,500 buyers, followed by the Picanto, Cee'd, Rio and Venga. More than half of customers (56 per cent) are private buyers.

If you fancy a trip across the Channel, the Paris show runs until October 19. You'll need more than a day to see everything. Tickets start at €14 (£11). Go to: mondial-automobile.com.

The Countess of Wessex revealed she drives an F-Type Jaguar when she met its designer, Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, at a reception for the London Press Club Ball.

Even the roar of the engine appeals to her, she confided.

Jaguar Land Rover was the main automotive sponsor of the Ball, held this week at the Royal Courts of Justice, to raise funds for the Journalists' Charity.

One racy lady royal, clearly.

The wraps came off the new high-tech Mondeo in Paris.

It marks the debut of Ford's new technology which can detect people in the road ahead — or who could cross the vehicle's path — and applies the brakes automatically if the driver does not respond to warnings.

The pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection also aims to help reduce road deaths and serious injuries.

The new versions have the widest range of engines and gearboxes Ford has ever offered. Fuel-efficient auto start-stop technology is standard throughout the range.

The new Mondeo also introduces intelligent all-wheel drive to the range's line-up.

The new Hyundai hatchback i20 which the company describes as a 'truly European car'

A new hatchback from Hyundai turned a few heads in Paris.

The Korean firm said the new-generation i20, has evolved into 'a more premium-quality package'.

It's been designed, developed and built in Europe, and was billed as a 'truly European car' on its world premiere at the show. It will feature a frugal one-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine in 2015.

Allan Rushforth, senior vice-president and chief operating officer at Hyundai Europe, says: 'The i20 is a truly European car.

'Our one-litre engine follows the trend of small turbocharged engines, which provide great driving performance while being very efficient. It underlines Hyundai's commitment to sustainable mobility and gives an insight into our future innovations.'

AUDI unveiled a five-door prototype of its popular TT coupe. The TT Sportback, powered by a 395bhp two-litre engine.

Hands-free and driverless at nearly 150mph... are you mad? Well, Audi thinks it's not.

A driverless Audi RS7 Sportback is to tackle Germany's Hockenheim circuit at race speed next week to showcase the potential for self-driving car technology.
