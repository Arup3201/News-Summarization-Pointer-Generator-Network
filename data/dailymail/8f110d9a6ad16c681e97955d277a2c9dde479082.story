The alleged gunman believed to have killed eight people in a string of shootings throughout Edmonton, Canada before turning the gun on himself was described as 'depressed and overly emotional' by concerned family members just before the tragic murder-suicide.

Though the assailant has yet to be officially identified, it's believed that the man found dead in a restaurant at the end of the bloody day is 53-year-old Phu Lam. 

Edmonton Police Chief Ron Knecht spoke out about the tragic incident on Tuesday, saying police were called to a home, which appears to be owned by Lam, Monday evening after his family became concerned about his well being.

'According to the family, the male seemed depressed and overly emotional,' Knecht said. 'The family was concerned the male might be suicidal.' 

Monday, December 29

6.52pm: Officers respond to a 'weapons complaint' at a house in southern Edmonton and discover the body of 37-year-old Cyndi Duong.

8.28pm: An emergency call raises concerns for the welfare of a man - suspected to be Phu Lam, 53 - at a house in north Edmonton. He is seen 'depressed and overly emotional' and a family is concerned he may be suicidal. Neither he nor his vehicle is found, but they do not force their way into the house.

Tuesday, December 30

12.23am: Officers return to the same house after 'further investigation and significant disclosure by a second individual'. This time they do force their way inside and find seven bodies - three women, two men, and a boy and a girl both aged under ten - after apparent 'planned and deliberate' murders.

2.20am: Officers find black SUV that matched description of vehicle connected to first murder outside a Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, where the suspect has a 'business interest'.

8.45am: Officers establish man found dead in restaurant killed himself and was the man they had been looking for since the previous night.

Seeing nothing suspicious, police left the scene. But they were called back just four hours later and inside found the bodies of seven people - including two children. 

It's currently unknown whether the seven inside were dead when police first arrived.

Edmonton Police spokesman Scott Pattison spoke with Daily Mail Online on Wednesday, describing the officers' decision not to enter the home the first time as standard procedure for welfare checks.

Pattison says they receive sometimes hundreds of calls a day to check in on people whose family are concerned about them.

At the time of the first call, police had not yet connected the discovery of a body in the south of Edmonton to the welfare call at Lam's home in the north of town.

By the time they received a second call several hours later, they had more information leading them to suspect something happened inside that they couldn't see through the windows.

Pattison added that the bodies may have been dead inside the residence since Sunday, but that investigators are waiting on autopsy results to confirm the cause and time of death.

Those results may be in as early as New Year's Day.

'This series of events are not believed to be random acts and there is no risk to the broader public,' Knecht said. 'These events do not appear to be gang related but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.'

Knecht added that authorities are not looking for any other suspects, which suggests that the gunman responsible is likely the man they later found shot to death in a restaurant in the next town. 

Eight victims: Police in Edmonton, Alberta, investigate a home where seven bodies, two of them children, were found Tuesday morning after reports of a suicidal man

Inside: Detectives scour the inside of a building in nearby Fort Saskatchewan, where officers found the alleged killer dead Tuesday morning

The Toronto Sun reported that Lam is thought to be the man in question, and was known to police before.

Police were first called to an address in the south of the town, three hours north of Calgary in the Alberta province, following a weapons complaint Monday night. 

Inside, they found the body of  37-year-old Cyndi Duong, who had been shot dead after someone broke into her house, according to state broadcaster CBC. So far, Duong is the only victim who has been identified. 

It was after finding the gruesome scene that they were called to the home owned by Pham to the north of the city, on the request of his concerned family members. 

While the officers checked on the door, they did not find anything suspicious and left the residence.

But when they were called back to the home after midnight, they found an even more horrifying scene: seven people shot to death including three women, two men  and two children,a little girl and a little boy. 

Duong shared the home where she was found dead with David Luu, 41, according to property records viewed by the Edmonton Journal.

Further records reportedly showed the home where seven more bodies were found is owned by Phu Lam and a 35-year-old woman named as Thuy-Tien Truong.

According to the Journal, Truong was sued by the Royal Bank in 2013 and Lam filed a bankruptcy proposal in the same year.

Neighbours told the Journal a couple with two children - an eight-year-old named locally as Elvis and a toddler - lived in the house alongside an elderly woman.

Police later tracked down the suicidal man to a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, a town outside Edmonton, to which Lam has been linked.

Officers located a black Mercedes SUV Lam is thought to have been driving.

When they entered around 8.45am on Tuesday, the man was dead - apparently after killing himself.

Police say there is no further danger to the public.

Chief Knecht said: 'Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides.'

Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths.
