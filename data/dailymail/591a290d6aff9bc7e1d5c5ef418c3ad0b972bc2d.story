Tommy Gilbert Jr appeared bedraggled and downcast as he stood before a judge in his orange prison jumpsuit today to be indicted over the fatal shooting of  his multimillionaire father. 

The Princeton grad, with his hands cuffed behind his back, said nothing and nodded in response to the judge's questions during the short appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court during the last minutes of Friday afternoon's session. He did not enter a plea.

The 30-year-old, his 6-foot-3, broad frame hunched in a padded, Department of Corrections jacket, appeared unshaven and his blond, surfer locks unwashed.

He stood in court alongside defense attorney Alex Spiro, a Harvard-educated criminal  lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying Spiro's fee.

Gilbert Jr was being held without bail at Rikers Island while he awaits trial and is due back in court on February 5. The charges will be made public at that hearing.

A grand jury voted to indict him on Friday over the death of his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners.

The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online on Thursday that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. 

The death of Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70,  was ruled a homicide on Thursday after he suffered a gunshot wound to the head

An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide.

Gilbert Jr.'s lawyer, told reporters outside the court hearing: 'No statement in light of the recent tragedy and no comment from the family.'

Mr Spiro works for Brafman and Associates, one of New York's most prestigious criminal law firms. 

Benjamin Brafman, the founder of the firm, successfully defended Dominique Strauss-Kahn and - most recently civil rights lawyer Sanford Rubenstein. 

Mr Spiro has a Harvard law degree and worked for the CIA and as a New York Assistant District Attorney before going into private practice.  

Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head.

Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. 

Gilbert Jr. allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities.

Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there on Sunday night around 10.30pm. 

He was arrested on murder charges the following day.

Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home.

Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports.

The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. 

Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing.

He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire.

Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties.

But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton University with a degree in economics.

Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. 

Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital.  

His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father.

He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. 

Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said.

Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. 

When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. 

When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. 

His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed.
