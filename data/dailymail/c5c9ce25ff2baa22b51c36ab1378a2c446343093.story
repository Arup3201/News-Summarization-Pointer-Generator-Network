Most dogs hate having a bath but this canine has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid having one.

The clever Alsatian has learned how to shut the door to his kennel so his owner can't reach him when bathtime arrives.

This hilarious clip posted on YouTube shows the dog in action - repeatedly pulling his door-closing trick on his unsuspecting owner.

Time for a bath: A Russian dog owner attempts to call his reluctant Alsatian out of his kennel for a quick clean

The Alsatian is far from happy at the prospect of a bath, and promptly used his paw to claw his kennel door shut

The video, entitled 'dog does not want to bath' in Russian, shows a man with glasses trying to entice his dog out of a large wooden shed.

But the second he moves away, the quick-thinking canine raises his paw and claws a plank on the wooden door to pull it closed.

The dog then closes the door on his owner a further two times before he is eventually convinced to come out.

But when his owner grabs a metal bucket with water to wash him, the animal quicker scarpers back in to his kennel and promptly closes the door shut.

One more try: The dog's owner opens the kennel door again to try and entice his pet out

Thinking about it: The Alsatian ventures a little way out of his kennel as his own gives him a reassuring pat

His owner tries to tempt his dog out of his kennel once more - but this time the animal isn't falls, and shuts the door in his face once more.

The video has been viewed on Youtube more than 11,000 times.

Another, AliciaLouiseOhPlease, added: 'In soviet Russia dog locks you out!'

Retreat: But the second the dog catches sight of the metal bucket he flees back to the safety of the kennel
