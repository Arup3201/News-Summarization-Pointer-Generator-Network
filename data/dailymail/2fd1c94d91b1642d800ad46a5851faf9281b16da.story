Qantas has unveiled its new business suites featuring seats that allow customers to fully recline and sleep during take-off and landing.

The new seats will be available on A330 aircraft that fly domestically and to Asia and Hawaii.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, celebrity chef Neil Perry and Qantas ambassador Lindy Klim announced the changes at an event in Sydney on Tuesday, showcasing a mock-up of the new business class configuration.

Mr Joyce said the upgrade would improve more than 15 international and domestic routes.

'There's enough space to eat while continuing to work, which is something our business customers said was very important to them, and plenty of storage room to keep the range of electronic devices that people now travel with,' he said.

'A key point of difference from all other carriers is that the seat can be in recline and fitted with the mattress from take-off right through to landing.

'With many Business passengers enjoying a meal in the lounge prior to travelling, this means more time to rest and sleep.'

But the airline will have to wait for approval from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority before passengers will be able to lie down during take-off.

The suites, which have fully-flat beds and direct aisle access, were designed in collaboration with designer Marc Newson

CASA spokesman Peter Gibson said current rules require seats to be upright during take-off and landing.

'They've got to get an engineering approval for these seats which are a different type of seat,' Mr Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.

'They need special approval to be partially reclined.

'These seats are already approved and used in Europe, it's a matter of us reviewing the engineering data which is expected to be in time for them to launch this in December.'

The suites, which have fully-flat beds and direct aisle access, were designed in collaboration with designer Marc Newson.

Economy seats on international A330s are also getting an upgrade, with cabins set to be fitted with an updated model of the 'Recaro' seat, an earlier version of which is already installed on Qantas A380 and B747 aircraft.

Economy seats on the A330-200s for Qantas Domestic will also be refreshed.

Business and Economy seats on international A330 aircraft will also be fitted with Panasonic eX3 inflight entertainment systems, with larger seatback touchscreens and technology which allows Qantas entertainment content to be streamed to passengers' own devices.

The upgrades will take about one month per aircraft and will start at Qantas' heavy maintenance facility in Brisbane next month.

The first of the domestic refurbished A330 aircraft will fly in late December from the east coast to Perth, and the first international A330 will commence flying in January 2015, Qantas said.
