A public inquiry is to be held into the death of poisoned ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.

With tensions running high with Moscow over the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Ukraine, the UK government has given the go-ahead to a probe into whether the Russian state was behind Mr Litvinenko’s murder.

The former KGB officer died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 with two ex-colleagues at a London hotel.

His widow Marina said the move sent a powerful 'message to his murderers', but one Russian MP claimed it was driven entirely by 'political expediency'.

Just last year Home Secretary Theresa May ruled out a public inquiry in part because she wanted to protect ‘international relations’.

She insisted in July 2013 that an inquest led by a coroner was ‘more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners’.

Twelve months on, and following a legal defeat, the government has said an inquiry will start by July 31. 

Relations between Britain and Russia are now in the deep freeze, with David Cameron threatening ‘hard-hitting economic sanctions against Russia’ over the shooting down of flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board.

The Prime Minister insists the evidence is pointing in ‘one direction’ – that the plane was hit by an SA-11 missile since smuggled back across the border into Russia.

EU foreign ministers will today meet to discuss tougher sanctions against Russia for fuelling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

In a written statement to Parliament, Mrs May said she had now agreed to establish an inquiry and has written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling asking him to halt the inquest.

Coroner Sir Robert Owen, who had warned a public inquiry was needed because he could not consider vital secret evidence as part of a normal inquest, is to lead the inquiry.

Mrs May added: 'I am very grateful to Sir Robert for continuing to lead the independent judicial investigation into Mr Litvinenko’s death. 

'It is more than seven years since Mr Litvinenko’s death, and I very much hope that this inquiry will be of some comfort to his widow Mrs Litvinenko.'

The decision to press ahead with a public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko’s death will further pile pressure on Moscow.  

Under the Inquiries Act, Sir Robert will have the power to demand the production of witnesses and papers within UK jurisdiction, including agents and documents from the security and intelligence services.

However, he has no such powers in relation to evidence from Russia.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman insisted there was 'no link whatsoever' between the announcement of the inquiry and current tensions with Russia over its activities in Ukraine.

But Russian MP Andrey Lugovoy today accused Britain of a blatant political act in launching a public inquiry into the death.

Mr Lugovoy - wanted by Scotland Yard to face murder charges over the former FSB officer's death - accused Home Secretary Theresa May of 'cynicism, lies, treachery, baseness.

'This is the only way I can comment on the actions of the British establishment and the decision to hold a public inquiry into Litvinenko's death.'

The move was entirely one of 'political expediency', he claimed.

Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Llitvinenko, won a court battle forcing Home Secretary Theresa May to reconsider her opposition to a public inquiry

'Now due to the situation in the south-east of Ukraine, the West increases pressure on Russia, and personally on the head of state, Vladimir Putin.' Lugovoy has always denied playing any role in Litvinenko's death.

Putin has ruled out extraditing Lugovoy to face charges in Britain, citing a Russian constitutional ban.

Lugovoy - also a former secret services officer - recently called for the Russian intelligence agency to revert to its former name, the KGB. 

UK government officials have been in contact with the Russian Embassy in London before today's announcement.

Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006.

His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin.

Former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been identified as the prime suspects, but both deny any involvement and remain in Russia.

Since his death his widow Marina and son Anatoly have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing.

Today Mrs Litvinenko said she is 'relieved and delighted' that a public inquiry is to be held into the death of her husband, known as Sasha to his loved ones.

Mrs Litvinenko said: 'It sends a message to Sasha's murderers: no matter how strong and powerful you are, truth will win out in the end and you will be held accountable for your crimes. 

'It has taken nearly eight years to bring those culpable for Sasha's murder to justice. I look forward to the day when the truth behind my husband's murder is revealed for the whole world to see.'

Mrs Litvinenko’s lawyers argued a public inquiry needed to establish whether Mr Litvinenko was the victim of a crime committed 'for private criminal purposes' or whether it was a 'state-sponsored assassination carried out on the territory of the UK on the orders of the Russian government'.
