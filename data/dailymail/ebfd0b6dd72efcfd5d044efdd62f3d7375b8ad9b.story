Wedding receptions are notorious for drinking, dancing and questionable decision-making.

But while a few red faces the following morning have come to be expected, little thought is often given to just what the rental companies - tasked with cleaning up after the fact - discover in the process.

Now, new data released by Young's Hire, one of the UK's leading formal menswear retailers, is sharing some of the most shocking and unusual items discovered in returned grooms and ushers' suits over the past 12 months.

Wedding receptions are known for groomsmen getting wild, but what do the suit cleaners find the next day?

Young's Hire has revealed a list of the strangest items found in suit pockets, such as rotting prawns

Standard post-wedding checks on garments have turned up everything from a pocketful of rotting prawns to over a dozen pairs of false teeth, and, less surprisingly, copious amounts of non-prescription drugs 

And while a full-size clown's costume may strike you as the most confounding - how would it fit in a suit pocket? - there are a few items that make much more regular appearances.

Garters, Viagra and marriage certificates are often fished out of suit pockets the following morning, while prophylactics and wallets are also commonly found. 

So much so, in fact, that Young's has dedicated an area of their warehouse exclusively for the garters that have been discarded. 

The most common item left behind according to the formal menswear rental company? Discarded garters

1. Prawns

2. Hearing aids

3. False teeth

4. Non-prescription drugs

5. A clown suit 

1. Garters

2. Viagra

3. Marriage certificates

4. Unused (or used) condoms

5. Wallets 

Chris Burns, Operations Controller at Young's, said: 'We provide the hire service for the whole of Debenhams so we hire a lot of garments across the country and as a result we've had some really amusing items left behinds over the years.

'This year we thought it would be great to take a look back and review some of the most unusual and humorous items our staff have found – and more often than not, returned to their rightful owners. 

'I never fail to be surprised by some of the things returned but it's actually some of the more common items we find that concern me the most.

'We would really like to encourage people to try and remember to double and triple check their pockets before risking their security or even their honeymoon plans by leaving behind vital documents or items.' 

But the absolute oddest item left behind, according to their survey data, was a full-sized clown suit
