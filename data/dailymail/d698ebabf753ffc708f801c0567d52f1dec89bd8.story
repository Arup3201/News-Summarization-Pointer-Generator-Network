Concerns: Canterbury headteacher Michael Walters says one pupil claiming to be 15 or 16 turned out to be in his twenties

Adult asylum seekers pretending to be children are being placed in schools alongside pupils as young as 11, headteachers claim.

Schools in Kent believe some people as old as 21 have lied about their ages, prompting concern over the safety of children in schools.

One headteacher, Michael Walters, fears in some cases asylum seekers are placed in mainstream education 'within days' without the necessary information.

He said he and other colleagues in Kent believe people had presented themselves as under 16 'only to find that they were clearly 20 or 21'. 

The county is considered the frontline of the arrival of immigrants into the UK because so many come through the Port of Dover.

Kent County Council currently has 38 unaccompanied asylum seeker children aged between five and 16  in their schools.

Asylum seekers may be tempted to reduce their age to secure preferential treatment, especially to get an education or improve their chances of staying in the UK.

They may also get better housing with foster carers rather than in shared accommodation with other adults.

Michael Walters, headteacher at St Anselm's RC Secondary School in Canterbury, said immigrant children - who arrive without parents - were being placed in schools in a 'random and haphazard' way with few checks on their backgrounds or ages.

Mr Walters said: 'While we have great sympathy with those unaccompanied asylum seekers who arrive in England in need of education and support, this does present a difficult position for schools.

'We are being asked to admit pupils to our schools with very little information about him (sic).

'Sometimes there is doubt about where they come from, and what age they are.' 

Mr Walters said the majority come from or claim to come from war-torn countries in the Middle East such as Syria and Iraq, or from Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.

He said: 'While I recognise that there is a very difficult balance to strike here, this lack of information and uncertainty could be seen as a safeguarding issue for schools.

'Quite rightly, schools are held to the very highest standards when it comes to keeping children safe.

'I believe that there have to be serious questions asked in some cases about the wisdom of immediately placing these children into mainstream educational settings.'

Meanwhile, Spires Academy secondary school, in Hersden, near Canterbury, has had two unaccompanied asylum seeking children placed in it this term.

Headteacher Nicki Martin said: 'While many of these are genuine cases and we will do all that we can to support these young people, a minority are not.

'As a school we have to be increasingly vigilant, given the lack of information that is provided. Safeguarding our pupils is paramount.'

Kent County Council, the local education authority,insisted today it assesses unaccompanied asylum seekers 'rigorously' before finding them school places.

But admitted 'in very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed'.  

A spokesman  said: 'Asylum seeking children are treated the same as other children in care.

'They are vulnerable young people who have often had a very difficult and traumatic journey to arrive in the UK.

'When they arrive in Kent, they are rigorously assessed by skilled social workers and educational assessors who are experienced in making an informed judgement about their age.

'In many cases, due to the lack of records or disruption in their home country, there is no way to check this information.

'Like any other child in care, schools are allocated on the basis of where they live.

'If the young person cannot speak English, it is the responsibility of the school to provide the appropriate support, as it would with any student.

Yonas Admasu Kebede, right, claimed the taxpayer should fund his £10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child.

But last year the Mail revealed he may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds.

The failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20.

He also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison, but the Mail’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family.

His lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation, living expenses and schooling paid for by Newcastle City Council.

And because he was a so-called ‘looked-after child’, it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons, even though he turned 26.

Newcastle City Council was forced to pay £10,000 for Mr Kebede to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the Court of Appeal earlier last year. 

'In very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed, action has immediately been taken to remove them from school and to inform police and the Home Office.

'In such cases, there is no evidence to suggest other pupils have been placed at risk.'

Canterbury Academy headteacher Phil Karnavas urged a cautious approach to the issue of asylum seeking children.

He said: 'A very small number of unaccompanied asylum seekers may be older than stated or provide limited background information.

'This will cause difficulty. Staff will follow safeguarding procedures.' 

Last year 130 unaccompanied children arrived in Kent with most found in the back of lorries.

Younger children are placed with foster carers while those judged to be at least 15 or 16 are placed in a converted old people's home in Kent.

Alasdair Hogarth, former headteacher of The Archbishop's School in Canterbury, believes it is tempting for asylum seekers to claim they are younger than they are to secure preferential treatment.

Mr Hogarth is now chairman of the Canterbury Inclusion Service, a body which meets to ensure that children who find themselves out of school are given places.

He said: 'Schools are generally sympathetic, helpful and supportive, and my experience has been that unaccompanied asylum seekers can do very well at school, although some with poorer previous educational experience or language difficulties can require considerable extra help.'
