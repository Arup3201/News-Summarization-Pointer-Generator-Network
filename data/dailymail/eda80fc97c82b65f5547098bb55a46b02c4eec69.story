Robin van Persie is backing his Manchester United side to bounce back against Cambridge United in their FA Cup fourth round replay at Old Trafford next week.

Louis van Gaal’s side were held to a goalless draw by the League Two minnows at the Abbey Stadium last Friday.

United have not tasted FA Cup glory since 2004, and Van Persie feels the time is right for the club to seize their opportunity.

Robin van Persie came off the bench against Cambridge but he was unable to break the deadlock 

‘I think it's vital,' Van Persie said. 'Especially with this Cup, because it's been 11 years ago since Manchester United won it last?

‘We want to win it. This club has wanted to win it for years now, but now we have a big chance.’

Van Gaal’s men were subjected to heavy criticism after their poor display against Cambridge, but after the extraordinary FA Cup results the following day in which Manchester City and Chelsea were both dumped out by lower league opposition, Van Persie admitted that the mood had changed at Old Trafford.

Cambridge supporters will have a day out at Old Trafford to look forward to for the replay on Tuesday week 

'After the game against Cambridge, everyone was a bit down,’ Van Persie explained.

‘But you have to give them credit. It's quite a stunt to do what they did which is very nice for them. But in a way, especially after tea time on Saturday, the whole mood changed. City went out, Chelsea went out and suddenly we are in it with a home tie against Cambridge. 

'Out of all the big teams, it's just us, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham left. But from all these teams, we are highest in the league so does that make us favourites? I don't know. I'm still very happy to be in it.’
