This is the disgraced Rev. Paul Flowers, posing in a dressing gown surrounded by members of the Boys' Brigade, in a photograph from his days as a Labour party secretary in the 1980s.

Next to the former Co-Op Bank chairman is former House of Commons Speaker Baroness Betty Boothroyd, who today branded him a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’.

The 63-year-old, who earned the nickname 'The Crystal Methodist' following his very public fall from grace, is currently on bail facing drug charges after being secretly filmed apparently buying cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine.

'Jekyll and Hyde': Rev Paul Flowers poses in a dressing down with then MP, later Commons Speaker, Baroness Betty Boothroyd and members of the Boys' Brigade in West Bromwich in 1982

The photo was taken in 1982 while Flowers worked with Baroness Boothroyd as a secretary for Labour in West Bromwich, West Midlands.

Former Speaker of the House of Commons, Baroness Boothroyd has spoken about her experiences working with Flowers in the 1970s and 1980s.

Before becoming chairman of the Co-Op bank, Flowers worked as party secretary when Baroness Boothroyd was the local MP.

Yesterday she said Flowers would often call party meetings but fail to attend himself.

Speaking out: Baroness Betty Boothroyd, pictured at Margaret Thatcher's funeral last year, worked with Flowers in the 70s and 80s, when he worked as a secretary for the Labour Party in her constituency of West Bromwich

She said: ‘He was very helpful. But he let the party down. He was happy to do a lot of work and was secretary of the party.

‘But he seemed to grow weary of it. I think West Bromwich was not big enough for him.

‘He was a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. Not in a nasty way. He had a wonderful enthusiasm but there was no real commitment there.’

Baroness Betty Boothroyd, born 1929, is the first and only female Speaker in the House of Commons.

She served as a Labour MP for West Bromwich and West Bromwich West from 1973 until she became speaker in 1992.

She served in the position until she resigned in October 2000.

The 84-year-old supports West Bromwich Albion Football club and enjoys paragliding in her spare time.

In November 1981 he was photographed 
for his local newspaper wearing a bath robe as he prepared to take part 
in a sponsored weight loss challenge and moustache shave.

He promised to shed 15lbs in weight and was pictured with members of the Boys' Brigade accompanied by Baroness Boothroyd.

Flowers, who was a minister at Hill 
Top Methodist Church in West Bromwich, became a Labour candidate for 
Meriden, Warwickshire, in September 1985.

In his campaign he pledged to bring ‘honesty, humanity and humour’ back to politics.

He resigned less than three months later after accusing party members of conducting a ‘whispering campaign’ against him.

In
 his resignation letter he blamed party officials of using his 
conviction for gross indecency - reportedly concerning a sex act in a 
toilet - to attack his sexuality.

'Within a relatively short time a whispering 
campaign began - not on political issues - but on the face that I happen
 to be gay, and that I was once convicted of the sort of offence to 
which gay people are susceptible within a pressurised and intolerant 
society,' he wrote.

‘I owe it to my own
 sense of self-respect and to those who employ me in the Church - and 
who have supported me through this charade - to resign now.’

Earlier
 this week Flowers was accused of inviting a teenage rent boy to 
accompany him to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton.

Following
 the publication by the Mail of the video showing Flowers allegedly 
purchasing drugs in Leeds new reports have emerged claiming he was spending 
'vast' sums every week.

The footage has led to his suspension from the Methodist church and Labour Party.

Even
 after his alleged secret drug taking was made public and he apologised, Flowers appears to have kept up a stream of texts to his dealer referring to 
'Charlie' (cocaine), 'ket' (ketamine), and crack cocaine.

He
 also bragged about having two bottles of date-rape drug GHB, lusting 
after a 17-year-old 'straight' boy and talked of going 'dogging'.
