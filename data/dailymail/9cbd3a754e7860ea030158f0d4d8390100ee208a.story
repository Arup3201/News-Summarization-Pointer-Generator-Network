There was a time when she held the nation – and Captain Ross Poldark – in the palm of her hand.

Now, as the BBC revives the classic costume drama Poldark, here is the first look at the new Demelza.

Eleanor Tomlinson – previously seen in the BBC’s The White Queen – is taking over the role of the fiery heroine first made famous by Angharad Rees. And these pictures show her on set last week in Corsham, Wiltshire, which is standing in for 18th Century Cornwall. 

HEROINE: Eleanor Tomlinson in the role of Demelza which Angharad Rees made famous

THEN AND NOW: The 1970s and 2015 incarnations of Ross Poldark and Demelza

The original series attracted audiences of up to 15 million when it ran from 1975 to 1977. And when the eight-part revival airs next year, it will be in a post-9pm watershed slot, so producers can make it steamier than before.

Tomlinson, 22, said: ‘Demelza was so brilliantly played by Angharad, and I have done my best to try not to disappoint the army of Poldark fans.’

Ms Rees died of pancreatic cancer in 2012. In the revival, Ross Poldark, first played by Robin Ellis, will be played by Aidan Turner from The Hobbit movies.
