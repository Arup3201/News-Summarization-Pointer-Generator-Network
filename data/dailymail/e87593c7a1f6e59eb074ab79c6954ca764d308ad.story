NASCAR racer Danica Patrick could be set to become America's first female Formula One driver after her boss hinted she would be a 'great candidate' for his F1 team.

The 32-year-old is the most successful woman in the history of American open-wheel racing and has competed in NASCAR since 2012, finishing inside the top ten twice.

Motorsport mogul Gene Haas, for whom Miss Patrick races for in NASCAR is preparing to launch a brand new Formula One team in time for the 2016 season.

And in an interview with NBCSN commentator at the Canadian Grand Prix yesterday, Mr Haas said including her on his team could be a possibility.

He said: 'She'd bring an awful lot of viewership, I think it's be great for America. I think she would be a great candidate.

'Whether that's going to happen or not, I think that's kind of a long shot there.'

Miss Patrick, who is originally from Beloit, Wisconsin became the fourth woman in 2005 to compete in the Indy 500.

She finished fourth, which is the best ever finish for a female competitor and won the accolade of Rookie of the Year.

She then made history again in 2008 by becoming the first female to win an Indy Car race and between 2005 and 2011, she posted another seven top three finishes.

In 2012 she switched to NASCAR racing but has struggled to break into the top 25 of the championship standings.

Outside of the sport, she is a model and advertising spokesman and has even featured in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition in 2008.

Last year she donned sequin showgirl outfit when she co-hosted the 2013 American Country Awards alongside Trace Adkins in Las Vegas.

If Miss Patrick were to be selected to compete in Formula One, she would become one of just two women to have ever started a race in the sport.

However, only one woman Lella Lombardi of Italy has actually picked up any points in a race.

She raced from 1974 to 1976 before joining in NASCAR after her retirement from Formula One.

But women's inclusion in Formula One has been criticised by some including former champion Sir Stirling Moss.

Last year he was quoted as saying: 'The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don’t think they have aptitude to win a Formula One race.’

But Miss Patrick, who has also faced criticism in the past for being female, was quoted as saying last year: 'I really don't care.

'There's going to be people who believe in you and people who don't.'

 

Lella Lombardi, the most successful woman to have competed in Formula One in the 1970s

Lella Lombardi was the first and only woman to have picked up a point in a Formula One race and participated in 17 Grand Prix between 1974 and 1976.

The Italian's best finish came in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix when she finished sixth, earning her the point.

She made the switch to Formula One after performing well in Formula 3 and Formula 5000 in the early 1970s.

During her Formula One career, she raced for March and Williams before a short-lived stint with RAM Racing.

After retiring from Formula One, she competed in NASCAR before racing sports cars.

She died in Milan in 2002 aged 50 after suffering from cancer.
