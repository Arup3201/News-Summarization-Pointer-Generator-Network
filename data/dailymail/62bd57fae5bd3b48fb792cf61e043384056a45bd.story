A man in a Captain America T-shirt broke into the Kennedy family mansion last night, answered the phone to Ted Kennedy Jr and said he was looking for Katy Perry, police said.

Officers in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, arrested a middle-aged man who claimed he was a war veteran after the bizarre incident at 9.30pm.

They were reportedly tipped off by the 52-year-old lawyer and nephew of John F Kennedy himself.

Police charged 53-year-old James Lacroix with breaking and entering and he was due in court this morning

Mr Kennedy, who was not at home at the time, is said to have phoned the house to check on his 16-year-old son - but instead was met by a stranger's voice.

Police rushed to the house and arrested 53-year-old James Lacroix.

He was charged with breaking and entering and was held overnight by police pending arraignment this morning.

Neighbours in the small village community told police they saw the man pull into the driveway in a black Corvette about three hours earlier.

When the officers arrived, they found the intruder inside the kitchen.

Sergeant
 Thomas Bird, of the Barnstable Police Department, told MailOnline: 
'When questioned he said he was looking for the singer Katy Perry.

'He claimed he was a veteran, that's what he says, but we have not ascertained that yet.'

He also reportedly asked to speak to the Kennedys themselves and said he was disabled, according to the news channel WDHD.

It is believed he may have got inside through an unlocked door.

A
 police press release this morning said: 'The Barnstable Police 
Department received a call from a gentleman who stated that he owns a 
home on Irving Avenue in Hyannisport and he believes that there may be 
an intruder in his home.

'The reporting party stated that he 
was currently at his home in Connecticut, and he had just called his 
Hyannisport residence to check on his teenage son.

'The reporting party stated that an unidentified adult male answered the phone and identified himself as James Lacroix.

'The reporting party requested that officers respond to his residence to check on the well-being of his son, who he believed may be inside the residence with this unidentified male party.Â 'When officers questioned him as to why he was inside the residence he stated that he was looking for the singer Katy Perry.

'The subject was identified as James Lacroix, 53 years of age.

'Follow-up investigation with neighbors revealed that Lacroix had arrived at the property at approximately 6:30 pm.

'Lacroix was charged with breaking and entering in the daytime. Lacroix was booked and held at the Barnstable Police Department and will be arraigned in Barnstable District Court on Wednesday morning.'

The compound on Cape Cod has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes on six acres of land.

John F Kennedy's father, Joseph P Kennedy, bought a summer cottage near the plot in 1928.

The home at which the intruder was found, in Irving Avenue, was bought in 1956.

It was used as a base for John F Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign and later as a retreat, where he enjoyed spending time with his family until he was assassinated in 1963.

It was also a favoured home of Ted Jr's father, Sentator Ted Kennedy, before his death in 2009.

Healthcare lawyer Ted Jr revealed in April that he had finally given into pressure to join the family firm and would make a bid for political office in the Connecticut state senate.
