Missing: Jade Morris, pictured, has not been seen since she left her home to go shopping with Brenda Stokes

Police in Las Vegas are on the hunt for a 10-year-old girl who was last seen with a blackjack dealer hours before she allegedly slashed a co-worker in the face at the famed Bellagio resort.

The family of Jade Morris, said they last saw the little girl on Friday when left with Brenda Stokes, 50, a family friend who had volunteered to take the girl Christmas shopping.

But neither returned that night.

When the family heard that Stokes had been arrested in a vicious knife attack on a fellow card dealer on the casino floor of the Bellagio, they grew concerned for their daughter's well-being.

When Stokes was taken into custody on Friday and asked about where Jade would be, Stokes claimed she hadn't picked up the girl that afternoon.

The girl's father, Philip Morris, who is reportedly engaged to Stokes, says has not been told where his daughter is.

He told KTNV-TV: 'I don't have a clue where she is. I can’t imagine where she could be. For some reason I kinda have a feeling inside that says she;s all right. Maybe it’s wishful thinking.'

A friend of the girl told the station that she visited Stokes on Monday, who said that she would be talking to anyone until she had an attorney.

The family is now pleading for Stokes to let police know where they can find Jade.

Speaking to KTNV-TV on Monday, Phil Tucker, the girl's grandfather, told KTNV: 'Brenda, please cooperate with our authorities and let them
know where Jade is at or where we can find her at... I'm begging you. Please say something'

According to local reports, a fight broke out between two female blackjack dealers at the luxury hotel famed for its elaborate fountain displays.

The woman allegedly attacked by Stokes, who hasn't been named, was taken to the Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center with deep facial cuts.

It
is unknown how many of the Bellagio's 4,000 guests saw the fight, which
occurred in the crowded casino at around 9.45pm, but it comes just a 
week after many witnessed a murder-suicide in a busy hotel lobby on the Las Vegas strip. 

An Illinois man shot dead his ex-girlfriend in the entrance-way of the Excalibur hotel around 8.30pm on Friday, December 14.

Jessica Kenny, 30, who worked as a concierge at the hotel, was shot on a crowded Friday night as panicked tourists ran for cover following the sound of gunshots.

Her ex-boyfriend Edward Brandt then turned the gun on himself.
