A woman was rushed to hospital with facial injuries after she was hit by a wild deer on a busy city centre shopping street.

The victim, 24, was given first aid for 'facial lacerations and a black eye' after the wild beast leapt over her on Chelmsford High Street in Essex.

She was taken to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital where she was treated for 'a minor head injury' and later discharged.

Chaos: A woman was taken to hospital with 'facial lacerations and a black eye' after being trampled by the frightened animal outside Superdrug

Sales shoppers were stunned to see the adult male deer galloping through the built-up area, where it was caught on CCTV.

Drivers later reported sightings of the deer near near junction 18 of the A12 heading towards Colchester.

Police imposed rolling blocks as a precaution, but no further sightings of the deer were made.

Witnesses reported seeing a young woman lying in a pool of blood for around 40 minutes after the incident as paramedics attended to her.

Joanna Tyzack, 22, from Chelmsford, said: 'I came out of Superdrug and saw a deer out of the corner of my eye.

'I thought I was seeing things as it ran into the corner of the high street - it must have been scared of the crowds.

'The next thing I saw was it running off down the high street and a young woman lying on the floor in a pool of blood. She looked in quite a lot of pain.'

Scared: The 4ft-tall red deer sprang into the high street on Sunday afternoon before dashing from the Stone Bridge across to New London Road, after which it disappeared

Ryan Knight, 21, who appears in the 
bottom-left corner of the CCTV footage flanked by two friends, has 
struggled to convince colleagues of what he saw before the CCTV footage 
was released today.

He said: 'I saw it shoot past us at speed and only just swerve past a bus. It came from the park and just sprinted up the road into the high street.

'When I got back to work I told everybody what I had seen but no one would believe me. People have been winding me up at work saying "Did you see another deer today?"

Mick McDonagh, manager of the High Chelmer shopping centre, said: 'It tried to leap over a young lady and unfortunately hit her.

'She was obviously very shocked. I think she was concussed.

'I
don't think she was actually able to talk about it. It was passers-by, 
who actually told the paramedics what happened. It's certainly not 
something you expect to see.'

He added: 'We saw it come running from
Bellmead. It turned left into an oncoming bus lane on New London Road 
and then disappeared.'

Running amok: Drivers later reported sightings of the deer near near junction 18 of the A12 heading towards Colchester (file picture)

The 
4ft-tall red deer sprang into the High Street on Sunday afternoon before
dashing from the Stone Bridge across to New London Road, after which it
disappeared.

A Chelmsford woman in her 20s was given first aid after the animal tried to jump over her outside Superdrug.

A
spokesman for Essex Police said: 'It [the deer] had found its way into 
unfamiliar territory and did what any wild animal would do in the 
circumstances.'

A spokesman 
for the East Anglian Ambulance Service said 'We understand the deer, in 
its attempt to get away, barged into a number of people, sending some to
the pavement.

'It also dazed itself when it hit a plate glass window.

'The young woman was treated for minor facial injuries, then taken by us to Broomfield Hospital.'

Not only is the burgeoning population of wild deer a threat to UK woodland, the surge in the number of deer is also a hazard for drivers on our roads:

The incident comes as anew study claimed the thriving population of UK roe deer could be damaging the landscape of British woodland.

Researchers discovered that areas with the most roe deer had the least shrub layer vegetation cover and fewer birds.

The study results add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled to protect the environment.

The species are also estimated to cause thousands of collisions on the roads each year.

A team from the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) and Durham University found that an increase in the population of roe deer is possibly related to a decline in the diversity and cover of shrubs below the main canopy in forest areas.Wild deer have been roaming Britain for 
around 6,000 years and it is estimated that there are currently around 
two million of them.

The incident comes just five months after Essex Police deployed armed officers to hunt a lion which had been spotted by holidaymakers in Clacton, Essex.

Less than 24 hours after officers hit the streets, the search was called off after the discovery that the 'lion' had in fact been a resident's pet cat called Teddy Bear.

Rebecca King, 19, from Essex, tweeted yesterday: 'LOL! Wild deer on the loose in Chelmsford. First a Lion now this. What is wrong with Essex?'
