A group of rabbits have been stranded in the middle after rising floodwater cut them off from the land.

The animals climbed up onto a concrete patch outside a sports hut in Windsor, Berkshire but were unable to move off their temporary home.

They ran from side to side in an attempt to find a way off the newly created island - but without success.

No escape: The hut was cut off from the rest of the park by rising floodwater over the weekend

The distressed animals were spotted by photographer Ed Brown when he was walking in Home Park, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, over the weekend.

Rabbits are able to swim - but Mr Brown said that the animals stranded in the park seemed to be too nervous to jump into the water and seek safety.

'My girlfriend Kirsty spotted the rabbits as we were walking from our home in Datchet to Windsor to see how bad the flooding in the area was,' the photographer said.

'We stood for over half an hour watching the rabbits, none of them made any attempt to jump in but they kept going to the edges and peering over in the water.'

Attempt: The animals tried to get away but were unwilling to leap into the water

The eventual fate of the distressed animals is unknown.

The pictures were captured after three weeks of heavy rainfall across the South of England, leading to serious floods in many areas.

Home Park is next to the River Thames, which has burst its banks in several places.

Plight: The rabbits are among a number of animals which have been caught up in the stormy weather

The Windsor rabbits are not the only animals to be affected by the storms in recent weeks.

Over the weekend a seal was found in a river 50 miles from the sea after being swept inland, while a dolphin had to be rescued by passers-by who saw it stranded on a beach in Cornwall.
