A group of 'murderous misfits' in Canada conspired to execute a mall massacre on Valentine's Day as part of a suicide pact, police claim.

The plot was foiled by law enforcement at the last minute after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, according to a Halifax Police statement.

Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 23, of Geneva, Illinois, and Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia, were arrested on Friday and charged with conspiracy to commit murder, the statement added. 

A third suspect, 19-year-old James Gamble, killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia. 

A fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody.

Investigators say the group planned to open fire inside Halifax Shopping Centre on Saturday.

A senior police official  told The Associated Press on Saturday that Souvannarath confessed to the plot following her arrest. She had also programmed a number of tweets to be posted to her Twitter account posthumously, the official said.

'It would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility:' Justice Minister Peter MacKay speaks to reporters at a press conference on Saturday February 14 in Halifax, Canada

'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility,' Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters Saturday.

'The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism.' 

'A day known to represent love and affection could have taken a much different meaning today had it not been for the exceptional efforts of the combined law enforcement community.'

MacKay said Souvannarath and 19-year-old James Gamble had been in contact online and allegedly planned to open fire at an unidentified public venue as part of a suicide pact.

The pair were reportedly  obsessed with killing and death and had numerous photos of mass killings. 

'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem on our community,' MacKay said.

'To be clear, all suspects are either dead or in custody.'

Target: Police say they have confirmed the target for the massacre was to be the Halifax Shopping Centre

Extra security measures have been taken at Halifax Shopping Centre. 

Police said the group had access to firearms and presented a significant weapons-related threat.

Weapons were seized by investigators, but it is unclear what type. 

Souvannarath - who lives on the fringe of Chicago - was arrested arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police airport at 2am Friday.

She was being picked up by Shepherd. 

However police believe Souvannarath made the suicide pact with Gamble.

Gamble was found dead inside his parents' home in Tiger Maple Drive, Timberlea, at 1.20am Friday, after officers surrounded the property.

Police heard a single gunshot before entering the house and the teen is believed to have committed suicide. 

Gamble's Tumblr page features pictures of him with a rife and a knife.

Along with photos of the Columbine High School massacre, there is also a quote from the Columbine shooters, saying: 'This is a weird time, weird life, weird existence.'

He also posted photos of a Nazi march.

Gamble's father told local media he needed privacy to grieve the death of his son, according to Global News.

The family's neighbor, Annette Casey, told the publication: 'The kids are a little nervous, you hear about things like this all the time but it's so close to home and you don't even know it's going on.

'My son used to actually be his book buddy at school when they were younger.'

On Facebook, there are photos of Gamble and Shepherd together.

They both have listed Walmart under their work information. 

Raid: The female suspect, from Illinois, a 20-year-old man, from Halifax, and a 17-year-old boy, from Cole Harbour, were reportedly arrested on Friday after the tip-off. Above, armed police at the Timberlea house

Prepared: The woman and 19-year-old man had plotted 'to go to a public venue in the Halifax region on February 14th with a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves,' Officer Brennan said on Friday

Armed vehicle: The roles of the other male suspects are still being determined as part of the investigation

Plan: The female suspect and a 20-year-old male were arrested at Halifax airport, while the 19-year-old male was found dead in the suburb of Tumberlea around the same time. The fourth suspect, a 17-year-old, was later seized in Cole Habour

The fourth suspect, a 17-year-old boy, who was arrested at 11am Friday at a house in Cole Harbor, has now been released by police without charge but remains under investigation.

The plot was intercepted after a tip off by a member of the public.

According to CBC, the information came from Geneva, where Souvannarath lives.

The tip only came in on Thursday and police were able to make the arrests within a matter of hours. 

Speaking on Friday night, RCMP Sargent Alain LeBlanc said the plot to kill a large number of people at a mall - which was not named - is not believed to be related to Islamic terrorism.

Officer Brennan also said he wouldn't classify the plan as a 'terrorist event'. 

Instead, he said the four alleged plotters 'had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts against citizens'.

Emergency response: According to the anonymous official, the woman had earlier tweeted a number of pronouncements that she wished to be posted after her death. The contents of these tweets remain unknown

Police at the scene on Friday morning: Officer Brunner said the plot was 'not culturally-based', adding: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there'

He added that the plot was 'not culturally-based', saying: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there.'

Speaking to AP, a senior government official confirmed the plot was not terror related. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Police have released no details about the motive. During a press conference on Friday night, Officer Brennan declined to release the exact location of where the four allegedly plotted to attack.

'We believe we have apprehended all known individuals in this matter and have eliminated the threat. We are not seeking any further suspects at this time in relation to this investigation,' he said.

On Friday, Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, applauded the work of police in Canada, describing the arrests as 'a great example of the fine work they do on a daily basis to help keep Canadians safe.'

'We have among the best emergency response in the country,' he told CBC News. 'The good news is they discovered all this and dealt with it very effectively. We always have to be vigilant.' 

In a statement, Canadian Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney also congratulated the efforts of officers in Canada and Geneva, Illinois, as well as border officials. Police are investigating.
