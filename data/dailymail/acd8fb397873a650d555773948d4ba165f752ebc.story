Burnley are set to be without their two top strikers, Danny Ings and Sam Vokes, for at least a month.

Last season’s 26-goal top scorer Ings is expected to be sidelined for four weeks after suffering a hamstring injury at Crystal Palace last weekend. And manager Sean Dyche dismissed reports suggesting that Vokes, who weighed in with another 21 goals as Burnley won promotion, is close to returning from the knee ligament injury he suffered in March.

‘It’s factually wrong,’ said the Burnley boss. ‘Sam’s just on his way back. There’s certainly no rush on him. He’s out on the grass and moving nicely, but he’ll be under no pressure from us.

‘I’m not thinking that he’s thinking he’s going to be ready in the next month, because he’s not.

Sam Vokes is not close to a return from a knee ligament injury, says Dyche

‘With Danny, it’s a straightforward hamstring injury. It will heal naturally but we won’t put a timescale on it. We thought it was that but I’m just pleased that scans showed something straightforward.’

The Clarets are still waiting for their first win of the season after drawing at Crystal Palace last weekend when Scott Arfield had a late penalty saved.

With Ings and Vokes sidelined, Dyche said that it will be up to the players who takes the next one.

‘Normally the players (decide) amongst themselves,’ he added. ‘Last year with Ings and Vokes, it was deemed that if one got tumbled over he took the penalty. But they both practised them. Scott Arfield practises them.

‘You could tell from his whole body language last week that he was desperate to take it. He struck it well but the keeper made a great save.

‘You’ve got to look at the people who want to take them. I’m not going to demand someone takes them. I took one once and I didn’t want to take it, so I don’t put anyone under pressure.’

Despite the winless start, Dyche insists that spirits remain high at Turf Moor as they prepare to face Sunderland at home on Saturday.

‘It’s never a question of morale here, that’s always good,’ he said. ‘We’re close to getting our first win. We’ve arguably deserved one and haven’t got one. The performance levels are good but I’m not naive, we’ve got to win games.

‘I’m only human. Of course you want to lay your head down on Saturday with your first win and three points are in the bag.

‘But it’s the reality, the Premier League, a step up, a hard task. We delivered a very good performance and missed a penalty, that’s the obvious one. But it’s nip and tuck and some games are like that. It was a good point away from home – we can’t be too greedy.

‘I put enough pressure on myself so outside opinion is not something I find too taxing. We don’t want to be here for fluff – “oh good old Burnley” – we want to achieve things. Last year was promotion, this year is different. We’re all learning and developing.’
