A baby boy who underwent open heart surgery when he was just a few days old has defied doctors' predictions and made it home for his first Christmas.

Little Alfie Donnelly was just four days old when he was diagnosed with a number of life-threatening heart defects.

Doctors warned his parents, Claire and Anthony, that Alfie had zero chance of survival without a complicated operation to re-plumb his tiny heart - which would leave him with a high risk of brain damage.

The family, from Birmingham, were told it would be a 'miracle' if he survived and that there was no chance that he would be home in time for Christmas.

Claire, 34, is overjoyed her miracle baby is doing so well he made it home in time for Christmas.

She said: 'It was awful and so painful to see him in hospital with all the tubes.

'It was really scary and I wasn't even allowed to cuddle him for three weeks.

'He is one in a million and having him home for Christmas means everything to us.

'We never ever thought it would happen so he is going to be really spoilt this year and we're really looking forward to having the family all together.'

Claire had a normal pregnancy with Alfie, but took him to Birmingham Children's Hospital when he was only a few days old after he became freezing cold, making a whingey sound and struggling to feed.

Claire and husband Anthony, 27, were told he had pneumonia but after further tests, discovered their little boy had a very rare condition and were told he could die without surgery.

The condition - complex aortic atresia with two ventricles and a ventricular septal defect - meant Alfie was born without a main artery in his heart.

Claire, a contracts manager, said: 'The decision to operate was harrowing because it felt like we were signing his life away, but really there was no decision to make.

Anthony and Claire could not wait to get Alfie home after spending nine weeks living in the hospital where their son was being cared for

'Leaving him was heart breaking and we made a point of not saying goodbye.

'We just said: 'see you in the morning Alfie'.'

But after seven hours of surgery and four weeks in intensive care, brave little Alfie defied doctors' predictions.

He was put on a ventilator to breathe for him and when he got stronger he was able to breathe unaided.

Claire said: 'When he came off the ventilator it was amazing to hear him crying.

'Most of the time crying is a bad sign, but to us, because we had never heard it, it was just incredible.'

Alfie has also had speech therapy to help him learn to swallow and take a bottle.

He was discharged this week to join his delighted parents and brothers Pierce, 12, and Ethan, nine, who had been living in the hospital for nine weeks.

Despite being nine weeks old, he still weighs the same as a newborn, at just 8lbs 4oz.

Anthony, who works in property maintenance, said: 'It's been one hell of a year and now we are just really looking forward to Christmas, it's going to be an emotional day.'

Alfie, who was conceived by using IVF, is recovering but will need further operations as he gets older

Alfie, who was conceived by using IVF, is now recovering at home, but will need further operations as he gets older.

Anthony praised the hospital staff who cared for his son.

He said: 'The staff at Birmingham Children's Hospital have been really fantastic.

'They all went above and beyond their call of duty and we could not have hoped for better care.'

Mr Brawn, consultant paediatric cardiac surgeon at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: 'Alfie's condition meant that he could not survive without life-saving surgery in the first few days of his life.

'The procedure was a complex open heart surgery for a baby and the repair of the great vessels of the aorta was very complicated in this case.

'It is really nice that the family can all be at home together at Christmas.'
