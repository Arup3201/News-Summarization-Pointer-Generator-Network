A mother was left furious after she was given a parking ticket for leaving her car outside her own home.

Clare Hopkins, 50, was charged £70 for parking her BMW 520 on the grass verge outside her family's house in Waltham, Lincolnshire, after pulling up and dashing inside to avoid a hailstorm on Sunday.

Just two minutes after she walked through the door, a neighbour called to tell her that a parking warden had appeared and slapped a ticket on her car.

Clare Hopkins says she parked one wheel of her car on the verge in front of her driveway and was given a parking ticket within two minutes

Mrs Hopkins, a fish-factory worker, said: 'I have never known anything like it. I'd been away to visit my mother in Wales and as I got closer to home, a huge hailstorm started.

'I pulled up quickly - off the road - with the full intention of going back out when the hail stopped and parking the car on the drive.

'The most ridiculous thing is that my husband is usually so fussy when it comes to the cars being on the drive, but he'd had to pull his van forward to get the bins out so there wasn't any room for my car.'

Despite informing the traffic warden that she had actually parked in front of her own home, he wouldn't revoke the ticket, leaving Mrs Hopkins facing a fine.

North East Lincolnshire Council is enforcing verge and footway parking using an experimental Traffic Regulation Order - which they claim Mrs Hopkins infringed.

Her £30,000 car was parked partly on the road, with one wheel on the tarmac that leads from the road to the driveway of her family's suburban semi-detached home.

Mrs Hopkins has paid the £70 fine to avoid the long appeals process, but says she would have happily moved the vehicle if the warden had knocked on her front door

The mother-of-two says she planned to move the car on to her driveway after sheltering indoors from a hailstorm

She said: 'It was a bit over zealous - it was quite clearly my car in front of my house so I don't know why he couldn't have knocked on the door and asked me to move it.

'There was plenty of room for any wheelchair, pushchair or pedestrian to get by no problem, and I wasn't blocking any cars from using the road.

'When the bins are out each week, they block the path but they don't do anything about it then, and at school pick up and drop off times, you can't move for abandoned cars - but they come picking on me on a quiet Sunday afternoon.'

Traffic Regulation Order's allow local authorities to bring in temporary or permanent traffic controls on their roads.

Experimental orders, like that Mrs Hopkins fell foul to, usually last up to 18 months.

The law states they can be used to 'avoid danger to persons or traffic', 'facilitate the passage of traffic' or 'preserve the character of a road'.

Councils have to publish plans before bringing them in and listen to any objections from local residents.

Councillor Ray Oxby said: 'In Waltham, a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) may be served where a vehicle is found to be parked in contravention of the terms of the Traffic Regulation Order (TRO).

'Specifically, the TRO is aimed at protecting the footways and grass verges. Contravention code 62 may be used, which is for being parked with one or more wheels on any part of an urban road other than a carriageway.

'If a motorist feels that they have been issued a PCN incorrectly, they should informally challenge their notice.

'This information is also provided on the reverse of the PCN, where full details of how to challenge the Penalty Charge Notice are clearly given.'

Mrs Hopkins and her husband Keith, 45, who have two children, have since paid the penalty charge.

Mr Hopkins, an HGV driver, said: 'We can't be bothered to appeal it because it just turns into a long process where they get their way.

'They would come back with some answer you can't get around. When you can't even park outside your own home, it just makes you think what next?'
