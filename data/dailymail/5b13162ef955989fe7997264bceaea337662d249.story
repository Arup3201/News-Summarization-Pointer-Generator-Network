David Moyes’ Real Sociedad made it three games without conceding but could only draw the first leg of their last-16 Spanish Cup tie against third tier Oviedo.

A third clean sheet will please Moyes but his side will now have to finish the job when they meet again in San Sebastian in two weeks, time just three days after the Basque derby against Athletic Bilbao.

Moyes had no luck in the cup at Old Trafford with Manchester United knocked out in the third round against Swansea last season and he watched his side contest a hard-fought goal-less draw at the Carlos Tartiere stadium.

The Copa del Rey clash was David Moyes' first since he became Real Sociedad boss in November

Real Oviedo: Esteban, Johannesson, Oscar, J.Vila, David Fdez, Erice, B.Valle (Sergio Garcia 78), Omgba, Cervero (c) (David Gonzalez 60), Sene, Eneko.

Subs: Magunazelaia, Nacho Lopez, Generelo.

Booked: Cervero, B.Valle, Oscar 

Real Sociedad: Rulli, Elustondo (Callens 46), Finnbogason, Pardo, Ansotegi (c), Zurutuza (Oyarzun 66), Castro, Yuri, Zaldua, Gaztanaga, Hervías.

Subs not used: Zubikarai, Estrada, Iker Hernandez, Descarte, Aritz Elustondo.

Booked: Pardo, Ansotegi

He rested five first team players ahead of this weekend’s visit to Villarreal and a second string side fail to penetrate the second division B team’s defence.

Real Sociedad had a penalty shout in the first half when Diego Johannesson looked to have brought down Pablo Hervias inside the area on the half hour but the referee waved away the young winger’s appeals. Hervias was a constant threat for Moyes’ team as Real Sociedad tried to break the deadlock.

Midfielder Ruben Pardo, starting the game in place of the rested Markel Bergara and Esteban Granero, also had a deflected shot go just wide before the break but Oviedo defended well and deserved to go in at half-time on level terms.

David Zurutuza had the first chance of the second half but the Real Sociedad midfielder headed straight at Oviedo keeper Esteban Suarez after connecting with Chory Castro’s free-kick.

Zurutuza went close again with a shot from distance as Real Sociedad pushed for the away goal. They were playing without top scorer Carlos Vela whose hat-trick helped Moyes to his first win at the club last Friday.

Leading the line in place of the rested Mexican and the injured Imanol Agirretxe was the Iceland international Alfred Finnbogason and his best chance came on the hour when Castro crossed from the left but from six yards out he failed to beat Esteban.

The Oviedo keeper was in fine form blocking a Castro shot moments later. But the home side were also forcing chances and Josep Sené volleyed over from six yards out. 

The chance seem to invigorate the minnows and when Franck Omgba tumbled over Alex Callens’ outstretched leg there were calls for a penalty from Oviedo’s players. The referee waved away the appeals and sent coach Sergio Egea off for protesting.

The teams take the 0-0 first-leg scoreline into the return game in San Sebastian in two week’s time. The match comes just after three days after the Basque derby with Athletic Bilbao. Moyes may be tempted to play a more first-choice side to ensure progression in the Spanish Cup.
