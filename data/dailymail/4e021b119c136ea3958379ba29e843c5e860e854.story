Louis van Gaal has handed rookie defender Tyler Blackett and midfielder Jesse Lingard their Manchester United debuts in a maverick first team selection against Swansea.

Van Gaal has been hit by defensive injuries before the opening game with Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Antonio Valencia all missing.

And that has led him to give 20-year-old Blackett his debut at centre back with 21-year-old Lingard in the right wing back role.

Van Gaal said with a smile in his Friday press conference: ‘Nine injuries and I’m not nervous. I won’t change the system because I’ve instilled it into these players. It is easier to continue with the system than to change it.’

Lingard spent last season on loan at Birmingham City and Brighton while Blackett also spent time with Birmingham after a spell at Blackpool.

Both impressed the new coach on United's US pre season tour but their Premier League debuts pose a big step up as Van Gaal plays a wildcard with his first ever United XI. 

Impact: Blackett has caught the eye with a string of impressive displays during pre-season

Out: Jonny Evans (left) and Luke Shaw (right) are both out, posing problems for Van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system

All smiles: The United manager remains confident that his team will hit the ground running, despite injuries
