A retired policeman had to tell nurses that his mother had died after finding her 'propped up' and 'cold' during a visit to the hospital, an inquest has heard.

Joan James, 85, from Solihull, Birmingham, was found dead by Martyn James, 54, on January 22 last year, 30 minutes after she had last been checked by a nurse.

Nurses at Heartlands in Birmingham had no idea Mrs James had died 
until her son - who had unknowingly been downstairs getting a coffee - raised the alarm, the widow's inquest was told.Â 

Martyn James, 54, says he found his mother Joan, 85, dead in her hospital bed in Heartlands, Birmingham, 30 minutes after she had last been checked by a nurse

Widow Mrs James died on January 22 last year after staff told the family she was 'acutely ill'. She is pictured earlier in her stay at the hospital.

At the inquest at the Solihull Council House, Mr James, who is also from Solihull, described how he had been downstairs with his family before returning to his mother's bedside, around 2pm.

Mrs James - who had been last checked by nurses at 1.30pm - was sat up in her bed but was not moving, the inquest heard.

He said: 'I approached her bed and noticed she was slightly propped up. I said 'Mum' four or five times but she didn't move.

'We approached the bed and she wasn't moving. I touched her forehead and it was slightly cold.

'I knew she had passed away. I was with my family and we all became extremely upset.'

Mr James said he was 'extremely upset' after finding his mother

Mr James had been with his two sons, aged 21 and 19, his daughter, aged 16 and his brother Brian when he found his mother.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr James said: 'What angers us most is that we were downstairs having a coffee while our mother was dying.

'We were not there when she needed us the most. We are still finding it all very hard to come to terms with.

'We were a close family but there are always things you wish you had said and now we will never get the chance.'

The inquest heard that Mrs James, who died from bronchial pneumonia, had been admitted to hospital on New Year's Eve 2012 for a fractured hip and shoulder after a fall at home.

Before her death, medical staff believed Mrs James was well enough to move to a care centre.

But, when they tried to move her, she was immediately sent back to A&E with low oxygen levels, the inquest heard.

Mr James told the coroner he was therefore shocked when doctors had not told him earlier this his mother was 'acutely ill'.

He told the inquest: 'We were never told of my mother's other health problems. When the doctor started to talk to me about the possibility of resuscitation, I was in shock.

Heartlands in Birmingham said it could not comment on the case for 'legal and confidentiality reasons'

'As a family, we believe my mother should never have been discharged.'

A Heartlands spokesman said the hospital had investigated the care given to Mrs James but she could not discuss the findings.

She said: 'We are very sorry for the loss experienced by the family of Mrs James and the issues raised with her care while at our hospital.

'We agree with the findings of the coroner's court and a full investigation has been carried out and shared in full with the family.

'For legal and confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment further at this stage.'

Coroner Zafar Siddique recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.

Joan James (right), with her granddaughter, was found dead in her hospital bed by her son Martyn. Birmingham Heartlands Hospital said it had investigated her care but did not make the findings public.

Mrs James, left, died on January 22 last year after being treated at the hospital for three weeks. She is pictured above with her grandson Sam James in 2009.
