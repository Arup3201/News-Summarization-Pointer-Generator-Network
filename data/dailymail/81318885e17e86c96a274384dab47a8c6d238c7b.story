Inmates at the prison holding Anders Behring Breivik are demanding that he is released from solitary confinement as they claim it is draining resources.

His isolation demands that the five adjacent cells on his block at Skien prison, 87miles south-west of Oslo, remain empty, which fellow prisoners claim is 'preferential treatment'.

The 36-year-old murdered  77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers -  in 2011 after detonating a bomb in downtown Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island.

Demands: Inmates serving their time alongside massmurderer Anders Behring Breivik wants him released form solitary confinement as they claim it has led to cutbacks for other prisoners

A representative for the inmates at Skein Prison said the demand to have Breivik released from solitary confinement came after his move to the prison resulted in cutbacks.

'We are mainly talking about the economics of it. It affects all of the other inmates,' he told state broadcaster NRK.

'He sits there with an entire cellblock to himself while there are austerity measures and cutbacks everywhere.'

However, representatives from the Norwegian prison service said the other prisoners are not affected by Breivik's situation, as Skien gets additional funding to detain the mass-murderer.

Breivik, a right-wing, anti-muslim extremist, was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012.

It the harshest possible prison sentence available under the Norwegian justice system and it is likely he will remain in prison for the rest of his life.

Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands.

In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3.

It emerged that he had issued a typed list of 12 demands to authorities at the high-security unit in Skien in southeast Norway where he is serving out his sentence.

The demands - outlined in a letter sent to the the French national newsagency AFP  - included better conditions for his daily walk and the right to communicate more freely with the outside world, which he argues are in line with European rights legislation.

He also demanded that his PlayStation 2 games console be upgraded to a Playstation 3 'with access to more adult games that I get to choose myself'.

Held apart from other prisoners since 2011 for security reasons, Breivik argued in the letter sent in November, last year, that he has the right to a wider 'selection of activities' than other inmates to compensate for his strict isolation.
