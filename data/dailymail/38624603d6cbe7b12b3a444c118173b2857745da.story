An online fund to help frail pensioner Alan Barnes after he was mugged has been halted  with donations standing at more than £329,000.

Beautician Katie Cutler said there will be a presentation in due course when a cheque will be handed over to the 4ft 6in visually-impaired 67-year-old.

Ms Cutler, 21, wrote on the Alan Barnes Fund page: 'Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family, they have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund.

'He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so i'll keep you all updated. X'

The fund exceeded all expectation and has now been stopped at the request of Mr Barnes and his family after it topped more than £329,526

In all, 24,748 well-wishers donated a total of £329,526, at an average of just over £13 each.

Frail Mr Barnes was pushing his bin  outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear earlier this month when he  was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed.

A mugger then demanded money and searched Mr Barnes' pockets before realising his stricken victim was not carrying cash and fleeing.

Mr Barnes stumbled to the house next door where his neighbour called his sister Carol, who rushed over and took her brother to hospital, where X-rays revealed the fractured collar bone.

Mr Barnes, a committed Christian, said at the time: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again. 

Mr Barnes's broken collar-bone will take nearly two months to heal, in which time he will need special care. 

He is now too frightened to return to his home, and Ms Hill is helping her brother look for new accommodation.

After hearing of the attack, local beautician Ms Cutler set up the fund, expecting to make £50,000 to help with Mr Barnes recovery and his potential home move.

But, after the story was widely reported, money flooded in and has now reached such an amount that the family have asked for it to be stopped.

Commenting on how the money would be spent, Mr Barnes said: 'A solicitor  has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.'

He later added: 'I don't know what I will do with the money yet, I think that is a question for a long time down the road. I will have to have a big think about it as it's such a huge figure.

'I can tell you one thing, it won't be wasted, I am always very careful with money and won't be spending it on flashy holidays, I just want to feel safe again.' 

People have called Ms Cutler a hero and there is an online campaign for her to receive an OBE.

A fund was set up by well-wishers to thank her for the consideration she showed for Mr Barnes, but she will give the £1,500 away to charity. 

She said: 'I have had a lifetime of compliments within a few days and it really warms your heart, it is lovely. I do find it hard, people calling me a hero - I definitely don't think that is right.'

The thug who attacked Mr Barnes is now one of Tyneside's most wanted criminals, a leading officer has said.

Chief Inspector Mick Lillico has urged the would-be robber to hand himself in and warned that every Northumbria Police officer is now looking for the crook, as police remain determined to see him caught.
