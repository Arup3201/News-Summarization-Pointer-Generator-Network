She may have had her dancing shoes on for not one but TWO parties last night but that didn't stop Princess Beatrice from grabbing a good seat at Wimbledon.

The busy royal has been spotted at today's quarter-final match between Sabine Lisicki of Germany and Simona Halep of Romania.

Beatrice joins star studded spectators including cousin Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge in her Wimbledon whites.

Does she ever sleep? Beatrice wasted no time in heading to her next social event - today's Wimbledon quarter-finals

Other audience members include Cliff Richard, Trevor McDonald and  Kim Sears who is unmissable in a hot pink dress.

Beatrice went for a tamer look at today's Wimbledon, following her showstopping ballgown at the Serpentine Gallery's Summer Party last night.

The 25-year-old Princess opted for a conservative navy dress paired with a monochrome blazer but kept her look updated by adding an edgy studded belt.

Beatrice is accompanied by her long-term boyfriend David Clark who she appears to be inseparable from having visited the Chiltern Firehouse together last night.

However it isn't just Wimbledon that is keeping the Royal busy.

The young Princess is fast becoming known as  the Royal Family's most enthusiastic social butterfly, attending London's most star-studded parties night after night.

Already this week the 25-year-old has frequented the Chiltern Firehouse, the Serpentine Summer Ball and The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party - and it's only Wednesday.

Seemingly
 taking tips from her good friend Cara Delevingne, who is a notorious 
party girl, the stylish young royal, who is fast earning herself a 
reputation as quite the fashionista, joined some of Britain's finest models for the Serpentine Gallery 
Summer Party in London's Kensington Gardens last night with her sister, Eugenie - who isn't far behind her in the social stakes.

Leading the way was Beatrice, whose sweeping organza 50's dress, complete with leather flowers by Nicholas Oakwell, caught the eye as she posed for photos before making her way inside.

With
 its subtle white and pink tones the gown perfectly accentuated her pale
 skin tone, which was offset with rather vibrant shade of red lipstick.  

Strappy
 lilac heels rounded things off, while a distinctive square cut clutch 
bag added an extra dimension to the overall ensemble.

She joined a throng of A-list stars such as Bradley Cooper, Cara Delevingne and Naomi Campbell at the glittering event.

Clearly not ready for bed, Princess Bea headed to celebrity haunt, The Chiltern Firehouse, with boyfriend Dave Clark and younger sister, Eugenie.

less stylish

It was surprising that Beatrice opted to stay out so late, considering that she had been out at another event the night before.

The young royal looked on-trend in a colourful boxy A-line skirt and white blouse as she attended The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party event in London on Monday night.

The event, which was supported by Jaeger-LeCoultre and hosted by Heather Kerzner, took place at The Royal Hospital Chelsea. 

The
 25-year-old cousin of Princes Harry and William showed off her tanned 
and toned legs in the short skirt and accessorised her outfit with a 
chunky gold necklace and blue court shoes.

Look who popped in too! Princess Eugenie is clearly trying to keep up with her sister in the social stakes and was seen at The Chiltern Firehouse late last night, too

Stylish, as always: Princess Beatrice of York cut an elegant figure as she attended The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party on Monday night

Strike a pose: The young Royal looked confident as she posed for cameras, seemingly leaving her boyfriend, Dave Clarke, at home

The young socialite, who often 
represents the royal camp at glamorous charity events, mingled with the 
likes of Clive Owen and Heather Kerzner.

It's been a sociable few week for Bea. Fresh
 off a winning turn at the Royal Ascot last week, the Princess cut an elegant
 figure when she stepped out for a London party honouring jewellery 
designer and socialite Eugenie Niarchos last Tuesday.

The redhead arrived at Notting Hill's Greek eatery Mazi in a 
knee-length black dress and trendy Topshop tassel jacket.

The week before that, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were both at Royal Ascot on two consecutive days, where they joined the rest of their family for a Pimms-fuelled day out.

The sociable sisters also attended the Buckingham Palace Garden Party earlier this month alongside the Duchess of Cambridge and the Trooping The Colour.
