Elena Butterfield, 26, has been cleared of being in charge of a dog which was dangerously out of control after her pet bit a police horse on the tail

When Elena Butterfield let her dog Louis off his leash in the park, she could not have imagined the chaos that would follow.

An exciteable Louis, on seeing a police horse for the first time, bit it, signalling the start of a ten-month ordeal for Miss Butterfield, who said the experience made her feel suicidal.

The young barrister was prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act and told Louis could be put down. But after ten months of anxiety, it took magistrates just hours to clear her of any wrongdoing after they ruled she did everything possible to prevent the clash.

Miss Butterfield, 26, sobbed as she described how a walk in Greenwich Park, South-East London, in January spiralled out of control.

The University College London graduate said she had begun letting four-year-old Staffordshire terrier Louis off the lead only three months earlier. But when he saw horses ‘for the first time’, he ran towards them, wagging his tail.

Speaking at Bexley Magistrates’ Court, Miss Butterfield said Louis turned aggressive when he was kicked by a horse and the police riders shouted: ‘Woman, control your dog!’ She said: ‘I called him immediately, but obviously he was distracted by this incredible creature he had never seen before.

‘I immediately ran over and called his name calmly, but assertively. He was just excited, I wouldn’t say he was fearful. Immediately the officers stopped the horses and shouted, “remove your dog!” I shouted, “Louis, come here!”

‘He was excited and distracted, but not showing signs of aggression. He was just curious and excited. Very quickly, the horses started kicking.’ Miss Butterfield said she feared for her safety as she tried to rescue Louis.

‘They were circling their horses, so I had to keep moving. I was worried I would find myself underneath the horses,’ she said. ‘They were absolutely furious. I said to them: “Please help me – I don’t know what to do. I’m trying to get my dog”. I actually begged them for help.

‘Throughout the incident, they were bawling at me: “Woman: control your dog!”’

A passer-by eventually intervened and tackled the dog before picking him up. Miss Butterfield said Louis calmed down as soon as he could not see the horses. The clash left a police horse called Quixote with an injury to his shoulder.

Choking back tears, Miss Butterfield added: ‘It has really affected my confidence. I really just thought, “I want to throw myself off a train”. I felt like I had no way out because how could I defend myself in front of police officers?’

Asked if Louis liked people, she added: ‘That’s who he likes best of all. He just wants to cuddle you. He jumps into strangers’ laps.

‘He brings people together. He’s got charisma.’

Earlier Met Police horse trainer Alistair Blamire, who was riding Quixote, said the dog was ‘aggressive’ and ‘jumping up’.

Speaking about Miss Butterfield, he said: ‘She didn’t seem to say much at all. I think she was very nervous and there wasn’t too much communication from her.

‘By this time the horse was becoming more and more agitated and . . . I was becoming more and more concerned – not only for the horse but also for me.’

Magistrate Maureen Anderson cleared Miss Butterfield of allowing her dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place and owning a dangerous dog.

She said: ‘We have read an expert’s report that your dog is not dangerous. We believe you did as much as you could under the circumstances that you could have.’
