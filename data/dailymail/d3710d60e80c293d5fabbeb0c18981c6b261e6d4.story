A campaign group in a village that was split over noisy church bells branded 'prejudicial to health' believes it has come up with a solution - a device to make them ring more gently.

The bells at St Mary's Church in Ashwell, Herts have been chiming every 15 minutes for around 118 years.

But a row broke out in the village after some families complained when the bells started again after being silenced for repairs two years ago.

Following an investigation by North Herts District Council it decided the chimes were 'prejudicial to health' with some villagers claiming they couldn't get a good night's sleep.

Last December Ashwell Parish Council stopped them chiming every 15 minutes between 11pm and 7am to avoid being issued with a noise abatement notice, but they could still ring on the hour. 

Chairman of Ashwell Parish Council Mark White confirmed that Save Ashwell Church Chimes had raised £3000 funds for the new device.

A Diocese of St Albans spokesman said the clock chimes are the responsibility of the parish council, but the chancellor of the diocese would have to give permission for the device to be fitted.  

After the decision by the council, campaign group Save Ashwell Church Chimes called for a referendum and it was given 'at least six months' to find another solution.

The group said it believes it has now found a compromise 

Wayne Francis, of Clockwise Restorations designed a hammer device to control the volume of the chimes overnight.

Francis, who has an engineering background and has worked on church bells before, contacted Brown to offer the solution.

He plans to fit a different hammer which will produce a softer sound when it strikes the bells. The hammer will be controlled by a timer already fitted in the clock tower to switch off the chimes at night.

The device is adjustable so he can ensure the chimes are below the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation 

Campaigner Maria Brown said everyone who had seen the prototype was impressed and the disagreement 'should be resolved soon'. 

The mother-of-two said: 'We worked so hard to save the chimes and find a solution to please as many people as possible.

'This device is really good news. I hope there are no objections and we get good new on January 13 as it is also my birthday.'

Brown, who now lives in St Neots, Cambs added: 'When we would go out as teenagers we would listen for the chimes so we knew when we had to be home.

'People who live in towns might not understand it, but the chimes are part of village life. It was such a shame a minority felt they had to spoils it for everyone else. But there were people having disturbed sleep. 

'No one wanted to lose chimes all together - even the people who could not sleep.'

But Gwen Pack, 80, who has brought up her children in the village, said she has become 'disillusioned' by the ongoing row.

The retired post office worker said: 'I don't know why people move into a village knowing there are bells and country smells and then moan about it.

'I have lived here very many years and I miss the chimes when they are not working. It is part of village life.

'I am so disillusioned about it. My son and I have stopped talking about it.'  

The bells, which chime through St Mary's clock mechanism, have been ringing since around 1896.

Grade I listed St Mary's church was built during the 14th century and its tower is the tallest in Hertfordshire with its wood and leaden spike rising to 76 ft (53.6m).

The church was presented with a three-faced clock by Mr J Westrope in 1896. It is said the side facing The Bury was left blank so that the Bury and Brewery workers would not be clockwatchers.  

Brown added: 'It's an unbelievable device, because unlike others that churches have used, it doesn't muffle the hammer, which quietens the bells 24/7.

'Perhaps with a mechanism like this, maybe other churches around the country may one day see the end to Noise Abatement Order on their bells.' 

She added: 'If this device is installed and solves the problem then we plan to approach other churches where bells have been silenced.'

St Mary’s is one of a number of churches to have been silenced in recent years following bell noise complaints.

In September, St Martin’s Church in Liskeard, Cornwall, was at threat of being silenced after a complaint from a resident who lived 300 yards away.

Graham Dutnall, 60, recorded the bells' sound at at 85 decibels, as loud as passing traffic, and told the council they were 'destroying his peace and quiet'.

Last year, meanwhile, the bells of All Saints’ Church in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire, were silenced from 11pm to 7am after a single complaint from a resident whose sleep was being disturbed.

But church leaders said the automated system, which meant the bells went off once an hour, could not be set to operate at specific times and so would have to be deactivated.

A month before this, an environment protection team suggested St Andrew Blackadder Church, in North Berwick, East Lothian, silenced its bells between the same hours. This again stemmed from a single complaint.

In 2011, a pensioner confronted a group of six professional bell-ringers before locking them in a church tower after the noise took its toll.

The unknown elderly man swore at the group having climbed the narrow staircase to the belfry of St John the Evangelist Church in Sharow, near Ripon, North Yorkshire.

After protesting to the bell-ringers - who had travelled from the south of England especially - and threatening to damage their cars, the man then closed the door to the tower and wedged it shut with a piece of wood, leaving the half-dozen musicians, aged between 46 and 65, trapped.

They were shut in for half an hour on Sunday before being freed by a member of the church who heard banging from the trapdoor when she went to lock up.
