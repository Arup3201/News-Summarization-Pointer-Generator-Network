Taco Bell has recently launched their new breakfast menu in the U.S. but its president has promised that it will soon also come to Canada - on one condition.

Fast food chain President Brian Niccol said Taco Bell would introduce breakfast in Canada if they 'take Justin Bieber back'.

The brilliant stipulation came as a response to a Canadian Taco Bell fan during an Ask Me Anything session on website Reddit.

Mr Niccol, who took to the social networking site in conjunction with Taco Bell's introduction of their breakfast menu also revealed that sales in Colorado has increased with 420 per cent since marijuana was legalised in the U.S. state.

The long anticipated breakfast menu features novelties like a waffle taco, and unsurprisingly, Canadian Taco Bell customers wants in.

Redditor user bordss posted 'Only to America? When is this coming to Canada?'

Mr Niccol's response was simple: 'When you take Justin Bieber back'.

The Taco Bell president's partaking in the Reddit AMA is just the latest move in the fast food chain's outreach to promote their new menu.

Earlier this week, Taco Bell begun airing ads Thursday that feature everyday men who happen to have the same name as their main competitor McDonald's mascot - Ronald McDonald.

High numbers: Mr Niccol also revealed that the sales increase in Colorado since the legalization of marijuana was 420 per cent, a term which refers to the consumption of cannabis or approval of marijuana culture

Taco Bell 
found around 400 men and women with the name Ronald McDonald, Ronnie 
McDonald or some variation.

A few dozen were selected to
 represent different regions around the country including Bossier City, 
Louisiana; Chicago; Dubuque, Iowa; Kane, Pennsylvania and Worcester, 
Massachusetts.

The men 
show their approval of the food with comments like, 'It's not messy' and
 'Mmm, wow' and 'Mmm, real good' and 'It has everything I like.'

In case it wasn't clear, tiny print at
 the end of the ad notes that, 'These Ronald McDonalds are not 
affiliated with McDonald's Corporation and were individually selected as
 paid endorsers of Taco Bell Breakfast.'

'We like to do things with a wink and smile,' Mr Niccol said. 'We have a sense of humor.'

The chain, owned by Yum Brands Inc. of
 Louisville, Kentucky, is looking to boost sales by opening most of its 
roughly 6,000 U.S. stores a few hours earlier at 7am starting this week.

But Taco Bell has a 
long way to go to catch up with McDonald's, the No. 1 player in 
breakfast with about 31 per cent of the category, according to market 
researcher Technomic.

The
 popularity of Egg McMuffins and other items have been a consistent 
sales driver for McDonald's over the years, with breakfast accounting 
for about 20 per cent of the company's U.S. sales.

By
 comparison, a Yum executive has said that breakfast accounted for just 4
 per cent of sales when it was being tested at Taco Bell stores in 
select markets.

That 
was before national marketing began, however, and Taco Bell president 
Brian Niccol said in a phone interview that the goal was to get the 
figure to a level 'much greater than that.'
