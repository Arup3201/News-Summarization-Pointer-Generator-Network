Becoming a victim of sexual abuse is horrific enough, but for many young people, their ordeal is compounded by having to give evidence against their attacker in court.

It was recommended to the government 25 years ago that no young witness should 
have to give their evidence in a court room unless they wish to. Instead, they may chose to give their evidence via video link.

However, according to NSPCC figures, for 99 per cent, giving video evidence still requires them to go to the court building. Even though they won't have to face their attacker in the actual court room, they still fear bumping into them or their supporters in the building. Others are left in despair after enduring brutal and confusing cross-examination by defence lawyers. 

Traumatic: Young victims of sexual abuse often still have to attend a court building to give their evidence via video link, leading to fears they may bump into their attacker (posed by model)

One young person who had to go through this ordeal was teenager Rhiannon (not her real name to protect her true identity), from the Midlands, who had to go to court after being sexually assaulted.

She explains: 'I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a man who had groomed me. He was arrested in 2013 along with a gang of men who had abused other girls but I had to wait six months for the trial against them to start.

'The wait made me feel scared as I wanted it all to be over and done with. He lived opposite my house before he was arrested and every time I looked at the place it reminded me of what he had done to me.

'I turned 15 while I was waiting for the trial but I couldn't enjoy my birthday as that's all I kept thinking about.

'I was only told the trial date two days before it started so that made me panic even more as I didn't feel like I had long enough to prepare myself.'

Rhiannon had to travel to a court in London to give evidence and she said the whole experience was daunting and unpleasant. 

She said: 'I was given the chance to do a video link but I didn't want the offenders to see my face so I decided to give evidence from behind a curtain instead. I had visited the room before so I knew where I would be standing and I went behind the curtain before everyone else went into the court.

'My video evidence had already been played to the court but the defendant's barrister kept asking me questions that I'd already covered in the video. He kept asking the same questions again and I got confused because he said things like, "He didn't do that, did he".

'I have dyslexia so I sometimes get muddled up and I said "no" initially. I got confused as to what I needed to answer. This upset me and made me cry.

'He also asked me questions about the defendant touching me and I felt embarrassed to answer so I just nodded. I'd talked about this in my video evidence and having to go over it again made me cry.'

The victim said the judge over the proceedings did step in at times which made her feel better and she was allowed to take a break to be comforted by her mother who had accompanied her.

Under pressure: Rhiannon said being cross examined by barristers was upsetting (posed by model)

Rhiannon said the ordeal could have been made easier if she had been better prepared for what to expect before she attended court.

The NSPCC believe the situation could also be improved if the government would allow victims to give evidence via video link without having to be in the court building.

The charity are appalled that this is often allowed for criminals - who can give video evidence from prison.

Via a freedom of Information request, they discovered that prisoners are 200 times more likely to 
have the benefit of using video links during criminal proceedings than a
 child witness.

Last
 year, those accused of committing offences made 50,000 'remote' court 
appearances from their prison cells.

These included, Ian Watkins, who 
conspired to rape babies, Stuart Hazell, the killer of schoolgirl Tia 
Sharpe and David Minto, who stabbed a 16-year-old to death.

Yet
 fewer than 2503 of the 21,000 young victims who gave evidence - 
including those who had been sexually or physically abused - had the 
same opportunity of using a remote video link to save them the trauma of
 going to court. 

Peter Wanless, chief executive of the 
NSPCC, said: 'If remote links are good enough for those accused of crimes
 then why on earth are they not available for all child witnesses? This 
imbalance in the judicial system is both astonishing and appalling.

'Everyone
 seems to agree that the young victims of crime should get every 
assistance possible when giving their evidence yet here we have a gaping
 hole in the system that needs to be plugged immediately.

'The
 courts are rightly using remote video links from prisons to save money 
and improve security. But this technology should also be used to help 
vulnerable children give evidence. This will reduce the intense 
emotional strain they are put under and allow them to give their best 
evidence – which is in the interests of justice.'

As part of its recently launched 'Order 
in Court' campaign, which aims to ease the trauma of child witnesses, 
the NSPCC is calling on government to ensure they all have the chance to
 give evidence via a video link which is set-up away from a court 
building.

Last year ChildLine, which is run by the
 NSPCC, received 1200 calls from children worried about giving 
evidence in court.

Balance the system: The NSPCC want more child victims to be allowed to give video link evidence away from court rooms - something that is afforded to many criminals who can give their evidence from prison (posed by model)

One girl told their counsellors: 'I'm trying to block 
things out at the moment so I've been self-harming. It helps me forget 
about how stressed I am. I've got a court case coming up and I have to 
give evidence against the person who abused me. The thought of it makes 
me want to run and hide.'

One 
mother described her sons as being 'slayed' by the barrister's cross
 examination when they gave evidence against their violent father in court.

She said: 'The boys were really worried about coming face to face with their 
father in the court building. Even just turning down a corridor and 
actually seeing him face to face was more of an anxiety than the 
questioning.'

After Rhiannon gave her evidence, she had a long wait until her attacker was eventually found guilty and imprisoned for 12 years. Once again, she found she was given little support during this difficult time.

She said: 'No-one from the police came to our house to discuss how he was found guilty until a few days later - by then it had been in all of the local newspapers.

'We also had to wait over a month for him to be sentenced as one of the jury was off sick. The wait was hard as I just wanted it to be all over. No-one from court or the police called us to tell us that he had been jailed for 12 years, we only knew as mum went to the court to hear the sentencing.'

She added: 'It was nine months from when he was arrested to when he was sentenced. It was a long wait and it made it harder to start my recovery as it was always in the back of my mind. Every time I walked out of the house I was reminded of what happened to me as I could see where he had lived.'

Rhiannon was able to gain support from the NSPCC after her social worker referred her to their 'Protect and Respect' programme, which helps girls protect themselves from sexual exploitation.

The programme teaches young girls the importance of communicating with their parents. It also covers the techniques abusers use to groom people and how girls can learn to avoid it.

Rhiannon said the programme has been a great help. She said: 'I'm not over what happened to me and it will be with me no matter what.

'There are times when I cry my eyes out and I'm depressed but I know I've got to carry on with my life and working with the NSPCC is helping me.

'It gives me someone to talk to and helps me open up to my mum about what happened so that she can help me recover too.

'I'm also learning how to keep myself safe from grooming in the future. Now some days I can have fun and smile and I have things that I am looking forward to. I know my birthday this year will be better than last year.'

The NSPCC are urging people to sign an e-petition calling on the UK Government to ensure there is at least one remote site for children to give evidence in each region.
