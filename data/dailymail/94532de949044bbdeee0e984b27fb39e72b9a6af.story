There were no standing ovations yesterday or headline mentions on the prime-time news for Steve Darcis.

Instead it was the largely anonymous grind on the unforgiving proving grounds of the Wimbledon qualifying event at Roehampton — a world far removed from the limelight he enjoyed 12 months ago.

As he battled away in the  second preliminary round against Germany’s Daniel Brands — finally losing 3-6,  7-5, 6-2 at 8.15pm in front  of barely a dozen spectators — the scene could hardly have  contrasted more sharply with the first round proper last year, when he sensationally beat world No 1 Rafael Nadal in straight sets on Court No 1.

The Curse? Steve Darcis has suffered a miserable nine months since beating Rafael Nadal at SW19

After beating Nadal we quickly came to know that he was nicknamed ‘Shark’ (because of a tattoo on his shoulder),  the  experience providing him with the biggest high of his career.

That turned out to be the  precursor to a miserable nine months. In fact, you could say that Darcis is just one victim of what might be termed the Curse of Wimbledon 2013.

How else to describe the  subsequent woes of so many who made a splash at what was a dramatic Championships?

Men’s champion Andy Murray, semi-finalists Juan Martin Del Potro and Jerzy Janowicz, Roger Federer’s  conqueror Sergiy Stakhovsky, women’s finalist Sabine Lisicki, standout home performer Laura Robson — not much has gone right for any of them since.

For Darcis, a genial 30-year-old from Liege, the fall has been steeper than most and was more immediate, for he did not even get to play in the next round after dumping out Nadal — who had come into the tournament having swept all before him for months. Darcis’s  problems have been with his shoulder and he barely had time to take in the scale of his achievement against Nadal before starting to fear the worst.

Grass roots: After winning Wimbledon, Andy Murray has undergone back surgery and hasn't won a title since

‘I was staying in a house in Wimbledon Village and I went out to an Italian restaurant with a party of about 10 other Belgian players and coaches that evening,’ he recalled. ‘A lot of people recognised me in there, which was great because it does not happen so much, but inside I knew already that my shoulder was really bad and I couldn’t sleep. I had to say everything was fine in public, but I was ready to pull out.’

He duly did so, and after a period of rest followed by further attempts at playing, he succumbed to what had been looking inevitable: surgery on his right shoulder.

When it took place, on October 10, they found a tear in a tendon almost a centimetre long. In fact, it was fairly miraculous he had soldiered on for so long. The news left Darcis worried for his future in the game, let alone when he might come back.

Under the knife: Laura Robson reached the fourth round last year but is set to miss the rest of the season after surgery on her wrist

‘Beating Rafa was the biggest win but it was the start of the worst period of my career, it has been very tough,’ he revealed.

‘I wasn’t confident about being able to come back at all after the surgery, I am just glad to be back here and am grateful they gave me the wildcard into qualifying.

‘I am as physically fit as I have ever been because for  five months I did nothing but physical work, it was very frustrating. I started practising again in early April.’

He came into Wimbledon qualifying having played only one professional tournament, a tiny Futures-level event in Belgium where he managed to reach the final.

Downward spiral: Sabine Lisicki has not won two consecutive matches this year after reaching last year's final

It is evident that he still  cannot serve with his old potency, but he is grateful for small mercies.

‘After what the surgeon said when he saw what was wrong with my shoulder, there was a doubt I would play again, so I can only be happy with being back here at all,’ he said.

During the dark winter months, he broadly resisted the temptation to wallow in  nostalgia and re-watch his great match against Nadal.

Andy Murray (champion) Needed a back operation and has not won a title since.Jerzy Janowicz (semi-finalist) Lost eight straight matches from February to May, slipped to 24th in the rankings.Juan Martin Del Potro (semi-finalist)  Had left wrist surgery in March, out at least until September.Sergiy Stakhovsky (beat Roger Federer) Still only 89th in the rankings, has railed against upheavals in his beloved Ukraine.Sabine Lisicki (finalist) Has not won more than two consecutive matches this year, faces huge drop from ranking of 19th.Laura Robson (fourth round) Had wrist surgery after Australia and will miss most of the season.

With the grass relatively lush and fresh that day, the two-time champion simply could not get sufficient purchase on his groundstrokes and the flair of Darcis completely deflated him by the end.

‘I did watch the match one time, just after the operation,’ said Darcis. ‘My main memory is that I tried to keep going for it even when I was nervous. I had to attack because you can’t stick on the baseline against Rafa.

Grass isn't greener: Steve Darcis was told he may never play tennis again after surgery on his shoulder

‘Mentally it is very tough  against him because there is always the fear that he is going to come back.

‘When I won the first set I thought, “If I lose in four I’ve still played a good match”. And when I won the second I thought, “If I lose in five I have still made it a good match”.

‘Even when I went out to serve for the match at 5-4 in the third there were thoughts that if I don’t win this set he might beat me. It was only when I got to  40-15 in that game that I thought, “I’m going to do this”’.’

As with several others who made their name at Wimbledon 2013, Darcis has found there have been great challenges since.
