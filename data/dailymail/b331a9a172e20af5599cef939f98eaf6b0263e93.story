Passengers in cars and taxis are being exposed to air pollution up to 15 times greater than cyclists and pedestrians on busy city streets, a new study has found.

Travelling inside a vehicle could be much worse than cycling by the kerb or walking on the pavement because emissions are highest in the centre of the carriageway, where vehicles suck in dirty air from those in front, scientists say.

Their shocking findings were revealed following an experiment by a group of five MPs who sit on the Government’s cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC).

Each was provided with a gadget to measure airborne pollution levels, as well as a GPS tracker device, by scientists from King’s College London, who analysed where pollution was at its highest during their travels across London and in their constituencies over a week in July.

By far the highest levels of tiny particles of ‘black carbon’ or deadly soot breathed in by the MPs was during taxi journeys in cities.

On average each inhaled around 50 million particles per breath while inside a cab in London, around seven times more than the six to seven million particles per breath inhaled while walking around Whitehall or Oxford Street, and 15 times greater than levels recorded outside their eventual destination City Hall where, on leaving the cab, levels fell to three million particles per breath.

The findings are worrying because persistent inhalation of air pollution and traffic emissions have been linked to lower life expectancy and serious illnesses, including heart disease and cancer, as well as low birth weights and stunted lung development in children. 

Ben Barratt, a lecturer and air quality scientist at King’s College, said that air pollutants, such as black carbon, nitrogen dioxide and the toxic leftovers of inefficiently burnt fuel, were highest in the middle of a carriageway and in the first two to three feet above the road, dropping off nearer to the kerb and pavement.

‘Travelling in vehicles gave the greatest average exposure,’ Dr Barratt said.

‘When you are in a vehicle, nose to tail with those in front, you are right in the middle of the source of the pollution.

‘Vehicles close together suck in each other’s emissions.

‘The air intakes are in the engine compartment close to road level, so they pick up the fumes emitted by the vehicle in front of them. Open windows are another route.’

Dr Barratt said often dirty air became trapped in cars and taxis, whereas cyclists and pedestrians had a constant ‘flow of air’ breezing in from all directions around them. 

The MPs who took part in the research were chairwoman of the EAC Joan Walley, fellow Labour MPs Alan Whitehead and Mike Kane, and Conservatives Caroline Nokes and Matthew Offord.

They are investigating why diesel engines, which are now recognised as some of the worst pollutants, were mistakenly promoted by officials as environmentally friendly.

On Wednesday, London Mayor Boris Johnson will appear before the EAC to explain why the capital persistently breaches EU standards on pollution levels.

Mr Johnson is expected to announce an new initiative – Breathe Better Together – where commuters will be asked to work from home or use bikes, trains and buses instead of cars and taxis when air pollution levels are highest.

However, it is not just in London where pollution is a problem. Mrs Walley’s monitor saw her inhale more than 80 million particles per breath during a car journey in her Stoke-on-Trent North constituency, while Mr Kane was exposed to 20 million particles per breath during a cab ride in Manchester.

Mrs Walley said: ‘Our monitoring equipment showed that people in vehicles were far more exposed to air pollution than they would be walking.

‘Car makers test exhaust emissions but this raises a question about whether they should also be considering air quality inside vehicles.’

Research suggests that up to 29,000 premature deaths are caused each year in Britain by pollution - 10 times the number of people killed in road accidents.

Those who live in big cities have a lower life expectancy, studies have found, because of poor air quality. London has by far the worst air pollution problem in the country - in 2010, 3,389 people died and 41,404 years of life were lost as a result of air pollution in the capital, according to Public Health England.

The biggest concern is the tiny bits of carbon - around 30 times smaller than a human hair - which are so small they can get into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, passing through major organs, such as the heart and brain.

They can have immediate effects on people with existing health conditions, triggering asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes.

But, worryingly, pollution can also cause diseases in healthy individuals, such as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and even cancer.
