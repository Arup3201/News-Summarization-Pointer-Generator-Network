A woman has been seriously injured and three show dogs killed after a lorry smashed into a broken down motor-home on one of Britain's busiest motorways.

The incident on the M40 near Banbury in Oxfordshire, shut all three lanes of the northbound carriageway for almost 10 hours yesterday.

Several corgis escaped from the vehicle, which had broken down on the hard shoulder, and caused problems on the motorway after the lorry jack-knifed at 5.40am.

Smash: The remains of the motorhome, which had contained 12 dogs, can be seen here as police surround the crash site on the M40

Carnage: Three of the dogs died in the collision, which occurred at 5.40am on Saturday

Response: Emergency services personnel investigate the scene on the motorway while all three northbound lanes were closed

Two other women, named by the Canine Chronicle as dog enthusiasts Lisa Croft-Elliot and Carrie Russell-Smith, were treated at the scene.

The third, believed to be their assistant, is understood to have suffered a broken leg in the crash, along with a suspected collapsed lung and other fractures.

The crash shut all three lanes of the carriageway after the lorry jack-knifed, according to police.

Traffic heading southbound was also disrupted after several dogs which were in the motor-home at the time escaped from the wreckage and ran off, West Mercia Police said.

One of the dogs - a male black and white Cardigan Corgi - was initially unaccounted for but was traced safe and well by the owners some hours after the crash, following an appeal on Twitter, Facebook and the Dog Lost website.

Inspector Helen Thomas, of West Mercia Police, said: 'A call was received at 5.40am reporting a collision on the M40 motorway northbound between junctions 11 and 12.

'A heavy goods vehicle collided with a motor-home which was stationary on the hard shoulder while it was awaiting recovery. It contained three people and 12 dogs.

'The HGV jack-knifed blocking all three lanes of the carriageway.

Clean-up: A woman can be seen sitting in the wreckage while the emergency services operation continues into the night

Recovery: Two people were trapped in the motorhome, but were rescued by fire crew

'A full closure from junction 11 northbound followed and ambulance, fire brigade and highways attended. A number of the dogs escaped from the vehicle and ran off causing problems on the southbound carriageway.

'Three people suffered injuries; two minor and a third sustaining a broken leg.'

She added the northbound carriageway was expected to remain closed until later this afternoon.

Escaped: The dogs that escaped from the motor-home were corgis (file picture)

A Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said that the two of the people travelling in the motor-home were trapped and had to be rescued by fire crews.

The woman who found the dog that was initially unaccounted for, Anna Halcro-Johnston, an animal behavioural specialist, said that having set out to find the corgi, whose name was Darren, she spoke with a passing lorry driver who had seen the animal, and directed her to it.

She described the reunion, later, with its owner as 'happy and tearful', adding 'there was lots of tail-wagging'.

'Knowing we've saved them from some of the day's heartache was enormously rewarding,' she said.

A spokesman for the RAC said they were en-route to recover the caravan when the crash occured.

He said: 'We are extremely saddened to learn that a young woman has been injured and that three dogs have lost their lives as a result of this incident.

'We had despatched a specialist recovery vehicle to attend, but unfortunately the accident occurred while the vehicle was en route to the scene.'
