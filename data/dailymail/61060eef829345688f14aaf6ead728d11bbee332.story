Australian teenage tennis sensation Nick Kyrgios was in no mood to talk to a member of one of the biggest boy bands in the world after his defeat against Andy Murray at the Australian Open.

The 19-year-old walked straight past Niall Horan from One Direction while making his way to his changing room at Melbourne Park, while the Irish singer was left doing a double take.

In video footage from after the game, Horan, 21, appeared to try and catch Kyrgios’s eye, with his Rod Laver Arena minder in yellow also trying to catch the tennis star’s attention.

But Kyrgios just kept on walking, ignoring Horan, who was dressed in a red shirt, blue shorts and a black cap, and his entourage.

In the post-match interview, Murray said that he had seen Kyrgios perform over the past 18 months, and that he had 'seen how dangerous Nick is'. 

'I wasn't going to underestimate him,' he said.

Murray said that he knew what it was like to be a teenager in the spotlight, and implored the Australian public to let the young tennis star to grow.

'Try not to put too much pressure on him. He needs to be able to mature and develop. He'll make mistakes, he's young, and growing up in the spotlight isn't easy,' Murray said.

l keep learning and getting better. He's an incredibly talent, not many people have done what he's done at his age,' he said.

The 19-year-old said that the experience had been stressful but also enjoyable, and that his focus going ahead was going to be on staying healthy and enjoying the games he played.

Kyrgios sent out a thank you message on Twitter to his fans after the game 

The player said Murray was 'just too good on the night' 

'I'm happy I got as far as I did. It was a great experience,' Kyrgios said in his post-match interview. 'This is why I play the game, to play these kind of tournaments,' he said.

Kyrgios said that he was still 'growing into' his body, but took his increased level of fitness compared with his performance at Wimbledon as a positive. 

'These [the top five seeded players] are incredible athletes, they're really on another level,' Kyrgios said. The 19-year-old said he had felt very supported by the mainly Australian crowd during the match, but that he had tried to focus on his game rather than the thousands of spectators.

'I definitely felt the support...it's one of the best courts in the world,' he said.

Murray's measured and calculated game won him the match in the end, securing his victory 6-3 against Kyrgios.

Tennis prodigy Kyrgios last year claimed hip hop star Drake's music was to blame for his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon.

Admitting his a fan of the rapper Kyrgios blamed his bad start and general lacklustre performance on the music he was listening to before the first set.

'I came out really flat, so hopefully I won’t listen to that again! It was actually Drake. Didn’t do the job for me,' Kyrgios said after the game.
