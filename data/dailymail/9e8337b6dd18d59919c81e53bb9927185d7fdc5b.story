This is the incredible moment an unborn baby gave his parents a 'thumbs up' from the womb during a routine 20-week scan.

Paul Schofield, 31, and Cheryl Stevenson, 32, from Tameside, Greater Manchester, were left in fits of giggles after their healthy unborn son presented them with the hand gesture.

Nurses carrying out the ultrasound at Saint Mary's Hospital in Manchester told the couple they had never seen such a clear signal during a scan before.

The couple, who have been together for five years and already have an 18-month-old son called Cameron (together above), thanked hospital staff for managing to capture the unique scan photo at just the right time

As well as receiving the unexpected stamp of approval from their unborn baby, the couple also discovered the sex of their child – and were delighted to be told they were having a boy.

The pair, who have been together for five years and already have an 18-month-old son called Cameron, thanked staff for managing to capture the photo at exactly the right time.

Mr Schofield, a manager at a conservatory company, said: 'It was all so clear. The midwife spent 15 minutes with Cheryl and the scan was very comprehensive. They check for an awful lot of things and you get 360 degree images.

'He was moving back and forth a lot and when it came to the end of the scan, they asked us if we wanted to know the sex, which we did. Then they asked us if we wanted some pictures.

'He immediately curled up into a ball and put his face down and at first we couldn't get a clear picture. We were gutted. But as soon as the midwife said she would have to wrap things up, his little hand came out and he gave us the thumbs up.

'We all burst into laughter. The midwife said she had seen a few hand gestures in her time but nothing as clear and forthright as this. It brought a great deal of happiness to our day.'

He added: 'It was a unique experience that we wanted to share - and it was a great way of him telling us that we are doing a good job by him so far.'

Ms Stevenson, who admitted the couple have not yet chosen a name for the newborn, said the baby was moving around constantly during the scan.

She said: 'It was really surprising. People have asked me if it is real.

'It's a prized memento and he must be having fun in there to be giving us the thumbs up.'

It is not the first time unborn babies have been captured on camera having fun in the womb.

Leo David Hargreaves, who was born last year, was snapped smiling in a 4D scan image revealed by his proud parents Leighton Hargreaves and Amy Cregg, from Accrington.

And John and Charlotte Steel, from Stockport, revealed a scan which appeared to show their unborn son laughing and rocking back and forth.
