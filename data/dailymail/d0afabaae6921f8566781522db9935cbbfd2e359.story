The parents of Justina Pelletier, who has been hospitalized with a mysterious illness since February 2013, have been denied a request to see their teenage daughter on Mother's Day.

Lou and Linda Pelletier lost custody of 15-year-old Justina in March after a judge ruled that they were interfering with her care and treatment.

Mrs Pelletier says the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, which now oversees Justina's care and welfare, will not allow her to see her daughter today, citing 'unspecified reasons,' according to WFXT-TV.

Denied: Justina Pelletier will not be able to see her parents Lou and Lindon for Mother's Day after social workers denied the parents' request for a visit

Justina is staying at Wayside Youth & Family Support Network in Framingham, Massachusetts -  nearly 90 miles from the Pelletiers' home in West Hartford, Connecticut.

The Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz outlined a plan that could reunite the Pelletier family as soon as next week and see Mr and Mrs Pelletier regain custody of their daughter.

A judge made Justina a ward of the state in March after officials at Boston Children's Hospital and social workers claimed that her parents were interfering with her care.

The Pelletiers believe Justina suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness. 

However, Boston Children's Hospital 
doctors say she has a mental condition called Somatoform Disorder, a 
stress-related mental illness where people 'imagine they are ill.'

The case has garnered international attention because it raised questions over who knew best how to care for Justina - her parents or social workers.

Next week, officials plan to move the teen to JRI Susan Wayne Center for Excellence in Thompson, Connecticut - much closer to her parents.

It's the first step in a program to turn the teen back over to the custody of her parents.

The parents must have visits with Justina at JRI, complete a care plan from her doctors at Tufts Medical Center, attend family therapy and meet with state social workers to review progress.
