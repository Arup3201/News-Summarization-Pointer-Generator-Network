She has courted international controversy by turning herself into a human doll using plastic surgery and thick layers of dramatic make-up, confessing she wishes to be considered 'the most perfect woman on the internet'.

With her pinched waist, skeletal arms, enormous coloured contact lenses and vacant expression, Ukraine's Valeria Lukyanova, 23, believes she has become a living, breathing Barbie, something she sees as the ultimate embodiment of perfection. But how well do we really know her?

A VICE documentary-makerÂ has gone behind the scenes with Valeria - who currently has 876,000 fans on her Facebook page - journeying to Ukraine to capture her idiosyncratic life on film.

Creepy crawlies: Valeria Lukyanova in a VICE photoshoot which she took part in alongside their documentary film about her life

'I'd seen her like everyone else when 
she popped up on the internet with all those bewildering and bizarre 
images and videos,' VICE director Will Fairman told MailOnline. 'And thought there had to be something more behind it all, because I could see little flecks of esoteric stuff.

'I followed it up and discovered she was a new age opera composer and gave seminars on spirituality, so she obviously had a 
few more strings to her bow than just being a tumblr girl.'

Will negotiated coming to the Ukraine to film Valeria, despite the model being 'a little bit skeptical' at first.

'I think she was probably protection herself,' said Will. 'She'd appeared on various talk shows in the past and they were mainly trying to do one on her, so there was a lot of back and forth. We finally secured coming over when we said we'd focus on her spiritual and astral theories.'

Valeria believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't quite sure - so isn't really human like the rest of us.

I am not human: Valeria believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't sure - and so isn't actually human

'She's not a fraud,' clarified Will. 'She genuinely believes she's from another planet. 100 per cent. She's not making any money from her life - not even from the seminars she gives - which is originally why I thought she was doing this.'

Valeria, who is supported by her construction-working husband who also acts as her manager, spends the film discussing theories about her pre-Earth space life, and how she has become an object of hatred within some internet communities.

'I come from a place where only love and joy exist,' she says. 'But I noticed the media is only interested in negativity: show someone in a bad light, show someone's mistakes.

'There are hate blogs and communities about me who post bad pictures about me and try and worsen my mood.

'Perhaps
 at some point I was an energy vampire, because I constantly received 
their negative reactions and enjoyed it. Specifically for them I created
 posts that would make them angry.

'But people who think badly of me just aren't happy in their own lives. When they are happy they will forget about me.'

Perfection: Will says Valeria holds herself in the way we see her all the time, and never lets her 'character' drop

I hear voices: Valeria, at home, admitting on film that she hears voices and sees 'different beings', which is why she has been to see a psychiatrist

Valeria, who says she has a 'small group of friends who accept me for who I am', also admits she has visited a psychiatrist about the voices in her head. But just the once. She is not in therapy.

She said: 'I asked myself if everything was alright with my head. I hear voices all 
the time and see different beings. One day I decided to visit a 
psychiatrist. I told him everything.

'He listened to me carefully and 
said it was very lucky it was him because with another doctor I definitely 
would have been taken to a special place.

But he said, "I've been 
studying esoterism for years and can see you are psychic".'

Will said: 'Valeria manages her appearance down to the finest detail, which is why something so tiny as a missing belt can trigger a stroke'

On film: Valeria has said in the past that she has neck problems, which is why it's always flopped to one side

Describing how he found Valeria, Will added: 'She's kind of like the really pretty,
popular girl at school who you're completely blown away by.

'She's like a little queen, and 
she carries herself like that all the time. She never breaks. It's not like the camera turns off and she whips out a cigarette and gets into a tracksuit.

'She's naturally like that: a girl who has been getting attention ever since she was a teenager and gets crazy attention wherever she is.

'And she is paranoid about not looking perfect. I don't know exactly where it comes from, but I suspect 
really it's down to... she seems to have a quite a lot of issues about her 
physical self, and is incredibly fixated with her image.

'She manages it 
down to the finest detail, which is why something so much as a missing belt can trigger a stroke.'
