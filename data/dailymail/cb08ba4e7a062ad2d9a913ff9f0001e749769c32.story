PSV frontman Memphis Depay has been tipped to  match Arjen Robben and even touted as a better player than Cristiano Ronaldo at the same age.

With 16 Eredivisie strikes to his name, the 21-year-old winger has stormed to the top of the goalscoring charts this season and even found the net for Holland at the World Cup in Brazil last summer.

Wanted by Manchester United and Tottenham, Depay may well depart the Philips Stadion at the end of the season after PSV admitted it may be difficult to keep him at the club. 

Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to about the exciting Dutch hotshot.

The 21-year-old is the current leading goalscorer in the Eredivisie having scored 16 league goals this season

Early years and PSV Eindhoven

Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six  before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later.

The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to  PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial.

Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants.

Playing style

Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign.

Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot.

Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents.

However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long.

Top of the scoring charts 

Depay's strike during Saturday's 3-0 win away at Go Ahead Eagles was his 16th of the season and took him to the top of the Eredivisie goalscoring charts - one  ahead of PSV team-mate Luuk De Jong. An impressive feat for a player who is not an all-out attacker.

The No 7 has enjoyed a steady flow of goals during the last two seasons and has found the net 19 times in all competitions this term.

Scoring four braces, Depay's goals from out wide have helped fire PSV eleven points clear at the top of the Eredivisie table and will have certainly caught the eye of Europe's biggest clubs.

Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo?

While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age.

Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better.

'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.'

Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so.

'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn.

'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.'

Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top.

'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.'

International star and World Cup goalscorer

Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later.

The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over  Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B.

Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

Standing out in the crowd

As well as his supreme talent, Depay catches the eye with his large collection of tattoos. The young PSV star even has the inside of his lip inked.

On his left arm, the winger has artwork dedicated to his grandfather who passed away the day after Depay's 15th birthday.

On the move? 

With Manchester United keen, and Tottenham even putting in a £14.6million bid for the winger, PSV general director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact Depay is likely to leave the club when the next transfer window opens in June.

Speaking last week, Gerbrands told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'Tottenham were willing to offer €20m (£14.6m) for Depay. We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.'

Depay's team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum has also been linked with a summer switch to French champions PSG and Gerdbrands is expecting bids for the midfield duo.

'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' the PSV director said. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.'
