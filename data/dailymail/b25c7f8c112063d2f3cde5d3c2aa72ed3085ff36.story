There was a bookies on Barking Road, behind which sits the Boleyn Ground, who offered the keys to the shop if West Ham beat Manchester City 7-0 and Joe Cole scored the opener last season.

After they were thrashed 6-0 in the first leg of their Capital One Cup tie, the return fixture became more of a joke than a serious match.

It was not just those two games, the second of which they still lost 3-0, where West Ham struggled against City.

The head-to-head between the pair during last campaign makes painful reading for West Hams fans; played four, conceded 14, scored just one goal.

But this season there will be a very different feel to the game when West Ham host the  Premier League champions in the early kick-off on Saturday.

For a start, West Ham are fourth in the table after a scintillating, if somewhat surprising, start.

Over the summer they added Alex Song to their central midfield on loan from Barcelona where he played, albeit infrequently, and trained every day with the likes of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi.

Their two attacking summer signings have swiftly created a formidable force up front, where in the past they lacked strikers, especially in the absence of Andy Carroll.

Diafra Sakho, signed from Boulogne for £3.5million, has scored in six successive games while Enner Valencia, who cost £12m from Mexican side Pachuca, has netted twice. Last campaign, West Ham's highest scorer, Kevin Nolan, finished the season with seven.

'We've got a different team and a different set of players,' manager Sam Allardyce said ahead of this weekend's match.

'Everyone still talks about the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, but there was little we could do with the injuries we had.'

City manager Manuel Pellegrini would surely have preferred not to play a lunch-time league match after flying more than 3,000 miles to Russia and back for their Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night.

In the freezing temperature, and strange environment of a Khimki Arena stadium supposedly closed to fans by UEFA but with a few hundred home supporters gaining access, City threw away a two-goal lead late on to make the journey back to Manchester a far more sombre trip.

West Ham are by no means getting carried away with their league position – players and the manager openly admit they are under no illusions they will finish in the top four.

But Allardyce has spotted a chink in City's armour and has a front two at his disposal who together create, on current form, one of the most lethal weapons in the league.

'If we're going to challenge against them it's this moment in time,' he added. 'City have just come back from playing in the Champions League and we're in good, confident form.

'It's about the players going out and producing their top level, playing like they did versus Liverpool and nullifying their outstanding attacking force, which is a lot better than Liverpool's.

'Can we keep it quiet? If we can, they've concede a goal or two. Our approach is we must contain that very talented forward line.'

Sam Allardyce has led West Ham to fourth in the Premier League after 13 points from eight games

City boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping they can repeat the form they showed over the Hammers last year

The 'goals against' column from their head-to-head last year would suggest not, but Alvaro Negredo scored five of those 14 and he has been loaned to Valencia.

David Silva scored one and Sergio Aguero bagged two as City tore them to pieces in the league at the Boleyn Ground.

And it is stopping the Argentina striker, who has put his injury problems behind him to score eight times in the past five games, including four against Tottenham last season, that Allardyce sees as the key to winning the match.

'You saw a fully fit Aguero last week against Spurs,' he explained. 'Not only scoring four but he missed a penalty as well. Sometimes he's unstoppable.

'We've got to focus on limiting service to him. The lads in front of defence can make life difficult. That's the key element to keeping him quiet.

'Even being marked he can receive the ball and wriggle free and is a fantastic finisher.'

The odds of Aguero scoring first in this encounter will be slim, but West Ham will certainly not be odds-on to lose this time.
