Hundreds of descendants of notorious bush ranger Ned Kelly gathered at a Catholic church in Australia today for a final farewell to the controversial outlaw, 132 years after his death.

Mourners, including Kelly's great-grand-niece Joanne Griffiths and great-grandnephew Anthony Griffiths, stood by a funeral car carrying Kelly's remains as they prepared to send him off with a traditional service at St Patrick's Church in Wangaratta, north-east Victoria, in line with his dying wish.

His bones - minus his skull, which remains missing - will be buried in an unmarked grave at a private ceremony reportedly alongside his mother and siblings, in Greta, near Glenrowan this Sunday.

Parish priest Monsignor John White led the mass, reading prayers and blessing Kelly's remains - which lay in a black, gold-handled coffin adorned with roses and a green sash to indicate his Irish ancestry - with holy water.

Msgnr White acknowledged the moment was 'a most significant and historical day in an old Australian story.'

He said he was deeply moved to preside over the requiem of Kelly, for whom he had a life-long interest.

He also told the 300-strong congregation of the public divide around the Kelly legend: 'Thus it has been and thus it will be.'

Kelly's descendants said the memorial is about giving peace to Edward Kelly, their beloved ancestor who died aged 25, not Ned Kelly, the outlaw. The order of service booklet named the memorial a 'Mass of Thanksgiving' for the hugely popular Kelly.

Kelly was hanged at Old Melbourne Gaol on November 11, 1880, for killing three police officers.

The location of his remains was a mystery until late 2011, when scientists used DNA testing to identify Kelly's bones as those of a skeleton exhumed from a mass grave at the former Pentridge Prison site.

His family, the Kelly Gang, became a 
symbol for social tensions between poor Irish settlers and the wealthy 
establishment at the time.

Although
many saw him as a simple criminal, Kelly became a folk hero in the 
Irish community for standing up to the Anglo-Australian ruling class.

Kelly's descendants said the private farewells were in keeping with the outlaw's requests.

Brendan Cooke, Kelly's great- great- grand-nephew spoke to media before the service. He told of his pride at being able to finally fulfill Kelly's final wish of a Catholic funeral and to be buried in consecrated ground.

Mr Cooke said today's ceremony would not touch on any criminal elements of Kelly's life: 'He and his family were proud and they had a great deal of grit and they stood up to the establishment.".

Joanne Griffiths, the great-granddaughter of Kelly's sister, Grace, was also dressed in all green, including a sash to represent the sash Kelly was awarded after he saved a child from drowning.

The first reading at the mass was from the book of Wisdom, beginning: 'The virtuous man, though he die before his time, will find rest.

Rest in peace: Kelly's remains were first buried in a mass grave at Melbourne jail. When that closed in 1929, Kelly's bones were exhumed and reburied in another mass grave at the newer Pentridge

Nearly Headless Ned: It is said that the remains of Ned Kelly will be laid to rest in an unmarked grave alongside his mother and several of his siblings, despite his head still missing

Kelly's
remains were first buried in a mass grave at Melbourne jail. When that 
closed in 1929, Kelly's bones were exhumed and reburied in another mass 
grave at the newer Pentridge Prison.

All
the bones buried in Pentridge yard were exhumed in 2009 and Kelly's 
skeleton was positively identified in 2011 by scientists after DNA tests
against his great-niece.

Kelly's skull remains missing. It was believed to have been separated from his skeleton during the transfer.

His
life story inspired the Booker Prize winning novel 'True History of the
Kelly Gang' by Peter Carey, which won the 2001 Booker Prize, and the 
late actor Heath Ledger played him in 2003 film Ned Kelly.

Australia's most infamous criminal Ned Kelly holds a gun in Melbourne

Edward 'Ned' Kelly was the first son of Irish convict John 'Red' Kelly, who moved to Australia in 1848.

Ned was born in Beveridge, just north of Melbourne, some time between June 1854 and June 1855.

At the age of 14, Ned was arrested for the first time for assaulting a Chinese pig farmer.

Ned had numerous run-ins with the police over the years, starting when he was 14 and arrested for allegedly assaulting a Chinese man.

The year after, he was arrested again, this time for being a suspected accomplice of robber Harry Power. Both these charges were dismissed, but it was too late: Ned had come to the attention of the police.

Some years later a police officer went to the Kelly home, hoping to arrest Ned's brother Dan for stealing horses.

The officer claimed that when he turned up he was shot in the wrist by Ned, although it was unclear whether Ned was even present at the time. Ned's mother Ellen was arrested for aiding and abetting an attempted murder and sentenced to three years

Ned and other members of his family went into hiding and hoped by starting up a whiskey distillery they could earn enough money to appeal their mother's sentence.

But the police were hot on their heels. Four officers were dispatched to track them down and Ned ended up killing three of them, officially becoming an outlaw.

He went on to rob two banks before police finally caught up with him. Ned was hanged on November 11, 1880. His last words were ‘Such is life’.

Despite being a violent career criminal, many consider him to symbolise the Australian spirit - an endearing underdog not afraid to challenge authority.

He once wrote an 8,000 word letter, later used against him at trial, in which he explained he was forced into a life of crime by situations beyond his control.
