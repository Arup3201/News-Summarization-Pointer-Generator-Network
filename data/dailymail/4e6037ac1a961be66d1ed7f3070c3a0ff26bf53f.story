Warning: General Martin Dempsey has said an Israeli strike would come too late to crush Iran's nuclear programme

An Israeli strike would come too late to crush Iran’s nuclear programme, according to America’s top military chief.

General Martin Dempsey said such an attack would ‘clearly delay but probably not destroy’ Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

Speaking from London, where he was with a U.S. delegation visiting the Paralympic Games, it was the strongest comment yet from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff distancing America from a possible unilateral attack by Israel.

Israel is believed to be planning a military strike ahead of November's Presidential elections.

Barack Obama would be under pressure to support the attack - even though military chiefs are against it - for fear of alienating Jewish voters in key swing states such as Florida.

Emphasizing Washington’s position, General Dempsey - America's most senior general - added: 'I don’t want to be complicit if they (Israel) decide to do it.’

And he said there was a worry that the international coalition putting pressure on Tehran ‘could be undone if Iran was attacked prematurely.’

He insisted that sanctions were having an effect and should be given a reasonable chance of succeeding.

His comments came on the same day that the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had doubled its number of centrifuges and accelerated nuclear fuel production – a clear sign that it is pressing ahead with its nuclear plans.

In private, America has repeatedly warned Israel that it does not have the military capability to destroy Iran’s main underground, heavily fortified nuclear site.

While the U.S. does have the firepower, it wants to give sanctions more time to work.

On Syria, General Dempsey dismissed the feasibility of a humanitarian buffer zone within the country, saying there was no comparison with the uprising in Libya.

Any countries enforcing a no-fly zone in the area would also have the responsibility of providing protection against Syrian missiles, he said.

Like Britain, the U.S. was providing ‘non-lethal’ aid to Syrian rebels, but he said he was concerned that a failed state would only add to growing fears in the West that the civil war was attracting al Qaeda and extreme jihadists.

In Israel yesterday, Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon said he feared Iran did not believe it faced a real military threat from the West because of mixed messages from the US and other foreign powers.

'We have an exchange of views, including with our friends in the United States, who in our opinion, are in part responsible for this feeling in Iran.

'There are many cracks in the ring closing tighter on Iran. We criticise this,' he said.
