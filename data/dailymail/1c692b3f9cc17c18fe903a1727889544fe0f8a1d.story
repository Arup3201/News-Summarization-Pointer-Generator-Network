This is the moment a mysterious flying object was caught on camera as it hovered in the night sky.

Footage of the UFO - a dome-shaped object with pulsating lights - was taken from outside a home in Tynemouth, North Tyneside. 

Craig Lowther, a venture capitalist, said he was letting his dog into the garden at about 11.30pm on Monday when he spotted the unidentified object hanging in the distance.

Mysterious: This flying object was caught on camera as it hovered in the night sky over Tynemouth

Pulsating: Craig Lowther spotted the UFO as he was letting his dog out into the back garden on Monday

He went back inside to grab his camera in the hope of taking a closer look at the flying object - and managed to capture it on film.

The object, which is made up of flashing white and purple lights, hovers in the sky for two minutes while Mr Lowther records its movements.

The 43-year-old told Chronicle Live that he originally thought it was a plane travelling on 'an unusual flight path'.

But he quickly realised it was 'an unusual colour for a plane' and 'it was not moving as you would expect a plane to move'. 

Mr Lowther said it was at this point he went into his house to find his video camera.

He said: 'I used the zoom so I could get a better look, and what I saw surprised me. It appeared to be a dome with a bulge in the middle and it had pulsating lights on it.

'I am out at night a lot walking the dog but this was like nothing I have ever seen before.' 

Flickering: The video first shows this speck of white light apparently flying somewhere in the distance

Hovering: The shape grows and appears to move closer to the camera - transforming into this purple dome

Clear: Mr Lowther continues to film as it hovers for two minutes and moves erratically across the sky

In the video, the object at first looks like a white speck of light that is somewhere in the distance. 

It then grows larger, and transforms into a diamond, or dome shape, as it hovers closer to the camera.

The UFO appears to glow purple and white in the night sky, with a light quality that resembles static on a TV screen. 

Mr Lowther continues to film as it disappears back into the distance, before once again reappearing. 

Last month, a similar unidentified object was captured as it hovered in the sky over Tynemouth. 

In the video, posted on YouTube, the white pulsating light hovers in the sky, much like in Mr Lowther's footage, but it never grows into a larger object.

And in 2006, another UFO was photographed by a man in nearby Northumberland. The spooky shot was captured by two men as they were taking photos of the sunset.
