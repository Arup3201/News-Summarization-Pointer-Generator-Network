As she stepped on stage at the finals of the Miss Great Britain pageant last weekend, few would have guessed that winner Shelby Tribble, 21, lacked confidence.

But Miss Tribble, who describes herself as 'painfully shy', says she not only had to overcome a lack of confidence, she also had to deal with the legacy of being bullied at school.

According to the glamorous 21-year-old, from Plymouth in Devon, cruel school bullies taunted her about her shyness and left her feeling less confident than ever.

She suffered bullying throughout school due to her intense shyness and lack of confidence 

But all that changed when she was pulled out of a crowd by a talent spotter while visiting the Clothes Show Live with her mother.

Then 15, the shy youngster was persuaded to enter the Teen Queen beauty pageant - and was amazed when she came second.

Miss Tribble, of Plymouth, Devon, says that was enough to turn the tables on her tormentors and begin the journey to her Miss Great Britain crown.

'I was painfully shy when I was younger and used to get bullied until one day I decided that I wasn't going to put up with it any more and decided to prove the bullies wrong,' she explains.

''I never used to stand up for myself but now I would not allow it any more because I'm a lot stronger.' 

The 21-year-old was spotted when out one day with her mother and says modelling and competing in pageants has help rebuild her confidence 

Shelby, here competing in Miss Great Britain as Miss South West before she won, has not always been so self confident 

The model originally wanted to become a Team GB diver and joined her local team on the same day as future Olympic hero Tom Daley.

As a child she suffered a collapsed lung and needed emergency surgery, before turning to diving in a bid to boost her recovery.

Miss Tribble, who now lives in London, also modelled part time for fashion student friends and squeezed in assignments at weekends.

Eventually, she decided to move to London to pursue modelling full-time but even then, her mother Karen, 50, says she was still inexplicably shy.

'It was to do with her confidence again because she's quite a perfectionist and never thought she was good enough so she would stress over it,' she explains.

'After a bad night out when she came home upset, I said to her that everyone was always saying that she should go to London and do some modelling and why didn't she give it a go.

'So she moved to London, worked full time and started doing the modelling on weekends. It was really difficult at first because she was up there on her own and it's a big place.'

But the blonde has never looked back and has since won Miss Great Britain and Miss Hippodrome, as well as completing modelling assignments for men's magazines.

Miss Tribble has also appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, has starred in several TV ads and has been signed up with two modelling agencies.

Now dating Barnsley footballer Conor Hourihane, a delighted Miss Tribble added: 'If you know what you want to do you've just got to go chase it and even though it's hard work and sometimes takes a long time to get there, you can do it.

'I've worked so hard and sometimes things haven't worked out but I don't let it get me down, I just carry on to the next thing and keep going.'
