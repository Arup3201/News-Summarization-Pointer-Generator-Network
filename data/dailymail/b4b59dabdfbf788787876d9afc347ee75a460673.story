There are still dangerously high radiation levels at Japan’s crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor – but now the plant’s owner is able to see the normally invisible threat.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has created a prototype ‘Super-wide Angle Compton Camera’ capable of creating images of gamma ray-emitting radioactive particles.

This equipment is based on the gamma ray-observing sensor technology to be added to the agency’s next X-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-H.

It is expected to be able to create visual images of radioactive particles that have collected at high altitudes such as building roofs where it is difficult to conduct measurements with existing equipment.

It can also detect particles that have widely dispersed on the ground and residential houses.

Last month  JAXA, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency and the plant’s owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company conducted a successful field test of the camera at the Kusano area of Iitate village in Fukushima Prefecture.

The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan triggered was triggered by a giant tsunami

Radioactive contamination from the Fukushima power plant disaster has been detected in the Pacific Ocean more than 370 miles off the Japanese coast.

Samples of plants, plankton and ocean water showed levels of the liquid metal caesium were almost 1,000 times greater than normal.

But although the readings, taken three months after the meltdown in March last year, were high radiation risks are only a tenth of those generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.

Dr Ken Buesseler, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and colleagues said radioactive elements were detected in zoop

At the moment there is still fatally high radiation levels at the plant and much less water to cool it than officials had thought, according to an internal examination.

The news has renewed doubts about the plant's stability and provoked fears the other two reactors that had meltdowns could be in even worse shape.

A tool equipped with a tiny video camera, a thermometer, a dosimeter and a water gauge was used to assess damage inside the No. 2 reactor's containment chamber for the second time since the tsunami swept into the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant a year ago.

The No. 2 reactor is the only one officials have been able to closely examine so far.

The data collected showed the damage from the disaster is so severe, the plant operator will have to develop special equipment and technology to tolerate the harsh environment and decommission the plant, a process expected to last decades.
