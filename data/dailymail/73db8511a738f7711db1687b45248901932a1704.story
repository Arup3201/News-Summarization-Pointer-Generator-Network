Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence's character in The Hunger Games, is arguably the coolest girl in the world right now.

And now you can copy her look thanks to a new clothing line designed by the film's costume designer.

Capitol Couture by Trish Summerville consists of 19 ready-to-wear pieces, as well as jewellery and leather goods inspired by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

The Hunger Games look: Capitol Couture by Trish 
Summerville, a Hunger Games-inspired collection, will land on 
Net-a-porter on November 21

The collection, which will be available exclusively on Net-a-porter from November 21, comprises of dresses and separates, including a laser-cut patent dress, leather bomber jacket, silk and leather jumpsuit and slogan T-shirts printed with with Katniss' trademark arrows.

Speaking about her new range, which ranges from £60 to £800, Trish Summerville said: 'I am extremely proud of the designs that we created for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and there’s no partner more appropriate for Capitol Couture than the world’s most cutting-edge luxury retailer.'

Big project: 'We're delighted to provide our 
customers with the chance to purchase limited-edition pieces designed by
one of the most original costume designers in the industry today' said a
spokesman for the range

A spokesperson for Net-a-porter, said: 'When we were approached by Lionsgate to offer the collection by Trish Summerville to our customers exclusively, we jumped at the chance. 

'Our customers take their style cues from myriad sources, from the latest runway shows and street trends to TV and film.

'Fashion plays an important role in The Hunger Games series and is especially prevalent in Catching Fire, and fans of the franchise will see the film reference in the collection. 

'This is also brilliant fashion in its own right, and we’re delighted to provide our customers with the chance to purchase limited-edition pieces designed by one of the most original costume designers in the industry today.'

Katniss style: The collection comprises of dresses and separates including a laser-cut patent dress (£800), faux fur trimmed wool coat (£550) and a jacquard trimmed twill jumpsuit (£350)

Earlier this year, Summerville was honored as Costume Designer of the Year for her work for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire at the 10th Annual Style Awards.

Summerville has also won the Costumer Designer’s Guild Award for her work on director David Fincher’s 2011 film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

She has designed award-winning costumes for music videos from top recording artists including Justin Timberlake, Pink, Janet Jackson and The Black Eyed Peas.

Speaking about the range, fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones says: 'I think this collection really embodies the power and strength of the characters within the film. Sharp silhouettes, sleek tailoring and the cut - away shapes would be great for creating the perfect dramatic AW look.'

Stylist Jane North added: 'It's cool but I just don't think I could justify spending £800 on a jumpsuit!

'The jewellery is really lovely though and would make a great stocking filler.'

The fashion odds are ever in your favour: Leather bomber jacket (£500), grey cotton T-shirt (£60), pendant necklace (£140)

Proud: Trish Summerville, who designed the costumes in the blockbuster, said there's no partner more appropriate for Capitol Couture than Net-a-porter

The
Hunger Games: Catching Fire is already drawing in rave reviews from

the US on November 22.

The first installment of the film was the 14th highest-grossing North American release of all time and  grossed nearly $700 (£343) million at the worldwide box office.
