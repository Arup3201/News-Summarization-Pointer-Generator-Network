If there was one complaint Ronny Deila could have filed about his team’s relentless domestic form in 2015: Craig Gordon hadn’t been warming up much for the task of keeping Inter Milan at bay.

Not a problem. Gordon’s incredible double save in the final minute of yesterday’ s win over St Johnstone confirmed that the Celtic No 1’s brilliance has not been dulled one bit by the tranquil days spent watching his team tot up a streak of eight victories.

Gordon conceded a goal for the first time since a December 21 defeat to Dundee United, as Michael O’Halloran dragged Saints back into the contest and set up a final push.

With Celtic tiring on a poor pitch in their third game in a week and the hosts threatening a comeback, the champions were more vulnerable than at any stage of a run in which Gordon had been largely inactive.

That is when the Scotland keeper’s unflappable class came to the rescue. His strong right-handed block of a Brian Graham header from six yards was excellent. When Dave Mackay returned fire with a volley, his reaction was a world-class save with his left hand to force it over the bar.

It augurs well for what are likely to be his busiest engagements of the season: the Europa League last-32 ties against Inter, starting at Celtic Park on Thursday night.

And the last-ditch heroics slammed the door shut on any chink of hope that Aberdeen had of being able to close the league title gap today.

Leigh Griffiths and Stefan Johansen scored the goals that sent Celtic six points clear of the Dons, who visit Hamilton, and Inverness, winners at St Mirren yesterday.

If Deila’s men continue in the winning habit, it will be an inordinate ask for the pursuers to remain in touch. And should it turn into another title canter for Celtic, they can start entertaining themselves with a quickest goal competition.

That is, if they haven’t started already. Griffiths returned to the starting line-up to score after 35 seconds in Perth, beating new colleague Gary Mackay-Steven’s debut effort at Firhill by three ticks of the clock.

Griffiths, scorer in back-to-back weekend cup ties, missed Wednesday’s Premiership win over Partick through injury. His ankle was back in full working order and there was no chance that those scoring senses would ever be blunted by just a midweek break with the feet up.

Saints’ sleepy start aided the cause as Nir Bitton’s perfectly weighted long pass went right in between Steven Anderson and Tom Scobbie to feed Griffiths. The rest was textbook for a natural-born finisher as he tucked his fourth league goal of the season past Alan Mannus.

Griffiths had taken less than a minute to do what John Guidetti, the man he replaced from midweek, hasn’t achieved since November 30.

It’s going to be hard for the Swede to state a case for anything other than spending the bulk of his remaining loan period on the bench.

Celtic created plenty of openings with Johansen enjoying an instant rapport with his two new midfield colleagues Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong.

An enforced change did at least alter the intent of the home side and pose the threat of an equaliser.

Murray Davidson limped off with a calf injury and substitute Chris Kane accompanied Steven MacLean in attack. Kane was immediately in action, flashing a header narrowly wide from O’Halloran’s delivery.

Saints’ improvements still left them susceptible to the off-the-cuff class of Mackay-Steven, however. He and Armstrong have already been dubbed Zig and Zag because they do everything together.

It could be a name, too, for one of Mackay-Steven’s bewildering tricks and St Johnstone would have suffered from one such manoeuvre had Mannus not intervened.

A trademark shuffle carved him the space and his terrific left-foot strike was soaring into the top corner before Mannus kept Saints in the game with a fingertip save.

With their Italian test looming, Celtic wished to secure three points with the minimum of fuss and without suffering any key injuries.

The sight of van Dijk nursing a knock on his right foot gave cause for concern but Deila, who has higher hopes for Kris Commons facing Inter than Mikael Lustig, reported no fresh injury worries.

By the 52nd minute, it appeared they had achieved the other aim of the afternoon by going 2-0 ahead.

Armstrong clipped the ball into the box and Griffiths provided the knockdown for Johansen to take advantage of stand-off defending.

Neither Anderson, Scobbie nor Simon Lappin got close to the ball-juggling skills of Johansen, who then unleashed a deadly finish with the right boot.

It can’t be long before Player of the Year arguments begin and the Norwegian’s name is prominent. But, as Johansen pointed out post-match, you need match-winners at both ends and Gordon was required to turn into Celtic’s hero after St Johnstone brought the pressure.

Scobbie’s run and deflected cross gave Gordon a nightmare ball to handle across goal and on the bounce. He used his knees to see off that threat but couldn’t prevent O’Halloran hammering home the rebound from eight yards out.

Gordon’s proud streak of shut-outs and a run of 13 hours and 36 minutes without conceding had come to an end but he had no time or interest in dwelling on that personal setback.
