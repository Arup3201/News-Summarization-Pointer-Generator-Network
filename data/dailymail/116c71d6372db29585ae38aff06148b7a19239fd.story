Changing direction: King of Queens actress Leah Remini has decided to leave the Church of Scientology

King of Queens actress Leah Remini has reportedly quit Scientology over claims that she was interrogated by the church she has been devoted to for 30 years - along with pouring in millions of dollars in donations.

Remini, who starred in the hit sitcom for nine years, is believed to be dropping out of the organization as she is against its policy of barring members from questioning the authority of Scientology leader David Miscavige.

The rift began, a source told the New York Post, at the wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in 2006.

Remini allegedly
 asked about Miscavige's wife Shelly's absence from the event, causing former 
head of the Scientology Celebrity Center Tommy Davis to berate her.

According to a blog by ex-Scientology member Mike Rinder, Davis said: 'You don’t have the [bleeping] rank to ask about Shelly.'

Miscavige's wife has not been seen in public for six years.

The actress was then subsequently subjected to five years of 'thought modification', according to the Post.

Church friends, many of whom Remini had known for years, allegedly wrote reports on her and had her family investigated.

According to Mr Rinder's blog, Remini 'will no longer tolerate the squirreling and human rights abuses perpetrated in the church'.

Mr Rinder has yet to respond to a request for comment on his allegations from MailOnline.

However according to a contradictory blog post by Village Voice editor Tony Ortega on July 5, Remini remains loyal to the Scientology movement.

Ortega, who has investigated Scientology for 20 years, spoke to Remini's husband Angelo Pagán, who said neither he or his wife were at odds with the church and remained within the organization.

A Church of Scientology spokeperson told MailOnline: 'The Church respects the privacy of parishioners and has no comment about any individual Church member.' 

A lawyer who represented Remini last year has yet to respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

Leah Remini is one of the most recognizable faces of Scientology which boasts a wealth of celebrity members including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and Juliette Lewis.

In the past, Remini, who starred in the movie Old School and had bit parts in Friends and Cheers, has been an avid defender of the religion.

In an interview with CNN, she said of Scientology's critics:
 'If somebody is going to get turned off about something because of what
 they read or heard, then that person's not smart enough to even enter a
 church.

'If you're really against something, then know what you're against.'

Remini promoted the launch of a Hollywood museum backed by Scientology, named the  'Citizens Commission on Human Rights Psychiatry: An Industry of Death'. A key component of the Scientology movement is its stand against psychiatry.

Remini, who was born in Brooklyn, New York, has been involved in the church for around 30 years after her mother joined in the 1970s.

She married her King of Queens co-star Angelo Pagán in 2003 and the couple have a nine-year-old daughter Sofia Bella. The family lives in Los Angeles.
