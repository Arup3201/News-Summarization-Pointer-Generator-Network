A bride was left stunned when Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr and Matt Lucas wished her well on her wedding day - in an incredible video set up by her husband.

Ceri Williams, 27, says the surprise from groom Steven, 29, was 'amazing'.

The newlyweds form Cardiff Bay watched the star-studded 12 minute clip with friends and family at their reception last month.

Video messages compiled and produced by Steven even featured congratulations from British Lions and Wales captain Sam Warburton and Everton manager Roberto Martinez.

Guests at the reception last month were amazed by messages from Breaking Bad star Betsy Brandt, BBC Wales weather presenter Derek Brockway and Welsh rugby legend Adam Jones.

'He told me he was going to do something, but I didn't know it was going to be such a surprise,' said Ceri.

'I thought it was amazing and I couldn't believe it. But 10 minutes later it was still on, I was absolutely stunned.'

And
 Ceri, who works in marketing, was bowled over when former Wales and 
Scarlets outside-half Steven Jones appeared on the screen.

'I've always had a soft spot for him,' admits Ceri. 'My crush on Stephen Jones has become a bit of a running joke.'

Steven, who is originally from Llanrug, near Caernarfon, embarked upon the epic video project around a year before the ceremony. After establishing a dedicated Twitter account, he began to follow several dozen celebrities.

'Unlikely
 enough, quite a few of them followed me and asked what it was all 
about,' said Steven, who works for a volunteering charity.

'I
 tried to keep it to about three tweets a week but I didn't want to be 
overzealous. I just asked them to give me a bit of help and sent them a 
message to say what was going on. They either said yes or unfollowed 
me.'

As Steven's inbox 
began filling up with video messages, he called upon the help of friend 
Tom Naylor to help him edit and produce the final version.

'I'm lucky to have such good friends,' he said.

The video has attracted more than 6,250 views on YouTube after being posted earlier this month.

'I
 put it up on Facebook and I don't think I've seen anything that has 
been liked or commented on so much. It was all for Ceri but it was nice 
to get so many different reactions,' Steven added.

The couple have been together for three-and-a-half years after first meeting as work colleagues at the Wales Millennium Centre.

'We became really good friends,' said Ceri, who is originally from Llanelli.

'We
 stayed good friends and realised it was something more. They say the 
best marriages stem from friendship. He is definitely a character. He is
 so thoughtful in everything he does and he is so warm-hearted. He's 
really quirky and so creative as well.'

She
 added: 'It was something really heart-warming to see so many of these 
big names who must get contacted every day take the time to respond and 
help. I'm very lucky.'

After
 the wedding reception, at the King Arthur Hotel in Gower, the couple 
jetted off for a three-week honeymoon in America, visiting New York, Las
 Vegas and Florida.
