Confusion surrounds the death of a six-year-old Chicago boy who was fatally shot in the head on Friday while watching cartoons at home.

Michael Cattron III, who lost his mother and uncle to gun violence in the city earlier this year, died after his father left him and his cousins watching television while he stepped outside to smoke.

According to the call made to the 911 dispatcher, Cattron's father heard a 'pop' and rushed back inside to find his son lying in a pool of blood on the floor.

Death: Police believe that Michael Cattron III accidentally shot himself dead on Friday at his father's home

Police have said that they are trying to establish whether Cattron shot himself in the head or if one of his relatives fired the shot.

Police are currently investigating how the gun came to be in the possession of children but have said that they believe the shooting was accidental.

Indeed, this is just the latest tragedy for the  family.

Michael's mother, Jasmine Curry, was shot dead while pregnant driving in her car over the summer.

The 25-year-old mother of five died after a male driver opened fire on her van in July.

Friends believe she was not the intended target.

'It's disgusting, it's sad, and all I keep thinking about is her babies,' said Liz McElroy, a friend of the victim to ABC 7.

The boy's grandfather, Pierre Curry, was distraught at the news.

'It feels like I'm floating,' said Pierre Curry to the Chicago Tribune. 'I have to take deep, deep breaths. I just can't believe it.'

Admitting that everyone was 'fuzzy' about the circumstances surrounding the boy's death, Curry said that all he knew for certain was that his son stepped outside for a cigarette.

'He heard a popping sound, a boom. One boom,' said Curry to the Chicago Tribune. 'He came inside and saw him lying in front of the TV.'

According to his grandmother, Latonia Mardis, the boy accidentally shot himself dead.

'Michael went into a room, went through some boxes, found a gun, and shot [himself] in the head,' said Mardis, according to the Inquisitr.

Lost: Michael was a popular student and was watching cartoons with his relatives before his fatal shooting on Friday

'Now, he's dead. It's too much death in the family, killing. It's just terrible out here.' 

Another of Pierre Curry's sons was shot dead in August 2013 aged 17 while his third child died after an illness, aged 20.

'He loved everybody, he was happy. He liked to joke like his momma. It's a tragedy,' said Michael's grandmother, 43-year-old Latonia Mardis to the Chicago Tribune.
