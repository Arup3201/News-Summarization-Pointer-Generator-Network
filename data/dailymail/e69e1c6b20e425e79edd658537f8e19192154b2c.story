Compared to the regular gatherings of the Brownies and the bowls club at the village hall, the ‘relationship support meeting’ sounded a little unusual.

Quite how unusual only became apparent after the first few meetings at Trumpington near Cambridge.

The village hall had been used to hold a series of secret bondage classes. The workshops – complete with tea and biscuits – include ‘spanking’ and ‘flogging’, activities reputedly made popular by the success of the Fifty Shades Of Grey books.

Unlikely venue: The bondage day will be hosted at Trumpington Village Hall, which was founded in 1908 and usually hosts groups such as the Brownies and WI

According to a day programme, which 
has a £10 entrance fee, it will start with a guide to meet other 
‘kinksters’ and a class in caning.

‘Mr
 Allen will show you how to truly get a bottom’s attention with canes,’ 
the guide boasts, while ideas are given on the instruments ‘suitable for
 spanking both naughty and not-so-naughty bottoms’.

Bestseller?: The event will teach aspects of BDSM, popularised in E L James's popular series of novels

The
 programme ends with the note: ‘We’d very much appreciate it if you 
could help us to pack up – stack chairs, collapse tables.’

But when it came to booking the hall, organisers Peer Rope Cambridge, a bondage group, appear to have been a little less frank.

Hall
 manager Barbara Fernandez, 51, said: ‘The woman who made the booking 
said it was a “relationship support group meeting”.

'But it is not. It is
 bondage. It did not say bondage on the booking form. Some of our little
 old ladies who come to play bingo will be upset.’

Now all future classes have been cancelled. Hall trustee Philippa Slatter added: ‘We will be investigating.’

Peer Rope Cambridge has a policy of not commenting to the press.

An expert from a London tannery would
 have explained the intricacies of leather flogging devices, after which
 a choice was available between learning about the erotic applications 
of wax and a 30-minute class on nipples.

More advanced sessions towards the 
close of the event would have focused on electrified props including ‘violent 
wand devices’, and later there was a financial session – ‘kink on a budget’ - exploring 
‘ways to indulge in BDSM without breaking the bank’.

Attendees were warned on the group's website that they must stick to certain rules - including a 'no touching without asking' policy, and a 'no choking games' rule. Everyone must also always have access to 'a cutting tool' in case things go wrong.

They were also told to stick to 
'vanilla [non-BDSM] dress and manners until you are well inside the 
venue' so not to frighten the neighbours.

However, after the hall's trustees were made aware of the true activities they immediately withdrew permission to use the venue.
