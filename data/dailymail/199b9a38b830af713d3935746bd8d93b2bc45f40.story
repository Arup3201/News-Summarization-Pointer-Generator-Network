An Australian online retailer has come up with a novel way to keep bearded hipsters and long-haired lasses looking smooth when taking calls on their shiny new iPhone 6's. 

In the latest Apple controversy, people around the world have been complaining that the new smartphone is pulling out hair.

The social media hashtag  #Hairgate went viral  after allegations that new owners are getting their locks and beards 'snagged' between the aluminium and glass parts of the new phones when holding it to their faces.

But don't worry: If you were thinking of upgrading to Apple's latest yourself, apparently Kogan.com can shave you.  

In response, and on the back of a string of hoax advertisements suggesting the phone is good for shaving a woman's legs and trimming a man's facial hair, Australia's biggest online retailer is offering free razors with each new iPhone 6 purchased through its site.

'Don't tear your hair out looking for the best iPhone 6 deal — this is it,' says CEO Ruslan Kogan in a PR release. 'But it is a limited time offer. It might be hair today, gone tomorrow. You won’t find any other retailers able to trim this much off an iPhone 6 and provide you with a free shaver as well.'

'The last thing we want is Australians walking around with unsightly bald patches just because they wanted the latest smartphone,' said Kogan, nobly.

Claims: Chad Coleman was one of the first people to raise the issue on Twitter after complaining that his 'scruff' was being ripped 

Anger: Scott Bilsky blamed the seam where the aluminium meets the glass on his hair being pulled out 

Scandal: Hairgate is the latest controversy following bendgate - where users said the phone was bending when it was placed in a skinny jeans pocket or sat on

New iPhone 6 users first complained that their phones were bending in their back pockets or when wearing skinny jeans. This latest scandal, following on from 'bendgate', has led to a flurry of angry posts on Twitter under the hashtags #Hairgate and #Beardgate. 

'Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it when I make calls,' tweeted Chad Coleman

Paul Peavler complained: 'The seam on my iPhone where the aluminium meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out.' 

Others have said the phone 'has it all' and can save you money on going to the hairdressers.  

Response: The latest complaint led to some creating mock adverts, one was as a beard trimmer for men

Smooth: Another involved a woman apparently shaving her legs using the iPhone 6

Earlier this month, the electronics giant were forced to respond to complaints the phones were bending. 

Apple said its iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry. 

'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' said Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller 

Laban Roomes, CEO of Goldgenie, a company which customizes and gold plates the iPhones, said the only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time. 

Kogan.com's Founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan has denied rumours his entrepreneurial company would also begin offering reinforced jeans with online purchases of the iPhone 6 Plus.

Problem: Paul Peavler, blaming the design of the phone for the issue, referred to the problem as 'seamgate'

Attribute: Mo Jiwa put a positive spin on the newest perceived flaw saying the iPhone 6 is now the phone that 'does it all'

Economical: Another social media user said the problem could provide assistance to personal finances, as it would save you money on going to a hairdresser
