Schools across Australia have been slammed by outraged parents for becoming too cautious after it emerged that childhood games, loom bands and even bibles have been banned by some teachers.

It comes after a Queensland school decided to ban students from doing handstands and cartwheels which prompted outraged parents to reveal online what other things have been axed from their kids' schools.

Peregian Springs State School parents were advised in a recent school newsletter by deputy principal Sandy Cathcart that 'cheerleading-style' stunts were not allowed unless children were supervised.

Another distressed South Australian mother took to Facebook to reveal her child's school now insists all parents have a police clearance if they want to step into a classroom.

The decision to ban cartwheels was made after students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts

The mother filed her police clearance but realised it would take up to six weeks to be approved. 'For that time I am effectively not allowed in the classroom even for a few minutes,' she wrote.

The woman's sister posted the status onto Reddit where many Australian parents insisted that it should not be the case unless the parent is working at the school.

Meanwhile New South Wales primary schools are banning children from bringing loom bands to school to stop unfair swaps and sales.

The newest playground fad made from rubber bands has been banned at Sydney's North Balgowlah Public School.

Parents were warned via the school newsletter not to allow their children to bring the rubber bands to school.

While in Victoria the Education Department has banned religious organisations from running prayer groups and handing out Bibles in state schools during school hours.

A Melbourne primary school even temporarily banned the game 'tips' or 'tag' last year because a lack of fair play among the students.

'We can’t always win and no we don’t all get a prize and better to learn it now than when you are stepping out into that big wide world and you are told ‘no’ for the first time at 28,' a Facebook user told Kidspot.

Leather balls were banned from Albert Park Primary School near Melbourne in a bid to prevent any head injuries incurred during sports games.
