George Clooney has denied attending one of Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga bunga' sex parties but claims the Italian leader did show him his double bed.   

Speaking for the first time about the incident the actor said he had gone to meet Mr Berlusconi in Rome to discuss the possibility of Italy providing helicopters for the relief effort in Sudan.

But he told the Time magazine website the Italian Prime Minister seemed 
far more interested in socialising and begged him to stick around for a 
party.

Berlusconi in Rome to discuss the possibility of Italy providing 
helicopters for the relief effort in Sudan

He claimed 75-year-old Berlusconi led him up to his bedroom to show off a double bed given to him by Vladimir Putin.

Clooney said: 'I've had one evening with Berlusconi and it was one of the more astonishing evenings of my life.

'I went to speak about Darfur. I'd done my homework.

'He took me to see his bedroom and the bed that Putin gave him. It became a very different evening than anyone thought.

Berlusconi is accused of abusing the office of Prime Minister and paying for sex with an underage prostitute

'I was like  "I have to go" and he was
saying "where are you going there's going to be a party", and I was 
like 'No, I gotta go, I really do.'

Berlusconi's lawyers want the actor to appear as a witness during the Italian Prime Minister's trial.

He is accused of abusing the office of Prime Minister and paying for sexual intercourse with an underage girl.

The prostitute, nicknamed Ruby the Heart Stealer, claims Clooney had attended one of Belusconi's infamous 'bunga bunga' sex parties in Milan.

Clooney, who owns an 18th century villa in Northern Italy, flatly denied attending the event claiming the only time he has met with the Italian leader was at the 2008 meeting in Rome.

He said he would be happy to give evidence on behalf of Berlusconi.
