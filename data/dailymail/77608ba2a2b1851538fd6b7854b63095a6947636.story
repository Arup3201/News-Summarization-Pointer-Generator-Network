Former Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental was arrested, but later released after a court order

Former Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental was detained by a Delhi court on Tuesday in a case of alleged plagiarism, cheating and forgery.

However, he was later released from Tihar Jail on the Delhi High Court’s direction. 

In a case dating back to 2009, professor Pental has been accused by another Delhi University professor, P. Pardha Saradhi, of plagiarising his paper on biotechnology and publishing it as his own. 

Saradhi has also accused Pental of stealing genetically modified seeds from his laboratory for unauthorised research work. 

According to the police and Tihar Jail authorities, 63-year-old Pental was released from the prison at around 7.30pm after the High Court’s order was communicated to them. 

Pental was taken into custody and detained by the police earlier in the day after a magisterial court ordered his arrest. 

Charges 

Pental refuted all the charges against him and maintained that he is innocent. 

“These are all frivolous charges and only court will decide the truth. I don’t wish to speak much on the issue,” Pental told Mail Today. 

Saradhi, a professor in the Department of Environmental Studies, alleged that his research work was plagiarised by Pental and another student. 

“KVSK Prasad was a Ph.D. student under me at the Jamia Millia Islamia. Pental appointed him as a post-doctoral scholar under himself. In connivance with Pental, Prasad stole the seed of codA transgenic Indian mustard developed by me and my team under India-Japan Cooperative Science Programme. Pental also allowed Prasad to use this GM seed to carry further research, fully aware that all GM materials are put under the tag of ‘Hazardous’ under Environmental Protection Act (EPA),” Saradhi alleged. 

Saradhi also said that Prasad and other members of Pental’s research team failed to obtain any new results. 

“Prasad and Deepak plagiarised the research work carried out by my team at Jamia during 1995-1999 and showed as the work carried in Deepak Pental’s lab during 2001-2004. Sentences (with exactly similar verbatim) and the data (exactly similar figures/ numbers) were copied from the report submitted by me to DST under India-Japan Cooperative Science Programme,” Saradhi alleged. 

Saradhi claimed that he complained to the University, which formed a committee to examine the matter. The committee gave Pental a clean chit, after which Saradhi filed a case in the court. 

As Pental was taken into custody on Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Kumar Gautam’s order at around 12:45pm, his advocate moved the High Court for stay of his arrest. 

The matter came up for hearing before Justice S. Muralidhar, who stayed the magisterial court’s arrest warrant, saying the trial court order is suspended. 

Justice Muralidhar directed Pental to appear before the trial court, when the bail application is listed. The HC asked the Registrar General to immediately convey the order to the Superintendent, Tihar Jail, by fax and by telephone, to facilitate Pental's immediate release.

The HC order came on a plea moved by senior advocate Arvind Nigam, representing Pental, alleging that the trial court passed a wrong order and he was illegally taken into custody and sent to Tihar jail.
