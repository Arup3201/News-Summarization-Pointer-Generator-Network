An artist has created an astonishing portrait as a tribute to singer Amy Winehouse, composed entirely of her song lyrics.

Next Monday marks the one year anniversary of the 27-year-old’s death, and fan Annemarie Wright spent 30 hours etching the portrait in honour of the star.

The portrait, which measures 3ft by 2ft, features all 24 of her songs from her two albums 'Frank' and 'Back to Black'.

Annemarie, who has been creating similar sketches of celebrities for ten years says: ‘I was a big fan of Amy’s music, it hit me hard when she died because she seemed to be just getting her life in order again and getting over her problems.

‘I had been planning to make this picture before she died but someone reminded me of it when she passed away so I decided to do it as a tribute to her.

‘I used every song from her two albums, in the order they are on the records, and added in a tribute to her at the bottom.

‘It took about 30 hours to make in total. I draw an outline in pencil to make sure I have the right shape and then fill in the middle by writing the lyrics in pen.

'I try to write every different lyric in a different font, or a different pen, in order to give it some variation.

‘My next project is David Cameron using people’s opinions of him, but that’s taking some time as I’m not getting enough positive opinions.'
