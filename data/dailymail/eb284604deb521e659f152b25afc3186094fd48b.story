Britain is set to send fighter jets to the Middle East and could attack Iranian vessels in the Gulf if Israel launches air strikes, the Daily Mail has learned.

David Cameron has been warned that Iran could attack British targets if its nuclear sites come under fire.

The National Security Council last week discussed how the UK could respond if there is a fresh war in the Middle East.

Options: British ministers say it could send the Royal Navy to the Middle East if war breaks out between Iran and Israel later this year over the former's, heading by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, nuclear ambitions

Separately, the Attorney General has been asked to advise on what action the UK could legally take in the event of an attack.

Senior sources say Typhoon and Tornado jets are likely to be sent to al Udeid air base in Qatar to help defend Britain’s Gulf allies against retaliatory attacks by Iran. The RAF would help to protect Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

‘We are looking at what we and others could do to reassure our Gulf Arab allies that we are on their side,’ a Whitehall official said.

The UK’s priority would be to work with the US to keep open the Straits of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s oil passes.

The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are also drawing up plans for the protection of British bases and embassies in the Middle East and beyond, since intelligence chiefs predict an attack by Iranian-backed terrorists.

Security sources say Britain would not be involved in initiating a military attack against Iran. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘This is planning for the day after, not the day before.’

Testing times: The key oil shipping route, the Strait of Hormuz, could be closed by Iran if it is attacked by Israel

British ministers say the deployment of the Royal Navy in the Middle East is just one of the options on their table should war break out

The BBC reports that ministers remain hopeful negotiations can stop Iran building a nuclear bomb and persuade Israel not to carry out a pre-emptive strike.

The desire to become involved is due to fears that an attack could trigger a wider war in the Middle East.

Britain's pondering comes as Iran made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers.

It agreed in principle to allow United Nations inspectors to restart probes into a military site suspected of harbouring tests related to atomic weapons.

But U.S. officials have shown no willingness to shift into bargaining mode so quickly, setting the stage for possible tense moments after talks today resume in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone.

Still, Iran's move raises the pressure on the West for some reciprocal gestures to keep dialogue on track and further highlights Tehran's apparent aims of opening a long give-and-take process over its nuclear ambitions.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will head to China in June to talk about his country's nuclear programme with Chinese President Hu Jintao.

He will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting - a regional security forum of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and which Iran is attending as an observer.    

The summit will likely be overshadowed by the presence of Ahmadinejad, whose country is at the centre of a standoff with the West over its nuclear programme.     

Ahmadinejad's visit to China takes on particular significance as China is a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council and has resisted U.S. demands for sanctions on Iran. China is also a major buyer of Iranian crude oil.    

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned Tehran in January against any effort to acquire nuclear weapons.

But Beijing has generally been reticent about publicly warning Iran or even firmly suggesting that Tehran might want to develop the means to develop nuclear weapons.    

China has repeatedly urged a negotiated solution to the dispute over Tehran's atomic activities, which Western governments say appear aimed at mastering the means to make nuclear weapons. Tehran says those activities are peaceful.   

A major breakthrough in the impasse was not expected in Baghdad, with officials and experts saying both sides will seek to demonstrate enough progress to keep the process moving forward.

That could cool down worries in international markets over possible military action, but reinforce the suspicions of Israeli leaders who claim Iran seeks only to buy time to keep up its production of nuclear fuel.

Iran's envoys, meanwhile, promoted the Baghdad talks as an opportunity to set aside past obstacles.

Saeed Jalili, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, said: 'That is the basis for the beginning of a new co-operation. We hope talks in Baghdad will be a kind of dialogue that will give shape to such co-operation.'

Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hasan Danaeifar, said the Baghdad talks could be historic.

He said: 'Should the talks set a start for a serious, constructive settlement of the issues, it could be a historic meeting for all sides.'

A senior Western diplomat in Baghdad said sanctions on Iran's oil exports, set to take effect on July 1, likely pushed Tehran to the bargaining table.

He said: 'I don't think the Iranians are coming to these talks because they suddenly changed their minds about anything. They are coming to these talks because sanctions are beginning to bite.'

In Iranian terms, that means offering some possible accommodations - such as opening to greater UN inspections. But sticking to its right to enrich uranium as a signatory of UN nuclear treaties.

The Baghdad talks, involving the five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany, could offer a test of how much the U.S. and allies are willing to bend from demands for Iran to halt to all enrichment and instead concentrate on just stopping the highest-grade production.

The West and others fear the 20 per cent-level enrichment can be turned quickly into weapons-grade of over 90 per cent.

Moving forward: Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research

Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research.

Yesterday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Iranian scientists had inserted a domestically made fuel rod, which contains pellets of 20 per cent enriched uranium, into the core of a research nuclear reactor in Tehran.

The advance would be another step in achieving proficiency in the entire nuclear fuel cycle.

Iran said in January it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod, and it had to find a way to make them because Western sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets.

Western claims about a clandestine atomic weapons programme have often cited Iran's Parchin military facility, where the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency believes Iran in 2003 ran explosive tests needed to set off a nuclear charge. Iran describes Parchin as a conventional military site.

The agency's chief, Yukiya Amano, returned to Vienna yesterday from a one-day trip to Tehran and said an agreement is within reach to give inspectors 'access to sites, scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe'.

He noted that some differences still exist but claimed they 'will not be an obstacle to reach agreement.'

He gave no details on the unsettled points or when the pact could be signed. Amano's remarks brought a measured response from Washington and allies.

White House press secretary Jay Carney called the announcement a 'step forward' and 'a step in the right direction'.

But he stressed that the administration will 'make judgments about Iran's behaviour based on actions, not just promises or agreements'.

He added: 'We judge and will judge Iran by its actions. We're not at the stage of negotiating what Iran would get in return for fulfillment of its obligations.'

In Germany, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the apparent inspection pact was an 'overdue step in the right direction'.

But he added: 'The aim is to make progress not just atmospherically but also on substance.' Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, dismissed it as a 'deception of progress' to stave off international pressure.

Suspicions: Britain's pondering comes as Iran made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers

He said: 'It looks like the Iranians are trying to reach a technical agreement that will create a deception of progress in talks in order to reduce the pressure ahead of talks tomorrow in Baghdad and postpone harshening of sanctions.'

On Monday, the U.S. Senate backed proposals for further sanctions on Iran, including requiring companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose any Iran-related business.

U.S. and European measures already have targeted Iran's oil exports - its chief revenue source - and effectively blocked the country from international banking networks.

Even before the meetings begin in Baghdad, expectations were kept in check. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said they will 'not produce a miracle'.

'But everybody is looking for some tangible steps on the basis of reciprocity,' Zebari added, also saying there is consensus in Iran for the first time to reach a diplomatic deal.

Mahdi Mohtashami, an analyst and former Iranian foreign ministry official, said 'the two sides should begin with small steps, not big demands, if they are to make any progress'.

The U.S. has been vague about its immediate goals, with officials saying the talks will gauge Iran's seriousness and explore elements of a possible agreement.

President Barack Obama opposes a near-term military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.

He has pressed Israel to give diplomacy and sanctions time to work while insisting that military options are available should talks fail. Republicans have criticised Obama for holding talks with Iran at all.
