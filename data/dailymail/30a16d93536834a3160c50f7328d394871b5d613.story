An Asian-American woman has filed a $1million lawsuit against CVS after she received a customer receipt that she claims was printed with an ethnic slur.

Hyun Jin Lee, 37, of Galloway, New Jersey, says that she gave her correct name when she placed an order for photos on the CVS website back in February.

But when she went to the to the store to pick up her order at a CVS store in Egg Harbor City, her receipt identified her as 'Ching Chong Lee.'

Outrage: When Hyun Jin Lee returned to a CVS store in Egg Harbor City, her receipt identified her as 'Ching Chong Lee'

Ms Lee, who identifies herself as Korean, is now taking legal action against the drugstore chain.

In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday and obtained by The Smoking Gun, Ms Lee says: '"Ching chong" is a pejorative term sometimes used by speakers of English to mock people of Chinese ancestry, or other Asians who may be mistaken for Chinese.'

She goes on to say that she was 'shocked, stunned, mortified, humiliated and severely distressed that in the space  designated for her customer name or identification was instead the words "Ching Chong" Lee.'

Ms Lee is accusing CVS of causing her 'immediate mental anguish, emotional distress, extreme embarrassment and anger.'

Response: In an email to Ms Lee, CVS said that the offending employee would be 'addressed at a store level' and subject to counseling and training

In response to a subsequent email from Ms Lee, CVS said that the offending employee would be 'addressed at a store level' and subject to counseling and training.

But her attorney says it's not enough, and they're seeking $1million in damages.

Ms Lee's attorney, Susan Chana Lask, told CBS New York: 'There’s no amount, in my opinion, of training from 
CVS or any company that’s going to stop this kind of hate and bullying 
against someone's race.'

Suit: Ms Lee's legal team says that CVS' actions to counsel the offending employee is not good enough, and she's seeking $1million in damages

She added: 'To me, this is something that deserves psychological counseling, not CVS counseling.'

A CVS spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment.

Last year, pizza chain Papa Johns issued an apology to a customer after an employee identified her as 'lady chinky eyes' in her order.

The racial identification was caught by New York City customer Minhee Cho after the store printed her receipt.

Later taking to Twitter, she uploaded a picture of the receipt with the caption: 'Hey @PapaJohns just FYI my name isn't "lady chinky eyes"'.

In a 2011 incident, Chick-fil-A faced a uproar when an employee in Irvine, California, was fired after using offensive names mocking Asian customers at the Chick-fil-A.

Rather than take the real names of two students, she typed 'Ching' and 'Chong' on their food receipts.

Restaurant bosses moved quickly to try and quell the controversy after a friend of the customers posted photos of the receipts on his Tumblr account.

The post quickly went viral drawing widespread criticism of the company that has drawn complaints in the past because of its openly Christian roots and conservative stance.
