Dream holiday: Keen sailors Roger and Margaret Pratt

A diving instructor who saw yacht attack couple Roger and Margaret Pratt days before they were attacked by armed robbers said the couple had been ‘like newlyweds’ and ‘so in love’.

It comes as a photo emerged of the couple about to set off on their fateful round-the-world trip, from which one of them would not return.

Three men were still being questioned
 last night over the death of Mr Pratt, 62, as he defended his wife on board their
 yacht in a Caribbean harbour.

Roger
 Pratt, 62, was left floating face down in the water after a gang of 
armed robbers attacked him and his wife Margaret, 60 who had been 
brutally attacked but survived.

A scuba diving instructor, who took 
the couple out on a trip just two days before their death, said he was 
struck by how in love the couple were.

Nathaniol Chester accompanied them last Tuesday and Wednesday on two two-hour dives off the coast of Soufriere.

He said: ‘They were both smiling at each other all day. 

‘They
 looked so much like newlyweds, or a couple who had just met and yet 
they were like twins. They finished each other’s sentences.

‘Roger
 was very caring towards his wife. He told me straight away that she was
 nervous about diving and said "I want to get her confidence up".

‘He told me to ‘take good care of her’. I told him not to worry and I would look after her.

‘He went diving by himself while me and Margaret dived in the shallow waters. 

‘When
 she was more confident, I brought Roger back and they held hands and 
went diving together. It was wonderful, actually, looking at them.

‘I went home the night I first met them and told my wife about them and how they were getting old together and still so in love.

‘They
 were having a ball and were hoping to dive all over the Caribbean and 
were about to go to Trinidad to get their visa for the northern 
islands.’

Mr Chester said 
he was ‘pained’ when he heard on the radio the three days later that Mr 
Pratt had been found dead face down in the water next to his boat.

As soon as I heard them say the boat’s name, it fell into place and I said ‘No, no, no, how can this be?

‘I am so shocked and angry this has happened.’

The
 retired financial consultants were halfway through a dream six-month 
sailing trip when they moored moored in 
Fort Vieux, an industrial town in St Lucia.

Relatives
 said Mrs Pratt, of Warwickshire, had been ‘badly beaten up’ but was 
being ‘very strong’ in order to help the police with their 
investigation.

A 
post-mortem of Mr Pratt’s body began yesterday at the mortuary at 
Victoria Hospital, on the outskirts of St Lucia’s capital, Castries.

The three men were said to be from a poor shanty town area of St Lucia.

A
 police spokesman said: ‘When we have the results of the post-mortem we 
will know better if we can make any arrests or charge anyone for his 
death.

‘Mrs Pratt is now in the care of the Foreign Office. She has been through a lot and is very fragile at the moment.’

On Sunday afternoon, Mrs Pratt was taken back to the boat on which her husband was murdered to collect her belongings.

Days
 before the killing, Mrs Pratt had written a blog about how blissfully 
happy she was as they celebrated her 60th birthday on the island, 
writing ‘60 not out! Altogether a delightful and memorable day.  
Happiness is…’.

Yesterday, 
she was staying in a hotel, while forensic tests are carried out on the 
couple’s beloved yacht, Magnetic Attraction, at a police marine unit.

In a travel blog, Mrs Pratt spoke of her frustration that they had been kept in the industrial port of Vieux Fort – which she called a ‘one-horse town’ – after being denied clearance to leave by customs officials.

Mr Chester said: ‘Vieux Fort is an empty place with no tourists and does not have good security. They would have been more of a target there then further north in St Lucia.’

Yesterday, Mrs Pratt’s sister Jenny Riley said she was a ‘very strong person’ who was coping well with her ordeal.

She said: ‘She has been back on the boat but she is staying in a hotel and is eing well looked after.‘Margaret is a very strong person.

‘She was badly beaten up, but she is not in a critical condition. She is out of hospital and is well.’There are more than 50 murders a year in St Lucia and thousands of violent crimes, despite a population of jst 174,000.

A British expat living near the capital city of Castries, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Tourism is the main industry here so the violence is hushed up but there is a massive crime wave happening here which goes unreported.

‘The population is impoverished, a quarter are unemployed and there are lots of drugs gangs.‘In Castries, it is extremely dangerous to go out at night and it’s not a good idea to go anywhere off the beaten track in St Lucia.’

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice warn tourists about the violent side of the holiday island on its website.

It states: ‘Incidents of violent crime, including murder tend to occur within the local community but can sometimes affect tourists. 

‘The St Lucian authorities work with the tourism industry to maintain a safe environment for visitors.

‘Nevertheless, muggings and thefts from hotels, yachts or holiday homes do occur, and are occasionally accompanied by violence, and there have been a number of serious assaults involving tourists and residents in recent years.’
