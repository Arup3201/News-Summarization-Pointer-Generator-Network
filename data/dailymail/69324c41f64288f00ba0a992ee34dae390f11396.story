Families have been warned to arm themselves amid fears of more violent protests over the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson.

Missouri is bracing itself for renewed demonstrations ahead of a grand jury verdict on whether to charge a white police officer over the 18-year-old's death in St Louis.

Protesters are gathering in and around the city as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no-indictment vote.

The ruling was expected yesterday, but did not materialise. 

Online chatter from users claiming to be police officers and their supporters predicts furious clashes regardless of the outcome, with some users saying the force will be powerless to protect the public.

Missouri is bracing itself for renewed violence ahead of a grand jury verdict on whether to charge a white police officer over the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown

From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for demonstrations when the grand jury decides

One user called A Concerned Cop advised residents to take up arms to safeguard their families. 

Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk, the user said: 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family.

'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us.

'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.'

Other posts label the protesters as 'terrorists', according to a report by Vocativ. The forum has since been taken down.

Meanwhile, some users suggested asking the fire department for water hoses to protect the police from rioters. 

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard ahead of a grand jury decision on whether Darren Wilson (left) will be charged over the shooting of Michael Brown (right)

In his executive order on Monday, Nixon (pictured) cited the 'possibility of expanded unrest' 

Supporters of the policeman who shot Michael Brown have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer.

The campaign was launched by a supporter from Tennessee last month and has already raised the $3,000 goal to erect the sign.

Plans are for the billboard to read 'Pants Up, Don't Loot' - a phrase made popular by National Review in response to the chant 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' recited by Brown's supporters.

The campaign website says it intends to erect the sign in the 'heart of Florissant' where many of the violent protests have taken place.

Although the $3,000 target has been reached, the billboard has not yet been purchased, it was noted by TPM Livewire.

According to the campaign website: 'The funds collected from this campaign will be used to purchase this billboard for as long as possible.

'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible.

'If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months... we will.' 

An anonymous user who claimed he was a police officer wrote: 'We can't even hit our sticks on the ground.'

The emergence of the forum comes after two Twitter accounts belonging to the Ku Klux Klan were taken over by hacker group Anonymous after the white supremacist group threatened protesters in Ferguson.

Anonymous acted after the group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force' against the protesters who have gathered around St Louis while they await what many believe will be a no-indictment vote.

Anonymous has previously announced that Wilson will not be charged.

Missouri's governor has re-activated the National Guard and declared a state of emergency in an effort to avoid more unrest. 

But when pressed further, he struggled to answer whether the buck stopped with him on any response to the protests.

Asked by reporters if it was his overall responsibility, he gave the less-than convincing response: 'We're, um, you know, it a, you know, our goal here is to, is to, keep the peace and allow folks' voices to be heard.

'And in that balance, attempting, you know I am, using the resources we have to be predictable. ... I don't spend a tremendous amount of time personalizing this vis-a-vis me.'

He was also vague when questioned on which official or agency was in command of the response, it was reported by ABC News.

He said: 'Well, I mean, it a, clearly, I mean, I, I feel good about the, we worked hard, to establish unified command, to allied responsibilities and now with the additional assets provided by my order today, with the National Guard, you know, we have worked through a number of operational issues.'

Unlike in August, when Governor Jay Nixon asked the troops to help quell the sometimes-violent protests that had occurred nightly following Brown's death, his latest move is pre-emptive, coming ahead of any decision on whether Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson will be indicted.

There also are some operational differences this time.  

When Nixon last declared a state of emergency, he put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of a unified local police command and later activated the National Guard to provide security around the command center. 

Nixon said the St Louis County Police Department would be in charge of security in Ferguson after the grand jury decision and would work with the Highway Patrol and St Louis city police as part of a unified command to 'protect civil rights and ensure public safety' in other jurisdictions. 

'My hope and expectation is that peace will prevail,' Nixon said Monday. 

'But we have a responsibility - I have a responsibility - to plan for any contingencies that might arise.'  

There is no specific date for a grand jury decision to be revealed and Nixon gave no indication that an announcement is imminent. 

But St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that he expects the grand jury to reach a decision in mid-to-late November.

The U.S. Justice Department, which is conducting a separate investigation, has not said when its work will be completed.

The governor did not indicate how many National Guard troops would be mobilised, instead leaving it to the state adjutant general to determine. 

Nixon said the National Guard would be available to carry out any requests made through the Highway Patrol to 'protect life and property' and support local authorities. 

If the Guard is able to provide security at police and fire stations, then more police officers may be freed up to patrol the community, Nixon said. 

Preparation: Demonstrators lay on the ground in a mock death protest of the shooting of Brown. The area around St. Louis, Missouri, is preparing for the grand jury decision in the shooting death of Brown

St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said Monday that he supports Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. 

He said the Guard 'will be used in a secondary role' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings.

'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. 

Before the shooting, Wilson spotted Brown and a friend walking in the middle of a street and told them to stop, but they did not. 

According to a St Louis Post-Dispatch report based on sources the newspaper did not identify, Wilson has told authorities he then realised Brown matched the description of a suspect in a theft minutes earlier at a convenience store. 

Wilson backed up his police vehicle and some sort of confrontation occurred before Brown was fatally shot. 

He was unarmed and some witnesses have said he had his hands up when he was killed.

Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in Ferguson, where two-thirds of the residents are black, but the police force is almost entirely white. 

Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. 

At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds.
