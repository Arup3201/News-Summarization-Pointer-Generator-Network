WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange believes election to the senate in his home country Australia will secure his escape from extradition to the United States.

Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for the past eight months, is planning to run as a candidate in Victoria for the September election.

Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa today called on Europe to settle Assange's fate, after being re-elected.

Wanted: Julian Assange hopes election to the Australian senate with force the U.S. to back down

The controversial figure is wanted in
Sweden over sex assault allegations but believes it is part of a plot 
to put him on trial in the U.S. over the leaking of classified documents
on his website.

He said if he is elected to the senate then America and Britain - where he skipped bail in relation to the accusations before seeking political refuge - would back down, fearing an international showdown.

In Australia, senators must take up their seats within two months of being elected and Assange is confident this is enough to secure a safe passage out of the UK.

He told Australian website The Conversation: 'The Senate could vote to evict me, but that would trigger a big political row.

'Australians probably wouldn't swallow it. They've learned a lesson from the controversial dismissal of Gough Whitlam.'

He said Britain would allow him to leave otherwise 'the political costs of the current standoff will be higher still'.

Assange's supporters have applied for him to be placed on the electoral roll in Victoria, which is necessary for all senate candidates.

He said he will start the WikiLeaks political party, with several candidates running in the election, and added he is 'sure' it would attract the required 500 fee-paying members.

Assange also claimed the allegations against him are 'falling apart'.

He revealed his plans as the President Correa declared victory in the presidential elections.

The president said: 'It's a diplomatic situation for which a solution must be found... as quickly as possible...his fate' is in Europe's hands.'

Assange, whose anti-secrecy website is responsible for the biggest security breach in U.S. history, fled to the embassy in June.

The country granted him asylum in August but Britain has refused to allow him safe passage out of the country.

By helping him, Ecuador 'did what it had to do in the framework of its sovereignty,' Correa said.

'There can't be a problem due to asylum, it's neocolonialism,' he said.

Correa claimed victory shortly after polling stations closed in an election he had been widely expected to win.

The first official results polls gave him 56.7 percent of the vote -- and a roughly 30-point lead over his nearest rival, banker Guillermo Lasso -- with just over a third of ballots counted.

It has also emerged that the bill for policing outside the embassy in London has reached nearly £3 million.
