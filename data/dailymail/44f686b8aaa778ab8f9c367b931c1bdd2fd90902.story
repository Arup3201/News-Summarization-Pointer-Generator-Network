As the new year rolls in, taking stock of the one just past can prompt the age-old resolutions, 'eat healthier' and 'make better choices'.

While taking steps towards these goals is often easier said than done, figuring out what the new superfoods of 2015 is easy, thanks to food writer and 'wellness warrior' Lee Holmes. 

You don't need to love yoga, kale, or chia seeds to embrace the superfoods list- so forget kale and quinoa, Holmes said this year is all about mindful eating, artisan food shopping, and approaching nourishment sustainably.

'There are so many faddy diets, but come January it’s a great time to take stock and set yourself some personal goals or positive changes,' Holmes said.

'For me, I’m focusing on adding more vegetables to my meal times. In season vegetables are at their best and relatively inexpensive,' she said.

'At the same time adding more fibre, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium and eating a diet with plant based options can help to lower LDL cholesterol levels.’

Holmes, a yoga teacher, wholefoods chef, and bestselling author, is passionate about bringing vegetables back to where they belong- front and centre on the dinner table.

Her approach to food is not just a list of what to eat, but how to go about sourcing nourishment for your body in the most sustainable way possible.

Fermented foods

'Fermented foods are full of healthy enzymes, minerals and live cultures that create a flourishing internal environment and help balance gut microflora, all contributing to good digestion, protection from toxic pollutants and a strong immune system,' said Holmes.

Fermentation has been practiced by many cultures long before the advent of industrialisation and unnatural processing of our foods.

So, while not a new concept, fermented foods help the body draw nutrients from food. 

'Adding a culture or salt to foods enables the production of Lactobacillus bacterial cultures (probiotics), which preserve the food through the production of lactic acid,' said Holmes.

'Some of the types of fermented and cultured foods you can include in your diet are kombucha, fermented drinks, kefir yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, cultured vegetables, and pickled vegetables and relishes,' she said.

Artisan Food Shopping

Holmes predicts that there will be a significant swing back towards artisan food shopping this year.

'Major supermarkets will be implementing more of their own personalized butcheries, bakeries and old school artisan products into stores as well as local foods and native ingredients,' Holmes said.

Watch out for kakadu plums and Margaret river cheese.

Incaberries!

A South American 'super fruit', these berries have high levels of vitamins, including 'phosphorous, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B12 and protein,' said Holmes.

'They are great as a snack and have high levels of bio-flavoniods,' she advises.

Healthy intermittent fasting

'Fasting is a psychological panacea to rigorous diets, built upon the foundation of a restricted calorie approach,' Holmes explains.

Some of the food people tend to eat on fasting days are actually what Holmes calls 'low calorie nightmares', such as puddings, meringues, bakes and cakes. 

'Fasting can be even healthier with the right food choices, to increase longevity and keep disease at bay,' she said.

'People will begin to choose nutrient rich fresh options to fast and learn that low fat is not healthy!'

Foraging Foods, local and sustainable

While 'meat and two veg' may no longer be the accepted eating framework for a majority of Australians, there has been a revived interest in eating foods that are more basic.

'The typical diet today consists of fast foods and processed foods, pesticide-laden and GM produce, with chemicals, preservatives and additives,' said Holmes.

For 2015, she predicts that 'we will see an even bigger return to seasonal eating and locally produced foods and also foraging foods such as wild mushrooms, berries and herbs such as dandelion.'

Mindful eating

As a new year starts, Holmes predicts that people will become more interested in eating mindfully and holistically.

She anticipates people looking towards 'whole food nutritional principals and nourishing themselves with healthy comfort food, hearty home cooked, highly nutritious recipes that heal and nourish with every mouthful.'

'Eating out will involve a community minded communal table approach with slow cooking being a highlight and shared plates and sides of fermented foods,' Holmes said.

'Meals that will help people flourish and feel nourished and encourage communication.'

Holmes's new vegetarian cookbook Supercharged Food: Eat Clean, Green, and Vegetarian is available now from Murdoch Books.
