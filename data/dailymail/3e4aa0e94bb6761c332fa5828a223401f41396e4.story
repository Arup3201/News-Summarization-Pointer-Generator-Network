No this is not a pampered WAG or celebrity - meet Chloe Princess Pom, the seven-year-old diva Pomeranian.

Chloe's wardrobe is bursting with accessories including, bows, hats, tiaras, diamante collars and jewellery to match almost every outfit and she even has two convertible toy cars.

To make sure she's always looking her best Chloe has her teeth and fur brushed every night before bed.

She also has a spa day once a week where she enjoys a floral scented bubble bath, pedicure and blow dry.

Each month she visits a professional groomer where she has her white fur trimmed and coiffed.

Chloe even has her own bedroom in the home she shares with owner Karen in Atlanta, Georgia, US which comes complete with her own doggy wardrobe and full-sized double bed.

The spoilt pooch has become so accustomed to her life of luxury she's turned into a bit of a diva and hates getting her paws dirty, preferring to be carried in her $1,500 Louis Vuitton carrier or doggy pram.

Real-estate agent Karen said Chloe is her only child and loves nothing more than to spoil her and admits to spending thousands on her over the years.

She said: 'She has over 250 outfits, some of them I buy from doggy boutiques others I design especially for her along with a matching one for myself.

'I have a dress maker who custom makes outfits for us, each outfit costs around $50 but some of her more special outfits have cost up to $300.

'She has over 50 bracelets which I co-ordinate with each of her outfits and she loves to stick out her paw and show her bracelet off to people.

'The most expensive item I have purchased for Chloe would have to be her Louis Vutton dog carrier. It cost around $1400.

'She's very spoilt, she's definitely a diva. Everywhere she goes she gets so much attention which she loves.

'When we go for walks I usually carry her or push her in her pram as she doesn't like to walk too far or get her paws dirty.

'I do spend a lot more than the average dog owner and I always spend money on her rather than myself.

'I'm not a rich person, if I had more money I'd lavish a lot more on her - I'd definitely be buying her real diamond collars.

'She's my only child, she's so special to me and I just love treating her.'
