'Unequivocal message': Foreign Secretary William Hague has welcomed further sanctions against President Bashar Assad's regime

William Hague today welcomed a further strengthening of EU sanctions on Syria, intensifying the pressure on president Bashar Assad's regime.

The Foreign Secretary said EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg had agreed a series of new measures against Syrian banking, military and state media organisations.

Further action had also been taken to strengthen the arms embargo, making clear that the insurance and re-insurance of arms shipments to Syria was explicitly prohibited.

It follows the turning back in British waters of a Russian ship carrying attack helicopters to Syria following a warning that its insurance was invalid as it was in breach of the arms embargo.

'This sixteenth round of sanctions against banking, military and state media entities sends an unequivocal message that we will intensify the pressure until the Assad regime ends the killing and implements (UN envoy Kofi) Annan's six-point plan in full,' said Mr Hague.

'The UK will remain vigilant and continue to do all that we can to prevent the completely unjustified arming of a regime that is carrying out appalling crimes against its own people.

'I call on all countries, including those in the region, to implement their own tough measures so that Assad and his henchmen are in no doubt that they must chose a different path or face ever-increasing isolation.'

Meanwhile, Syria warned Nato not to enter its 'sacrosanct' territory today as the alliance prepares to discuss possible military intervention after Syria shot down a Turkish warplane.

Ankara invoked article 4 of the defence alliance which allows a member state to consult allies if its security is threatened.

Spokesman for the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry Dr Jihad Makdessi said: 'We heard previous statements made by the NATO that they have no intention of military intervention in Syria.

'If the aim of the meeting is aggressive in nature, I want to reassure everyone that the Syrian territories, waters and airspace are sacrosanct for the Syrian army.'

EU foreign ministers today condemned Syria's shooting of the F4 Phantom jet, but said the bloc will not support military action in the troubled country.

'What happened is to be considered very seriously (but) we do not go for any interventions,' Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also urged calm.

'I think it is still important that we continue to work on a political solution (to the Syrian crisis),' he said as he arrived for a regular meeting of EU ministers. 'De-escalation is crucial at this moment.'

Today's sanctions have targeted six 
government ministries as well as a bank and television company, bringing
the total on the EU's blacklist to 129 people and 49 entities.

'As long as the repression continues, the EU will continue imposing sanctions against the regime,' said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.

No details were immediately available on the identity of those blacklisted, but several EU diplomats said on condition of anonymity that assets held in Europe by Syria's defence and home affairs ministries were targeted.

Also on the list were a bank, a television firm, an oil transport company and a security office of the Baath party, sources said.

The measure follows an incident some days ago involving a British-insured Russian cargo ship carrying attack helicopters for Syria.

The United States alerted Britain to the consignment and British security services told insurers Standard Club that providing insurance for the shipment would breach EU sanctions, reports said.

Standard Club then cancelled insurance for the ship as well as others in the fleet owned by Russian cargo line Femco, forcing the vessel to head home.
