Google is now attempting to ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that Apple may now target them after the success of the patent lawsuit against Samsung.

The search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $1billion victory that Apple won from a California court, saying that the portions of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google.

'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office,' Google officials said in a statement on Monday.

Last week a Californian court decided that Apple's 
iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and 
that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages

Google provided their Android 
operating system to companies like Samsung for free, and allowed the 
companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software.

'The mobile industry is moving fast 
and all players -- including newcomers -- are building upon ideas that 
have been around for decades. We work with our partners to give 
consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don't want anything
to limit that,' the statement continued.

Wired reports that many software 
analysts agree with Google's statement, and their argument that any 
infringement claims came from the individual phone companies themselves 
and not Google.

Scorched earth: Steve Jobs was said to promise 'thermonuclear war' against Google after then-CEO Eric Schmidt (right) was on Apple's board when Google released their Android software

There is reason for the company to be 
somewhat nervous, however, because it would be shortselling it to say 
that Google and Apple had a frosty relationship.

The Android software first came out on the market when Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt was serving on the Apple board.

The Associated Press reports that 
after shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Jobs vowed that Apple would 
resort to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies.

While Jobs is no longer at the helm of
Apple and their ensuing legal battles, his determination to kill the 
Android software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset.

Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last
year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had 
'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads

Before moving on to any seperate legal
challenges, Apple announced on Monday that they will be following 
through with the implications of their victory against Samsung.

Apple on Monday gave a federal judge a
list of eight Samsung Electronics Co. products it wants pulled from 
shelves and banned from the U.S. market, including popular Galaxy model 
smartphones.

The products Apple wants out are all 
smartphones: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 
T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy 
Prevail.

The judge has scheduled a September 20 hearing to discuss Apple's demands for the sales bans.
