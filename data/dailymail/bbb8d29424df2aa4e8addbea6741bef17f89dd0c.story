There was sunshine, blue skies and brief showers today as the nation prepared to enjoy a bank holiday hotter than parts of Italy and the south of France.

Forecasters are predicting that Bank Holiday Monday will be the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures expected to creep above 22-23C (73F) in some places, beating temperatures in the sunny European destinations.

The warm weather is likely to continue tomorrow with highs of 20C (68F). The day will start cloudy, but brighten up in the south and be cooler in the north.

Today in the south east it began with bright blue skies with the top temperature In St James' Park, London at 17.2C (63F). The best of the weather was in Donna Nook, Lincolnshire, with 17.8C (64F).

On the coast, the chilly sea temperature kept bathers and sun worshippers away, particularly in Brighton where the beach was almost deserted.

The
warmest day of the year so far was on April 25 when temperatures 
climbed to 23C (73F), and forecasters believe Monday may break that 
record, or at the very least match it.

Sunny outlook: The temperature could soar above 23C on bank holiday Monday, forecasters say

Paul Mott, a meteorologist at MeteoGroup, said that while the temperatures over central and eastern England are expected to be in the low twenties, it might just climb above 23C in London and East Anglia.

'There's a chance it could be the warmest day of the year so far. Temperatures will be higher than quite a bit of Italy,' Mr Mott said.

'Northern parts of Italy and south east France will be about 20C,' he added.

This year's expected sunny Bank Holiday will be a big improvement from last year, which saw rain and a temperature high of 16C (60.8F) at Exeter Airport.

Mr Mott said the capital and East Anglia can expect the best weather Britain has to offer this weekend - with some mixed conditions elsewhere.

The outlook in Scotland is less promising, according to Mr Mott, who said: 'Scotland and Northern Ireland will have more cloud and rain as well, particularly in the west of Scotland.'

But elsewhere people can look forward to ideal bank holiday weather, with Monday expected to be the warmest day over the three-day weekend.

'Eastern areas of England will be good on Sunday with lengthy periods of sunshine,' Mr Mott said.

The warm weather is expected to see a surge in demand for barbecues, with Asda reporting a sales increase of 142% while Marks and Spencer report sales of its barbecue range 'The Grill' are expected to double on last year.

Meanwhile Superdrug has reported an increased demand for beauty products such as false toe nails, wax strips and fake tan.

Forecasters said it was expected to be cloudy and damp across Scotland and Northern Ireland with outbreaks of light rain or drizzle on Monday.

But the weather will be dry and generally fine across England and Wales, with warm, sunny spells, MeteoGroup said.

While the news is good for sun worshippers, hay fever sufferers may struggle this weekend with high levels of pollen expected across England.

The pollen count will increase as temperatures heat up, with the worst conditions expected on Sunday and Monday, forecasters said.

The Met Office said tree pollen would be more significant than grass pollen until the middle of May.

Blustery start: Brighton Beach was relatively deserted this morning, but it could be packed on bank holiday Monday if the sunshine shows up as expected

Getting warmer: It was a dull start to the day in Southsea, Portsmouth, as Zizi Tsang-Warmington walked her dogs Missie and Muttley along the beach - but forecasters say it will get brighter over the weekend

Promising outlook: Walkers wore jackets as they strolled along the beach in Portsmouth this morning, but forecasters have predicted better weather to come

People in the south east will be particularly badly affected while cooler temperatures in Scotland should lead to lower levels of tree pollen, spokesman Alexander Burkill said.

He said the tree pollen count will be high towards the end of the weekend, adding: 'Today we've got a fair bit of cloud and the rain coming down, so it's going to go down to moderate.

'Onto Sunday and Monday in places, especially across England and especially in the south east, you're looking that it could get up to high.'

South west England and Wales will only experience moderate levels of tree pollen on Monday, though Mr Burkill said those areas may see high levels on Sunday.

Slow start: It was deserted this morning, but this ice cream kiosk is likely to see a rush as the weather gets warmer over the weekend

Regions with higher temperatures 
towards the south east of England will be worse for hay fever sufferers 
as warm weather leads to higher levels of both tree and grass pollen.

Grass pollen will still have an effect this weekend, according to Meteogroup, the weather division of the Press Association.

Tom
Tobler, of MeteoGroup, said: 'As we get more sunshine on Monday and it 
warms up in southern England, it could start edging into moderate pollen
counts.'

Mr Burkill 
said the much-anticipated warm weather would increase pollen levels. He 
said: 'It's the fact that it's going to be mostly dry, quite warm and 
generally lightish winds across much of England and Wales.'

Standstill: Hundreds of drivers trapped in their vehicles on the M25 Motorway in Waltham Abbey, Essex following a spillage of chemicals between junctions 26 and Junction 27

Meanwhile, on the M25, thousands of drivers were stuck in long tailbacks today after a chemical spillage brought bank holiday getaway traffic to a halt.

Essex Police arrested a lorry driver after the spillage, which saw a section of the key route between junctions 25 and 27 closed off from 5am this morning as emergency services worked to clear up the mess.
