A rally driver and his co-pilot were lucky to escape with their lives after their car skidded off the road, down a bank and into murky water.

The dramatic moment occurred as the Ford rally car, driven by Ott Tanak and co-piloted by Raigo Molder, approached a bend at speed.

In a video recorded by a fan, the car's wheels appear to lock on the gravel road and it accelerates towards the edge of the road before plunging into the water in front of horrified fans.

Rolling down the bank on its side, the car flips over and land on its roof.

In addition to smashing the windscreen, the force of the fall throws the car back onto all four wheels but into an expanse of water.

Water begins flooding the car as the driver and co-pilot set about making a quick exit.

The clip then cuts back to the footage captured by a fan, revealing the moment the driver and his co-pilot swim to safety.

They made their escape before the car disappeared in the water.

M-Sport Team Manager, Malcolm Wilson, said the most important thing is that both the driver and co-pilot were OK.

The pair were competing in the Mexico leg of the FIA World Rally Championship in Guanajuato.

Both Ott Tanak and Raigo Molder are from Estonia and race for M-Sport World Rally Team.
