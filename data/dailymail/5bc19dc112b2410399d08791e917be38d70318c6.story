Alex Neil will have further talks with Norwich over their managerial vacancy after Hamilton agreed a compensation deal with the Norfolk club.

Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald agreed a deal from New Douglas Park on Thursday afternoon and Neil will return to Norwich to finalise his appointment.

MacDonald said at an impromptu media conference: 'I'm happy to report that we have now agreed compensation terms with Norwich City. A most amicable arangement eventually broke out. And I'm delighted Alex has now got the opportunity to go and discuss terms with them.'

Neil Adams resigned on Monday after less than nine months in charge of the Championship club

Norwich have been quick to pinpoint Neil as a replacement for Neil Adams, who quit following their weekend FA Cup defeat by Preston, and with his team sitting just outside the promotion play-off places.

The mood of the Hamilton players was decidedly downbeat when they emerged from the meeting with their manager and team-mate, who captained the club before taking over from Billy Reid little over 18 months ago.

Defender Mikey Devlin admitted 'it looks like' Neil was moving on.

The 21-year-old said: 'Everybody is a bit flat and a bit disappointed. He has been an inspirational figure for everybody at the club and everybody had a great relationship with him. Everybody loved him here.

'So we are disappointed but at the same time thrilled for him because he deserves it.

'Everybody is delighted for him that he has got an opportunity to go and manage at a higher level. We all hope he goes on and shows how good he can be.'

Neil led the club to promotion in his first full season as manager, while they are now on course for their best-ever campaign in the top flight.

Neil will leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years

Accies topped the Scottish Premiership after a 1-0 win at Celtic Park in October - their first victory at Parkhead for 76 years - and they have scored nine goals without reply in two league games against Lanarkshire rivals Motherwell. They currently sit third in the table, four points behind leaders Aberdeen.

Speaking on Wednesday, vice-chairman Ronnie Macdonald said: 'We are delighted that Alex's achievements have been recognised by this approach and that our policy of progressing players, staff and managers continues.'
