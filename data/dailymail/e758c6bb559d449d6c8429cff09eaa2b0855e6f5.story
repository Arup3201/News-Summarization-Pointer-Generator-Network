David Cameron’s authority in Parliament and on the world stage was dealt an unprecedented blow last night as he faced a breathtaking Commons defeat  over plans for missile strikes on Syria.

In an extraordinary assault on the Prime Minister’s authority, 50 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a watered-down Government motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military action.

There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons.

Chastened: British MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject Prime Minister David Cameron's motion backing British intervention in principle

The last time a Prime Minister was defeated over an issue of war and peace was in 1782.

A
 Downing Street source said Mr Cameron had no intention of resigning, 
adding: ‘His colleagues support him on most things, but on this issue 
they disagreed.’

Education 
Secretary Michael Gove was said to have shouted at Tory rebels outside 
the  chamber: ‘You’re a disgrace, you’re a disgrace.’

Chancellor George Osborne today raised concern that the UK's place in the world would be undermined by the vote.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think there will be a national soul-searching about our role in the world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the international system, be that big open and trading nation that I'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that.

'I understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in Parliament many members of the public have about British involvement in Syria.

'I hope this doesn’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world’s problems.'

Mr
 Cameron, who had made a passionate plea for support over proposals for 
targeted strikes on Damascus after a chemical weapons attack last week, 
was forced to issue a humiliating climbdown.

‘It
 is clear to me the British Parliament does not want to see British 
military action. I get that and the Government will act accordingly,’ he
 told MPs.

His decision to 
pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with the US in a planned attack on 
Syria, and to recall Parliament from its summer recess for an emergency 
debate, backfired spectacularly.

Mr Cameron had been counting on 
Labour’s support to ensure he could win a Commons vote authorising 
strikes, despite the doubts of scores of Tory MPs.

Labour,
 however, refused to back the Government, prompting the angriest foreign
 policy row between the main parties since Suez in 1956.

The Tories 
accused Ed Miliband of giving ‘succour’ to President Bashar Assad’s 
regime.

Defence Secretary 
Philip Hammond said: ‘I’m disappointed with Ed Miliband’s behaviour, 
frankly. Anything that stops this from giving a clear, united view of 
the British Parliament will give some succour to the regime.’

After
 the vote, Mr Hammond said: ‘I hope Britain isn’t going to retreat into 
being the sort of nation that isn’t going to act to uphold international
 norms.’

Sir Gerald 
Howarth, a former defence minister who voted ‘reluctantly’ with the 
Government, accused Mr Cameron of rushing into the vote.

Reza Afshar, head of the Syria team at the Foreign Office, tweeted simply: ‘Disaster.’

Senior US officials said President Obama was prepared to move ahead with a limited military strike despite last night’s vote.

Two
 Tory ministers, International Development Secretary Justine Greening 
and Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds, apparently missed the vote 
after not hearing a division bell. 

Debate: A chastened Mr Cameron was forced by Labour leader Ed Miliband to pledge not to deploy any UK military forces without first staging another Commons vote

An
 earlier Labour motion, demanding further conditions before Britain 
could be involved in any military action, was defeated by 332 votes to 
220. In other developments:

Moment: MPs last night dramatically voted against David Cameron's plea to take military action against Syria

Recall: Mr Cameron told a packed House of Commons that Britain had to decide how to respond to 'one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century'

Demonstrate: Protesters speaking out against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament

Last
 night’s vote is a grave humiliation for Mr Cameron and will also raise 
doubts about the future of the ‘Special Relationship’ between Britain 
and the US.

One Whitehall source said Britain was ‘handing back its 
deputy sheriff’s badge’ to Washington.

The shadow of Tony Blair loomed 
large over yesterday’s proceedings, with speaker after speaker referring
 to the mistakes and misinformation of the Iraq War.

The
 Prime Minister acknowledged that Iraq had ‘truly poisoned the well of 
public opinion’ on military intervention.

Prudent: An RAF Typhoon jet comes in to land at Akrotiri in Cyprus yesterday as a 'prudent and precautionary measure', the Ministry of Defence said

Target: Syria's President Bashar al-Assad (centre left) pictured yesterday during a meeting with a Yemeni delegation in Damascus

He admitted there was not ‘one
 smoking piece of intelligence’ but insisted it was ‘beyond doubt’ that 
Assad’s regime was responsible for a chemical attack that killed at 
least 350 civilians.

Mr 
Miliband insisted he was not ruling out backing military strikes at some
 point, but presented his own ‘sequential roadmap’ before he thought 
Britain should take such a step.

Asked if Mr Miliband was giving comfort
 to Assad, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Yes. The fact is that a lot
 of the arguments over this could give succour to the regime.’

No
 10 also accused Mr Miliband of ‘flipping and flopping’ and having 
privately indicated his party would back military intervention before 
moving the goalposts at the last minute.

Making their point: Protesters demonstrating against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, central London

Placards: A protester demonstrating against military action in Syria outside the Houses of Parliament in London

Opposition: As MPs debated the UK response to the Syria crisis, protestors gathered outside the Commons

Anger: Anti-war protesters have staged a number of demonstrations in Westminster this week

Labour said the suggestion it 
was giving succour to Assad was ‘frankly insulting’.

Mr
 Cameron acknowledged voters were sceptical about getting into ‘another 
war in the Middle East’ but insisted he was not proposing a long-running
 campaign to dislodge Assad – rather a strike on ‘command and control’ 
assets to try to reduce the chances of another chemical weapons attack.

A
 string of senior Conservatives, however, expressed doubts about the 
wisdom of intervention and Mr Cameron’s rush to join the US.

Former Tory
 leadership contender David Davis said: ‘It’s very simple – when you are
 going to do things which will lead to the death of people, civilians in
 particular, you should get your facts right first.’

Campaign: UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) and his deputy Paul Nuttall launched this poster opposing Britain intervention in Syria

Condemnation: Mr Farage said David Cameron's policy on Syria was his 'gravest misjudgment yet'

Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, said he did not support military intervention in Syria in any shape.

He said: ‘The drums of war were banging very loudly two or three days ago. The people didn’t like it.’

But
 Dr Liam Fox, former Conservative defence secretary, said: ‘Appeasement 
has never worked to further the cause of peace. It will not now and it 
will not in the future.’

Lord
 Howard, the former Conservative leader, said: ‘We are in danger of 
allowing the United States and France to act as the conscience of the 
world while the United Kingdom stands on the sidelines wringing its 
hands.’
