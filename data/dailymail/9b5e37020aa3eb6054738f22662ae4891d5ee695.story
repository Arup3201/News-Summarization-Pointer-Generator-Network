A bog-standard public toilet is set to be transformed into a luxury apartment after it sold for more than eight times the expected price.

The disused loo in Reading, Berkshire, attracted more than 80 viewings and the successful bidder snapped it up for £85,000.

Built in the 1930s, the former public convenience was listed at £10,000 before it went under the hammer in the village of Binfield, near Bracknell.

As property prices continue to soar, dozens of buyers flush with cash have been competing for a bog-standard public toilet which has now sold for £85,000 - more than eight times the expected price

It was listed at £10,000 before being sold to an anonymous phone bidder.

The project includes replacing the steel bar security gate with panelled doors fitted with fanlights, and replacing the timber windows to reduce the noise levels from the busy main road.

Councils have been cashing in on the property boom round the UK by selling off old and dilapidated public loos.

Many have been refurbished and turned into properties worth hundreds of thousands of pounds - some have even been converted into hairdressers and florists.

Developer Tony Thorpe, of Tony Thorpe Associates in Tilehurst, insisted the plans for the Reading loo will preserve the character of the building.

He added: 'The purchaser is a local man who spotted a development opportunity and took it.

'It will be a unique living experience since all the windows are high-level and there are no direct views in or out of the building.'

Last month a toilet in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, sold at auction for £100,000.

The
 brickbuilt structure was used as a public convenience up until 2012 
when it was closed as part of a cost-cutting review by Derbyshire Dales 
District Council.

The single-storey building came complete with roof lighting and running water. It had two rooms - a gents' and a ladies'.
