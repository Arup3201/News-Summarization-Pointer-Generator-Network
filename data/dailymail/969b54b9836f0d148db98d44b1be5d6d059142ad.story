If you happen to see a tiger-striped pony cantering past, don't panic, it's not the result of some freakish medical experiment gone wrong.

It's all down to a fun new range of non-toxic, water-based paint, designed to be painted onto equine subjects. As a result, UK kids have been getting busy turning their mounts into trotting canvasses, daubing them with stars, butterflies, peacock feathers, hearts and leopard spots. It's like My Little Pony come to life.

The British company behind the product, Fred & Bill, says the paint is the first of its kind in the UK. They assure us it's perfectly safe for the animal's skin and washes off easily.

Paint My Pony is a fun range of paints encouraging horse lovers of all ages to bond with their ponies. Freddie, 9, paints his 13 year old chestnut roan, Trumpton

They explain: 'Paint my Pony is a fun 
range of paints encouraging horse lovers of all ages to bond with their 
ponies in a creative and imaginative way.' Children are getting creative
 and decorating their pets with flowers, hearts, stars and even tiger 
stripes.

Cosmetically tested and kind to equine skin, it is available in a range of four vibrant colours, including Hot Pink, Tinsel Blue, Midnight Blue and Fiery Orange.

One pot of paint costs £7.50, and the pigment can be used freehand with a brush, hands or fingers to create personalised designs on mane, tail, coat and hooves. The company also sell a mini painter's palette for just £1.85.

For the less arty, a range of stencils is also available, which ensure a masterpiece every time.

And for fans of bling, there are
 rhinestone-encrusted stickers in skull, cupcake, 
unicorn and many other designs.

The firm, which delivers worldwide, says the paint is ideal for shows, rallies, gymkhanas, Boxing Day meets, fancy dress, team identification or a spot of fun in the sun.

The owner came up with the idea for the company after an accident allowed her time to refocus.

'Some say "more haste, less speed" and they would generally be right,' says Beth Cooper, the brains behind Paint My Pony.

'As
 a rule, slowing down has never come easily to me but when I had a bad 
fall from my horse earlier this year, it forced a change in pace and 
time to reflect…

'During those quieter months, the idea for Fred & Bill was formed and our first product, Paint My Pony, was born.

'Named 
after my children, our aim is to produce, and share with you, some fun, 
creative and exciting products, which we think are brilliant! It's
 been an interesting journey and a stimulating learning curve.'
