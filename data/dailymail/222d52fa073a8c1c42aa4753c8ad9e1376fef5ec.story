The Utah Jazz's new free-agent guard dunked just minutes after he signed to the team on Monday night - and he's only five years old.

JP Gibson, who has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, signed a contract with Jazz president Randy Rigby before joining the team in uniform in Salt Lake City.

Wearing a No. 1 jersey, he took part in the annual preseason intrasquad scrimmage at EnergySolutions Arena, as his dad Josh, mom Megan and two-year-old sister Elsie cheered him on.

After taking to the court in the third quarter, the youngster was passed the ball and dribbled into the lane as players failed to get the ball from him.

After running to the end of the court, 7ft1 center Rudy Gobert lifted him up so he could dunk the ball.

'JP Gibson with a two-hand flush!' the announcer shouted after the dunk. 

Fans roared in the stands as the other players congratulated him. 

The family was hosted by the Jazz and photographer Jon Diaz's 'Anything Can Be' project, which helps children with cancer achieve their dreams.

'We are a young team and we decided that we'd go even a little younger,' Rigby said in a media conference.

JP was diagnosed with cancer two years ago.

His parents were touched by the effort from the Jazz.

'We had no clue anything like this was going to happen,' his dad told the Deseret News. 'We just thought a little quick picture and (we’d) be done.

'The Jazz have been great at making this dream come true. I wish it was for a different reason. It’s unfortunate that it’s because he has cancer. We’re happy that there’s great people out there that care.'

In a statement, his mother added: 'JP loves most sports, but basketball is definitely his favorite.

'When he was just over a year old, he would sit with my husband, Josh, watching games. He started insisting on shooting hoops for an hour each night before bedtime when he was just 15 months old.

'He knows he has to be six before he can play Junior Jazz, and he reminds us all the time that he can't wait until he's six.'

Gibson's Jazz adventure was captured by Jon Diaz, who will create a storybook of the day.
