London Mayor Boris Johnson mocked the government plan to screen passengers arriving form Ebola-hit countries

Boris Johnson today ridiculed the government's attempts to tackle the spread of Ebola, accusing Number 10 of making promises which 'don't really make any sense'.

The London Mayor said he could understand why the public was left baffled by the Downing Street announcement of plans to quiz air passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent the deadly virus entering the UK.

Mr Johnson warned that 'eventually' there would be a case of Ebola in Britain, 'probably' in London, but the focus should be on preparing for it not making announcements about screening which does not work.

There is a growing sense of chaos surrounding government plans to screen passengers, with airlines insisting they are in the dark about how it will work in practice to halt the spread of the virus which has so far killed more than 4,000 people.

With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it is feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to use a Commons statement tomorrow to set out the timescale and details of the screening plan in the UK.

It is expected to start by Tuesday or Wednesday, in line with how long it took the US to introduce its own screening programme last week. 

On Thursday morning the British government ruled out screening passengers, with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warning it would be 'very hard' to track people arriving in the UK from affected countries.

But eight hours later Number 10 announced 'enhanced screening' will be carried out at Heathrow and Gatwick, and Eurostar trains, for people arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

But far from reassuring voters, the lack of detail about the plans have added to the sense of confusion.

Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I understand why people don't understand them. The difficulty is I think again it's one of those cases where we are at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense.

'You can't blood test everybody coming in to the country.'

There are no direct flights between Britain and the high risk areas, but it is possible to change in a third country.

Airport screening of people leaving airports in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea has been in place for several weeks.

But following calls for checks on arrival in the UK, the government suddenly changed its position on screening.

A Downing Street source said today: 'It is important to stress that the decision to bring forward that additional screening was taken with the advice of the chief medical officer.

'We are absolutely upfront about saying there is no magic solution for protecting the UK from this. This is another layer to try to help.'  

Medical teams at New York's JFK airport, armed with Ebola questionnaires and temperature guns, began screening travellers from three West African countries yesterday. 

John F. Kennedy Airport is the first of five U.S. airports to start enhanced screening of U.S.-bound travellers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Medical teams at New York's JFK airport, armed with Ebola questionnaires and temperature guns, began screening travelers from three West African countries yesterday

9.30am Defence Secretary Michael Fallon: 

'We're following the advice of the World Health Organisation, and the advice here of the Chief Medical Officer, and the WHO advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure people who are leaving are not infected, rather than trying to screen people who arrive. It's very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the UK.'

2pm Chancellor George Osborne:

'If the medical advice is we need to screen - it might well be - then we will absolutely take that action. We are not going to do anything that puts the British population at risk. Quite the opposite. The steps we have taken for several months now have all been designed to protect Britain from this awful disease.

5.30pm Downing Street:

'Advice from the Chief Medical Officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the UK's main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - will offer an additional level of protection to the UK.' 

But Mr Johnson insisted: 'I can only go on the advice I have been given and that is that although I think we are doing a lot more screening, we don't think that temperature measures alone will be of any use.

'Because you could after all be in the early stages of incubation of the virus and have two or three weeks to run.

'So the idea of screening at airports is far from perfect as a solution.'

He stressed the focus should be on screening and testing people 'people coming from the affected countries'.

He added: 'They shouldn't be allowed to leave if they have been in contact with people in one of the affected areas.

'And obviously we should be putting on preparations in this country. I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city.

'We have fantastic preparations in London for this, we have very good healthcare in this city, considerably better, alas, obviously than they have alas in Africa.'

Labour's shadow health minister Luciana Berger said: 'People don't want to see politicians on TV speculating about an Ebola outbreak, before passing the buck. 

'After the past week they want reassurance that robust preparations are being made. Boris Johnson should focus on explaining what plans are in place.'  

Airports, airlines and Eurostar have all said they are still waiting for instructions from the government about how its hastily-announced plans would be implemented in practice.

Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work.

Meanwhile the British expert in charge of the United Nations response to Ebola has said he hopes the spread of the killer virus will be 'under control' in three months.

Dr David Nabarro, the UN's special envoy on Ebola, said the number of cases in west African countries including Sierra Leone were increasing week-on-week.

But systems now put in place, along with international help from nations including Britain, could help turn the tide and reduce the number of cases from one week to the next, he told the BBC 5live Up All Night's Dotun Adebayo.

Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle took part in an exercise on Saturday aimed at showing the NHS could cope with an Ebola outbreak if and when it reaches the UK

Mr Johnson insisted the NHS was well-prepared for the deadly virus and was better equipped than the African nations which are worst affected

However Dr Nabarro said screening people arriving at ports and airports was 'less necessary' than screening on departure and singling out people because of their nationality or where they are travelling from was 'inappropriate'.

He added: 'As a result of the sensitisation programme last month I think we have got a much better community involvement, which leads me to believe that getting it under control within the next three months is a reasonable target.

'When we have a disease outbreak like this there is a thing called the epidemic curve, which is numbers of cases over time, and at the moment that epidemic curve is increasing in an exponential fashion ... this means an upward-going curve and it's quite frightening because it means an acceleration.

'By under control I mean we bend the curve down, the numbers of cases each week diminishes compared with the previous week to the point where there is no new transmissions. For me under control means the epidemic curve is coming down and we are confident that the numbers of cases is reducing and will be eventually ended.'
