Car lovers from across the globe have geared up to test their need for speed at the annual Summernats Car Festival at the Exhibition Park in Canberra.

From super-charged engines, high-performance driving to clouds of smoke and burning rubber - it's that time of year again where tens of thousands gather at the four-day street race event to show off their love for custom-made vehicles and celebrate all things cars.

Coming from around Australia and the world, an enthusiastic crowd of over 100,000 people are expected to attend Australia's biggest horse power party while the festivities unfolded through the start of the New Year and wraps up its final day on Sunday. 

Summernats delivers three and a half days of high octane extreme auto action including Australia’s top street machine judging competition, the world’s best burnout battle, precision driving demonstrations, horsepower heroics, and many more. 

Set against a backdrop of burnt rubber, the high-energy festival includes jam-packed entertainment perfect for all ages to enjoy live music bands, stunt spectaculars, airbrush art, fireworks display and more.

More than 100 cars set a new world record for the most burnouts performed at the same time as Australia's top burnout warriors battle it out for the right to compete for the title of Burnout Master in the Liqui-Moly National Burnout Masters.

Described as more than just a motor show, Australia's biggest car festival is a celebration of the street machine lifestyle and for the people who eat, breathe and live it.

Designated non-alcohol zones have been in place during the festival to ensure the event is family friendly, while traffic police continue to be out and about ensuring car lovers are also safe drivers.
