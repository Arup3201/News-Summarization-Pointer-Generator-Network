Martin Atkinson is the most experienced international referee in the Premier League and well aware of time-wasting tactics.

After a revelatory and most welcome post-match interview for Match Of The Day following Chelsea’s first defeat of the season at Newcastle, Jose Mourinho was gracious in defeat.

Then, when speaking to the written media, he changed.

Rather than a consistent story, Mourinho bemoaned the time taken by the ball boys at St James’ Park to return the ball — which was rich coming from a ‘master of the dark arts’ who knows and has used every trick in the book.

Somehow he tried to blame them for the defeat.

Atkinson, like all referees, is briefed to watch for such tactics and add time to allow for that lost in the ball being returned. On Saturday he added six minutes at the end of the second half.

It does not have to stop there. If he feels that the ball boys are deliberately acting in an unsporting way he can dispense with their services, as he can if he feels they are acting differently for the two teams involved.

Clearly, he did not feel this was the case and from what I saw I felt he was right — just like Mourinho did after the match and before his mischievous side got the better of him.
