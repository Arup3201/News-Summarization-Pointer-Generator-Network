Shawna Michelle Gunter will spend three years in prison after posing as a physician's assistant

Charges against Shawna Michelle Gunter, 37, included wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. 

With her phony credentials, she was trusted to diagnose 137 children and allowed to write more than 400 prescriptions. 

'"Shawna Michelle Gunter fraudulently posed as a licensed physician's assistant, treating patients and writing prescriptions, although she had no medical training," said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. fraudulently posed as a licensed physician's assistant, treating patients and writing prescriptions, although she had no medical training,' U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said at the sentencing.

Her trickery meant her employer had filed false Medicaid coverage claims without knowing they were dong so, and getting back around $19,000. 

The Baltimore Sun reports that Gunter will also have to pay $53,530.39 in restitution as well as six months of home detention. 

Gunter's plea agreement detailed how she got the job with a prior acquaintance, a pediatrician, with offices in Centreville as well as Chestertown after lying about having graduated with a physician's assistant degree from Howard University. 

Once hired, she was supposed to show a physician's license, DEA certification, and proof of her education claims.

Upon starting in the physician's office in July 2013 she presented a fake physician's assistant certificate and license number as well as an altered certificate and a fake diploma.

The pediatrician unknowingly filed thousands of dollars in false Medicaid claims through Gunter

Some of her patients included infants and newborns. 

Prior to coming to that office, Gunter had been fired from her job as a surgical assistant when it was discovered that she'd stolen a check from the surgeon and forged his signature for $14,400, WJLA reports. 

She admitted to the forgery upon being confronted, but she also failed to repay $7,800 she borrowed.
