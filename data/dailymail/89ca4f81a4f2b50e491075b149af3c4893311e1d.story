Two days after Tanilla Warrick-Deaves should have turned five, her mother’s ex-boyfriend was found guilty of murdering her.

The two-year-old was being beaten to death by Warren James Ross, 30, in her mother’s home on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, after he became frustrated that the little girl was not toilet-trained.

Ross abused Tanilla in the weeks leading up to her death in August 2011 as he used brutal methods to try to toilet-train her, forcing her to run laps, whipping her with various implements and hitting her.

The violence escalated with Ross striking the toddler repeatedly, banging her head on a glass shower screen and a cupboard door. The beatings were so severe that she lay unconscious in a pram for two days until she eventually stopped breathing.

The girl’s mother, Donna Deaves, witnessed the abuse but did not intervene or call for medical assistance as her daughter lay unconscious.

She was found guilty of manslaughter last year and was sentenced to 12 years prison, which was reduced to nine years after she agreed to give testimony against Ross, her former partner.

Ross was convicted in December last year after a harrowing six-week trial.

During the trial Ross remained defiant, using offensive language toward members of the media and making threats to a man sitting next to his mother.

When the jury delivered the guilty verdict he yelled: ‘It’s not over,’ before breaking down in tears, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Ross was in court again this week as those close to Tanilla read victim impact statements to the judge before sentencing.

The girl’s father, Adrian Warrick, who has Tanilla’s name tattooed on his arm told the NSW Supreme Court he had gone through ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’ and he could not understand why Ross abused his daughter because she was not toilet trained as quickly as he wanted.

‘Why was it so important to punish her so harsh that it took her life?

‘I can only imagine what Tanilla went through and the fear she faced through her ... ordeal.’

‘What did she do so bad that gave you the right to hurt Tanilla? None whatsoever. She was a defenceless child,’ the Sydney Morning Herald reported him saying.

While Mr Warrick was delivering his victim impact statement, the toddler’s killer was defiant. He stood up and shouted abuse at the girl’s father.

‘F*** you Adrian, you dog,’ Ross yelled from the dock. ‘Where were you for two years?’

Court officers surrounded the dock until Ross sat down.

Tanilla’s two sisters, who cannot be identified, also wrote victim impact statements that were read on their behalf.

‘You have killed my baby sister,’ one said. ‘You have scarred me for life.’

The other one said she was ‘angry because you have made the baddest thing to have happened,’ reported The Australian.

Tanilla’s father asked Justice Stephen Rothman to give Ross ‘a lengthy sentence or possibly life if that allows.’

Outside the court on Friday after delivering his statement, Mr Warrick said he hoped that Ross would never be released.

‘That's what my daughter deserves. Any child does. For what she had to go through ... such a person doesn't deserve to see the light of day in my eyes.’

His partner Brooke Bowen said Tanilla was a ‘beautiful little girl’.

‘People talk about closure but there's no such thing as closure. Today was a bit of acceptance of that she's never coming back,’ she told reporters.

Sentencing will continue in May.

Adrian Warrick is interviewed outside court this week. He is wearing a shirt with a picture of his daughter on it, with a caption reading 'Stand up don't give up'
