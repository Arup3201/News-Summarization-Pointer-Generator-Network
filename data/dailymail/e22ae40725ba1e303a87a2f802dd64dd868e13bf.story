It can now be confirmed hundreds of people in gleaming white trailers have descended on the Forest of Dean to film scenes from the hotly-anticipated Star Wars sequel.

Speculation and excitement over the film site reached fever pitch in the past 24 hours with a number of clues eventually giving away the purpose of the temporary Gloucestershire community.

The Forest of Dean is now awash with jedis, sith lords, caravans and set production equipment involved in filming an unknown forest scene for Star Wars Episode VII.

Fans are now speculating over which fictional Star Wars landscape or planet is being represented by the Forest

Due for release next December, the Star Wars sequel is being filmed at Pinewood Studios

Rumours first swept through the rural community on Monday, prompting locals and Star Wars obsessives to travel to the site in hope of a glimpse of the cast.

Due for release in December next year, Star Wars: Episode VII features the stars of the original 1970s trilogy Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher alongside newcomers and unknowns.

It will be set 40 years after the original films in the same fantasy galaxy, and fans have been buzzing with debate about which planet the lush green forest of Puzzlewood might represent.

The production recently made news when Harrison Ford broke 
his foot during filming. After initially being confined to a 
wheelchair, he is now walking on crutches

Excitement: The new film features original stars Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill 40 years on

Fantasy world: Puzzlewood (pictured) has already been used to film Doctor Who, Merlin and Atlantis for the BBC

The knotted trees and winding paths of the forest, a popular family tourist attraction, were said to have been the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's enchanted woodlands in Lord of the Rings.

More recently they have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis.

Fans have speculated Puzzlewood could be a return to the lush green territory inhabited by Yoda or the Forest Moon of Endor, inhabited by Ewoks.

For the original Star Wars trilogy, the spectacular redwood forests of northern California were used for the Forest Moon of Endor.

And the frozen landscape of Hoth was represented by the northern wilderness of Norway - which was so cold in real life that some scenes were shot out of the crew's hotel doorway.

Few details about the set have been released, but Kevin Smith - the director of Clerks (1994) and Dogma (1999) - gave a few tantalising details after a recent visit.

In a Q&A session at the Neuchatel International Film Festival in Switzerland, he said: 'It was tactile; it wasn't a series of f****** green and blue screens in which later on digital characters would be added. It was there; it was happening.

'It's like Field of Dreams,' he continued. 'And if [director J.J. Abrams] builds it, weâ€™re all going to come because it's amazing. It looks fantastic.

'I cried, and I hugged that guy.'

Star Wars will be hoping the scene they create at Forest of Dean is better than the last time the legendary films were shot in an English forest.

Whippendell Woods near Watford, Hertfordshire, were used as the meeting point between The Phantom Menace's Jedi knights and Jar Jar Binks - probably the least beloved Star Wars character of all time.
