A prehistoric sea creature that swam the oceans almost 250 million years ago has been dug up near Shanghai in China.

It's believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water - filling an important gap in evolution.

The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures. 

A prehistoric fossil has been found at the Yangtze River near Shanghai. An expert says it could be the first amphibious ichthyosaur (illustrated). These were reptiles that could live both in and out of the water. If confirmed it would fill an important gap in evolution. The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs

However, there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed. 

The ancient marine reptile, with seal-like flippers, may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea, scientists believe. 

Its relatives were dolphin-like creatures that swam in the oceans at the time of the dinosaurs.

They are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors, but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea. 

The Permian-Triassic extinction, which occurred around 250 million years ago, was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct and is more commonly known as the 'Great Dying'.

The causes that triggered the event have remained a mystery.

Some scientists have suggested the mass extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in the area now known as Siberia.

They claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of Earth’s species.

Research from earlier this year, however, suggested that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide.

These fumes could have suddenly spurted from the oceans and wiped out the huge number of animals.

Whatever the cause, the event is known to have wiped out 96 per cent of species on Earth. Today, all life is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. 

'Now we have this fossil showing the transition,' said lead scientist Professor Ryosuke Motani, from the University of California.

At 1.5ft (0.46 metres) long, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur.

Ichthyosaurs - meaning fish-lizards - ranged greatly in size and could grow up to 30ft (nine metres) long.

Superficially they resembled today's dolphins and whales.

They were very different to Cartorhynchus with sharp teeth in long jaws and big eyes. They had four crescent-shaped fins, a stabilising dorsal fin and a fish-like tail with two lobes.

Its fossil remains were dated from the start of the Trisassic period about 248 million years ago and were found in Chaohu near the Yangtze River about 150 miles (240km) from Shanghai in China. 

As well as big flippers, Cartorhynchus had flexible wrists which would have been essential for movement on the ground.

While most ichthyosaurs have long beak-like snouts, the new specimen possessed a short nose that may have been adapted to suction feeding.

Its body also contained thicker bones than other ichthyosaurs. This supports the theory that most marine reptiles that left the land first grew heavier to help them swim through rough coastal waves.

Called Cartorhynchus lenticarpus it is the smallest known ichthyosaur. The fossil (shown) dates back 248 million years, four million years after the 'Great Dying' mass extinction event that wiped out 96% of species. These animals moved to the water after being land creatures but until now no fossil marked this transition

The animal lived about four million years after the worst mass extinction in history, shedding light on how life on Earth survived.

The Permian-Triassic extinction, known as the 'Great Dying', wiped out 96 per cent of all species and may have been linked to global warming.

Scientists have wondered how long it took for animals and plants to recover after such destruction - particularly since the extinction was associated with global warming and ocean acidification.

Understanding how reptiles such as this survived could be important for our own future, according to Professor Motani. 

'This was analogous to what might happen if the world gets warmer and warmer,' he said.

'How long did it take before the globe was good enough for predators like this to reappear?

'In that world, many things became extinct, but it started something new. These reptiles came out during this recovery.'
