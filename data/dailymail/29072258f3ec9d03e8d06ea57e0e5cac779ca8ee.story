England captain Steven Gerrard insists he needs time before making a decision over his international future.

The Liverpool midfielder, 34, will mull over whether to announce his international retirement after Roy Hodgson's side crashed out of the 2014 World Cup at the group stage.

He said: 'There's no truth that I'll be making any announcement within a week. I think I need more time.

'I am still hurting very bad, I'm 
broken from what's gone on over the last couple of weeks. I need to 
clear my head before I make that big decision.'

Asked if he had a hunch what his decision would be, Gerrard said: 'Not at the moment, I need time.

'I've agreed with the manager I'm going to speak to him in a few weeks' time.'

Hodgson has received the backing from Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.

The manager said: 'I am very pleased of course that Greg and the board have come out and backed me to continue.

'We
 are midway through a term, there's lot of work to be done, but I think 
we are on a good path. I am very pleased I am going to be the man 
leading (the team).'

Plenty to ponder: Gerrard has not made up his mind over his international future

Sorry: Wayne Rooney had apologised for England's failure at the 2014 World Cup

He added: 'It means a lot because the job means a lot to me. It's a fantastic job, it's a privilege to have it.

'I
 am very pleased to have had that backing. Scapegoats are always 
necessary in times of failure, one understands that. But one would like 
to think the work that you do is judged over a long period of time.'

Hodgson said it would be 'absolutely the wrong time' to talk about his future after 2016.

'I am recovering from a very bitter experience, a very raw experience,' he said.

England
 still have one game to go, against Costa Rica, who are already through,
 on Tuesday, and Hodgson said he would make sure those players in the 
squad yet to feature would get some game time.

'I shall be changing the team,' he said.

Gerrard said England needed to 'toughen up as a group', but claimed they did have talent at their disposal.

'I
 think we have got world class players here, I agree with the manager 
when he says there are potential world class players here as well,' the 
Liverpool man said.

He also disputed Harry Redknapp's claim that players look for excuses to escape international duty as they find it a burden.

He added: 'I’ve never come across players who don’t want to play for Englnad. This group it means everything to be out here.

'If
 people want to point fingers I’ll take it on my shoulders as the leader
 of this team. We can’t allow it all to go on the manager and coaching 
staff. The players want to win the last game for the supporters.

'I’m
 not in a position to fight negative opinions. I have to disagree with 
the idea the squad has been cosy. We worked very hard.'
