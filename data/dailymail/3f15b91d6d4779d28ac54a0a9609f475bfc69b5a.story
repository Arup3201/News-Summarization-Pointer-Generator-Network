A British man has been arrested in Germany for allegedly stealing rhino horns worth nearly £50,000 from museums to sell on for use in traditional Chinese medicine.

The man, who has not yet been named but who reportedly comes from north London, was one of a trio of Britons stopped in a stolen car at a police checkpoint in Munich.

It is understood that he may have links to an organised crime gang operating out of Dublin.

Museum thefts: The preserved black rhino from the Cron hunting trophy collection at the Museum im Ritterhaus in Offenburg after its horns were robbed

While he and his suspected accomplices sit in preventative detention, police continue to try to ascertain if they have been involved in other rhino horn thefts on the continent.

'The person who is strongly under suspicion is accused of having been involved in the theft of the horns in February in the German city of Offenburg,' said police.

Police said two people distracted staff at the Offenburg museum while another two climbed on the display case and removed a rhino head from a wall to smash off the horn with hammers.

Investigations into the possible role of the other two UK citizens in the robbery are continuing and all three remain in custody. The hunt goes on for the fourth man.

Museums across Europe have recently been targeted by rhino horn thieves as populations of the animals diminish more and more in the wild.

The horn is ground down for usage in many Chinese medicaments, most famously to make an alleged aphrodisiac which, scientists say, has no effect.

A single horn can capable of fetching close to £200,000 on the black market. China and Vietnam are the main markets.

Audacious: Two robbers distracted the museum staff while two others rushed over to the rhino head mounted on a display 13ft high and broke off the horns

The Offenburg museum was targeted on February 18.

Four thieves entered the museum during broad daylight. Two of them distracted the museum staff and the two others rushed over to the rhino head mounted on a display 13ft high.

Officials at Europol, the European Union's criminal intelligence agency, say the number of thefts of rhinoceros horns has increased sharply in Europe during the past year.

Since 2011, the agency has recorded 56 successful and 10 attempted thefts.

Criminals purloined horns from museums and private collections in 15 countries, with many of the thefts believed to be linked to 'an Irish and ethnically Irish organised criminal group, who are known to use intimidation and violence to achieve their ends.'

Europol spokesman Soren Pedersen said the increase in crimes may also be linked to a rumour that rhinoceros horns can cure cancer.

But scientists have not found the horn, which is ingested in powdered form, to be of any medical benefit.

'You'd get the same effect by chewing your fingernails,' said Nigel Monaghan, keeper of the National Museum of Ireland.

Chinese medicine: The rhino horns are ground down and used for a variety of remedies, but are especially prized as an aphrodisiac

Norbert Niedernostheide of the German Museums Association said he knew of ten cases in Europe in the past 12 months where horns have been stolen from zoos, private collections and museums.

In Germany, Bamberg's Museum of Natural History installed extra security after a thief broke into the facility last summer and used a screwdriver to prize open the display case containing the museum's only wide-mouthed rhinoceros horn.

In their natural habitats in Africa and Asia, fewer than 30,000 rhinoceroses still roam in the wild today.

Javan rhinos, with a population of just under 50, are under particular threat of extinction.
