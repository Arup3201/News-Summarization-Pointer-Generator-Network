High heeled shoes, hair extensions, glowing spray tans and false eyelashes might sound like an Essex girl's party-ready regime, but it's how girls as young as three are preparing to compete in American style children's beauty pageants.

The mini modelling contests as seen on hit TV shows such as Toddlers and Tiaras arrived in the UK last year.

And they are already spawning a booming beauty industry for babies

Salons offering services usually reserved for adults, like hair styling, blow-drys and nail painting are now opening their doors to the under tens to meet demand for pushy mothers and style savvy youngsters.

Tantrum salon in Kensington is one such company, and they already have a thriving celebrity clientele with Geri Halliwell, Liz Hurley and Jack Black all having sent their children there for a haircut.

The salon even styled one of the bridesmaids at the Royal Wedding.

Tantrum’s co-founder Latasha Malik, 34, who worked in marketing and PR before opening the salon five years ago, told the Times that pre-schoolers make up about 40 per cent of their clients.

'We get all sorts of people but our catchment is quite wealthy,' she said.

A blow-dry for baby there costs £30 and follows a consultation and a trim - and they will also paint your child's nails for £7.

Nipper Snippers beauty parlour in Reigate, Surrey, offers 'party hair' for little girls with prices starting at  £22.

Fidgets salon in Tyne & Wear offers blow-drys to girls of eight years old for £13, stating on their website: 'For girls aged over 8yrs Curly and Frizz highly recommends a little pampering and suggests you get a wash, cut and blow dry.'

The US children's beauty industry is worth £3.3billion and beauty contests for children are the norm, with many families spending hundreds on dollars on one event.

The
Miss Mini Princess UK contest invites girls from one through 13 
to compete against each other to be crowned the most beautiful.

The
competition has four rounds, the first focuses 'on the face and beauty', while in round two the child wears their most 'eye catching special fancy wowing' outfit.

The
third round is talent where children get to show off, with props and 
costumes allowed, and round four is focuses again on glamour and 
beauty.

Titled 'Evening Dress', this is the 'final chance to show their poised elegant stance in a prestige evening dress'.

The
six age groups split the girls up into Baby Princess, Tiny Princess, 
Little Princess, Petite Princess, Little Miss Princess and Pre-teen Princess.
