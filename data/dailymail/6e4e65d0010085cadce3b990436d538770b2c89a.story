FC Zurich have opened legal proceedings against an opposition player after midfielder Gilles Yapi-Yapo suffered career-threatening injuries as a result of a sickening knee-high tackle.

The former Ivory Coast international sustained the injuries during Zurich's 1-0 Super League win over FC Aarau when Sandro Wieser charged in and planted his studs on Yapi-Yapo's right knee.

The 21-year-old was shown a straight red card for the shocking challenge and Yapi-Yapo was carried from the pitch on a stretcher after just 19 minutes.

Wieser was shown a straight red card after the sickening challenge after just 19 minutes 

The midfielder suffered torn anterior and interior cruciate ligaments, serious cartilage damage, a meniscus tear, a torn kneecap and deep bruising in his thigh.

And on Monday Zurich president Ancillo Canepa launched legal proceedings against Wieser for intentionally causing injury to his player.

But the Liechenstein international, who is a former team-mate of Yapi-Yapo after the pair played together at FC Basle, denied that he had deliberately hurt the 32-year-old.

'I totally regret what happened,' Wieser wrote on his Facebook page. 'There was absolutely no intent on my part.

'I've had a lot of experience with injury and I don't wish that on anyone.'
