This bride certainly made an entrance by turning up to the wedding in a fire engine after her original transport burst into flames.

Irini Georgiou, 23, was on her way to her traditional church ceremony in a 1969 vintage Plymouth Barracuda car when smoke began to billow from the engine.

Clutching her bouquet and dressed in a long white gown, Irini, her father Michael Georgiou, 48, and two bridesmaids were forced to jump out of the burning vehicle.

Way to make an entrance: Irini Georgiou, 23, arrived at her church wedding in a fire engine after her original transport burst into flames

Rescue: Irini Georgiou and her wedding party were given a lift by firefighters after her transport, a 1969 vintage Plymouth Barracuda, began smoking before bursting into flames

Fire fighters rushed to the scene and managed to extinguish the blaze - even rescuing bottles of champagne from the boot.

But Irina and her wedding party were left stranded without a way to get to Christ Church at Little Heath, near Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire.

So the fire fighters offered to give her lift - sweeping her up to the church in style on Sunday, complete with flashing blue lights.

Teacher Irini, of Potters Bar, Hertforshire, said: 'I was just laughing at first, I'm quite a laid back person, I was just thinking "can this really be happening to me?"

'The firefighters were simply great and we thank them so much for getting me to church.

'This is one big day we'll never forget!'

Her groom, Phillip Critoph, 24, was delighted and relieved to see her - as she finally turned up just 30 minutes late.

The builder added: 'I was a bit worried, because Irene was a little bit late, but it was quite exciting.'

Her father, Mr Georgiou added: 'We just didn't know how we were going to get to church.

'But the fire brigade came to our rescue as they put away their pumps and offered Irene and I a lift.

'We certainly arrived in great style - albeit 30 minutes late!'

But there was not enough space for all of them in the fire truck so one of the fire fighters transported the bridesmaids in a separate car. 

Mr Georgiou continued: 'One of the firefighters had to go in a Nissan Micra with the bridesmaids and they were over the moon about that.

'We had a few panic-stricken moments ' but it all worked out OK in the end.'

The happy couple had two days to recover from their excitement before they jetted off to Greek sunshine island Rhodes today on a two-week honeymoon.
