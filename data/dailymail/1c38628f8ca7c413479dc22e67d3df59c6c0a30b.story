New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez is embroiled in a war of words with his own team after he announced that he had recovered from injury without consulting management first.

The $28million-a-year third baseman took to Twitter to reveal that his doctor had given him the all-clear to play baseball again, describing the announcement as 'the best news'.

But Yankees general manager Brian Cashman responded with fury to his star player's behaviour, saying he should 'shut the f*** up'.

Controversial: The star sent out this tweet declaring that his surgeon believes he has recovered from injury

Rodriguez, 37, has not played a game so far this season after undergoing surgery on his hip in January.

Last month he started rehabilitation at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, and on Monday he batted in a simulated game for the first time.

Yesterday he revealed that he had met with his surgeon Brian Kelly, who suggested that he was ready to return to action straight away.

Rodriguez wrote on Twitter: 'Visit from Dr Kelly over the weekend, who gave me the best news - the green light to play games again!'

But Cashman disputed the surgeon's judgment, and said that it was up to the team's own doctors to decide when Rodriguez is fully fit.

'You know what, when the Yankees want to announce something, [we will],' he told ESPN New York.

'Alex should just shut the f*** up. That's it. I'm going to call Alex now.'

Yankees manager Joe Girardi added: 'I don't tweet, and I really don't follow Twitter. So I probably don't really know much of what is going on. As far as I know he has not been cleared.

'There's always a chain of command with injuries. There has to be and that's the process. It goes through our training staff, our doctors and our GM and then it goes to me.'

Star: Rodriguez is paid $28million a year but has suffered from injuries and doping scandals

Rodriguez, one of the world's highest-paid sportsmen, only joined Twitter recently and sent his first message on the site less than a month ago.

He has enjoyed a torrid time recently, as he was benched by the team for last year's playoffs and has now been threatened with suspension over a new doping scandal.

Rodriguez is one of 20 players alleged to have obtained performance-enhancing drugs from Biogenesis of America, an anti-ageing clinic in Miami.

He could face a suspension of up to 100 games if Major League Baseball officials judge that he has broken league rules.

In 2009, he admitted that he had used steroids for two years while playing for the Texas Rangers.
