Clara Amfo presents the Radio 1 Top 40 chart show, which is due to be moved from a Sunday 

The top 40 singles chart show is set to move from its traditional Sunday night slot. 

The move follows an international agreement by the music industry to release all new albums and singles on Fridays.

Experts hope the new co-ordinated release date across the world will reduce piracy and 're-ignite excitement'.

It comes after months of discussions between retailers, record companies, artists and musicians' unions about whether it should be changed.

The Official Charts Company spokesman said it now planned to change the day the top 40 is announced.

Although the new broadcast day has not yet been decided, a spokesman said BBC Radio 1 would continue to be the official home of the chart. 

In a statement it said: 'Exact details are to be decided, but Radio 1 will continue to be the home of the Official Chart.' 

A Radio 1 spokesman said a decision had yet to be made on whether the show would move or remain in its current timeslot. 

In the UK, singles are released on a Sunday, while albums are released the following day on a Monday. The chart show, presented by Clara Amfo, then runs between 4pm and 7pm on a Sunday. 

But albums and singles in other countries are released on different days, something which has led to problems across the industry. 

According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the global record industry body, retailers around the world 'are committed to working with the labels and artist communities to ensure the successful implementation of the move to Friday'. 

The IFPI said Friday releases, which will come into force this summer, would 'breathe new life into music', adding: 'It has a compelling logic, at the start of the weekend when fans most want to buy music.'     

Under longstanding traditions, albums are generally released on Monday in Britain and France, Tuesday in the United States, Wednesday in Japan and Friday in Australia and Germany. 

A number of independent retailers in the United States, the world's largest music market, had opposed the Friday release date. They argued that weekends were already the busiest time and it made sense to encourage customers to come on an otherwise slow Tuesday.

In recent years, artists including Beyonce and Madonna have also suddenly released albums without warning, sometimes selling them first in digital format, either in response to leaks or sometimes to avoid them.  

The music industry has witnessed turmoil since albums started going digital some 15 years ago.

The chart show's listening figures have alone dropped from four million in the 1980s to 1.3million. 

In comparison, Pick of the Pops, presented by Tony Blackburn on Thursdays and Saturdays, attracts an average audience of 2.1million for each episode.

However, although modern audiences can now find the tracks on YouTube or streaming services such as Spotify whenever they want.  

Paul McGowan, chief executive of Hilco Capital which owns Britain's largest music retailer HMV, voiced enthusiasm about shifting to Friday releases due to the flow of shoppers.

'Quite simply, new music should hit the high street when people hit the street,' he said in a statement.
