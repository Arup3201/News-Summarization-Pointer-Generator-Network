Smartwatches and wearables such as Google Glass are designed to make life easier - but these cutting-edge gadgets require considerable investment.

But now there’s a kit with a tiny screen that promises to turn everyday spectacles into smart glasses, and can be used to make a games console, smartwatch, remote control and more – from just $20 (£13).

The makers of TinyScreen claim the screen can also be incorporated into jewellery to display ever-changing visuals.

What it is? Tinyscreen is a small customisable display

Uses: depending on the kit purchased, the screen can form part of a smartwatch, basic version of Google Glass, video player or necklace.

Apps: It comes with a number of pre-loaded apps including a smartwatch app, video player and games, such as a clone version of Flappy Bird.

Customisable: The watch can be configured with basic code to use different watch faces and a Bluetooth connection to 'talk' to Android or iOS devices.

Notifications: Customisable notifications can inlcude incoming calls, tweets and texts, plus appointments.

Cost: Between $20 (£13) and $460 (£288) depending on the kit. 

Delivery date: Kits are due to be shipped in January. 

They include: the screen itself ($20 or £13) basic kit ($55 or £34) video player kit ($65 or £41) video game kit ($75 or £47) smart watch kit ($90 or £56) and deluxe kit ($120 or £75). 

More complex kits to build robots, sensors and all of the ideas are available.

Ohio-based company, Akron, is raising funds on Kickstarter to mass produce its device, which costs $20 (£13) for the screen alone, plus $90 (£56) for the smartwatch kit. 

The idea is proving popular, with more than $41,000 (£25,660) pledged so far. 

And with 22 days to go, the campaign has already exceeded the $15,000 (£8,388) goal set by the company.

TinyScreen is a small customisable 16-bit colour, 96x64 pixel OLED display, that is not flexible. 

It has been designed to let people play games, get notifications from their phone, and display useful information on their wrist in the form of a smartwatch, for example.

Once assembled, users will be able to fix the TinyScreen to a pair of spectacles to make a basic version of Google Glass. 

They will then be able to watch videos and view phone notifications easily.

The firm claims that a number of pre-programmed apps will work right out of the box. 

These include a smartwatch app, video player app and a video game app - which the developers promise require no programming skills.

With a little know-how, they explain that the smartwatch can be configured to use several different watch faces, as well as a Bluetooth connection to communicate with an iPhone or Android phone.

An open source app will additionally allow people to set up the type of notifications that they can receive and display on the watch, like incoming phone calls, texts, tweets and appointments.

People who adapt their screen to become part of a smartwatch will be able to download code so they can print a plastic casing using a 3D printer, or alternatively purchase different cases. 

Games will be able to be played on TinyScreen, using either the four buttons along the side of the screen, or with two tiny analog joysticks, which come in the gaming pack.

Currently, games include a Flappy Bird clone and Asteroid, with more titles to come. 

Users will also be able to create their own games using the open source software library.
