In their fresh-faced modelling heyday they were a familiar pairing on the party circuit.

And more than two decades later, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen appear to have barely aged at all.

The original supermodels looked as super as ever at Monday's New York premiere of Kingsman: The Secret Service, which was directed by Miss Schiffer's husband Matthew Vaughn.

German-born Miss Schiffer, 44, now a mother of three, was there to support her British film director husband Matthew Vaughn. 

She showed off the slender physique she has managed to maintain in a leopard print mini dress.

Miss Christensen, 46, who was raised in Denmark strutted her way into the star-studded bash, showing off her impressive model figure in a plunging black jumpsuit and gold shoes.

The 1990s was the decade of the supermodel and both Miss Schiffer and Miss Christensen were among an elite eight who commanded the catwalk and magazine covers.  

Both women still dabble in modelling, but also devote much of their time to their families. 

The pair remain friends to this day and still as stunning as ever on a red carpet appearance for the premiere of the Kingsman

The pair were joined on the red carpet by a host of stars on the red carpet including Anna Wintour, Brooke Shields and Olivia Palmero.

While the prmeiere attracted A listers in the dozens, one person who wasn't at the premiere however was Helena's Interpol frontman boyfriend Paul Banks. However, the couple have been together since 2008 and their romance is believed to be stronger than ever. 

Miss Schiffer has been married to Vaughn since 2002 and revealed last year she received an indecent proposal of £1million from an Arab prince at the height of her modelling career.

She told Jonathan Ross: 'The strangest one was an Arab prince. He asked if he could hire me for a dinner for a million pounds. I declined, and some other supermodel took it.

'It's not all about money. I just want to be able to walk down the street and be proud of what I do.'

Miss Schiffer and her husband have three children, while Miss Christensen – who is in a long-term relationship with rock musician Paul Banks – has a teenage son.

The glamorous pair, here pictured at a David Copperfield Gala in Paris in 2004, have stayed friends for over two decades
