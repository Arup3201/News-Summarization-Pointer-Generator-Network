It is one of the most hotly-anticipated film releases of the year.

But it seems the film adaptation of best selling erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey was not smooth sailing. 

The film's director Sam Taylor-Johnson has told of clashing with the book's author EL James over bringing her raunchy books to the big screen.

Fifty Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Johnson admitted that she and author EL James (right) had 'proper barneys' on set over 'creative differences'

Sam, 47, here with husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, says doing the film didn't impact her own love life 

The artist-turned-film-maker admitted that she and the best-selling author had a few creative differences

Taylor-Johnson told Porter magazine: 'It was difficult, I'm not going to lie.

'We definitely fought - but they were creative fights and we would resolve them.' 

She added: 'We would have proper on-set barneys, and I'm not confrontational, but it was about finding a way between the two of us, satisfying her vision of what she'd written as well as my need to visualise this person on screen. But, you know, we got there.' 

Asked whether she is friends with the author now, she replied: 'Ummm.'

When told that she didn't have to answer, Taylor-Johnson replied: 'Good.'

Angelina Jolie's name was previously linked to Fifty Shades Of Grey, with reports that she was preparing to direct the movie.

The Hollywood star has previously addressed the rumours, saying that she 'came very clear out of the gate'.

Now Taylor-Johnson has told the magazine: 'I got an email out of the blue from her saying good luck on your journey. I thought that was incredibly sweet of her.'

And asked whether the steamy scenes in Fifty Shades had any impact on her sex life with younger husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, she remained coy, saying: 'My intimate life is doing just fine. It didn't need improving.' 

The raunchy film, which will be released February 13, was rumoured to have Angelina Jolie as director for a while before Sam Taylor-Johnson was announced 

Sam Taylor-Johns spoke to Porter magazine

Sam told The Guardian this weekend about one scene in which she disagreed with producers, featuring 'sexual' jellyfish.

The director felt that featuring footage of the jellyfish would suggest the sensuality of a scene without showing too much.

She said: 'We went to this beautiful aquarium and there were these jellyfish. They're so sexual, jellyfish, when you look at them in tanks – just the way they move, the fluidity.

'So there was a scene when we go into Anastasia's world and her head, and we just had these jellyfish on the screen.' 

She added: 'It was beautiful, very impressionistic. Everyone went, 'What the f*** are those jellyfish doing there?'

'So we had to take them out. I wasn't happy to let them go.' 

For the Nowhere Man director, the scene was all about letting viewers' imaginations run wild. 

'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' she said.

'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.'

She explained there were constraints on sexual content because she wanted the film to earn an 'R' rating in the US – meaning it can be viewed by mainstream audiences. 

Porter, Net-A-Porter's fashion magazine, is on sale globally from 6 February.
