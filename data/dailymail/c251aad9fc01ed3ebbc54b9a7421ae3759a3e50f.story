Alexander Gustafsson entered the Octagon to a deafening reception from almost 30,000 fans, but left with tears in his eyes after a devastating punching display from Anthony Johnson.

Johnson, in just his third fight at light heavyweight, landed a right hand early in the first round from which Gustafsson failed to recover.

The Swede took a severe beating on the canvas before  referee Marc Goddard stepped in to end his punishment and set Johnson up for a shot at champion Jon Jones.

'Jon Jones, I hope you get well brother,' said Johnson. 'Let’s get this championship on and make the crowd excited about this.'

Johnson was competing for just the third time since his return to the UFC less than a year ago.

Having finally found a weight division to suit, the American upset Phil Davis with a unanimous points win in Baltimore. He followed that up with a stunning 44-second knockout of Antonio Rogerio Nogueira three months later.

But Gustafsson was expected to provide an altogether tougher challenge.

The Swede came agonisingly close to dethroning Jones in what was one of the best fights in UFC history in 2013.

And after a second-round victory over Londoner Jimi Manuwa last March, Gustafsson was set for his rematch with Jones in September only for a knee injury to rule him out.

While Jones would go on to beat Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas at the turn of the year, Gustafsson prepared for an emotional homecoming at the magnificent Tele2 Arena in Stockholm.

But his dreams of another title shot are now in tatters after Johnson's explosive performance.

The No 3 ranked contender needed a little over two minutes to make a statement that was not lost on Jones.

'Wow,' he tweeted. 'Man this fight's going to be awesome.'

Jones is currently dealing with the fall-out from testing positive for cocaine a month before his clash with Cormier but is expected to return later in the year.

'I'll be the hardest puncher he's ever faced and he's faced a lot of top quality guys,' Johnson said.

'Hopefully I can do things to him that no-one has ever done to him.

'Alexander gave him the worst beating he's had and hopefully I can give him one 10 times as bad.

'It didn't seem real. I couldn't believe I stopped the guy who, in my opinion, beat Jon Jones. No-one has ever stopped Alexander  like that before and I was just speechless.'

Gustafsson, meanwhile, was still emotional sometime after the fight had ended.

'I got hit,' he said. 'I felt fine going into the fight and for the few minutes we were fighting. He caught me and took the opportunity.

'Anthony is a beast and he did what he had to do.

'I'm going to take a few days off and go back to the gym. You always learn from your mistakes and I learned I need to keep my guard up.' 

Earlier, in the co-main event, Dan Henderson suffered a controversial defeat to Gegard Mousasi.

Henderson, fighting at middleweight for the first time in more than five years, was dropped in the first round and the fight was stopped quickly; perhaps prematurely.

Henderson, who appeared at the post-fight press conference wearing a patch over his left eye, said: 'I got hit and I couldn't see very well out of my left eye. He just clipped me a little bit. But I was aware of what it the whole time, you know. But it’s not his fault, he is a good guy.'

Mousasi, who bounced back from a defeat to Ronaldo Souza in September, said: 'I feel good. I like Dan Henderson but of course I’m happy and pleased that I won. It was a good victory.

'I thought it was a good stoppage. Right when he went down, I would have been able to put another punch in it but I didn’t because I thought the referee would stop it. 

'And then I thought, well maybe they aren't going to stop it, so I kept punching afterwards. So I think it was a good stoppage.'

In another potentially pivotal fight in the light-heavyweight division, Ryan Bader won a split-decision victory over Phil Davis after three tentative rounds.

'It was a split decision but I walked out with a win so I’m happy,' Bader said. 'Performance wise, I felt like I was a bit sloppy at times. He’s obviously a really good wrestler. His stand up is just sporadic. 

'At the end of the day, I came out of there with a win and I got the job done. Now, back to training – try to sharpen up those skills. Who knows what’s next? 

'I needed to get over that hump of beating one of those top five guys, so I’ll just go on from there. I’ve fought the who’s who of MMA so whoever is next, whatever is next, let’s just do it.'
