Convicted murderer Jodi Arias has suggested on Twitter that she may consider a plea deal to avoid a death sentence rather than appeal her guilty verdict.

In a tweet posted this weekend, Arias suggested she had not yet made up her mind on which option to go for.

Her Twitter account, managed on her behalf by friends, posted on Saturday the following two messages:

'Let's clear up any confusion. Anyone asking 4 donation$ right now on my behalf 4 my appeals is not legit.'

Convicted: Arias, pictured appearing in court last week, has speculated that she may consider a plea deal to avoid the death penalty

New wardrobe: Throughout the five-month trial, Jodi Arias wore prim sweaters and button-down shirts but today she was seen wearing the stripes and shackles of all Arizona prison inmates

This was quickly followed by another 
stating, 'I'm not currently accepting donations 4 appeals. Just don't 
know yet if I will plea or appeal.'

Last week a jury failed to decide 
upon a sentence for Arias' crimes; she will either receive a life 
sentence or she could be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander.

An
earlier trial heard how Arias, 32,stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 
times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him 
and shot him in the forehead. She then left his body in his shower where
friends found him about five days later.

Maricopa
County Attorney Bill Montgomery said last month he would have an 
'ethical obligation' to consider a plea deal if the defense offered one,
according to ABC News.

Appearing
in court for the first time since the Arizona jury was unable to decide her 
sentence for murder, Arias last week swapped her prim, collared shirts 
and business-like attire that she sported throughout her lengthy murder 
trial for the standard issue stripes now that she is behind bars.

The
procedural hearing lacked the sizzle of the five-month trial, which concluded in May, that 
attracted a global following and had spectators waiting in line in the 
middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom.

Last Thursday, the courtroom was about two-thirds full, the hearing was not televised, and there were no arguments in open court.

That verdict will come even later than previously expected, as the judge ruled today that the next hearing is scheduled for July 18.

Smiling through the process: Jodi Arias has already been convicted of murder but now she awaits her sentencing

Jury selection alone could take weeks, given the difficulty of seating an impartial panel in the high-profile case.

Prosecutors
have the option of taking the death penalty off the table, and Stephens
would then sentence Arias to one of two punishments: life in prison or 
the more unlikely life in prison with the possibility of release after 
25 years.

If prosecutors do pursue death, a new panel must be seated to determine a sentence.

If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed, leaving the judge to sentence Arias to one of the life-in-prison options.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said last week his office continues to prepare for a retrial aimed at securing a death sentence.

He had previously said he is confident an impartial jury can be seated to determine Arias' punishment but added that he is open to input from defense lawyers and the victim's family about possibly scrapping a new trial in favor of a life sentence for Arias.

Meanwhile, after losing motions for mistrials, appeals to higher courts and efforts to quit the case altogether, Arias' attorneys tried a new tactic this month, appealing to the court of public opinion while hoping to influence Montgomery's decision.

Decisions: The next hearing will be held on July 18 and that is when they will begin the process of picking a new jury for the sentencing portion

'It is solely for them to determine if continuing to pursue a death sentence upon Ms. Arias, who is already facing a mandatory life sentence, is a good and proper use of taxpayer resources,' defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott wrote in a statement provided to The Arizona Republic.

Taxpayers footed the bill for Arias' court-appointed attorneys at a cost so far of nearly $1.7million, a price tag that will only balloon if the case moves forward.

Arias, 32, admitted she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her.

Prosecutors argued it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman.

After murdering Alexander, Arias left her ex-boyfriend's body in his shower where friends found him about five days later.

She testified for 18 days during her five-month trial, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he had grown physically abusive.
