A single mother of five who forked out for a loan on a $43,000 brand new car from Holden, thinking it would guarantee safety and reliability for her family, has told of her three-year nightmare ordeal with the vehicle.

Vicki Dedeigbo’s nine-year-old daughter Treasure suffers from an incredibly rare and fatal genetic disorder called generalised arterial calcification and Ms Dedeigbo needs her car to drive Treasure the 86km from their home on the NSW Central Coast to Westmead Children's hospital in Sydney's west.

The 38-year-old, who tragically lost a daughter at just eight days old to the same condition, now spends much of her time travelling to see neurosurgeons, paediatricians and geneticists with Treasure.

The care worker also needs a reliable car for her job and to take her other children to school - but her Holden Captiva has consistently let her down, breaking down on freeways in the dark and causing her to miss vital appointments. 

'The engine seized on the highway at 100km/h and I was stuck in the first lane with all my kids in the car,' Ms Dedeigbo told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Dedeigbo said on numerous times she has taken the car, or it had expensively towed, to her Central Coast Holden dealership she has ‘endured rudeness and unfair treatment’.

‘I have been left stranded on the freeway, in the dark, unable to remove my car off the road on numerous occasions,’ Ms Dedeigbo said.

‘I have been late to an appointment because my car said it had 55kms of fuel left however I broke down around the corner from my house,’ she added.

Ms Dedeigbo showed Daily Mail Australia numerous copies of repair certificates from the garage including details of the replacement of faulty seatbelts that had ‘frayed on the outer edges’.

Other problems included electrical faults with sensors causing warning lights to flash and engine seizures that have left her stranded. One time she was forced to sleep in her vehicle overnight. 

'My children have missed school because the car wouldn't start,' Ms Dedeigbo said. The car is seen here being towed away after another breakdown 

The mother of five showed Daily Mail Australia her numerous repair sheets from after having to get her vehicle fixed repeatedly over the past three years 

The car's beam headlamps blew and a knock in the steering was also identified

‘My children have missed school because the car wouldn't start or I had to go 10 days without a replacement car until the dealership could diagnose a problem before they would honour a temporary replacement car,’ Ms Dedeigbo explained.

‘I had a threatened miscarry due to all the stress I endured with the vehicle over my last pregnancy and it is a miracle that my last child survived as I suffer from high risk pregnancies and Holden is aware of all of this. It is not at all what I expected from a $43,000 car,’ she added.

The distressed mother has started a Change.org petition, along with a number of other disgruntled customers, in an attempt to get her money back.

A Holden spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Our Customer Care team has been talking with Ms Dedeigbo regularly about this matter to help find a solution that meets her needs.

‘Earlier this morning a new replacement vehicle was approved for Ms Dedeigbo and we have attempted to make contact. 

'We look forward to discussing this with her and helping her into a brand-new Holden. Holden has also previously offered to cover any out-of-pocket expenses and will honour this commitment. 

'Customer service and satisfaction is always a priority and we take instances like this extremely seriously, we always endeavour to find solutions that meet our customer’s needs.’

However, Ms Dedeigbo told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I would really prefer the full cost back because I have paid so much interest on my loan already and I’m scared to get another one.’

Another repair sheet lists how the car 'cuts out just after starting' and 'won't shift down under acceleration' 

Along with the interest on the loan she has paid, every 30,000kms she has had to replace the tyres on the vehicle. So far she has bought four sets of new tyres. She also believes she is owed a sum of money to cover all the breakdown costs such as towing. 

Ms Dedeigbo is not the only Holden Captiva customer who wants their money back.

Stacie Konkel in Perth, WA has also started a petition on Change.org and says her car has had 'multiple issues since purchasing it new from a Holden dealership'.

'All door handles had to be replaced, new alternator at 60,000km, cooling system leaks, electronic problems, air bag issues and wait for it - CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE at only 84,500km,' she wrote on the campaigning website.

Laura Taylor from Cairns, in Far North Queensland, said she also bought the Captiva as a 'reliable and safe car' for her young family.

On her petition she writes: 'Day after we picked it up, it went back. Towing mechanism melted to the underneath of the car. Catalytic converter, transmission, casing, massive oil leak, new transmission needed, safety recall on power steering overlooked, windscreen wipers stopped, full engine rebuild at below 85000kms.'

She added: 'Car just stopped on a range on a bend, with 2 young children in the car (aged 18 months and 12 weeks), car in the middle of the road.'

Meanwhile, Karina Blackman from Sydney, NSW, said on Change.org: 'In the 12 months since I purchased my car (which was only 2 years old and still under a new car warranty), my vehicle has had a new tranmission (we later found out this is the second time the tranmission has been replaced), oil leaks, fuel pressure regulator replaced and has been back at Windsor Holden 5 times for a total of 6 weeks.'

And Belinda Smith from Burnie in Tasmania wrote on her petition: 'We purchased our Captiva in August 2011. On the 8th of September 2011 I lost use of my gears when trying to slow down from a 100km zone to a 80 km zone with a cattle truck behind me. I had a near miss with the truck and had to swerve off the road onto gravel.'

The women list numerous problems with their Holden Captivas and each of them are petitioning for refunds for what they are all claiming are 'faulty vehicles'.
