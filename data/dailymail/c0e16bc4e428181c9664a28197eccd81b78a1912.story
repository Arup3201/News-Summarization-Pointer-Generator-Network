Driving up sales: Land Rover hope to boost sales by bringing out a whole new range of cars

Land Rover is embarking on a major new model and investment blitz that could see production more than double to 600,000 vehicles by 2020.

It has a seven year plan that include a line-up of 16 different Land Rover variations including a family of six luxury Range Rovers, five leisure Discovery and Freelander models, and five iterations of the utilitarian Defenders.

Ambitious Land Rover is aiming to capture around 3 per cent of the global sports utility market which experts predict will reach 22 million by 2020.

The investment is a key part of £10billion investment planned by Jaguar land Rover over the next five years.

It means big expansion at the firm’s Solihull plant near Birmingham which builds the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender models, and particularly at its Halewood factory on Merseyside which builds the Range Rover Evoque and Freelander models.

Expansion is also planned in China and India.

The firm inadvertently leaked the extent of its proposed 16-car line up when its design director Gerry McGovern flashed up a slide showing silhouettes of the proposed vehicles on a power-point display during a briefing on its new Range Rover which goes on sale in the New Year.

New variants of the next generation of five and seven-seat Defender include a ‘crew cab’ pick-up truck.

A soft-top version of the Evoque ‘baby’ Range Rover is in the pipeline, as well as an even smaller Evoque.

A new flagship luxury Discovery is also touted, as well as a ‘baby’ Freelander.

Details are revealed in the latest edition of the respected Autocar magazine and its website www.autocar.co.uk.

Autocar’s associate editor Hilton Holloway who has been briefed by Land Rover sources says: ’Land Rover is on a roll. It is almost certainly the biggest investment that the UK car industry has ever seen.

‘The new aluminium production line at Solihull could produce 150,000 models per year at full stretch, which is the most profitable operating position.

‘With the new Range Rover shifting just over 40,000 units and the sport about 60,000,it leaves room for a range-topping aluminium Land Rover in a luxury segment that should be able to steal 50,000 of the 682,000 global sales.’

Of the proposed £10billion investment  not all will be in the UK, says Mr Holloway: 'About £1.8billion will be invested in anew Chinese plant that will have, in the first stages, have the capacity to build 130,000 vehicles per year, about 60 per cent of which will be Land Rover models.

'China is now Jaguar Land Rover’s second biggest market, just behind the UK, and Chinese tastes are  increasingly turning away from conventional luxury saloon cars towards sports utility vehicles.’

Land Rover sold nearly 50,000 vehicles in China in the first eight months of the year and its 96 Chinese dealerships is set to grow by a further 47.

Mr Holloway said: ’Perhaps the biggest area where Land Rover can make headway is in the mid-market ‘leisure sector’ where six million annual sales are up for grabs. As land Rover’s future line-up shows, it needs to build a family of cars in the sector where the current Freelander and Discovery compete.’

‘The new ‘leisure’ range would be partly built in the UK – suggesting that Halewood would need to expand. Significantly in a few years.

‘The new defender family will probably be built mostly in India, with European versions using a significant number of Indian-sourced sub-assemblies.’
