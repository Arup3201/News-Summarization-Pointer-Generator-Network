Manchester City have slashed ticket prices by 50 per cent for the trip to Arsenal in September.

City have been allocated 2,900 tickets for the clash against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on September 13 and have taken the decision to cut costs for the fans.

Travelling fans were set to be charged £64.00 for an adult ticket, while over-65 seats were priced at £27.25 and the under-16 bracket is set at £24.00.

Help: City will subsidise the cost of Arsenal tickets for their travelling supporters by 50 per cent

City, however, have moved to subsidise the prices for season-ticket holders by 50 per cent. The loyal followers will now be charged only £32 for an adult ticket, £13.62 for an over 65 ticket and £12 for a junior ticket.

A Premier League initiative has seen clubs donate commit to spending £200,000-per-season that must be used to enhance the experience for travelling fans. It is a three year agreement born out of discussions between the Premier League, clubs and fans' groups. City have taken funds from their war chest to halve the cost for the trip to Arsenal.

Different clubs use the money in various ways. For example, Arsenal took £2.50 off every away ticket for their supporters last season while they are also offering travel arrangements for games such as the 5.30pm kick off at Everton on Saturday afternoon. Stoke City offer free coach travel to all away games while Manchester United last season knocked £4 off away tickets for their supporters.

City's move follows continued protests by the Football Supporters' Federation against the rising cost of watching live Premier League football.

In defence of the £64 tickets, Arsenal would argue that their supporters are asked to pay similarly high prices on away trips in the Premier League.

It is understood that supporters last season were charged £58 for the away match at Manchester City, £59 at Chelsea and £55 at Manchester United. Equally, Liverpool fans will pay up to £57 when they visit the Etihad Stadium next Monday evening.

Arsenal have also been frustrated by the demands of certain smaller clubs. For example, Norwich City supporters were charged only £25.50 when they visited Arsenal last season while Gunners' fans were expected to pay £50 on the return trip to Carrow Road.

In January 2013, City fans protested inside Arsenal's ground after being charged £62 for match-day tickets. 900 tickets were returned to Arsenal before the game as supporters boycotted the expensive prices while fans raised a banner inside the stadium asking: '£62!! Where will it stop?'
