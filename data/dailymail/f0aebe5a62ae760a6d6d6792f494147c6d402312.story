After enduring months of noise and nuisance as Tesco expanded one of its stores, residents in the surrounding streets may have been hoping for a goodwill gesture.

They got one… a free loaf of bread.

The gift has infuriated locals in Toton, Nottingham, who have had to put up with work going on through the night and at weekends since July.

Fed up: Aggrieved neighbours of this Tesco store in Toton, Nottingham, were given a loaf of bread each

Sarah Turner, who lives by the site, said: ‘The whole of the summer holiday has been destroyed. I and my neighbours have constantly complained about the noise.

'I and my neighbours have constantly complained about the levels of noise, meaning our children have been unable to sleep at night as the noise has gone on past 9.30pm.

'We have had every Sunday ruined for goodness knows how long due to their insistence of jet-washing vans all afternoon right up to my children’s bedtime.

'The list of complaints goes on and on. I’ve had a couple of gestures from Tesco in the past but I spoke to the manager and told him that he was alienating the very community they wanted walking through the doors.

'He told me that he was going to speak to PR about doing something for the community to compensate them in some way and this is where the loaf of bread comes in.”

The neighbours received a loaf of tiger bread each - admittedly more pricey than that pictured

Neighbour Natalie Harvey, 37, added: ‘Most of the work happened through the night and at weekends. If the bread is meant to be building a relationship with the community, it is laughable.’

Mother of two Sacha Taylor-Jobbins, 32, said: ‘While the work has been taking place it has been terrible for parking.

'There has been a lot of workmen and a lot of heavy-duty vehicles around. 

'We deserve more than a loaf of bread for everything that has happened.’

The store gave away 200 £1.30 loaves of its tiger bread.

A spokesman said: ‘To celebrate the relaunch, we’re giving away loaves of bread and we hope that residents enjoy our great produce.
