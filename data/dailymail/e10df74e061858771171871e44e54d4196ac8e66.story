Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has been branded 'dishonest and deceitful' for turning President Barack Obama's own words against him in the first television ad of his 2012 White House bid.

The Republican candidate's commercial is set to start airing in New Hampshire later today, hours before the president visits the state.

It compares Obama's 2008 promises as a candidate - to turn around the economy, stem foreclosures and rescue the middle-class - with economic statistics that suggest the incumbent president has come up short.

'Dishonest and deceitful': Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been criticised for turning Barack Obama's own words against him in the first television ad of his 2012 White House bid

Romney then pledges a new direction, turning to his biography as a successful businessman.

'I'm going to do something to government,' he says in the ad, using footage taken during a recent stop in Dubuque, Iowa. He then promises to repeal Democrats' health care overhaul that he says is 'killing jobs'.

'It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C.'

The 60-second ad features clips of an Obama campaign stop in Londonderry, New Hampshire, in October 2008 and fresh footage from Romney events from recent days.

But the Obama re-election team is unhappy with what they describe as a 'deceitful' ad.

Campaign spokesman Ben Labolt told the Huffington Post: 'While the president brought us back from the brink of another 
depression and is fighting everyday to restore economic security for the
middle class, Mitt Romney opposes the president's plan to create two 
million jobs and instead proposes a return to the same economic policies
that led to the recession.'

The commercial is slated to run until the end of this coming Thanksgiving weekend at a cost of $134,000 (Â£85,000).

Romney told Fox News last night: 'The
contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark, people will 
recognise we really do need to have someone new lead this country.'

Romney,
who is at the top of state polls and is sitting on a mound of campaign 
cash, has kept his focus on Obama over the past year and largely has 
shied from criticising his GOP rivals.

He said: 'I want people to remember 
that when he was candidate Obama, that he said he was going to get this 
economy going, he was going to bring people together, be a real leader 
for change in America," Romney said.

Obama is set to arrive in New 
Hampshire today to deliver an economic speech. For months, Romney has 
given interviews to local reporters in states Obama had on his schedule,
either pre-empting the president's message or rebutting it.

Romney
hopes to later today use one-time rival Tim Pawlenty and Senator Kelly 
Ayotte of New Hampshire to make the case for Romney as a superior 
choice. Both have backed Romney's presidential bid.

Yet Romney elected to use his first paid television ad not to promote himself or criticise his rivals but to take on the man he hopes to face in November 2012.

He said: 'Clearly, the president can't run on his track record. His track record is miserable.

'So what he'll do is try and assassinate, on a character basis, his opponents and/or his opposition. I'm hoping that's me, but I'm not looking forward to those attacks.'

Even in a softer interview with People magazine, Romney kept his criticism on point. Asked by the celebrity magazine to say something nice about his potential rival, Romney praised Obama's merit pay for teachers and said Obama was 'a good example of a husband and father'.

Then he went back to his familiar refrain.

'But the plusses are far exceeded by the places where I'd give him a minus,' Romney said.

The interview included some non-political questions about his Mormon faith.

'Never had drinks or tobacco,' Romney told the magazine when asked if he's ever had a beer. 'It's a religious thing. I tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once, as a wayward teenager, and never did it again.'

Sarah Palin: Really a grandmother?

Reports of dirty tricks reached unprecedented levels during the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin faced rumours suggesting she was really the grandmother of her youngest son.

Internet sites were buzzing with unproven claims that Mrs Palin's daughter Bristol, then 17, was the real mother of her four-month-old son Trig.

Elsewhere, complaints surfaced in predominantly African-American neighbourhoods of Philadelphia where fliers circulated warning voters they could be arrested at the polls if they had unpaid parking tickets or a criminal conviction.

In Virginia, bogus fliers with an authentic-looking seal said fears of high voter turnout had prompted election officials to hold two elections - one on Tuesday for Republicans, the correct day, and another on Wednesday for Democrats, which would have been a day late.

In Nevada, Latino voters said they had received calls from people describing themselves as Obama volunteers, urging them to cast their ballot over the phone.

In Pennsylvania, emails appeared linking Democrat Barack Obama to the Holocaust.

'Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision on Tuesday, Nov. 4,' said the electronic message, paid for by an entity calling itself the Republican Federal Committee.

'Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake.'

Laughlin McDonald, who then led the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said he has never seen 'an election where there was more interest and more voter turnout, and more efforts to suppress registration and turnout. And that has a real impact on minorities.'
