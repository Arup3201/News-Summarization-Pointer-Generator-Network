High street giant Debenhams doesn't like sticking to the rules.

The store was among the first in Britain to introduce plus size mannequins, ban airbrushing from campaign images and use disabled models in their photoshoots.

And today they took their campaign against body image tyranny one step further by becoming the first high street retailer in the UK to promote its fashion collections with a campaign so rich in diversity.

The campaign turns its back on the industry norm of young, thin models, instead featuring an amputee, three models over 40 - including one nearing 70 - and a Paralympian athlete.

There is a petite model just over five foot tall, and swimwear shots celebrating curves using a model who is a size 18. Then there is Philomena, who hopes to become the first black plus size supermodel,  and Jada Sezer, who is the face of Plus Size Fashion Week.

For the High Summer look book Debenhams worked with inclusivity campaigner and fashion industry commentator Caryn Franklin MBE. 

The aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing.

'Our customers are not the same shape or size so our latest look book celebrates this diversity.

'We would be delighted if others 
followed our lead. Hopefully these shots will be a step, albeit a small 
one, towards more people feeling more comfortable about their bodies,' 
said Ed Watson, Director of PR at Debenhams.

'To
showcase the range of sizes and labels at Debenhams this season we 
chose models to inspire us with their own unique looks and 
personalities.

'I 
loved seeing the way that clothes emboldened each woman and man and I 
loved being on a shoot where no two models were the same,' said Caryn 
Franklin.

No age limit: The campaign features 69-year-old Valerie Pain, whose modelling career began in the Sixties

Embracing all shapes and sizes: The look book features alternative model, Kelly, who was born without her left forearm and discovered when she won TV show 'Missing Next Top Model'

Broad range: The aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing

'As a commentator on the importance of seeing a broader range of body and beauty ideals in our media, I never underestimate the power of great clothes to bolster self-esteem, or the impact of imagery that celebrates difference,' she added.

Minister for Women and Equalities Jo Swinson said: 'Once again Debenhams is showing that beauty comes in all forms – different skin colours, ages, body shapes and sizes.

'It was one of the first to introduce size 16 mannequins, and continues to send a clear message to the rest of the retail industry that many customers want to see more diverse and realistic images.

Diverse: Petite Tess Montgomery, who's just 5ft tall features, as well as plus size model Jada Sezer, who at size 18 was the face of Plus Size Fashion Week

'I have long been concerned that idealised, unrealistic media images play a significant part in lowering self-esteem and reducing women’s confidence and contribution – at school, at work, and in society. 

'The government works with a range of industries, including retail and fashion, to promote more honest and varied images of women. 

'The models in the look book are truly diverse, each with their own unique style and personality, and I hope they inspire others to feel good about their bodies.'

Debenhams scoured top model agencies in search of a group of professional models who go further to be representative of diversity, and to convey a message empowering every man and woman to feel able to wear the latest trends, but to make it right for them through style.

Paralympian amputee Stefanie Reid makes her modelling debut for Debenhams in the campaign and seasoned plus-size model Jada, size 18 and face of the recent Plus Size Fashion Week also features.

Then there is Tess, a size six petite model, measuring in at just over five foot tall.

While Valarie, 69 and Maxine, 44, highlight looking great isn’t anything to do with age while Philomena, a size 18 model, wants to be Britain’s first black plus size supermodel.

Hugo 47, and six foot four Lucio also make an appearance.

As a result of its work in this field Debenhams now sits on the Government’s 'Body Confidence Advisory Committee’.

Debenhams received a Body Confidence Award (2012 winner) –for its on-going Inclusivity Campaign showcasing imagery that is inspirational and realistic by using models who are older, curvier and in Shannon Murray’s case – visually disabled to inspire modern day British women .
