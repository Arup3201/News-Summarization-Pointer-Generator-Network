The 'Angel of Woolwich' who confronted a man accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby claims police threatened to arrest her after she reprimanded youngsters who allegedly threw eggs at her house.

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, confronted the fusilier's alleged killer seconds after he was slaughtered in a London street.

She now claims she was threatened with arrest herself after a group of young boys began pelting her house with eggs and stones.

The mother-of-two dialled 999 before going outside to remonstrate with the youths.

But she says when police arrived later they 'manhandled' her and threatened to arrest her for a breach of the peace - a claim denied by the police.

The teacher and former Girl Guides leader says the attention she received after her appearance when Lee Rigby was killed has made her a target for abuse on her housing estate.

She said: 'I've had trouble with these youths from the moment I moved in here five years ago - I think my accent makes me an easy target.

'Being on the television just made things worse. I became more of a target. I've never confronted them before but I'd had enough and decided to be brave and say something.

'They've been throwing eggs and stones at my house for months. On Monday night, I heard something hit my wall and that's when I caught them.

'Sometimes I just find the eggs all over my walls the following day, but this time I managed to catch them in the act.

'I asked them why they continued to harass me and they began shouting at me.

'One of the young boys pulled his trousers down and showed me his bottom. Then they ran away.

'I called the police as soon as the incident happened. They arrived after 20 minutes which was useless as by the time they got here, the kids had left.'

'The police were saying that I should stop ringing them and that I had no proof. One of the policemen grabbed my arm really tight and twisted it. He told me that if I didn't calm down I would be arrested.

'They made me out to be the wrongdoer - he just wouldn't understand my side of the story and that I was actually the victim.'

Mrs Loyau-Kennett, who is half French, decided to take matters into her own hands after three boys allegedly targeted her property in Helston, Cornwall, on Monday evening.

The death of Fusilier Lee Rigby shocked the nation after he died in the street

Mrs Loyau-Kennett became known as the Angel of Woolwich in the wake of Drummer Rigby's death in May after she jumped off a bus to bravely confront his alleged killers.

She has since written to the Minister for Policing, Damian Green, to complain about the behaviour of the officers.

She says she was so traumatised by the incident at her home that she fainted and an ambulance had to be called.

Mrs Loyau-Kennett added: 'I suffer from stress and anxiety which has got a lot worse since Woolwich.

'I stay in my house a lot more since the incident which means I'm targeted more frequently.

'Every time I try to leave my house they are there and I say nothing. I just don't know where to go from here. The police don't do anything.'

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they were called out and a woman was given advice about her behaviour - but denied she was threatened with arrest.

A spokesman said: 'At no point was she threatened with an arrest. The policemen gave the woman advice and left it at that. It is not appropriate to comment any further on the matter.

'We are aware of community tensions on the estate and are stepping up patrols with a visibility police presence.'

One neighbour, who witnessed the dispute, said: 'She went outside and confronted them and there was a very heated argument - insults flying about all over the place. I tried to calm things down but it just got worse.'

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are due to face trial next month for the alleged murder of Drummer Rigby.Â
