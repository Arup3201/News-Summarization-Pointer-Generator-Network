Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman was groped by a stranger while she was reporting on the Lord Rennard sex harassment case, she has revealed

The 39-year-old mother of two said the incident took place in a bar in London’s Soho last year.

‘This stranger came up and groped me,’ she told The Mail on Sunday last night. ‘It was really ironic that I was doing the Lord Rennard investigation at that time.’

After the encounter Newman said the 
offending man said: ‘It’s not a criminal offence.’

She added: ‘I said, 
“Well it is an offence.” It made me very uncomfortable. I then left the 
bar.’

An 
official inquiry into the allegations concerning Life Peer Lord Rennard 
said that although there was credible evidence he had violated the 
personal space of the women it could not be proved beyond doubt that he 
had acted in a sexually inappropriate manner.

In January Lord Rennard was suspended from the Liberal Democrat Party after he refused to apologise to the women.

But a cabinet minster said he could return to a key role within the Liberal Democrats despite his refusal to apologise.

The claims against the peer were first made in a Channel 4 News investigation in February last year.

In a separate case, Ms Newman has also been on the receiving end of more than 100,000 Twitter messages by a stalker who also kissed her after following her to the ITN building.

Adrian Johnson, 54, allegedly sent 
the journalist flowers and greeting cards and frequently turned up at 
Channel 4 News’s central London headquarters.

He
 also terrorised Ms Newman, who has been married to writer John 
O'Connell since 2001, with scores of emails and text messages after 
finding out her mobile number, it is claimed.

Johnson was granted bail on condition 
that he does not contact Ms Newman or go within 50 metres of her, and 
that he does not attend the ITN building.
