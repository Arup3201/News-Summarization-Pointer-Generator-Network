A man who was sexually abused by a Catholic priest in Los Angeles has accused a U.S. cardinal who took part in the papal election of covering up the abuse.

Michael Duran was 11 years old when he was assaulted by Father Michael Baker, who molested 23 boys during three decades in the priesthood.

Mr Duran, now 40, said he 'can still feel Father Mike's beard on my face' at a news conference yesterday.

The archdiocese of Los Angeles was led at the time by Cardinal Roger Mahony, who was in Rome helping to choose the pope this week, has now agreed a settlement totalling $10million to four victims.

Mr Duran said Cardinal Mahony helped confessed pedophile priest Mr baker evade law enforcement by sending him out of state to a Church-run treatment center, then placing the priest back in the Los Angeles ministry.

Mr Duran, a special education teacher, added that Francis's election to the papacy was 'tainted' because cardinals accused of covering up abuse had taken part in the conclave.

Mr Duran was particularly upset that Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony took to Twitter and a blog to defend himself while in Rome.

In one post, Mahony wrote about praying for victims of sexual abuse but also for 'those in the media who constantly malign me and my motives, attorneys who never focus on context or history in their legal matters, groups which picket me or otherwise object to me, and all those who despise me or even hate me.'

Mr Duran said: 'He was tweeting and blogging over there like an innocent man, and it was really offensive to me.

'He was acting like he was the martyr, like he was the victim in all this.'

Mr Duran was awarded $1million in the settlement as a videotape of Cardinal Mahony being interviewed in 2010 emerged, reported CBS.

The video showed Cardinal Mahony, who took part in this week's papal conclave, explaining why he did not report Baker to police after the priest told him about the abuse in the 1986 when he held the position of archbishop.

The lawyer asked: 'Wouldn't that be the right thing to do?'

Cardinal Mahony replied: 'Well today it would. But back then that isn't the way these matters were approached.'

Instead, the Church sent Baker for therapy. But a memo, written by an official and approved by Cardinal Mahony, warned that Baker should not tell his therapist about the child abuse.

'If he were to mention his problem with child abuse it would put the therapist in the position of having to report him. I think we have to be very careful,' it said.

Baker went on to abuse more boys after being put back into the ministry for another 14 years and was jailed in 2007 for 10 years.

He was released after serving four years of his term and is no longer in the clergy.

'I didn't do anything wrong and it's taken me a long time to come to that, but I didn't do anything wrong,' Mr Duran told CBS.

'I carried their shame for almost 30 years and I'm putting it back on them.'

Mr Duran said that he holds Cardinal Mahony more responsible than Baker 'because he had more power to do something about it.'

John Manly, Mr Duran's attorney, told CBS: '[Mahony] deliberately put Michael Baker back into parishes where he had access to kids.

'That is vile, it is wrong, it is sickening, and he deserves to be in jail.'

This morning, Pope Francis met all of his cardinals, including those who were too old to take part in the conclave, at the Vatican.

Addressing the cardinals in the Clementine Hall, where his predecessor Benedict XVI said goodbye to them a fortnight ago, Francis said it was 'very moving' to see the crowds in St Peter's Square who gathered for the announcement of the new pontiff.

He paid tribute to Benedict by saying that he had 'reinvigorated the church with his goodness, faith, knowledge and humility.'

The new pope, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, will be inaugurated during a mass on Tuesday.

Other victims of sexual abuse have called for Pope Francis to defrock US cardinals who covered up for paedophile priests, to formally apologise and to order the release of all confidential Church files from every diocese.

It's unclear how much direct experience Francis, an Argentine cardinal, has had dealing with sexually abusive clergy in Latin America, where the scope of the abuse scandal has been more muted.

He responded by making it harder for people to become priests and now 60 per cent are eliminated, his authorised biographer Sergio Rubin told the Associated Press. 

In contrast, Pope Benedict XVI was in charge of the Vatican office that handled clergy abuse cases before becoming pope and was a guiding force behind several sex abuse policies enacted under Pope John Paul II.
