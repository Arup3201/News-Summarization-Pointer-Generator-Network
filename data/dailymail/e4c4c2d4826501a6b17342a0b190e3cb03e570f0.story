Two women drivers involved in a car crash who have not been named were stung by over 600 angry bees after one of the cars hit and dislodged a hive.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Jose Larios says the collision occurred on Sunday in suburban La Canada Flintridge, California.

The collision occurred around 2:50 p.m. on the 200 block of Los Amigos Street, reported KTLA.

Thousands of bees attacked the women drivers after their hive was dislodged from a tree

One of the cars hit a tree and dislodged a bee hive of about 1,000 bees

One of the drivers, a 51-year-old woman, jumped into a backyard swimming pool to escape being stung by the swarming insects.

The driver of the other car, a 17-year-old girl, fell to the street where a deputy found her covered in bees. He had to use a fire extinguisher and then a neighbor's hose to stop the violent swarm of bees from harming her.

Each of the poor drivers were stung over 600 times between the both of them. After a car dislodged the hive, 1,000 perturbed bees were released into the area.

The 17-year-old was screaming so loud that 'neighbors started pouring out of their homes,' said CBS reporter Bobby Kaple.

Even news teams had to do their best to avoid being stung by bees in the area.

'We got out of our truck to shoot some video when the bees started circling us,'  Kaple reported almost two hours after the swarm began buzzing around.

CBS reports that the women were first attacked when exchanging insurance information.

Both drivers were treated at a hospital. The deputy was also stung but he did not require hospital treatment.

The bee hive was removed by a pest control company.
