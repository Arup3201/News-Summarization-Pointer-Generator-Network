It's every plane passenger's worst nightmare - but a surprisingly good premise for a film.

Unfortunately, it seems Denzel Washington's portrayal of a fully-functioning alcoholic pilot in the new film Flight isn't going down well with everyone.

Brewer Anheuser-Busch has asked Paramount Pictures to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from scenes of the movie showing Washington's character drinking the beer while in the cockpit.

And the distributor of Stolichnaya has made a similar request - despite the film already showing in American cinemas and grossing £15.7m in its debut weekend.

Sobering: Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic pilot in the film Flight, which opened in American cinemas last weekend, but some drinks companies are not happy with the portrayal of their products

Washington's character frequently drinks Vodka throughout the film, with several different brands represented.

But William Grant & Sons, who distribute Stolichnaya in the United States, said it did not license its brand for inclusion and would have refused permission if asked.

James Curich, a spokesman for the company, said the company had a strict code for how their vodka was portrayed in films and wanted to market it responsibly.

'Considering the subject matter of this film, it is not something in which we would have participated,' he said.

Rob McCarthy, vice President of Budweiser, said his company had not been contacted by Paramount or the production company of director Robert Zemeckis for permission.

'We would never condone the misuse of our products, and have a long history of promoting responsible drinking and preventing drunk driving,' he said.

'We have asked the studio to obscure the Budweiser trademark in current digital copies of the movie and on all subsequent adaptations of the film, including DVD, On Demand, Streaming and additional prints not yet distributed to theatres.'

A spokesman for Mr Zemeckis referred questions to Paramount, which did not return a message seeking comment.

Regrettably for the drinks companies, experts say there's little they can do about it legally.

'Trademark laws 'don't exists to give companies the right to control and censor movies and TV shows that might happen to include real-world items,' said Daniel Nazer, a resident fellow at Stanford Law School's Fair Use Project.

'It is the case that often film-makers get paid by companies to include their products. I think that's sort of led to a culture where they expect they'll have control. That's not a right the trademark law gives them.'

Jay Dougherty, a professor at Loyola Law School, said the use of brands in films had generally been protected by the courts, even when the companies are not pleased with the portrayals.

'It wouldn't have been effective as film if we used a bunch of non-generic brands,' said Prof Doughterty, who is also the director of the school's Entertainment & Media Law Institute.

'In a normal situation, if the alcohol were just there as a smaller part of the movie, they might have created an artificial brand for it.'

Other vodka brands, including Absolut and Smirnoff, are also included in the film. Representatives of those companies did not return messages seeking comment.
