Australians will soon be able to test themselves for HIV after the federal government announced that restrictions preventing the manufacture and sale of oral home-testing kits have been lifted.

This will enable kits to be sold straight to customers in the hope it leads to early detection and treatment in a bid to stop the virus be spread.

The government unveiled its 2014-2017 national strategies on HIV, hepatitis B and C, sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and a special strategy on targeting blood borne viruses and STIs in the indigenous community.

The HIV strategy aims to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV by 50 per cent by 2015, as a key step towards a 2020 elimination target.

The Federal Government has announced Australians will be able to test themselves for HIV using home-testing kits

To help it achieve this goal the government has removed a restriction preventing the manufacture and sale of HIV home self-tests.

Health Minister Peter Dutton said on Monday that companies can now apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for approval to supply their test kits, which will be able to be sold direct to customers.

'We know that there are Australians living with undiagnosed HIV,' Mr Dutton said. 'Home self-testing provides an additional testing option that complements current options and allows people living with HIV to learn their HIV status and seek appropriate treatment and support.

'It also overcomes some of the common concerns people have about receiving the test in a medical setting and gives them more choice.'

Mr Dutton also said the early diagnosis of HIV was critical to supporting Australians living with the condition to get the treatment they need sooner and to stop its spread.

The kits offer an alternative to visiting a clinic and being tested by a clinician

The move follows the successful rollout of the oral swab kits in countries including the U.S. and the kits will be available for purchase from pharmacies, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Therapeutic Goods Administration national manager John Skerritt said the home kits detect antibodies in oral fluid produced by people with the virus.

'A small purple band appears to show the antibody is present and you are therefore likely to have HIV. It's like a home pregnancy test,' he said.

Professor Skerritt said the kits were sold in the U.S. for about $40 and people using them had access to aÂ  24-hour hotline providing them with support and information.

Mr Dutton also announced that from next July those living with HIV will be able to access their medicine from a pharmacy of their choice, rather than the hospital - $16.2 million over four years to improve patient access to HIV antiretroviral therapies in the community.

Alfred Hospital infectious diseases director Sharon Lewin said the HIV strategy sets some 'ambitious targets'.

It is hoped the kits will help the government meet its target of eliminating the virus by 2020 through early detection and treatment

'Australia has taken a rather bold step working towards eliminating new HIV infections by 2020,' she said.

'The increased availability of testing and greater ease of accessing treatment through community-based pharmacies will both greatly assist in reducing new infections.'

There were 1,200 new HIV infections last year and the highest prevalence of HIV is still among gay men in Australia.

'A big challenge will be in eliminating new infections in men who have sex with men,' Prof Lewin said.

She said that home-testing offered people an alternative way of getting testing - rather than visiting a clinic to be tested by a medical practitioner.

But she said it was essential that there was support available for people with a positive result.

Meanwhile, the government plans to halve the incidence of new hepatitis C infections over the next four years.

Chronic hepatitis C affects about 230,000 people in Australia and is a leading cause of liver cancer.

Mr Dutton said the TGA recently approved a new hepatitis C treatment called sofosbuvir (Sovaldi, Gilead).

This treatment can reduce treatment time and increase cure rates for hepatitis C to 90 per cent.

Hepatitis Australia, who worked with the government to develop the national strategies, said immediate action was needed to halt the rising rates of new infections and 'appallingly low levels of treatment'.

'Without urgent investment in rigorous treatment programs, Australia will continue to fail in its efforts to halt escalating rates of serious liver disease due to chronic hepatitis B or C,' said Hepatitis Australia's acting chief executive Kevin Marriott.

The 20th International AIDS conference will be held in Melbourne later this month.
