A man organised his wedding in less than 24 hours so he could marry his terminally ill fiancée before it was too late.

Paul Wheatley had been with his partner, Donna, for 12 years when she was admitted to hospital with kidney and heart problems.

On April 17, 2013, the couple from Leeds were given the devastating news that the 36-year-old had just weeks, if not days, to live.

Paul Wheatley, 40, planned his wedding in just 24 hours after his partner, Donna, 36, was given just days to live. The couple are pictured with their son, Kian, nine, during the wedding which took place in hospital

Mrs Wheatley was rushed to hospital with severe vomiting on Christmas Day and tests revealed she was suffering from terminal heart and kidney failure

Mr Wheatley, along with friends, family and hospital staff, rallied round to organise the couple’s wedding in just 24 hours.

They tied the knot at Leeds General Infirmary, but tragically, Mrs Wheatley lost her fight with kidney and heart failure just six days later.

Mr Wheatley, 40, said: ‘We had been engaged for nine years and wanted to get married abroad, but we just never got round to it.

‘As soon as the doctors told us that Donna didn’t have long left, I went immediately down to the registry office to collect the paperwork and start organising.

‘Everyone was incredible - we got flowers, a buffet, a dress, suits and rings all sorted in just a day.

‘It meant such a lot to Donna that I went to all the effort to make sure she had the special day we’d talked about.

Mrs Wheatley (right before her illness with her best friend, Jane) was diabetic and her health had been deteriorating gradually for years

‘It doesn’t seem fair that I only got to call her my wife for six days, but I know I made those last days special.’

Mrs Wheatley suffered from diabetes and her health first started to deteriorate three years ago.

She had four operations on her eyes and it was thought she had turned a corner.

But at Christmas last year she suffered severe vomiting and Mr Wheatley was forced to take her to hospital on Christmas Day.

He said: ‘There had been a stomach bug going round, so we just thought she had that.

‘After a few days I was really worried about her, but she refused to go to hospital.

Mr Wheatley says he always expected his partner to get better. But when he was told she was dying, he immediately set about planning their wedding

Mrs Wheatley (pictured with her son, Kian) died just six days after the wedding

‘On Christmas Day I had to put my foot down, she was terrible.

‘At Scarborough Hospital we were told she had heart and kidney problems and Donna was transferred to St James University Hospital, Leeds.

‘It was a very worrying time, but we always thought she would get better.

‘Even months later when they told us it was terminal Donna refused to give up hope.’

Mrs Wheatley was briefly released from hospital in March before returning to hospital and being transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where they were told the devastating news that she would not be leaving the hospital.

Mr Wheatley called in favours from friends, family and local business to organise their big day.

Mr Wheatley said: 'It doesn't seem fair that I only got to call her my wife for six days, but I know I made those last days special'

The couple’s son, Kian, nine, was best man for the wedding, and Donna’s step-sister, Laura Adams, sang John Legend’s All Of Me.

Mr Wheatley said: ‘It was an incredibly moving day - everyone was in tears.

‘I helped Kian with his speech and we tried to make it light-hearted to give the wedding a bit of everything.

‘Donna picked up for the day and we had photos done in the rose garden on the roof, before she became too tried at about half four.

‘In the days that followed I did everything I could to keep her spirits up.

‘She’d had a falling out with some old friends over 10 years ago and I arranged for them to come and see her in hospital.

‘She also had a phone call with Danny McNamara, the lead singer of Embrace, and he was planning on coming to visit her over the weekend.’

Mrs Wheatley was transferred from Leeds General Infirmary to St James’s University Hospital where she passed away surrounded by friends and family on April 24.
