'Pot princess': Andrea Sanderlin, 45, a suburban mother of three and avid equestrian, has been arrested and charged with running a multimillion-dollar marijuana growing outfit

A mother of three from the upscale New
York City suburb of Scarsdale who is accused of growing thousands of 
marijuana plants was compared Tuesday to Colombian cocaine lords.

Andrea
Sanderlin, 45, was indicted in federal court in Brooklyn on charges of 
operating a sophisticated pot-growing operation in a Queens warehouse.

‘Whether
you're a suburban mom growing marijuana in a warehouse in Queens or a 
cartel member making cocaine in the jungles of Colombia, manufacturing 
and distributing illegal narcotics comes at a hefty price,’ said James 
Hayes Jr., a Homeland Security agent, in a release announcing the 
indictment.

U.S. Attorney 
Loretta Lynch said Sanderlin ‘chose to inhabit the shadowy underworld of
large-scale drug dealers, using drug proceeds to maintain her family's 
facade of upper middle class stability.’

A call to Sanderlin's attorney, Joel Winograd, was not immediately returned.

Sanderlin, a mother of two daughters and a son, pleaded not guilty in May when she was taken into custody on a federal complaint.

Following her arrest, New York City tabloids 
compared her lifestyle - living in a Spanish-style mansion, driving a 
Mercedes SUV, horseback riding in equestrian gear - to the plot of 
‘Weeds,’ a television series about a suburban mom from California who 
becomes a pot dealer to support her family.

‘Sanderlin
could have focused her talents on building a legitimate business 
enterprise to support her family and serve as a role model for her 
children,’ Lynch said in the statement.

Sanderlin has been held without bail since her arrest. No arraignment has been scheduled.

She
faces two counts of manufacturing and possessing marijuana with intent 
to distribute and maintaining a drug-involved premises.

If convicted, Sanderlin could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined up to $10million, Lynch said.

After
being tipped off by an informant, agents from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration followed Sanderlin's Mercedes from Scarsdale to Queens 
and found nearly 3,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value 
of $3million, as well as dried pot and paraphernalia.

Sanderlin
is accused of operating the facility which had state-of-the-art 
lighting, irrigation, electrical and ventilation systems and cost more 
than $9,000 a month to run.

It was the warehouse's unusually high electric bill that raised suspicions about Sanderlin’s line of work, officials said.

The criminal complaint against Sanderlin was filed May 20 by Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent David Lee. It was first reported earlier this month by The Smoking Gun website.

Lee says law enforcement agents entered Sanderlin's Queens warehouse using a search warrant to find two rooms designed to grow marijuana. He says each room had state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation and ventilation systems.

In a twist straight from the Showtime series 'Weeds,' which told the story of suburban mom Nancy Botwin, played by Mary-Louise Parker, who built a marijuana-growing operation, officials say Sanderlin had set up a greenhouse in Maspeth, Queens, where she cultivated 2,800 plants worth $3million.

When DEA officials busted the 45-year-old Virginia native outside the warehouse, they seized the marijuana plants, as well as 'large quantities of dried marijuana,' along with special lighting, hydroponic watering system and ventilation equipment.

Sanderlin, who lives with her two daughters, ages 3 and 13 in a well-appointed home on Saxon Woods Road in Scarsdale, has been charged with felony narcotics trafficking, which carries a minimum 10-year prison sentence.

The woman's lawyer, Joel Winograd, descried his client as a 'full-time mother' who had never run afoul of the law before.

According to federal officials, Sanderlin has been running her marijuana business through a shell company called Fantastic Enterprises Inc.

Sanderlin's name first appeared on the radar of federal agents in April when they arrested five men suspected of running a marijuana-growing outfit from two New York City warehouses.

That business was allegedly headed by 50-year-old Stephen Haberstroh, a Scarsdale resident and Sanderlin's longtime friend.

During the investigation, one member of the pot-growing business told federal officials that Sanderlin, whom he referred to as 'Andi,' operated 'at last one marijuana grow house in Brooklyn or Queens,' according to a criminal complaint. 

DEA agents quickly linked Sanderlin to several industrial properties, which racked up unusually high charges for electricity, suggesting that the spaces were used as grow houses.

Federal officials also discovered that Sanderlin's company had an electric account at a one-story warehouse on 57th Drive in Queens, which used up $9,000 worth of charges a month. The bills were usually paid in cash, which also raised a red flag for investigators.

After staking Sanderlin out for several days, on May 20 DEA agents moved in to arrest her as she approached the warehouse in her gray 2010 Mercedes-Benz SUV. Sanderlin refused to allow the officers to enter the property, but they came prepared with search warrants on hand.

Upon entering the property, agents discovered over 1,000 pot plants housed in two rooms, as well as nearly 2,000 other plants that had been prepared for distribution.

Queens Neighbor Noria Solis said she had been smelling pot in the area since December, but assumed that the odor came from local teens smoking marijuana.

Although it remains unknown how long the mother of three has been growing marijuana, she has been leaving posts on message boards like cannabis.com about hydroponic growing techniques since 2008 under the user name andi68.

According to the criminal complaint, Sanderlin had several addresses in New York registered to her name, including 420 Tiffany Street in The Bronx, where she had allegedly operated another grow house.

Inside Sanderlin's sprawling four-bedroom Scarsdale home worth between $1.2 and $2.4million, DEA officials said they found $6,000 in cash and books on money-laundering and growing marijuana.

They also seized $7,900 from the woman's nanny, who allegedly attempted to carry out the cash inside a brown leather bag to Sanderlin's boyfriend, who has been identified as Victor Garcia.

Sanderlin also has a 27-year-old son from her first marriage at age 16. He lives in Brooklyn, and according to the New York Post, he has been arrested twice for marijuana possession.

Sanderlin had recently began taking part in horseback-riding competitions and took lessons with her teenage daughter at Twin Lakes Farm, a riding academy and competitive show stable in Bronxville, according to owner Scott Tarter.

Tarter described Sanderlin to CNN as a ‘beginner adult rider’ who joined the academy in January after buying a big black Friesian horse. Tarter described the 45-year-old woman as a normal, caring, local mother who boarded her horse at his stables.

Tarter said he was led to believe Sanderlin was in the interior design business.

‘She was just like all the local moms here,’ he said. ‘She wasn't loud. I never saw her smoking or drinking or anything that would have made me believe this.’

In March, Sanderlin won several ribbons in a local equestrian contest, but sold her horse for more than $9,000 last month and was on the market for a new jumping horse.

In an interview with The Post this week, Jenji Khan, the creator of the series Weeds, which ran for eight seasons on Showtime, called Sanderlin's arrest 'a bummer' and joked that 'it's tough being a stay-at-home mom.'
