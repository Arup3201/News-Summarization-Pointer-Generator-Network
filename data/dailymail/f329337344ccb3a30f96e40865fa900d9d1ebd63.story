Dramatic CCTV footage has been released of the raid at Red Bull's Formula One headquarters in Milton Keynes where 60 trophies were stolen.

The video, which will be aired on BBC One's Crimewatch programme later on Wednesday, shows a 4x4 ramming through the entrance of the team's base before thieves begin raiding the trophy cabinet.

One of the suspects is seen throwing throwing one of the trophies on to the floor.

A total of six men were involved in the heist as 60 trophies were stolen from Red Bull's cabinet

The thieves were caught on camera moving the trophies from the cabinet to the car

Six men were involved in the December heist and around 20 of the trophies, which didn't include the team's F1 championship and constructors' awards, were found dumped in a lake near Sandhurst 10 days later.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the manner in which some trophies were found showed the disregard the criminals had for the objects stolen.

'It's good news that some of our trophies have been found and thanks to the police for all their help so far,' he said.

The burglars even managed to discard some of the trophies on the floor during the heist

'The fact that some of the trophies were discarded in a lake and damaged shows how senseless this crime was.

'While the trophies mean an enormous amount to the team, their intrinsic value is low – and the extent of the damage that was caused to the factory by the offenders during the break-in was significant.

'Hopefully we can get the trophies back to our factory where they belong and get replicas made of those that we can't. Thanks to everyone involved for their help so far.'
