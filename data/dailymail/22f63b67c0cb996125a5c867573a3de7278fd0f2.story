Two new witnesses could provide clues to the brutal bashing of Australian school teacher Robert Scott on a Californian street.

The Fresno Police Department's murder-robbery unit was expected on Friday to hand evidence to prosecutors from a second investigation into the one-punch incident that left 26-year-old Mr Scott with a fractured skull, brain damage and in a coma for almost two months.

Scott's family hired a lawyer, Benjamin Tryk, who conducted his own investigation this week after Fresno District Attorney's opted not to charge the man, Gilbert Romero, who knocked the Australian to the asphalt.

Mr Tryk passed the names of the new witnesses he found to police.

'We will wait on re-submitting the case until we contact these two individuals,' Lieutenant Mark Salazar told AAP.

Lt Salazar and Mr Tryk did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.

'We are confident that with all additional information provided to investigators in addition to evidence uncovered by Fresno PD in their ongoing investigation will lead to justice for the Scott Family and Robert,' Mr Tryk said.

Mr Scott, a physical education teacher, champion rower and surf lifesaver from the mid-north NSW seaside town of Pacific Palms, was visiting a college friend in Fresno, 320km north of Los Angeles, on August 17.

Mr Scott had been drinking from 11am, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.24, and was was walking along a residential street at 9pm with another friend, Norwegian tourist Helena Sordal when Mr Romero confronted him.

Police said Mr Romero, who is an associate of Fresno's Bulldog gang, claimed Mr Scott yelled and swore at Mr Romero's girlfriend and their one-year-old son who were sitting in a parked car.

Ms Sordal gave a different version, describing how Mr Scott only offered to help the woman and her child and when confronted by Mr Romero, had his hands down, backed away and said, 'I don't want any trouble'.

At least one of the new witnesses spoke to Mr Scott before he fell into a coma and Mr Scott described how he had been hit without provocation, Mr Tryk said.

Mr Romero was arrested on August 26 for felony battery but released from custody after the district attorney did not file the charges citing potential self-defence and Scott's intoxication.

Mr Scott was flown back to Sydney on a Lear jet last week and remains in a coma in Royal North Shore Hospital.

The flight added to the already extremely high medical bills he accumulated in intensive care at Fresno's Saint Agnes Medical Centre, despite having travel insurance

But the insurance company might not pay the bills because he was drunk when he was hit.

In a positive sign, he has begun to breathe on his own but his cognition has not improved since he left Fresno.

Mr Scott's US hospitalisation and the flight back to Australia has cost more than $US1 million but his family hope his travel insurance will cover the bill.

Dee Why Surf Life Saving Club, where his father Stephen Scott is a member, will hold a 'Rally for Robbo' event on October 24 to help raise funds.
