Samantha Cameron has arrived in Birmingham in time to hear the Prime Minister rehearse his speech before he stands up in front of the Tory conference tomorrow.

The Conservative leader's wife beamed as she made her way inside the Hyatt Hotel in Birmingham, before posing up for photographs with her husband.

David Cameron is due to give his keynote speech to the conference tomorrow, and was pictured earlier today preparing his notes.

No doubt Mrs Cameron was due to be treated to an early rendition of Mr Cameron's speech, in which he is expected to set out his personal plan for Britain.

Mrs Cameron, who is an ambassador to the British Fashion Council and a consultant for luxury firm Smythson, had ditched the tight cord trousers she wore earlier in the conference for a knee-length black skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels.

The warm September sunshine enabled her to go bare-legged and without a coat, although she held a black scarf in her hand as she made her way into the hotel.

Mr Cameron said that, unlike Labour leader Ed Miliband, he would be using a script while making his speech, and was pictured jotting down ideas in his hotel room prior to his wife's arrival.

Last week Mr Miliband was ridiculed after forgetting to mention the deficit during his 69-minute address, claiming he did not want to read a script because he wanted to do politics differently.

However, Mr Cameron said a script would help him to 'lay out my plan for Britain'.

He told the BBC: 'I've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and I think people have a clear idea. I don't see a contradiction: if people are worried, is this country going to deliver for me? Is there a good job for my child?

'Is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment? Are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because Britain means something in the world?

'I think all those things are connected and I think a modern compassionate Conservative can appeal to all of those and it actually all first together.'

Announcement: Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England

Today Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England.

Doctors' leaders warned that there would need to be significant additional funds and staffing to implement the pledge, announced by the Prime Minister at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.

But Mr Cameron insisted that 8am-8pm opening, weekdays and weekends, was already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries.

He announced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million are covered in 2015, and a further £400 million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election.

The Prime Minister took part in a number of television and radio interviews today, in which he hailed Boris Johnson as a 'star player' and revealed he has still not apologised to the Queen for revealing she 'purred' down the phone when Scotland voted against independence.

Mr Cameron has been hoping to use a round of media appearances to get a grip on the coverage of his party conference in Birmingham.

It follows the shock defections of two MPs to UKIP, growing rows over Europe and the resignation of charities minister Brooks Newmark who sent an explicit picture of himself to an undercover journalist. 

Appearing on BBC2's Newsnight last night, Mr Cameron was asked a series of questions to shed light on his own character.

Four decades since metres and litres replaced yards and pints on the curriculum, the Prime Minister suggested he would prefer to see a return to the old system.

'I think I'd still go for pounds and ounces, yes I do,' Mr Cameron told BBC2's Newsnight when asked which should be taught predominantly.
