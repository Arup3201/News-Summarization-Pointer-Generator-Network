Some who possess them can't stand them, and now that freckles are back in vogue, many who don't have them are drawing them on instead.

After a fair smattering of freckles appeared on the faces of models at this year's spring runways, they officially became a trend; popular for lending a natural, youthful, sun-kissed look to the skin.

Two weeks ago, singer Demi Lovato posted a make-up free selfie to Instagram captioned 'Freckles,' and this month, Topshop will launch the DIY Freckle Pencil, so that anyone can dot them on.

Freckles, much like bushy eyebrows - thanks to Cara Delevingne - and cheek dimples - we're looking at you Kate Middleton - have a habit of going in and out of style; swinging between dorkish and highly desirable.

DIY freckle pencils have been around for some time, from brands including Lancôme and Chanel, and Topshop's latest offering - which goes on sale this month for $13 - boasts a 3D 'marbleized formula' to better mimic natural freckles.

Celebrity make-up artist Kate Best, who has worked with stars including Lucy Liu, Lindsay Lohan, Vanessa Williams and Rebecca Romijn, shared her tips for achieving the look at home with MailOnline.

'Whatever you do, don't forget about 
your 'freckles' and rub your face, or your look will swiftly go from 
on-trend to needs-a-bath'

'Using a soft eyebrow pencil a few shades lighter than your brows, apply the dots to either side of the nose, and across the bridge, going no further than the apples of the cheeks,' she suggests, adding that the tip of the pencil should be dull, so as to achieve imprecise dots which look more realistic.

'Lightly press the dots with the tip of your finger to smudge them ever-so-slightly,' she says. 'Then apply a dust of powder to set your work, topped with a touch of blush.

'Remember; less is more, keep the lips natural so they don't fight for attention, and whatever you do, don't forget about your 'freckles' and rub your face, or your look will swiftly go from on-trend to needs-a-bath.'

Natural freckles are in fact small dots of melanin, the pigment that causes our skin to darken in the sun.

They are entirely natural, genetically pre-destined, and not harmful, unless confused with potentially cancerous melanomas, which sometimes look similar.

Most commonly occurring on the face, freckles rarely appear on infants and usually start to develop in childhood or pre-pubescence, often fading as we grow older - thus the reason they evoke youth. They are more visible on fairer skin, and are noticeably enhanced by sunlight exposure.

Lindsay Lohan is well-known for her freckle-covered face and body, although they seem to have diminished considerably over time. Earlier this month, RadarOnline reported that she is actually planning to have them removed.

A source said: 'She’s always loved her freckles – well, pretended to, anyway – but now she’s decided it’s time to get rid of them and she’s looking into having them either bleached or lasered away.'

There are a handful of freckle-speckled stars, on the other hand, who are more embracing of their natural skin.

Embracing their skin: Lucy Liu (left) says she thinks her freckles give her 'a personality,' while Olivia Munn (right) dislikes it when make-up artists try to cover hers up

Actress Olivia Munn said to People last year: 'I've had them since I can remember... It's just my skin. I don't like it when people try to cover them up.'

And Charlie's Angels star Lucy Liu once said to The New York Times: 'Freckles give you a personality without you ever having to say a word. People automatically think you're fun and have a very open nature, which is a great way to be perceived.'

But whether or not you are naturally gifted with these little flecks of melanin, you can always try them on for size, at least for one summer.
