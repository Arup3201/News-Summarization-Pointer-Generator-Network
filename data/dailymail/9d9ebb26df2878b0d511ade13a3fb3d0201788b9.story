The husband of a young mother who was last seen on December 30 has been charged with her murder, police confirmed on Tuesday.

Kyle J. Crosby, 28, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, was being held on one count of murder over the death of his wife, 26-year-old Erica Crippen. 

The young mother's body has not been found and investigators continue to search for her whereabouts after the suspect reported her missing on January 7.

Crosby was captured by police on Monday during a traffic stop, while he was driving his wife's car, from which he attempted to flee on foot. 

Kyle J. Crosby, 28, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, is being held on one count of murder over the alleged death of his wife, 26-year-old Erica Crippen. Her body has not been found 

According to 6abc, Crosby had been missing since last Wednesday doing drugs with a prostitute. 

According to a release from the Mount Laurel Police Department, in the trunk of the vehicle, investigators found several items they believe 'have evidential value in connection to her disappearance'.

Police gave no further details to the items in the trunk of the car. According to nj.com, Crosby was driving his wife's car which had also been reported missing by her family members.  

Crosby was being held in the Burlington County Jail on $1.2million bail. 

He appeared in court on Tuesday afternoon and was charged with murder and two counts of child endangerment.

The couple lived together in New Jersey with their two children - Crosby's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship and their three-month-old baby girl. 

Police officers were sent to the family's home on January 7 for a wellness check after the eldest girl did not attend school that week. 

The father signed a missing person's report for his wife that day and claimed that he had not seen his wife since New Year's Day.

The couple were last seen together at PJ Whelihan's restaurant in Cherry Hill on December 30, according to NJ.com. 

The 26-year-old gave birth to her daughter (pictured) three months ago. The new mom has been missing for almost two weeks

Further investigation led to a charge against Crosby filed on January 10 for Endangering the Welfare of a Child.

The charge allowed officers to stop and detain the 28-year-old suspect on Monday. 

According to reports, the alleged murderer has previous convictions for drug and robbery offenses. 

Ms Crippen's cousin, Barbara Kellam, told CBS that she had not heard from her cousin since December 30 and that when family members went to check on her at home, they found broken glass and no shower curtain or rod in the bathroom. 

On a Facebook page titled, Team Bring Erica Back Home, loved ones have shared messages about the 26-year-old's disappearance and noted that her car also had been missing.

A message from January 9 read: 'I seriously can't fathom all that is going on right now and even the strong possibility that Erica may not return to us with breath in her body!!! My heart hurts and my mind is boggled.. I personally want to thank all of you who have reached out in love and support to help us through this...'
