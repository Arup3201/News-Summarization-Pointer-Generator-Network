English Heritage buildings are normally well known for their grandeur or historic importance - but one house has gained notoriety because it resembles TV comic Alan Carr.

The 'Whitefriars Gatehouse', in Coventry, was recently being used as a  toy museum but closed in 2008 after the owner died and is now being sold by the city council.

The Grade-II listed property, which dates back to the middle-ages and was once the gatehouse to a monastery, was ruined by a fire in 2009, but has since been renovated and was put up for sale  in 2010.

This historic house in Coventry may date back to the middle-ages, but it has gained new fame - as a dead ringer for Chatty Man comedian Alan Carr

Despite its historical roots, it is best-know these days for its resemblance to Chatty Man host Carr, with the window frames resembling his glasses, and the black and white beam over the arch mimicking his toothy grin.

The lookalike was first spotted by local resident Karl Abbott, 31, a computer engineer. He said: 'I was just passing it and out the corner of my eye I saw this building that looked familiar.

'I pulled over got out out the car and I thought - "that looks just Alan Carr". 'I took a picture and emailed it to my friends and work colleagues and everyone thought the same. 

'He’s from not too far away from here in Northampton - I wonder if he’d be interested in buying it.'

Another resident Jack Tailor, 53, added: 'It really has that big jolly and goofy look about it. I’ve heard of the houses that look Hitler but I’ve never seen one like Alan Carr before.

'Some say it looks more like Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd - but I think it’s a dead ringer for the chatty man.'

The property has also been likened to Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd. Residents say the windows look like Carr's glasses, while the black and white beam over the arch resembles his toothy grin

The property was added to the English Heritage’s 'At Risk Register' earlier this month, which identifies vulnerable historic properties.

The original gatehouse began as an entrance to Whitefriars monastery in the early 15th century when the new town wall blocked the original access.

It was modified into a house in the middle of the 16th century after the monastery was dissolved and converted into a private house.

Politician John Hales purchased the Whitefriars for £83 after it was dissolved and confiscated by Henry VIII.

It is likely that he converted the stone screen into a gatehouse by erecting another sandstone wall at the rear and roofing over.

Later additions were built in the 18th and 19th centuries and the wing that was almost totally destroyed by fire in June 2009 dates from this period. 

This house in Swansea became notorious three years ago after one resident noticed its similarity to German ruler Adolf Hitler
