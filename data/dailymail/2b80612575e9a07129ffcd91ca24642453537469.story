It is a language that only the youngest generation can speak fluently.

But now parents are being urged to learn the online slang that could be an indicator that their child is at risk.

Research shows that mothers and fathers are clueless about how their children talk on the internet.

Clueless: Parents are being urged to learn the netspeak that children use online

Only eight per cent of parents knew 
that LMIRL means 'lets meet in real life', a phrase used by predators to
encourage strangers to meet up with them.

While on average, only one in three
parents of 10-18 year olds were able to accurately identify definitions
of six popular netspeak terms including LMIRL, ‘frape’, YOLO, ASL, POS 
and trolling.

The study by knowthenet.org.uk 
highlights a clear knowledge gap amongst parents, since a massive 81 per
cent of teenagers admit to regularly using net lingo.

It also showed that out of the two parents mothers are generally more clued up than fathers.

An average of 32 per cent are able to select the correct definitions compared with 29 per cent of fathers.

Phil Kingsland, Site Director for knowthenet.org.uk commented on the study: 'Parents may find it frustrating that web language moves so fast, but they need to have some understanding of what’s going on so that they can engage with and support their kids through some of the greyer aspects of our cyber lives today.'

Parents can be kept in the dark about their children's plans to meet up with people they met online

Trolling was the term that most parents (58 per cent) were able to identify;

Other terms that parents were quizzed on included YOLO - 'you only live once' - 23 per cent and POS - 'parents over shoulder' - 28 per cent.

Knowthenet.org.uk has launched a new test for parents to assess their 
own understanding of popular internet terms. You can take the test here.
