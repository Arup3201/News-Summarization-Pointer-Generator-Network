Shelly Sterling has branded the NBA sexist for saying she will lose her share of the Los Angeles Clippers if her husband, disgraced owner Donald Sterling, does.

The league issued a statement on Sunday saying her 50 per cent share would be forfeited if team owners 
voted to force her husband - who was recorded making racial slurs two weeks ago - to sell.

'Would an owner's wife say the same thing 
and would the owner be asked to leave the NBA?' she posed in an interview with the Today show on Tuesday. 'Or would they say, "Ah 
she's only the wife"?'

She continued: 'Why am I the victim, when he's the perpetrator? If somebody kills somebody does the wife have to stand trial too?'

Shock: Shelly Sterling watches her husband's latest TV interview beside Savannah Guthrie. She said she became emotional as she watched it because she knew there was something wrong with him

Speaking to Savannah Guthrie, she added that she was shocked when she watched her husband's latest interview with CNN, in which he sparked more controversy by saying Magic Johnson had done nothing to help the African-American community.

He made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status - mistakenly saying he had AIDS - dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model.

'What kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV?' he said.

'Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about? I think he should be ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background. But what does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything.'

Shelly told the Today show that she would stunned by the interview.Â

'Why would he bring Magic Johnson into the
 issue of what's happening now?' she asked. 'That's where I felt pity because he 
couldn't connect the dots.'

She said she believes her estranged husband - whom she intends to divorce - has dementia.

'He's not the man I know - or I knew. There's something wrong,' she said. 'I don't think it happened overnight, I think it's been happening, but no one really knew the reason.'

League commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and fined him $2.5million after recordings of him grumbling racial slurs at his presumed girlfriend V Stiviano were made 
public two weeks ago.

He told CNN on Sunday that he will do 
everything in his power to keep control of the Clippers despite the 
league having already installed an interim CEO to run the team.

Hours after Shelly Sterling said she would fight to keep her ownership of the franchise even if her estranged husband can't, the league said that wouldn't be possible.

'Under the NBA constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a three-quarter vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well,' an NBA spokesman said.

'It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here. These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.'

Shelly's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, responded to the NBA's statement.

'We do not agree with the league's self-serving interpretation of its constitution, its application to Shelly Sterling or its validity under these unique circumstances,' O'Donnell said. 'We live in a nation of laws. California law and the United States Constitution trump any such interpretation.'

Sterling also told ABC News on Sunday that she 'would love him to' consider transferring ownership to her if he is forced to sell.
