Nicolas Sarkozy received up to £42million from Colonel Gaddafi to fund his election as president, it was claimed yesterday.

Evidence made public in Paris is said to prove that the two men had an   illegal financial arrangement that  helped Mr Sarkozy to power in 2007.

A governmental briefing note published by Mediapart, an investigative website, points to numerous visits to Libya by Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues that were aimed at securing funding.

One, which is referred to in the note
 as having taken place on October 6, 2005, led to ‘campaign finance to 
NS (Nicolas Sarkozy)’ being ‘totally solved’.

At
 the time Mr Sarkozy was an ambitious interior minister raising money 
for his presidential election campaign. Taking cash would have broken 
political financing laws.

Mediapart claims that 50million euros referred to in the note was laundered through bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland.

Close: Extraordinary evidence made public in Paris is said to prove that the two former close allies had an illegal financial arrangement which propelled Mr Sarkozy to power in 2007

The Swiss account was opened in the name of the sister of Jean-Francois Cope, the leader of Mr Sarkozy’s ruling UMP party, and the president’s right-hand-man.

The money was then allegedly distributed through an arms dealer called Ziad Takieddine, who acted as a middle man between Arab despots and French politicians.

Gaddafi’s son and former heir, Saif, last year stated unambiguously that Libya had financed Mr Sarkozy. Saif, who was arrested after the fall of his father’s regime, said: ‘Sarkozy must first give back the money he took from Libya to finance his electoral campaign. We funded it.

‘We have all the details and are ready to reveal everything.

‘The first thing we want this clown to do is to give the money back to the Libyan people. He was given the assistance so he could help them, but he has disappointed us. Give us back our money.’ In December 2007, eyebrows were raised when Colonel Gaddafi was honoured with a state visit to Paris.

Revelations: Gaddafi's son Saif-Al Islam said last year that Libya had financed Mr Sarkozy's election but did not say what the figure was

He was referred to as the ‘Brother Leader’ by the French, and allowed to pitch his Bedouin tent next to the Elysee Palace.

The incriminating evidence came in a thorough investigation of Takieddine’s activities. His doctor, Didier Grosskopf, told judges in Paris that he went on many of the trips to Libya and witnessed negotiations about political funding.

The discussions involved Brice Hortefeux, one of Mr Sarkozy’s closest allies, who has confirmed to Mediapart the meetings took place, but would not comment further, beyond denying any wrongdoing.

The incriminating note, which is in the hands of the French police, was leaked to Mediapart along with other documents. These include at least three letters sent from Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues to the Libyan leader in 2005 and details of ‘one-on-one negotiations’ between Mr Sarkozy and Gaddafi.

‘If these allegations are proved then those involved face prison sentences,’ said political analyst Yves Thibier.

‘There are frequent funding scandals involving domestic donors, but a Gaddafi funding scandal is something else.’ The Elysee Palace made no comment.
