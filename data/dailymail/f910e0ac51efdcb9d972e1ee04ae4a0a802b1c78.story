The internet craze for selfies has been branded the ultimate expression of vanity, with David Cameron and Barack Obama among those castigated for posing for self-portraits that were later put online.

But now the selfie has been put to good use – celebrities are posting pictures of themselves to campaign against oil exploration off the coast of Ibiza, the Mediterranean playground for the rich and famous.

Bearing home-made banners with the slogan ‘Ibiza Says No’, stars including Kate Moss, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and DJ Fatboy Slim and his wife Zoe Ball have posted selfies on the internet and signed a petition lobbying the Spanish government not to lease territory to oil giant Cairn Energy.

The petition, which now has 60,000 signatures, will be submitted this week by the Ibiza Preservation Fund, a consortium of businesses and residents.

Singer James Blunt, who lives on Ibiza, model Laura Bailey, make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury and designer Alice Temperley are among others who have also posted selfies to show support.

Although it is best known as a party destination, Ibiza is a Unesco World Heritage Site.

The deep waters around the Balearic island are home to the endangered bluefin tuna, the striped dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale and sperm whales.

‘We were horrified to discover that the Spanish government had quietly passed a law on Christmas Eve granting Cairn Energy rights to prospect for oil just 15 miles off our coast,’ says actress Lisa Bilton, who is helping to lead the campaign through the Twitter hashtag #ibizasaysno.

Sir Mick Jagger’s daughter Jade, who lives on the island, said: ‘We’ve been ignoring the environment for too long and now it’s time to speak out.’

Strictly Come Dancing star Ms Ellis-Bextor, a regular visitor to Ibiza, added: ‘It’s about having a conscience about the world we live in.’

It is the first time in the history  of the island that the Spanish government has leased its territory to an oil company for prospecting.

Environmentalist Ben Goldsmith, a founder of the Ibiza Preservation Fund, said of the campaign: ‘People complain about Nimbyism, but if they’re not going to do it, then  who is?’
