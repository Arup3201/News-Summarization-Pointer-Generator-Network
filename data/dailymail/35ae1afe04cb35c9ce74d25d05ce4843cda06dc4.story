A mother who had an operation on her womb was horrified after she discovered a surgical glove had been left inside her.

Sharon Birks, 42, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, had felt unwell after having a hysterectomy and was stunned to discover the medical glove inside her when she went to the loo.

The mother-of-six had the operation at the Royal Derby Hospital and suffered for three days before she discovered the error.

Mrs Birks said: 'It was horrible - when I went to the toilet, I just remember having this feeling something had dropped in my stomach.

'Then I felt something rubbery and, the next thing I know, I’m pulling out this great big surgeon’s glove - and there’s this blood gushing everywhere.

'I just felt sick and giddy and I went straight to the nurse - they gave me a full internal examination and people came down to talk to me about it.

'But I think people should know about this because I would hate to think what would have happened if I’d have gone home before this was discovered.'

She said she had felt unwell after the five-hour operation so had been given a bladder scan to check for problems.

Doctors had even prescribed her antibiotics, thinking she had an infection - totally unaware the pain was being caused by the latex glove inside her.

Mrs Birks said: 'I just had this really bad stomach ache and it almost felt like something was wedged in my stomach.

'At first, I just thought it was perhaps something to do with my catheter. By Thursday, I wasn’t ready to go home and now I’m so glad I didn’t.'

She added: 'This should never have happened - I was actually told just how careful I needed to be following the operation.

'I just keep wondering what would have happened if the glove had stayed inside me and what damage it could have caused.'

The hospital has now launched an investigation into the matter and have apologised to her.

Sue James, Derby’s hospitals trust chief executive, said: 'We are extremely sorry for the distress that was caused to Mrs Birks. Clearly this should not have happened and we have launched a detailed investigation.

'A consultant and a senior nurse saw Mrs Birks and her husband while they were still at the hospital to apologise in person and to inform them a full investigation would take place.

'I have also written to Mrs Birks to offer her sincere apologies for the distress and anxiety that such an unpleasant experience must have caused.

'A full investigation is now underway and, when it has been completed, we will be sharing our findings with Mrs Birks.

'We take patient safety extremely seriously and, at the conclusion of this investigation, we will want to ensure lessons are learnt.'
