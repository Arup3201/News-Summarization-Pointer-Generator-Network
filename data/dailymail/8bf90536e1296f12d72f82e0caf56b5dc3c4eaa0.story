Prince Charles’s private office came out fighting yesterday after a controversial biography claimed he is riven by insecurities and undermined by his aides’ feuds.

Officials reacted angrily to the heir’s portrayal as a man ‘driven by guilt’ who flies into fits of ‘royal rage’ but cannot control his courtiers’ internal squabbles.

Clarence House insisted the book by Catherine Mayer – called Charles: The Heart of a King – was in no way authorised by the palace.

Attempting to refocus attention on the Prince’s extensive charity work, aides last night described him as a man who ‘cares deeply’ about his country and has frequently been ‘ahead of his time’.

Charles is at the heart of a massive international charity empire that in recent years has helped raise more than £100million a year for his good causes – which range from rescuing historic buildings to helping young people get a start in life.

A Clarence House spokesman said Charles had devoted most of his working life to ‘helping individual and organisations make a difference for the better – and not for personal gain’.

She added: ‘He takes an active interest in the issues and challenges facing the UK and around the world through his own work and that of his charities.

‘Over the past 40 years in his role as heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales has visited countless places and met numerous people from every walk of life. He carries out over 600 engagements a year.

‘This gives him a unique perspective which has often led to him identifying issues before others which might otherwise be overlooked.

‘He is often described as being ahead of his time and the evidence for this has been well documented – and includes leading the work on corporate social responsibility from as early as the 1980s, demonstrating the benefits of organic farming, as well as finding ways to help young people who are not in employment, education or training through his Prince’s Trust.’

Journalist Miss Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, claims in her biography that she was given ‘remarkable access’ to the Prince and achieved ‘exclusive interviews’ with his inner circle.

She was afforded a rare interview with Charles for an article published in 2013 and attended a private dinner at Dumfries House – the Ayrshire stately home Charles helped save for the nation – where she was given a tour of the estate by the heir.

It is also clear she was given access to a number of Charles’s friends, including actress Emma Thompson, and senior aides past and present. Some very close to him – such as former foreign advisor Clive Alderton and long-serving private secretary Elizabeth Buchanan – allowed their comments to be reported on the record, which would never have happened without Royal approval.

But Clarence House stressed the biography was not an ‘official’ one and Miss Mayer had no ‘exclusive’ access. The Prince’s spokesman said: ‘Catherine Mayer was only given access to the Prince of Wales briefly for the writing of a Time magazine feature over a year ago.

‘She is often allowed to attend events, as part of the rota like any other member of the media.’ The book, extracts of which are being serialised in The Times, says Charles feels compelled to get involved in national affairs because of the ‘guilty’ privilege of his birth.

It also describes him as the ‘Prince of Wails’ with a short fuse and compares his household to Wolf Hall – a reference to the treacherous world of Henry VIII’s court as evoked in Hilary Mantel’s novel.

The Prince’s spokesman added: ‘Clarence House employs over 100 hardworking professionals, many of whom have been there for decades and whose work and dedication is appreciated by Their Royal Highnesses.’

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are planning to hire a live-in maternity nurse to help them care for their second child, it was claimed yesterday.

The couple already have a nanny for 18-month-old Prince George but are thought to be looking for an extra set of hands to help with their second child, who is due in April, including looking after night feeds.

Royal aides have apparently been in contact with the Norland Agency and Royal Nannies in London to find a suitable candidate to work for at least the first three months. It is thought the Duchess is hoping for a swift return to her charity work after giving birth.

In a break from royal tradition, the couple did not hire a maternity nurse for George. Instead, Kate, 33, spent almost a month at her parents’ Berkshire home.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Kate and William loved the early weeks with Prince George but it was hard work and the sleepless nights took their toll. Kate especially was exhausted.’

Last night a spokesman for William and Kate declined to comment.
