A farmer is turning one of his fields into a stone age-style burial chamber where families can pay £1,000 to bury their relatives' ashes.

Wiltshire landowner Tim Daw, 52, is laying down huge sarsen stones, similar to those at nearby Stonehenge, to form the base of a burial mound which will eventually hold the remains of 2,400 people.

The diggers moved in to his field at All Cannings, near Marlborough, after he won planning permission to build a 50m-long mound, the first such chamber to be built in Britain for 5,000 years.

Mr Daw says that that 50-metre long mound at All Cannings should be completed within six months

Mr Daw says it will take him six months to complete the mound, which will contain seven large chambers, each with several shelves containing lockable alcoves, or niches, that can be secured for a family.

He plans to charge around £1,000 for a family niche with space for the ashes of up to eight people.

The farmer, an atheist who works as a steward at Stonehenge, said: 'We've already had five people sign up, and that's without really pushing it at all.

'It's being made of sarsen stones weighing up to one tonne each and is quite a simple construction.  We will have to keep the inside secure as other people's remains will be in there too, but the idea is that it will be a place for families to come.

'They'll be able to sit and contemplate on the mound'.

Mr Daw said the burial chamber will be non-religious, but it is already attracting interest from pagans because of its alignment, designed to allow the sunrise of the winter solstice to shine through the entrance and down its passageway.

Mr Daw, seen here sitting on what will be the entrance, says he has had a good deal of interest already

The burial mound lies in the Marlborough Downs, near Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles, and its design is based on the nearby long barrow at West Kennet, near Silbury Hill, the largest man-made mound in Europe.

The 220-acre farm lies in the middle of Wiltshire's 'crop circle country', where mysterious patterns appear in fields of crops overnight.

Theories as to how they occur range from UFO landings to over-zealous cider-drinking, but they draw large crowds each summer.

Wiltshire is strewn with Neolithic burial mounds, or barrows, dating back to the new stone age period, beginning about 10,200BC and ending between 4,500-2,000BC.

They were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud, soil and grass.

West Kennet Long Barrow, six miles from Mr Daw's barrow at All Cannings, is one of the largest, measuring 100m long.  Excavations suggest work began on the tomb, which has five sarsen stone chambers, in 3,600BC, some 400 years before Stonehenge was begun.

East Kennet Long Barrow is the largest in Britain, a wedge-shaped burial chamber measuring 106m long.  It is believed to have been open for several centuries before being sealed up.

Lanhill Long Barrow, near Chippenham, is a late Neolithic long barrow which was found to contain the remains of several people from the same family, ranging in age from 12 months to 60 years.

Beckhampton Long Barrow, near Avebury, is one of the oldest known barrows in the country, dating back to around 3,200BC.  Its two ends have been ploughed away and destroyed, but the remains of one of the Beaker folk, migrants into Britain in 2,500BC who were notable for the beaker shape of their pottery, have been found in the barrow.

Silbury Hill, a vast chalk mound 16 miles from Stonehenge, is not strictly a barrow but is a man-made mound from the same, Neolithic period and can be seen from many of the barrows that post-date it.  Despite various attempts to excavate it over the years, and despite a common assumption over the years that it must be a burial mound, its purpose is still a mystery.
