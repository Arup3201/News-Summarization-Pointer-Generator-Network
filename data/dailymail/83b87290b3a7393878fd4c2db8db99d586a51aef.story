The NHS is paralysed by a Mafia-style code of silence that stops whistleblowers highlighting poor care, MPs were told last night.

Even senior surgeons fear drawing attention to dangers to patients in case it should damage their career.

David Prior, the chairman of the Care Quality Commission watchdog, said there was a ‘chilling’ culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks.

Medics who wish to expose failing hospitals have to be ‘very, very brave’, he told a Commons committee. He said senior doctors’ career prospects had been ruined after they dared to speak out.

There have been a series of scandals involving whistleblowers whose concerns were covered up by an NHS keen to sweep poor care under the carpet.

Campaigner Julie Bailey was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where up to 1,200 died needlessly from neglect in appalling conditions.

Hundreds of former NHS staff are under gagging orders to ensure they did not speak out about poor care.

Highlighting the need to break down the NHS’s ‘tribal’ culture of banning criticism, Mr Prior told the Commons health select committee: ‘I have spoken to a couple of surgeons whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on at their hospitals.’

He said he had found it ‘chilling’ to 
hear a senior clinician ask why doctors did not raise concerns about 
unusually high mortality rates and poor care of patients at the 
Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust.

‘For years, this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet,’ he said. ‘Why is that? One part of the answer is that they are frightened.

‘Even if you are an alpha-male surgeon, you are frightened. We might feel that’s not good enough, but that is the situation.’

Committee member David Tredinnick said NHS trusts operated under ‘omerta’ – the Mafia’s code of silence, adding: ‘It is about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anyone steps out of line they are finished.

‘It is a kind of Mafia code, an omerta, where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished. That is something that surely needs to be broken.’

Joyce Robbins, of the pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘If you are an innocent patient you will be scared by this.

‘It is horrific to think that doctors know of problems but cannot speak out. We only hear about it when there is a big case like Mid Staffs, but now it seems it is more widespread.’

Dozens of doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out.

One of them was Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, who was given £500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients.

He received the hush money to prevent him going public with his fears that the ‘target culture’ at the trust could cost lives.

As many as 500 patients may have died needlessly because of poor care – but his concerns were ignored, and he said he was ‘thrown to the wolves’ for speaking out.

The new leadership of the Care Quality Commission want to make it easier for doctors and nurses to trigger inspections of their hospitals by coming to them with concerns about patient safety.

Mr Prior and chief executive David Behan were appointed within the past year to lead a shake-up of the CQC after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals including Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay, where babies died needlessly in maternity units.

They told MPs they were bringing in a new
 regime of specialist inspections of hospitals, care homes and 
surgeries, which will eventually see ratings published not only for each
 service but also for individual departments within hospitals.

Mr Prior said: ‘How we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage in confidence is incredibly important.

‘We need to get a continuous flow of information from staff and residents and patients and carers. That’s our best source of information.

‘What we have got to do is to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospitals have got proper whistleblowing, concern-raising, procedures within the hospital and that there is real clinical engagement.

‘And we have got to be a safety net and be available to these people at a much earlier stage so they can ring us up, get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection.’

Mr Prior acknowledged that the CQC’s new inspection regime was ‘a work in progress’, but said the first 18 inspections would be completed by Christmas, with reports published by February.

He and Mr Behan were challenged over their decision to clear head of media Anna Jefferson of wrongdoing over a report into the watchdog’s handling of complaints about maternity unit deaths at Morecambe Bay.

An independent report suggested Miss Jefferson was involved in preventing the publication of the results of an internal inquiry because of fears it would damage the watchdog’s reputation.

But Mr Prior insisted the report had not come to the conclusion that any individual was guilty.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘Labour supports protection for whistleblowers in the NHS. But this Government needs to do more to support frontline NHS staff.’
