A California high school water polo player was found at the bottom of the pool during a match when the boy suffered an epileptic seizure, authorities say.

Alejandro Camacho, 16, was airlifted from Don Antonio Lugo High School in Chino Thursday night after he suddenly sank to the bottom of the pool while suffering a seizure during the a playoff game, ABC 7 reports. 

'The other team had scored so we were lining up to keep going … when everybody noticed we were still down a player,' Marco Garcia, the coach for Nogales High School boys water polo team, told KTLA.

ABC 7 reports that Camacho was at the bottom of the pool for about 20 seconds before his father and several spectators jumped into the pool and pulled him out.

'I dove in. Me and another player got him,' Jose Mirande, another Nogales High School water polo player, told CBS Los Angeles.  'And his dad jumped in, fully clothed, just jumped in and helped us up, helped him up, get his head out of the water.'

Critical: Camacho was airlifted to the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, in Colton, where he was listed in critical condition

Once Camacho was out of the pool, spectators administered CPR to get the water out of his lungs. Camacho was then airlifted to the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, in Colton, where he was listed in critical condition, CBS LA reports. 

Garcia told KTLA that this has happened before at one of the team's practices so 'we knew we had to just let the seizure play out.' 

Play Out: Marco Garica, Nogales High School boys water polo coach, said this has happened before and he knew he had to 'let the seizure play out' while everyone waited for help to arrive

Did We Win? Garcia said that Camacho called him from the hospital asking, 'did we win?' The team lost by a score of 17-12

However, Scott Atkinson, battalion chief with the Chino Valley Fire District, told KTLA that the 16-year-old was breathing on his own and is expected to make a full recovery.
