The sky was blue and sunny but a grey and doleful air gripped the paddock even as Lewis Hamilton was tearing to pole position for Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix.

His reward should he win would be a handshake with Vladimir Putin if, as is rumoured, the president of the Russian Federation presents the victor’s trophy in this glittering steel and tarmac symbol of his own virility.

But it is not the dubious politics of shadowy former Soviet states that accounted for the melancholic mood here on Saturday. That was summed up by the legend across the track: ‘Jules we are all supporting you’.

It was a reference to Jules Bianchi, the 25-year-old Marussia driver who remains on life support in a Japanese hospital after his terrible accident in Suzuka a week ago today. His condition 5,000 miles away shook the usual narrow focus of the 21 other members of the F1 drivers’ fraternity, men whose craft demands total self-absorption.

‘It’s something I’m trying my hardest not to think too much about,’ said Hamilton of Bianchi’s predicament, after beating Rosberg into second place in qualifying. ‘We all know it’s tough for everyone here. Getting into the car this weekend has been the weirdest and one of the most difficult in my racing career. But we need to keep the pedal down and keep going. I hope we have a strong, positive race and that everyone is safe.’

They were honest words from a driver who has never recoiled from danger at the wheel.

The demeanour of the three fastest qualifiers — Hamilton, Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas — was a little quieter than normal. There was no fist-pumping celebration or hollering down the radio. These were genuine manifestations of a deep but almost suppressed anxiety. 

Hamilton, driving as though unfazed, has been the master of the new Sochi Autodrom — 3.6 miles with 19 bends — since he first drove on it during practice on Friday. His margin of two-tenths of a second over Rosberg was emphatic enough, though Williams’s Bottas may have prised pole for himself but for veering wide as he strained at the final couple of corners.

It was Hamilton’s seventh pole of the season and maintained the momentum that has carried him to three consecutive victories. Jenson Button drove impressively to fourth, his best qualifying performance since the British Grand Prix in July. 

Toro Rosso’s Russian Daniil Kvyat was fifth, somehow saving the best qualifying performance of his life for his home audience. However, the main grandstand was half-empty, though other parts of the stadium looked pretty full.

The other home representation in the race comes in the form of Bianchi’s Marussia team. They are based in Banbury, Oxfordshire but are owned by Andrey Cheglakov, a businessman just short of oligarch status. Out of respect to Bianchi, his team ran just one car, driven by Brit Max Chilton. Alas, he finished last.

But through the pall, he said: ‘It has been a difficult weekend for us all, so all in all we’ve done well. With the whole team around me we can try to do the best we can for Jules.’

Victory for Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by 10 points with three rounds remaining after Sunday, would take him closer to a second world title and provide the highlight of a wonderful weekend here for British drivers. For as Hamilton did his debriefs, Jolyon Palmer, son of ex-Formula One driver Dr Jonathan Palmer, was celebrating winning the GP2 race and series.

He became the first British winner of F1’s feeder series since Hamilton in 2006. Aged 23, he is looking for a race in the top echelon but, heavens, it will be hard because the lesser teams are looking for drivers to pay them huge sums to land a race seat.

Palmer Snr was in tears as he looked up at the podium with God Save the Queen ringing out. ‘We know it will be hard to get into Formula One but Jolyon has done a fantastic job this season,’ he said. ‘We are speaking to a few people but are realistic. We are keeping our fingers crossed.’

Earlier, another Brit, with an astonishing story of courage, won the GP3 race. Dean Stoneman, who has recently recovered from cancer, lost his drive with Marussia GP3 team when they decided not to race in Sochi for ‘commercial reasons’. He hitched a race with Finnish team Koiranen — and won.

Sebastian Vettel had a very disappointing day and finished 11th in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix

Before the inaugural Russian Grand Prix starts, all eyes will be on Putin and his guards. He loves projecting his all-action image. Here at the Winter Olympics in February he was at every major event from the opening and closing ceremonies to the ice hockey and even to the bedside of stricken skier Maria Komissarova, where she woke up to find him wearing a white coat.

But there is a catch now. Given the sanctions imposed by the West after the crisis in Ukraine, the seizure of Crimea and the downing of a Malaysian airliner near Donetsk, Putin and his cronies are less keen to be seen enjoying themselves.

A sense of ill-will towards him was displayed at the Euro 2016 match in Minsk between Belarus and Ukraine this week. Fans of both sides sang an insulting song about Putin. Eight were jailed, others convicted and fined. Will such elements find their way into the stands here?

A tight security operation — armed guards, Cossack warriors, scanning machines — says they won’t.
