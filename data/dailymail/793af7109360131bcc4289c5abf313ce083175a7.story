Tory Immigration Minister Mark Harper has denied claims by anti-racism campaigner Doreen Lawrence that controversial immigration spot checks were linked to people’s colour.

Mr Harper sought to defuse a growing storm over the checks by also insisting they were not ‘random’ but based on ‘specific intelligence’.

He also revealed that so far 17 people had been arrested on suspicion at two London Underground stations but was unable to say how many in total had been stopped.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission is now investigating the checks for possible discrimination.

Last week, Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence and who is now a Labour peer in recognition of her fight against racism, said she thought ‘racial profiling’ was involved in the checks.

But Mr Harper insisted: ‘We weren’t 
stopping people based on their race or their ethnicity. We were only 
stopping people and questioning them where we had a reasonable suspicion
that they were an immigration offender.’

He also said no ethnic details about people questioned were recorded, with officers noting only people’s nationality, name and date of birth.

Mr Harper told BBC radio: ‘We are not carrying out random checks of people in the street and asking people to show their papers. That’s absolutely not what we are doing.’

Denying any racial profiling, Mr Harper said: ‘It’s about how they behave, not what they look like. It’s not about their appearance or their race or their ethnicity.’

Data on the numbers stopped for questioning will be released ‘in due course’, said Mr Harper.

Labour spokesman Chris Bryant has demanded the release of statistics on the number and ethnic background of people stopped and accused Ministers of whipping up a ‘moral panic’ over immigration for electoral purposes.

He said: ‘If it feels as if what is basically happening is that they are going to some parts of the country and stopping every person with a black face, then that is totally unacceptable.

‘What we really need from Home Secretary Theresa May is precise numbers of where these stops and searches were being done, what the percentage was of people who were arrested. I think this is a matter of urgency now.’
