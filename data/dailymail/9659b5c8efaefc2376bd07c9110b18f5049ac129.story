An area around the port of the French city of Marseille was evacuated after a German bomb dating back to the Second World War was discovered.

Experts removed the explosive in a delicate operation to transfer it to a military base, where it was to be safely detonated.

About 1,000 people were asked to leave an area around the port today as officials began the task of moving the device.

Boat traffic was also halted and access to several coastal roads was blocked to ensure safe and clear passage for the bomb disposal experts as they moved it to a military base to be detonated.

The explosive was discovered in the city about a week ago, when construction workers accidentally pierced the bomb with their equipment.

The bomb's ignition system no longer works but the sheer amount of explosives - 1,400 pounds - made it dangerous, according to the regional government.

It had apparently been buried by German soldiers, who had planned to destroy the city's port, as they retreated near the end of the war.
