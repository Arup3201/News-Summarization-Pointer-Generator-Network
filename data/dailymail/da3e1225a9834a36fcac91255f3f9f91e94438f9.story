The convicted killer who was the subject of a popular podcast has been granted an appeal.

Adnan Syed and his role in the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was killed on January 13, 1999, became a topic of discussion among millions of Americans when Serial, a podcast that reexamined evidence in the case in hopes of determining his guilt or innocence, premiered last year.

Now, thanks to the work of the team behind Serial, most notably narrator Sarah Koenig, an appeal has been granted thanks to a woman contacted by producers who said she could provide an alibi for Sayed.

The Maryland Court of Special Appeals after learning of this approved Syed's application for leave to appeal on Friday, which claimed his attorney, Christina Gutierrez, was ineffective

Asia McClain has stated in a sworn deposition to Syed's attorney, C. Justin Brown, that she saw him in the library at the time prosecutors claim Lee was killed.

In the affidavit, published by the last month by The Blaze, McClain stated that she now realized 'her importance to the case' and felt she needed to make her story 'known to the court system.' 

It was revealed on Serial that McClain had let Syed's attorney during the trial know that she could alibi the high school student, but she was never called to testify during either of his trials or even contacted by the woman.

She also wrote Syed in jail letting him now that she saw him in the library that afternoon.

This as prosecutors claimed Ms Lee had been dead by 2.36pm, but Ms McClain said she remembered talking with Syed from 2.20 to 2.40pm.

Gutierrez also failed to let her client know of a possible plea deal with prosecutors during his trials.

Lee was found buried in a shallow grave having been strangled a few weeks after she disappeared, with Syed being identified as the murdered by Jay Wilds, a friend who said he helped Syed dig the grave.

Syed has maintained his innocence in her murder for the past 15 years.

'It's the first step in a pretty long process but we're extremely happy,' Brown told The Baltimore Sun.

Syed now needs to file formal briefings of his appeal arguments by March 16, at which time the court could hear oral arguments and offer or deny Syed a new trial.

His appeal is scheduled to be heard in June 2015. 

Syed, 34, who a jury found guilty of first-degree murder, robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment, is currently serving a life sentence plus 30 years in a state prison in Cumberland.
