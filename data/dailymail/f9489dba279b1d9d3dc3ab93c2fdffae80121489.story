Last Picture: Stephen Rakes looks over his shoulder as he leaves the courthouse after attending the trial

The funeral has been scheduled for the man who was found dead just days after being relieved as a witness from the Whitey Bulger trial.

Police are still investigating the death of Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes, who was found dead on a remote running path on Wednesday.

Rakes openly despised Bulger, the former crime boss who headed Boston's notorious Winter Hill Gang, and was ready to testify that Bulger threatened his daughter at gunpoint to force him to turn over his South Boston liquor store for $100,000 so that he could make it his mob's new headquarters.

After Rakes' body was found by a jogger, police initially ruled it a suicide but now they have revealed that an autopsy has been rulled inconclusive in determining what killed him.

Investigators have ordered toxicology tests, which can take weeks to be processed.

In the meantime, The Boston Herald reports that his friends and relatives will attend his wake on Wednesday and funeral at the Gate of Heaven Church in South Boston on Thursday morning.

His friend Steven Davis told NBC: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket.

'Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now.'

A long time friend of Rakes, Steve Davis, whose sister Debbie was allegedly killed by Bulger, said the first indication of anything amiss with Rakes was on Wednesday afternoon when he was removed from the witness list of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz at the U.S. District Court in South Boston.

The 59-year-old's death came just weeks after Rake, 59, revealed he was no longer scared of the gangster and that he was grateful to be alive to testify.

'They took everything from me,' he said of the mob. 'They don't care about nothing. They don't care about what they take from you... At least I’m still alive. I’m alive and I’m grateful for that.'

Rakes, who had previously refused to testify against Bulger, had told Davis that he was 'nervous' about the 'bombshell' he thought he was going to drop on the stand at the feared mobster's trial.

'He was looking forward to taking the stand. He told me over and over he had a big bombshell to drop,' said Davis.

However,
 he was robbed of this chance on Tuesday when U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz
 informed Rakes that he was no longer needed as a witness - a decision 
that reportedly 'devastated' him.

Rakes
 had harbored decades of anger at Bulger and his accomplices, Stephen 
'The Rifleman' Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, after they allegedly forced him 
to hand over his South Boston liquor store in 1984 by holding a gun to 
his daughter's head.

'The day I see him in a box, not breathing, will be better,' Rakes said in April.

Indeed, Rakes had been a constant presence at Bulger's trial at the US District Court in South Boston.

Attending
 every day for the past six weeks, the trial began after the notorious 
gangster was captured in California two years ago after 16 years on the 
run from authorities.

Bulger's right-hand man, Kevin Weeks 
testified last week Rakes' expected upcoming testimony that Bulger's 
gang put a gun to his daughter's head was 
bogus.

Weeks, who was a close associate of 
Bulger's for two decades, later became a government witness and 
eventually led authorities to the bodies of people who were allegedly 
killed by Bulger and the gang. He served five years in prison after pleading guilty to being an accessory to five murders.

Bulger stared straight ahead during much of Weeks' testimony and only glanced at him occasionally.Weeks also described how Bulger acquired a liquor store in South Boston.

Prosecutors
 say Bulger forced Stephen Rakes to sell his liquor store to him in 1984
 to use as a headquarters for his gang and as a source of ‘legitimate’ 
income.

Weeks denied that 
the gang forced Rakes to sell the store, saying Rakes had agreed with an
 offer from Bulger to buy the store for $100,000

He said when they arrived at Rakes' 
house to close the deal, Rakes said his wife didn't want to sell the 
store and complained about the selling price.

‘He was trying to shake us down,’ Weeks said.

At the time, Rakes' two young daughters were in the room and Bulger was bouncing one of the girls on his lap, Weeks said.

He
said he pulled a gun out of his waistband and put it on the table. The 
girl on Bulger's lap reached for the gun, Weeks said. Bulger then told 
him to put it away.

‘Kevin continues to lie, as usual, because that's what he has to do,’ Rakes said. ‘My liquor store was never for sale - never, never, never.’

Davis 
told ABC News that the last time he saw Rakes was on Tuesday in court 
but he failed to reach him during the night and alarms bells started 
ringing when he didn't meet him for breakfast on Wednesday.

'Stippo would not kill himself. Absolutely not,' said Davis to ABC News on Thursday morning.

Davis said that his friend was 'in good shape' and the two of them would frequently cycle across Boston.

'He had everything to live for and was looking forward to his day in court. It doesn't make sense.'
