One woman whose family was scammed out of $25,000 by a dodgy 'doctor' promising to help stall the onset of her motor neuron disease may finally get her shot at battling the debilitating condition.

Jaime Wild, from Queensland's Gold Coast was diagnosed with the devastating illness on October 1 last year, and straight away her family kicked into action, looking for ways to fight the cruel disease.

After her mother Kate was scammed out of almost $25,000 paid to a dodgy Canadian doctor to visit his clinic in India, Jaime's family needed money to send her to Israel for a procedure which isn't available in Australia.

The mother-of-three, 36, said the MND was initially misdiagnosed as other ailments, but thing started to take a more serious turn when her speech began to slur.

'First I thought I had depression because I was a bit moody and I got upset quite easily,' Jaime told Daily Mail Australia.

'I went on anti-depressants and then my breathing started to play up and we thought it was anxiety, so we just upped the medication a little bit more.

'That’s when the slurring started and they said something’s not right,' she added.

To raise funds for this treatment and Ms Wild's (pictured left and right with her husband Chris), ongoing medical costs, her friends and family threw her a 'Cinderella Ball To Remember' at the weekend

The ball was a great success and between that and boxing fight organised by a kind stranger called Chris more than $26,000 has been raised

When doctors told her she had MND, Jaime said she had not prepared herself for the fact that there was nothing she could do to treat the crippling disease.

'At first I thought okay, all right, so what do we need to do... (The doctor) said there is no treatment and there is no cure.

'That was like your whole world crumbling,' Jaime revealed.

The Gold Coast mother described her debilitating symptoms in great detail, and revealed her dexterity has declined in recent months despite her still being quite mobile.

'My eating is quite hard, it takes a lot of energy for me to chew, I try and go for the softer foods,' Jaime said.

'My breathing is quite severe, I don’t do big long breaths, just short ones.

'My tongue is quiet weak so for me to form words especially when I get tired they don’t come out too well,' she continued.

Motor neuron disease (MND) is the name given to a group of diseases in which the nerve cells (neurons) controlling the muscles that enable us to move, speak, breathe and swallow undergo degeneration and die. Motor function is controlled by the upper motor neurons in the brain that descend to the spinal cord; these neurons activate lower motor neurons. The lower motor neurons exit the spinal cord and directly activate muscles. With no nerves to activate them, muscles gradually weaken and waste. MND can affect a person’s ability to walk, speak, swallow and breathe.

'My right hand is really bad so I can’t undo buttons or press buttons.

'(And) both my legs are pretty bad,' Jaime revealed.

Desperate to help her daughter, mum Kate Millar sprung into action, spending all hours of the day researching potential treatments and clinics.

Stem cell treatment is one of the most common ways to treat motor neuron diseases among sufferers, however is not available in Australia due to inconclusive medical studies.

Kate came across a doctor called Doug Broeska, owner of Regenetek Research, offering clinical trials in stem cell treatment out of a clinic in India.

However since then Mr Broeska's medical qualifications have come under scrutiny by CBC and other news organisations, with some reporting that his medical degree is fake.

'When Jamie was first diagnosed of course I went Googling and searching for anything that I could come up with,' Kate told Daily Mail Australia.

She said the doctor came highly recommended from another patient who had suffered from MS, and Kate and her family were in frequent contact with Mr Broeska before he went underground with their money.

'We transferred the first lot which was $24,000 Australian dollars, two days later that’s when it all came out in the media questioning,' Kate said.

She also revealed that since further revelations against the 'doctor', were aired, the Canadian Police have been involved to try and recover her money.

After the first treatment option fell through, Jaime's family wanted to get moving to get her some more help as soon as they can.

Organised primarily by her brother Geoffrey, 30, who is also her full-time carer Jaime was almost lost for words as she described the evening.

'It was amazing, all of it was just so surreal, I just sat there at the front just taking in every moment of the night,' she said.

Decked out in a stunning white dress and arriving at the venue in a carriage, Jaime described the moment she arrived at the ball to a red carpet awaiting her as 'incredible'.

'When Jamie was first diagnosed, Jamie was in the closet one day crying and I was sitting on her bed and I thought what does every girl want to be, and I thought to be a princess,' Geoffrey revealed.

'So we came up with the idea of the ball.'

The ball was a great success and between that and boxing fight organised by a kind stranger called Chris more than $26,000 has been raised, but to sustain the high level of treatment Jaime needs the family needs more.

'Jamie can’t get any support from the government because her husband and her do own a small business,' Geoffrey said.

'They’ve gone from having three kids and two incomes to one income and still three kids plus Jamie’s medical expenses.'

'We literally take it five minutes at a time, I could come around here in the morning and Jamie;’s having a bad day,' Geoffrey continued.

'Her life is just beginning, her and her husband have always been hard workers

'She’s done everything right she doesn’t smoke, she doesn’t drink

'It is unfair but me as Jamie’s brother I believe that if Jamie was supposed to be taken away from us she would have been.' he added.
