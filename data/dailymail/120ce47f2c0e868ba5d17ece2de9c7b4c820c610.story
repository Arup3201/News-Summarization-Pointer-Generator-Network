A man accused of beheading a Topeka resident with a guitar string has pleaded innocent to premeditated first-degree murder.

Police say 29-year-old James Paul Harris practiced voodoo and kept the head of 49-year-old James Gerety to talk to after the March or April 2011 killing.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Gerety's partial remains were found a year later in Carbondale, 18 miles south of Topeka.

Harris' former girlfriend testified in March that he told her he used a guitar string to sever Gerety's head.

She said he disposed of the body but kept the head in a bag.

A Topeka police officer said the ex-girlfriend told him Harris practiced voodoo and that he liked to talk to the head.

A judge on Monday set Harris' trial for June 23.

Thomas Henderson, an attorney who handled Gerety's Social Security 
payments, testified at the March hearing that he reported Gerety missing
 in April 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments.

Henderson said 
Gerety planned to live with Harris in Carbondale, 18 miles south of 
Topeka.

Dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, Harris appeared in court under heavy guard for the 30 minute hearing - six Osage County sheriff deputies watched him sat with his two attorneys.

He is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder of James Gerety, who authorities believe was killed between March 3, 2011 and April 20, 2011.

On March 14 in a pre-trial hearing, former girlfriend, Bobbie Williams testified that Harris told her he killed Gerety using a guitar string, disposed of the body, but kept the head in a bag for himself.

Another witness at that hearing, Topeka police Detective Brian Hill said that during questioning after his arrest, Harris told him that he kept the victim's head in a canvas bag with a draw string.

Hill testified that Harris spoke to the head, and had an active interest in voodoo and practiced it.

According to Harris' former girlfriend, Harris told her that he had shot the victim in the stomach and then tortured him for two days at their Topeka house.

After he had finished with his brutal treatment of Gerety, Harris then decapitated him with the string, according to Williams' testimony.

Then, Harris is said to have put Gerety's torso, arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father, Jeff Harris in Osage County.

Williams testified in court that she saw Gerety's head once, but then claimed later on that she was mistaken.

She did tell the court that Harris kept a voodoo doll named 'Jimbo', 'Bob on the Hill' and 'Poor Jimbo Bolinsky'.

The doll hung from the ceiling in their apartment.

Gerety's skull was recovered on March 24, 2012, at Jeff Harris' home by his girlfriend, Shirley Johnson.

She had been on the hunt for mushrooms when she found a ball barely buried and brought it inside to show Harris' father, who promptly called the police and his son was arrested.

Harris was in federal custody on unrelated charges when a warrant was 
issued in October 2013 and he was placed on hold for Kansas authorities.

In January, Harris filed a request to have the hold resolved and he was
 booked into the Osage County jail in March for court proceedings.
