Houston Mayor Annise Parker says her youngest daughter was barred from taking a driving test 'because she has two moms.'

Parker, who is the first openly-gay mayor of a major American city, said Thursday that the Department of Public Safety wouldn't accept the documents that her daughter Marquitta took to sign up for the test.

'Daughter needs drivers test. Has all docs, some in MomA [Annise] name, some MomK [Kathy Hubbard], but w/ birth cert showing both,' she said via Twitter.

'DPS says can only be from 1 mom!'

The mayor says it took her three trips and an 'unnecessary paper chase' to get her youngest daughter a driver's license.

'Thank you to the DPS clerk & supervisor in the Rosenberg office who took the time to read my daughters documentation & realize it was OK,' she said Friday afternoon.

Parker has three children with Hubbard: Daniela Parker, Marquitta Parker and Jovon Tyler. 

A spokesman for the department denied the claims. 

'All individuals applying for their first Texas driver license must provide a variety of documents to prove their identity, Social Security Number, US citizenship or lawful presence status, and Texas residency,' press secretary Tom Vinger told Lone Star Q.

'In this case, the adult applicant did not initially present sufficient documentation to prove residency. Once she provided the required documentation, she was able to complete the transaction.

'There is no indication that any delay in the process was related to same-sex marriage.' 

Parker and Hubbard were married earlier this year in a sunset ceremony in California on the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of their relationship.

'This is a very happy day for us,' Parker said then. 'We have had to wait a very long time to formalize our commitment to each other.

'Kathy has been by my side for more than two decades, helping to raise a family, nurture my political career and all of the other ups and downs and life events that come with a committed relationship.

'She is the love of my life, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life married to her.'

Parker's election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor.

Texas does not recognize same-sex marriages.

Parker has previously stated that she wanted to get married in Houston, but acknowledged that being able to do so may be a long time in coming.
