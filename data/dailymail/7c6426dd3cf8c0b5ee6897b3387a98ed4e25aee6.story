The Barbarians produced an imaginative penalty play in an attempt to fool the opposition during their victory over Leicester Tigers at Welford Road on Tuesday.

Just yards from the try line the invitational side huddled together in an attempt to conceal which player received the ball from the pass.

Unfortunately the move failed to pull the wool over the Tigers' eyes as a tackle is made without the Baa-Baas able to make any ground on their opposition - top marks for innovation, though.

The Barbarians, celebrating their 125th anniversary, came out on top as they charged to a 59-26 victory over Leicester.

There was also a final swan song for Barbarians' Jacques Botes who scored the final try of the match before converting from in front of the posts with his last touch as a professional rugby player ahead of retirement.

Botes was handed kicking duties earlier in the match but was left red-faced as his attempt to convert Tevita Li’s try from near the touchline barely made it halfway to the posts.
