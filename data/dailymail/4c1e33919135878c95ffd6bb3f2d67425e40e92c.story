The Prince of Wales will be an excellent grandfather to the new Royal baby, according to his wife Camilla, who said today that he is 'brilliant with children'.

But six-month-old Emily Scott may not agree - the youngster burst into tears when she met Charles as he continued his visit to Yorkshire.

The Prince admitted that he toasted the 
birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child by opening a bottle 
of champagne last night - however, he told well-wishers he had 'no idea' what his grandson would be called.

Resident Alex Dale told Charles: 'We popped a bottle of bubbly last night at our house - I hope you did too.'

The Prince replied: 'Yes. But just a little bit.'

He also told locals he was 'thrilled and very excited' by the news that his daughter-in-law had given birth.Â

One member of the crowd, Robert Barrett, raised a chuckle from Charles by greeting him, 'Morning grandad!'

Mr Barrett later said, 'He obviously likes being a grandad.'

And a little boy asked the Prince: 'When's the little baby coming?' to which Charles replied: 'We haven't been able to bring him yet.'

Camilla said her husband would make a 'brilliant' grandfather as she spoke to crowds during the visit.

'I think it's wonderful news. I think mother, son and father are all well,' she told the BBC.

for the grandfather - he's brilliant with children.'

Yesterday
 Charles continued his scheduled appearances after Kate went into Labour
 at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London.

The Prince visited the National Rail Museum in York as well as York Minster, and went on to a reception at Harewood House.

Isla Lister, eight, said both Charles and Camilla told her they could not wait to see the new baby.

She
 said: 'She was really nice and she said was really excited. I spoke to 
Prince Charles too and he said he couldn't wait to see him too.'

Welcome: The Duchess was beaming as she met staff and members of the public at the fish and chip shop

Good mood: There was a festive atmosphere in Bridlington in the wake of the Prince's birth

Several members of the Royal Family are carrying out engagements today despite the arrival of William and Kate's baby boy.

The Queen will give a reception for the winners of The Queen's Award for Enterprise in London.

The Earl and Countess of Wessex will also attend the reception, while the Countess is meeting members of the British wheelchair basketball team at the Swiss Cottage Sports Centre.

The Princess Royal will open the newly renovated Underground Tour and Roadways at the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield.

She will also visit Clayton Hall Farm and Candy Makers in West Yorkshire, before attending the Herriot Hospice Homecare 21st Anniversary Garden Party in Masham, North Yorkshire.

The Duchess of Gloucester will visit Haven House Children's Hospice in Woodford Green, Essex.

The Duke of Kent will attend the reception hosted by the Queen.

Her mother Debbie asked Camilla about the baby's name.

Mrs Lister said: 'She said they had no clue whatsoever. She wasn't giving anything away. I thought she might tell me something, but no.'

And Isla's grandmother, Judy Willis, said Charles told her: 'Grannies are getting younger, you know.'

Camilla later enjoyed a lunch of 'celebration fish and chips' in Bridlington, described the meal as 'the best thing I have eaten in an awfully long time'.

She ate the takeaway from the box it came in - but declined an offer of batter 'scraps' on her meal and opted instead for a healthy slice of lemon.

However, while she might have enjoyed the experience, she was unwilling to reward the proprietor with a sneak peek at the name of the Royal baby.

The Prince also enjoyed a nautical snack, when he was given a portion of Bridlington crab cakes by local chef David Nowell.

He
 spoke to Holderness Fishing Industry Group about how offshore wind 
farms affect the fishing industry, and was offered the chance to hold a 
live lobster but politely declined.

During
 the trip to Bridlington harbour, Geraldine Kynaston asked the Prince if
 she could give him a cuddle to congratulate him on becoming a 
grandparent.

There were spontaneous rounds of applause and cries of 'Congratulations, Grandad' as Charles was shown around the port.

At Bridlington Priory, hundreds of 
people waited under gloomy skies to see the Royal couple as they 
attended a celebratory service.

Thanks: Charles talks to locals who helped with recovery efforts after a devastating flood

Outside the church he met Charles and Janet Gardner and their son Matt, who had travelled 70 miles from their home in the suburbs of Leeds to see the Prince.

'I shook his hands and said "Congratulations",' Mrs Gardner, 70, said as she cried with emotion. 'He said, "I don't know if I have done a lot to deserve it. There's lots of proud grandmas and grandpas today."

'We came here from Leeds to see them. We are really big royalists in our family.'

Her 33-year-old civil servant said: 'To shake the future king of England's hand - this is the proudest day of my life.'

Charles and Camilla finished their day in Yorkshire with a walkabout among thousands of well-wishers in the seaside town of Withernsea.

Everywhere they went in the town they
 were greeted with shouts of "congratulations" and some people gave them
 teddies and other presents.

But Charles resisted all attempts by 
people in the crowd to find out more details about his new grandson, 
including any potential names.

Charles earlier paid a visit to a pub
 in the village of Burton Fleming, where he met people who were affected
 by severe floods last Christmas.

He was given a selection of real ales by Kate Balchin, who works at her parents' nearby micro-brewery.

'He
 said he was looking forward to trying some,' she said. 'It's a 
coincidence that the visit happened today, but the beers can wet the 
baby's head.'

One group of pensioners in the village serenaded him with the song: 'Grandad, we love you, Grandad, we do.'
