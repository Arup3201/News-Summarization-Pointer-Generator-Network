A 'Bonnie and Clyde'-style couple who were part of a gang which terorrised dozens of petrified victims during a spree of armed robberies has been jailed for nine years. 

Nicola Wright and her boyfriend Lee Makin made up half of a destructive group of robbers who stormed homes and businesses across the North.

The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who acted as the gang's getaway driver, was jailed alongside her 30-year-old partner and his accomplices after CCTV footage of them dressed in balaclavas and yielding knives against members of the public in Leigh and Warrington emerged.

Nicola Wright, 39, and her boyfriend Lee Makin, 30, were part of a gang of armed robbers who raided shops and businesses across Leigh and Warrington 

Accomplices Lee Harper (left) and Daniel Atherton (right) were jailed for eight and seven years respectively after admitting conspiracy to rob and burgle 

The couple were arrested following a high-speed police chase

Together they had carried out almost 40 burglaries and raids between May and July last year. 

After being pursued by police cars and helicopters, the group were arrested on July 18 and jailed at Liverpool Crown Court this month. 

The court heard how Wright drove Makin and his accomplices, Daniel Atherton, 28, and Lee Harper, 34, away from dozens of houses and businesses raided as part of the group's spree in a saloon car. 

Dramatic footage obtained by Greater Manchester Police shows the gang, dressed in balaclavas and masks, smashing shop fronts with axes and waving knives in the faces of innocent bystanders as they steal an estimated £94,000 worth of property.  

Makin, from Leigh was jailed for seven years after admitting conspiracy to rob and burgle while Wright will spend two years behind bars for conspiracy to burgle. 

Harper received an eight year sentence while Atherton was also jailed for seven years. 

Detective Constable Lynsey Watson of Greater Manchester Police described the 'devastation' caused by the group. 

'It is no exaggeration to that say that these four terrorised the Leigh and Warrington areas over a period of several weeks.

'Collectively they conspired to commit serious acquisitive crime for their own ends and did not at any point give a second thought to the trail of devastation they left behind.

'They targeted businesses and homes indiscriminately, moving from shops to garages to an amusement arcade. 

'Even a letting agent wasn't outside their remit, proving just how arbitrary their offending was.

The gang stormed businesses including letting agents across Leigh and Warrington wielding knives and axes 

Wearing masks, hats and balaclavas they 'terorrised' members of the public and office workers with their raids

Among the gangs targets with letting agents and other businesses though they are thought to have also robbed homes 

CCTV footage shows one of the gang members escaping through a broken-in door at a shop after plundering its till 

The gang emerge from their carrying knives, axes and wearing disguises during just one of their many sprees 

Smashing the entry to another premises the men pursue their next target. Greater Manchester Police said they terrorised dozens of workers across Leigh and Warrington with their crimes 

One of the men rests his axe on the counter of  a shop while a second gang member searches cupboards behind the till 

The group were arrested while driving in tandem as Greater Manchester Police helicopters and cars followed 

'A lot of time and effort went into identifying this gang and bringing them to justice and I would like to thank everyone who has been involved for helping us get to this point today.

'We have secured lengthy sentences against a dangerous gang of organised criminals who do not shy away from serious offending and this result is great news for everyone, particularly the residents and business community of Wigan and Warrington.'
