She's a strong advocate for healthcare both at home in Denmark and around the world, and this week Princess Mary of Denmark proved her dedication to the cause once again.

While touring South Africa the Crown Princess visited the Nthabiseng Thuthuzela Care Centre at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto, South Africa.

The centre was introduced as a critical part of South Africa's wider anti-rape strategy and is a one-stop facility which cares for victims of sexual crimes in an area where such attacks are rife.

During her time at the care centre Princess Mary toured the facility speaking to nurses and other staff about the services they provide.

These services include reducing secondary trauma for the victim which can arise from seeking unsuccessful help, improving conviction rates of the perpetrators and reduce the length of time it takes to deal with cases.

The Crown Princess also attended meetings with staff members who informed her of some of the challenges they face at the facility.
