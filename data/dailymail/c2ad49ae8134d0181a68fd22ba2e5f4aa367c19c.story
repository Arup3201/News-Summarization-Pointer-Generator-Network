Zoe Woolmer, 23, passed away on June 15 when she fell while walking King's Canyon in Central Australia

A month after she plunged to her death at a popular tourist spot in the Northern Territory, mystery still surrounds the final moments of British tourist Zoe Woolmer.

The 23-year-old backpacker was killed in a fall at Kings Canyon in central Australia on June 15 and her family travelled out to Alice Springs from the UK last week seeking answers.

Police still have not revealed the cause of the traveller's death, saying only that 'the investigation is ongoing and a report is being prepared for the coroner.'

Ms Woolmer was from Hertfordshire and studied Human Resources at the University of Portsmouth.

She was on a trip of a lifetime to Australia and had been travelling through the country for over a year.

Zoe had been visiting Melbourne prior to visiting the Red Centre and had lived in Sydney for several months before the accident.

She passed away after falling 30 metres while completing the rim walk at Kings Canyon, 450km west of Alice Springs on the afternoon of June 15.

While she was able to talk to paramedics after the fall, she passed away later that day.

Zoe's family and friends paid tribute to Ms Woolmer on social media.

Her mother Dawn wrote on Facebook two days after the incident: 'It is with a heavy heart that our family and friends report the sad loss of our dear Zoe during her much loved trip to Australia. Words fail us during the difficult time.'

Zoe's friend Connie Patterson, with whom Zoe had been travelling in Australia, wrote: 'RIP my beautiful best friend Zoe Woolmer.

'I miss you like crazy and cannot ever put into words how much I love you and the great experiences we have shared together!'

Zoe's family travelled from the UK to Alice Springs last week and met with police and the tour company that conducted the King's Canyon walk.

The tributes to Zoe come as photographs emerge of unsafe practices by tour guides at The Rock Tour, the company conducting the walk Zoe was on.

The photographs show tour guides skylarking at the edges of Kings Canyon â€“ posing close to the edge and standing on small ledges above 50 metre drops.

Adam Cooper, who was a tour guide with the company from March 2011 to April 2012 and returned in March 2014 for five weeks, told MailOnline that at Kestrel Falls, the area of the walk where it is believed Ms Woolmer died, walkers regularly pose on a thin ledge, only a metre wide, above a 50 metre drop.

'There's actually a bit up near the waterfall where... guides encourage people to take a photo off the ledge, it's so dangerous, if you fell that'd be falling 50 metres,' he said.

Numerous photographs of The Rock Tour guides and walkers posing on the ledge or posing close to the edge of the canyon, even in the rain when the sandstone would be slippery, have been posted to the Facebook pages of The Rock Tour guides, and some have been posted to the company's Facebook page.

The photos have since been taken down by the company.

Managing director of The Rock Tour, Rob Cowan stated that photographs are uploaded to the company's Facebook page by employees and the page is regularly monitored by company management.

'Whenever management sees a photograph depicting inappropriate behaviour they remove the picture and talk to the guide in question', he said.

'We have a three-strikes-you're-out policy,' he said and commented that two of the tour guides depicted in the photographs obtained by MailOnline had since been fired or encouraged to leave the company.

Police are investigating the cause of Ms Woolmer's death and have taken statements from the other 16 people in the tour group.
