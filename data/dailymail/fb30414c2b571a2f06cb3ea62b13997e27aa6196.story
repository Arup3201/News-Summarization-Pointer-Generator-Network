Jackets fitted with airbags may not be new, but they’re typically reserved for professional motorcyclists or can be difficult to install.

As an alternative, Alpinestars’ Tech-Air street system works like a lining for bike jackets and is portable - meaning it can be moved between jackets for different bikes and scooters.

When the system detects an impact, a built-in canister and ‘bladder’ inflates to protect the wearer’s body.

The Tech-Air street system, from Italian-based Alpinestars, is a portable unit that includes an air canister (left), an Airbag Control Unit (right), and cables that fit it to the jacket. When the electronics in the unit detect an impact, the canister inflates built-in 'bladders' to protect the wearer's body following an accident

The impact is monitored using sensors inside the Airbag Control Unit (ACU), and the whole system is powered by a lithium-ion battery.

This battery takes around six hours to charge, and will last for more than a day on a single charge. 

In April, Swedish firm Hövding unveiled its airbag helmet for cyclists.

The makers said that many modern bike helmets only just comply with European regulations, but their helmet performed considerably better in testing, making it three times safer than traditional helmets.

They go on to explain that, using their inflatable helmet, the risk of fatal head injuries resulting from accidents can be reduced to almost zero. 

The ACU is a single component surrounded in fabric and a mesh. 

Cables then connect the unit to panels in the jacket and the whole system is sealed to make sure it’s waterproof.

Alpinestars has said the jackets will launch in Europe in the spring. 

The vest itself will cost £999 (€1,199). 

Riders will then additionally need to buy compatible jackets. 

At launch, the technology will initially be available for a version of the current Valparaiso jacket, expected to cost £599 (€649).

It will also be available for the lighter Viper jacket, worth £299 (€349).

Both jackets will be fitted with an LED panel on the arm to make sure the system is working, and to make sure it has enough charge before the motorcyclist sets off.

Their helmet is so much better, they claim, that if the tests were redone with Hövding as the standard then all other bike helmets would be obsolete.
