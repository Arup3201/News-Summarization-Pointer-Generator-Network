When Santiago Wanderers midfielder Marco Medel was summoned by his manager to get stripped and ready for action he would have been hoping to steal the limelight, and he did.

But instead of scoring the winning goal or setting up a team-mate the 25-year-old Chile international hit the headlines after picking up an injury just seconds after entering as a second-half substitute.

Medel suffered the embarrassment of injuring himself as he jogged on to the pitch before immediately signalling to the bench that he had a problem.

As soon as he stepped foot on the pitch when he replaced Paolo Tamburrini Medel wore a strained grimace across his face as he realised he wouldn't be able to participate in the match.

He motioned towards the dugout to suggest he had snapped his achilles tendon before crumpling to the floor in a heap.

The unfortunate Medel had to leave the pitch on a stretcher in what must be one of the shortest ever substitute appearances.

Santiago Wanderers ended up drawing the match 0-0 with Universidad de Concepcion in the Chilean top flight to leave the club 12th in the table.
