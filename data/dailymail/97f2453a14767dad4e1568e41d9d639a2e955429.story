Ashley Roberts is no stranger to dazzling on the red carpet.

But the former Pussycat Doll always found it hard to find the perfect dress so she decided to take fashion into her own hands by designing her own line of glamorous garments - and now she wants to see Kate Moss wearing one.

The 32-year-old was recently appointed the new face of Key Fashion and helped create a 37-piece range of prom and cocktail dresses.
