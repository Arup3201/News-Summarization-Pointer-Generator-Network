The secret of a squirrel’s hibernation could hold the key to preventing Alzheimer’s.

Other devastating conditions, from Parkinson’s to Huntington’s could also be avoided or delayed, thanks to a British breakthrough.

Scientists from the Medical Research Council in Leicester have shown how a deep hibernation-like sleep cools down the brain and protects it from degenerative diseases.

The discovery could lead to a drug that stops a host of crippling illnesses in their tracks. 

Given in middle age, it could keep the brain healthy for longer.

The work is still at an early age but Alzheimer’s charities described it as exciting and said it could have ‘wide-reaching benefits’.

Researcher Giovanna Mallucci got the idea for her research after hearing what happens to the squirrel’s brain when it hibernates.

When the animal’s body temperature drops to conserve energy during its long winter slumber, connections between brain cells are broken. 

This stops messages being sent from cell to cell and helps put the brain into a deep sleep.

When the creatures come out of hibernation, the cell to cell connections, called synapses, reform, and work so perfectly that the squirrel can remember exactly where it hid its stash of nuts.

Older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements, say researchers.

Healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life, so-called episodic memory, had improved recall after six months of treatment.

A new overview says the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has most benefit for people with existing memory problems, particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress.

Experts believe supplements rich in DHA from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with Alzheimer’s disease. 

Dr Carrie Ruxton, independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer Equazen, said oily fish consumption was falling. 

With broken synapses a classic early feature of neurodegenerative diseases in people, Professor Mallucci decided to see if she too could fix them.

To mimic the effects of hibernation, she took healthy mice and gave them a drug that cooled them down to the 16-18c of a hibernating squirrel and put them in a deep sleep.

The synapses in the mouse brains broke up – then reformed when the creatures were warmed up again. 

Crucially, levels of a protein called RBM3 rose.

In contrast, mice in the very early stages of an Alzheimer’s-like illness were unable to reform their synapses when coming out of ‘hibernation’. And they did not make more RBM3.

However, when these mice were given an injection that raised levels of RBM3, the brain connections reformed.

The improvement was even more dramatic in mice genetically engineered to succumb to a CJD-like illness.

These animals remained healthy – and even lived longer than usual.

Together, the experiments show RBM3 to fix broken synapses – something that should keep brain cells alive.

If RBM3 also keeps human synapses healthy, a drug that increases levels could keep Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases at bay.

Professor Hugh Perry, a Medical Research Council neuroscientist, said: ‘We now need to find something to reproduce the effect of brain cooling.

‘Just as anti-inflammatory drugs are preferable to cold baths in bringing down a high temperature, we need to find drugs which can induce the effects of hibernation.’

The researchers caution that such drugs are a long way off. But say if they work, it may be possible to give them from middle-age to delay or even prevent a range of crippling brain diseases, including dementia.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature, also helps explain why medically-induced hypothermia protects the brain. 

For instance, artificial cooling is used to prevent brain damage in babies deprived of oxygen at birth.

Dr Eric Karran, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘This research is at an early stage and will need exploring further in humans before we know whether it could be developed into an effective treatment for diseases like Alzheimer’s.

‘There is currently a desperate lack of effective treatment options for people with dementia.

‘Research to uncover the key biological mechanisms keeping brain cells healthy is important, as it provides more avenues for investigation in the search for treatments that could make a real difference to people’s lives.”
