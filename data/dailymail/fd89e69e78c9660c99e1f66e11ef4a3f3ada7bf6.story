Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill has been left sweating over the fitness of winger James McClean ahead of Sunday night's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland.

The 25-year-old Wigan midfielder limped out of training at Gannon Park in Malahide on Tuesday morning with his left ankle heavily strapped, and was immediately taken for a scan.

O'Neill later insisted the examination was precautionary, but he was left crossing his fingers over a man who has become a regular in his team.

The manager said: 'James has got a sore ankle. He's gone for a scan - precautionary, I hope - but he was just feeling it a little bit. We'll see how he is.

'It didn't happen in training. He felt a little bit sore after yesterday. He thought it might go away, but it's just a bit of a pain across the ankle.'

O'Neill will be desperate to have McClean fit for the clash with the surprise Group D leaders with fellow wide-man Aiden McGeady having not played for club Everton since January 31 because of a knee problem, from which he has now recovered, but which has left him short of match fitness.

The 63-year-old, who first worked with McClean during their time together at Sunderland, insists he is yet to pick his team for what could prove to be a pivotal game in the campaign, but admits the former Derry City player has become an important player for him.

He said: 'They are all key. We haven't picked the side yet, but James has played exceptionally well for us in most of the games since I have been in charge. Obviously I know him quite well - very well, in fact - and yes, he's a good player for us.'

O'Neill also has concerns over Burnley full-back Stephen Ward, who was due to undergo a procedure to remove screws used to repair an ankle injury on Monday, while striker Jonathan Walters trained wearing a mask to protect the fractured cheekbone he had repaired recently.

Everton midfield duo James McCarthy and Darron Gibson have been nursed through the early part of the week after their exertions on club duty, while skipper Robbie Keane and new squad member Harry Arter have now joined up with the rest of the party.
