Everyone knows the term ‘get them while they’re young,’ but is this taking things a step too far?

Bizarre footage has surfaced of a Chinese toddler dressed in pyjamas running on a treadmill under the order of his parents.

The vision, which was uploaded to Chinese website Ku6 on Sunday, features the parents laughing in the background as they gradually turn up the speed of the treadmill, forcing the 17-month-old boy to run at full speed.

The father orders the one-year-old child to 'hurry up' as he struggles to keep up with the speed of the treadmill

The child struggles to keep up with the conveyor belt, edging towards the back of the machine before his father, who is in stitches, finally lifts him off.

The father is repeatedly telling the child to ‘hurry up! hurry up!’ in Chinese throughout the clip.

The mother can be heard saying ‘don't make it too fast,’ while failing to contain her own laughter.

The description for the video describes the baby running on the treadmill as 'adorable'.

Children can suffer serious injuries as lacerations, fractures or amputation on treadmills

An article published last month on prominent health website LiveStrong explained why letting children use treadmills is fraught with danger.

‘Children may not be able to keep up with the high speeds a treadmill reaches, so they may trip and fall when using it,’ the article reads.

‘Also, children might insert their fingers between moving parts or around the edges of the running belt, leading to such serious injuries as lacerations, fractures or amputation.’

According to a warning for the NSW Fair Trading in 2013, 95 per cent of those who suffer injuries on treadmills are children. The notice ‘urged parents to keep youngsters well away from treadmills.’
