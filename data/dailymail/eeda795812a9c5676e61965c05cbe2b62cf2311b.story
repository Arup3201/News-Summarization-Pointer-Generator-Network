The Charlie Hebdo massacre was almost cancelled because one of the gunmen suffered a stomach bug the day before the terror attack, according to a police report.

Killer Said Kouachi had a 'virulent stomach bug' that left him bed-ridden the entire day before the shooting, the leaked report revealed.

But after taking anti-sickness tablets, evil Kouachi had recovered enough to leave his home on the morning of January 7 and attack the offices of the satirical magazine in central Paris.

Evil: The brothers went on the run in France following their deadly attack on the satirical magazine, which they targeted because it had published cartoon images of the Prophet Mohammed

He left his home and told wife Soumya he would return 'this evening or tomorrow', before linking up with brother Cherif and gunning down 12 people in cold blood.

The killers targeted Charlie Hebdo after the controversial paper had published cartoon images of the Prophet Mohammed.

The inquiry also found that the night before the attack, Cherif Kouachi met an Islamist gunmen who was behind a synchronised but separate terrorist strike in Paris.

Phone records have indicated that Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly met just 10 hours before beginning their three-day killing spree in and around Paris in early January.

They are believed to have met in Gennevilliers, the town near Paris where Kouachi lived, according to the police inquiry.

And around one hour before  the Charlie Hebdo offices were attacked, records show that Kouachi sent a text message  to one of the 13 phone numbers belonging to Coulibaly, according to Le Monde newspaper.

Coulibaly went on to shoot dead an unarmed policewoman the next day, before taking hostages at a Jewish supermarket in  Paris on January 9.

Accomplice: Amedy Coulibaly met with Cherif Kouachi just 10 hours before the fanatics began their three-day killing spree in and around Paris. In total, 17 people were murdered by the trio

That siege ended after he killed a further four people, before police stormed the building and killed Coulibaly in a blaze of bullets.

During the siege, Coulibaly had told French media  that he had 'synchronized' the attacks with the Kouachi brothers, but failed to provide any further details.

Detectives also allegedly discovered that Coulibaly filmed his attack on his assault on the kosher supermarket with a high-tech GoPro camera attached to his chest.

It is understood the footage was then sent via internet from the hostage scene, but it has not been posted since. 

Solidarity: Just days after the attacks, an estimated 3.7 million people took to the streets of Paris in a defiant show of support for Charlie Hebdo staff

Four suspected accomplices of Coulibaly remain under formal investigation for allegedly supplying him with weapons, a bulletproof vest, knives, tear gas and a car. All have denied knowledge of his terrorist intentions.

In total, 17 people were killed in the two terror attacks, along with the three gunmen who were killed in shootouts with police. 

Days later, more than 3.5 million people took to the streets of Paris in a defiant show of strength in support of Charlie Hebdo and the murdered victims.
