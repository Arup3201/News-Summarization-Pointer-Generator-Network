ESPN's Gerry Hamilton suffered an epic copy and paste fail on Wednesday when he mistakenly tweeted a link to a porn site to his near 15,000 followers.

Hamilton, the network's college football national recruiting analyst, was tweeting about linebacker recruit Roquan Smith, but instead of including a link to ESPN's college football recruiting page he mistakenly pasted a link to Pornhub.

The offending tweet was taken down within minutes, and Hamilton quickly resent the original tweet with the correct link.

However several of his followers were able to screen grab the offending tweet which continues to live on on Twitter.

Neither Hamilton nor ESPN have so far acknowledged that he sent the offending post, although he has continued tweeting about football-related matter.

Many users made jokes at Hamilton's expense. 'I think @HamiltonESPN  forgot to double check his copy/paste function ...' tweeted NASCAR driver Ryan Ellis.

'@HamiltonESPN So you're just gonna take the 'act like it never happened' approach? SMH my kids are on this site. I demand an apology,' said another user.

Pornhub even got in on the joke and asked if Hamilton wanted a job for the day. 'I heard you like Pornhub,' the adult site wrote. 'Want to switch jobs for a day?'

On his Twitter profile, Hamilton describes himself as the 'father of an awesome 8 year old, Golf Channel nut, Basset owner'.
