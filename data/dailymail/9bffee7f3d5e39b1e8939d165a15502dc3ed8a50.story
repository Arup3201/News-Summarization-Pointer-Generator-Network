A minor crab bite has left a 
77-year-old Florida man fighting for his life after he was infected with
the flesh-eating virus that claimed its ninth victim over the weekend.

George
Clarke, of Yulee, was out crabbing Saturday night in Nassau County at the 
Georgia-Florida state line when a crustacean snapped at him, infecting 
the elderly man with Vibrio vulnificus.

So far, 27 cases of the flesh-eating infection have been confirmed in Florida this year, nine of them fatal.

George Clarke, 77, of Yulee, was infected after 
being pinched by a crab. This is Clarke's arm. Since this photo was 
taken the bacteria has eaten away all of the swollen skin pictured, 
according to his family.

Case No. 27: George Clarke, 77, contracted a potentially deadly infection caused by the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria 
(pictured), which so far this year has affected 26 people, killing nine of them

The latest victim of the outbreak was 
identified this week as Henry Konietzky, 59, who passed away from the 
infection just over a day after he went crabbing in Halifax River in Volusia 
County Saturday.

News of 
the latest incident involving the deadly bacteria was first reported by 
the Orlando Sentinel, which recieved a call from Mr Clarke’s grandson 
Bob Karstetter, of Delaware.

'His arm
turned completely black, and they have given him five antibiotics,' 
Karstetter told the paper of his grandfather’s condition.

The 77-year-old patient is currently being treated at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville.

His
grandson decided to contact the media about the health scare in order 
to warn the public of the danger, saying that the bacteria is extremely 
fast-moving, and seeking immediately medical attention could make all the 
difference between life and death.

In
a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday afternoon, Clarke's 
granddaughter-in-law, Kimberly Kartstetter, said that the 77-year-old 
married father of four is currently stable, but his condition is ‘hour 
by hour.’

‘He's a fighter,’ Kimberly told MailOnline. ‘He’s the toughest man I know.’

Crabbing gone awry: Clarke's grandson said that the man was bitten by a crab in Nassau County, Florida, over the weekend

Mrs Kartstetter explained that doctors are getting ready to perform a third surgery on her husband's grandfather to remove more necrotic skin from his right arm.

Since the 77-year-old was admitted into the Jacksonville hospital, the team of medics treating him has removed all the skin and tissue on the affected limb down to the muscle.

Kimberly Kartstetter added that her elderly relative, who is affectionately known to his family as ‘pop-pop,’ remains heavily sedated.

According to the woman, Clarke’s doctors remain ‘cautiously optimistic’ at this time that they may be able to save his arm in large part thanks to the fact that the infection has not reached the muscle in the limb. 

Experts who have spent the past five days struggling to save Clarke’s life have recently found what is believed to be the right combination of antibiotics to prevent the infection from spreading further, according to Mrs Karstetter. 

On Saturday, Mr Clarke was fishing for blue crabs near his home in Yulee, Florida, when one of the critters pinched his finger.

Kimberly said the 77-year-old, who has a degree in fish farming from Rutgers University in New Jersey, usually rinses his hands with alcohol after handling sea creatures, but for some reason he had failed to sanitize the wound Saturday.

Clarke went to bed that evening, but woke up at around 4am Sunday with 105-degree fever and pain in his right arm, which has become swollen and quickly turned black.

The man immediately went to a local hospital and was later airlifted to Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville. 

Mr Clarke has remained in the hospital since Sunday, with his extended family, including his wife of 59 years, Shirley, by his side.

‘We all have hope,’ Kimberly Karstetter said.

This was the first sympton that manifested on Henry Konietzky after he was infected with the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in a Florida river at the weekend. Mr Konietzky died on Monday after the infection overtook his body

Florida resident Henry Konietzky 
passed away 28 hours after noticing a small lesion on his foot, which 
appeared a day after he went crabbing with his wife.

Mr Konietzky had stepped on some ants before getting into the water, sustaining small bites.

Doctors believe this was the gateway that allowed him to become infected by the flesh-eating bacteria, which is considered one of the deadliest strands of bacterium in the world and usually forms every year in the warm saltwater swimming holes of Florida.

It is the ninth death in 2013 connected to the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in the Volusia and Flager counties, with health officials warning locals to take serious care when visiting saltwater spots, especially with open wounds.

Horrific: Henry Konietzky had no previous medical issues before encountering the bacteria

However, two men have recovered from the infection after contracting it fishing in the Indian River Lagoon, reported 10 News.

Vibrio
vulnificus is a naturally-occurring bacteria in warm seawater that 
belongs to the same family of bacterium as cholera and requires salt to 
live.

According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the bacteria can also 
be contracted from eating contaminated raw seafood like oysters.

When open wounds on otherwise healthy 
people are exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria, the skin 
can become infected, leading to a breakdown and ulceration of the skin.

Immunocompromised people suffering from liver diseases and other ailments face a 
deadlier risk: they have a higher possibility of the bacteria invading 
the bloodstream, leading to potentially fatal complications.

If the bacteria is ingested, healthy people can experience vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. 

For
people with weaker immune systems, consuming Vibrio vulnificus can 
infect the bloodstream, leading to 'a severe and life-threatening 
illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure 
(septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,' according to the CDC.

Deadly bacteria: The bacteria can be contracted by eating contaminated raw seafood which can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, or through open wounds such as insect bites that contact the water

Bloodstream infections by the bacteria are fatal about 50 per cent of the time.

Patients
are treated with antibiotics, and according to the CDC, infected wounds
must be treated aggressively - sometimes meaning amputation of an 
infected limb.

Between 1988 and 2006, CDC received reports of more than 900 Vibrio vulnificus infections from the Gulf Coast states
