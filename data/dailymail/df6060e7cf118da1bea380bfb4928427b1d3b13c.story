Getting rid of large unwanted items is normally something of a chore, but a group of fundraisers have come up with a novel solution.

They commissioned a 60ft trebuchet that hurled a car, a church organ and a petrol bomb to raise money for a church near Bridgenorth, Shropshire.

The novel idea came from Rollo Gabb who said he wanted a catapult ever since he saw the medieval weapon being used 20 years ago.

Trebuchet: The catapult flings a car through the air in a display of medieval weaponry

Preparing to fire: The car is winched into place before being fired across the field

Flying bomb: The trebucet flings the car, which weighed between 1.5 and 2 tonnes, with ease

The 12-tonne machine has been called Dionysus and the event at the weekend raised £1,000 in funds for Acton Round Church.

After its launch the red Peugeot was left a crumpled wreck when it was launched around 100ft into the air while the organ made an almighty crash as it hit the floor. 

Mr Gabb, owner of Journey's End Wines, said he was happy with his efforts and had realised a long-held dream.

He said: 'Ever since I first saw a 
trebuchet in action nearly 20 years ago I have wanted to include one in a
project and tying it in with one of our vintages seemed like an ideal 
opportunity.

'The 
event went a long way to providing Acton Round Church with a new organ, 
the trebuchet will hopefully continue to be used for fundraisers for 
many years to come.

‘It is being painstakingly taken apart and 
shipped to the vineyard near Stellenbosch before then being rebuilt.

'I'm
planning to raise funds for various projects in South Africa by people 
donating to watch the trebuchet flinging items such as empty wine 
barrels.’

Preparing to fire: The car is attached to the trebuichet before being fired

Swinging into action: the car is lifted into the air by the catapult

Lift off: The car gets ever higher into the air before being hurled downhill in the field

Free fall: The car flies through the air before crashing into the ground

Wrecked: The damage to the car from the force of the impact can clearly be seen. It is almost impossible to tell which is the front of the car and the back

Grounded: The car looks like it has already gone through the breakers yard such is the damage from the impact

The Gabb family bought Journey’s End in 1995 since 
when it has supplied wines for the likes of Brasserie Roux, Gordon 
Ramsay at Claridges, L’Atelier, the National Portrait Gallery and Quo 
Vadis.

Musical monster: A Church organ is attached to the trebuchet before being launched

Church hymns: The trebuchet also hurled an old church organ which began to fall apart mid-air as a result of the G-force

Smashed: The wreckage of the church organ shows how it has been smashed to bits by the impact with the ground

Flying: The trebuchet also launched a petrol bomb and church organ

Exploding bomb: The petrol bomb explodes as it flies through the air illustrating the power of the trebuchet in medieval battles

Firebomb: The petrol bomb continues its flight through the air

Touch down: The petrol bomb lands in a puff of smoke
