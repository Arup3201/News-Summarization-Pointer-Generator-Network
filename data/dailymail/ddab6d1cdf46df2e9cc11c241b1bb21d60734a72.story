If there’s one gadget that is crying out for a redesign it’s the humble umbrella, whether they’re being torn apart in the wind or clashing into people.

That’s where the Air Umbrella comes in. The ambitious design creates a 'force field' of air above a user to deflect rain.

The potentially revolutionary device comes in three sizes but won't be available until late next year.

The gadget was created by inventor Chuan Wang from Nanjing, China and it is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign.

On their page the team notes that the product is still in a research and development phase - although that hasn’t stopped them already reaching their target of £6,200 ($10,000).

The Air Umbrella will come in three sizes and prices to meet different needs.

The smallest is Version A, which measures 11.8 inches (30 cm).

Version B is 20 inches (50 cm) long while Version C can be extended and retracted, growing from 20 to 31 inches (50 to 80 cm).

A is the cheapest at £55 ($88), B will set you back £61 ($98) and C is £67 ($108).

However the battery life isn’t terribly impressive, ranging from only 15 to 30 minutes.

The long and thin device resembling a regular umbrella but without the fabric. It works using a lithium battery to power the fans inside.

At its base is a button that turns it on and off, while the bottom can also twist to change the size of the air emitted.

Above this is the somewhat large lithium battery, with a motor mounted on top.

This drives a set of fans in the head of the sceptre-like device. Air is drawn in at the bottom of the head, and then expelled at the top. 

This creates a canopy of air above a person that will blow water away and apparently keep you dry in the rain.

The Air umbrella apparently produces less noise than the rain around it, while the device is also waterproof.

A space 3ft 4in (one metre) in diameter is created under the umbrella when it is turned on, which expands in size when the rain is less heavy. This is apparently fine for up to two people.

However, the company doesn’t say how the device copes in windy conditions. 

And you’ll have to wait a little while to get your hands on it, with the release not due until December 2015.
