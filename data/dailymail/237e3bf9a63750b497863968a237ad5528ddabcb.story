Six years have now passed since the Champions League final hosted two English teams and 10 English players in the glittering Luzhniki Stadium.

These days, such an event would feel an outer-world experience, as though an illusion that this nation could ever enjoy such worldly superiority as it did when Manchester United and Chelsea slugged it out on that dramatic night in Moscow.

English clubs have had their moments since, Chelsea battling courageously and improbably to win the competition in 2012, but recent years have been exercises in containment, rigidity, ill-discipline and usually, hard-luck stories.

Gone: England have been eliminated from the 2014 World Cup after losing their first two Group D matches

Minority: Joe Hart (left) and Gary Cahill (right) were two of just four England players, starting against Uruguay, who played Champions League football last season

Chelsea against Atletico Madrid, Arsenal against Bayern Munch, Manchester United against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

Three English semi-finalists in three consecutive seasons between 2006 and 2009, playing a confident and dominant brand of football now feels a lifetime away.

It is as though English teams no longer feel comfortable in their own skin, reverting only to stifling tactics on the showpiece occasion.

Now, finally challenged to rediscover an attacking verve, the England team went gung-ho, liberating the restraint that has strangled the national culture in recent years.

History: Six years have passed since two English team battled it out for the Champions League in 2008

Failed: Roy Hodgson (left) and Steven Gerrard were unable to lead the Three Lions into the World Cup last 16

Sidelines: 11 players in the England squad to played in the Champions League last season but five haven't kicked a ball in Brazil

It may explain the giddinness and 
faltering concentration that engulfed Roy Hodgson's side following 
equalisers in both matches, almost as though many of these players were 
on work experience before the main event in two years.

It is a 
very sad time for English football when a World Cup in Brazil - a once 
in a life-time opportunity for many of us, we would presume - is tossed 
away so liberally.

England
 should have done more. Uruguay had been beaten by Bolivia, Costa Rica 
and even those whipping boys Spain in the past couple of years. Italy 
went into this World Cup on the back of draws with Armenia, Denmark, 
Luxembourg and Nigeria.

The
 debate will rage over whether England underperformed or whether this is
 simply an England team that does not possess the requisite pedigree for
 the world stage.

It may well be a bit of both. Consider this for a 
moment: just four of the players that started the match against Uruguay 
have started a Champions League match in the last two seasons.

The
 Premier League is a fine breeding ground but it simply does not provide
 that very same brutal induction into the unforgiving and ruthless 
nature of football at the highest level.

England conceded goals from a 
corner and a goal-kick at this World Cup, the final blow from Luis 
Suarez a goal transplanted from the Hackney Marshes scrapbook for its 
amateurish, child-like simplicity.

Learning curve: The likes of Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw have just 10 England caps between them

Experience: All 11 of Germany's starting line-up against Ghana were in the Champions League last season

Dip: Could the Three Lions be suffering from English team's poor performances in Europe?

Look elsewhere at this World Cup and it becomes clear that major European experience is needed. Taking into account the most recent starting XIs selected, England possess less players from last season's Champions League than Holland, Portugal, Brazil, France, Belgium, Italy, Argentina and Germany.

On Saturday, Argentina started with eight, Germany with all eleven. Of course, there are no guarantees. Spain's entire squad of 23 participated in last season's Champions League and they are on the first plane home.

Then again, they can take comfort in two European Championships and a World Cup in the last six years.

Louis van Gaal's exciting Holland squad has just nine Champions League players in their 23-man squad but in Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Nigel de Jong, they arguably have the form players in the world at this moment. England's finest never threatened to reach such a level.

Mistake? Chelsea duo Frank Lampard (left) and Ashley Cole have years of Champions League experience but the latter wasn't even selected by Hodgson

Ever-present: Chelsea have been the only English team to perform in the Champions League and won the competition in 2012

Even amongst those who have dined on the continent's top table in recent times, question marks remain.

Of
 the starters against Uruguay, Wayne Rooney is England's best but he has
 scored just three Champions League goals in the last two seasons and 
has not inscribed his name into a knockout match since Manchester United
 2011 final defeat by Barcelona.

Danny Welbeck has his qualities but he 
will never decide a football match alone. Gary Cahill is not the same 
player without John Terry beside him.

Joe Hart's Manchester City have barely been exposed to the knockout-stages of the European competition.

Not good enough: Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich

Stalwarts: Arsenal have qualified for the Champions League for the 17th consecutive year but the Gunners are yet to win the trophy

So maybe there should be little surprise that for all England's flirtation with attacking aspiration - and that is all it was, a shimmy across the dance floor, an awkward chat-up line and then the abrupt put-down - England rarely appeared at ease at this World Cup, rarely in control of their own fate.

Once again, England gave notice that they fear, rather than relish, such a stellar stage, frightened to seize the occasion in the way that the Chileans, Ghanians and Costa Rican's have done.

The hazard signs have been flashing for some time now, the European malaise now reflected in a national team that is shorn of quality, devoid of self-belief and happy to do little more than hop along for the ride.

The manager and players will bristle at the suggestion but the noises from the FA - Alex Horne suggesting that mere qualification for the World Cup constitutes success, Greg Dyke irritatingly backing Hodgson on the day England exited the competition - only contributes to the feeling that English football increasingly appears to be apathetic, out of ideas, and suffering yet another crisis of confidence.
