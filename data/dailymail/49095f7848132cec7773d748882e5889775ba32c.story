In 2011 astronomers announced they had discovered a gas cloud known as G2 drifting around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's core.

While the cloud had been observed orbiting the black hole its origins, however, were unknown.

But now astronomers have found that the cloud is in an orbit matching another gas cloud - suggesting both may have been ejected by a star as it orbits the black hole.

A cloud at the Milky Way's core could be form a star, say astronomers. In this image the red part of the G2 cloud is seen in orbit around the black hole (path shown in solid white). The blue part is the second cloud, G1. The distance from red to blue is 900 times the Earth-sun distance. They may have come from star S2

The new research, made possible using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, was presented by astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) near Munich, Germany. 

At the centre of our Milky Way is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. Most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core.

Sagittarius A* lurks 26,000 light years away in the Milky Way's innermost region.

For a black hole, it is very dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery.

Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy.

Its interaction with the gas clouds G1 and G2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes 'feed'.

They hope to understand these black holes don't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies.

The findings could shed light on how stars are formed, how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies. 

But finding a gas cloud in orbit around the black hole was odd, as it was not obvious where it could have come from.

The new research, though, shows that the gas cloud G2 lags behind another, dubbed G1, by about 13 Earth years.

Both are in a similar orbit, suggesting they are part of the same stream of gas - and they may just be one in a series of gas clouds deposited around the black hole by a star.

The best model to explain the gas clouds now is that they originate from the wind of a massive star that also orbits the black hole.

This star is labelled S2, and it may be shedding material as it makes its way around the huge gravitational phenomenon. 

If confirmed, the cloud would provide a fascinating insight into what happens when stars orbit a black hole.

All black holes are known to have an event horizon around their core, within which nothing - not even light - can escape.

But this star in question orbits beyond the event horizon, so it only feels the effects of the black hole from a greater distance.

At the centre of our Milky Way is a supermassive black hole (illustration shown) called Sagittarius A*. Most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core. Its interaction with the gas clouds G1 and G2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes 'feed'

The new research, made possible using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, was presented by astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) near Munich, Germany. They observed the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, seen in this illustration

In 2013, the G2 gas cloud made its closest approach to the black hole, a distance of 20 light hours - about five times the distance of our sun to Neptune..

It is on a highly eccentric orbit, so will now begin to move out to a much greater distance from the black hole.

And it follow a path already carved out by its companion, G1, which could provide information about its origins.

'Already a decade ago, another gas cloud - which we now call G1 - has been observed in the central region of our galaxy,' said Dr Stefan Gillessen from MPE in a statement.

'We explored the connection between G1 and G2 and find an astonishing similarity in both orbits.' 

The G2 gas cloud (illustration shown) was first spotted in 2011, but since then astronomers have debated its origins. Some have suggested it may have come from a star surrounded by a gas cloud, but this latest research says it is more likely it is ejected material from a star

The latest findings were made using the Very Large Telescope in Chile (shown). Here a laser beam launched from the VLT´s 26.9ft (8.2-metre) Yepun telescope crosses the majestic southern sky and creates an artificial star at an altitude of 56 miles (90km)  to correct images from the blurring effect of the atmosphere

Dr Oliver Pfuhl, also of MPE and lead author of the study, added: 'Our basic idea is that G1 and G2 might be clumps of the same gas streamer.

'In this case, we should be able to simultaneously fit both data sets and, indeed, our model captures the G1 and G2 orbits remarkably well.' 

A likely source for both G1 and G2 could  be clumps in the wind of one of the massive disk stars, which could have been ejected some 100 years ago.

Another possible explanation that has been suggested recently would be a large star, enveloped by an extended gas cloud. Based on current data, however, this model is highly unlikely.

Whatever the answer turns out to be, though, it could reveal a fascinating insight into some of the goings on near the black hole at the Milky Way's core.
