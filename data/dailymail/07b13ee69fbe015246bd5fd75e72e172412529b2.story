Metropolitan Police PCSO Billy Wheatley was jailed after admitted 18 sex crimes on children as young as six

A former Metropolitan Police PCSO with a 13 year history of child sex abuse that began when he was just 12 years old has been jailed.

Billy Wheatley, 25, videoed himself on a mobile phone abusing a girl aged just five or six and recorded sexual assaults while wearing a hidden camera.

He was working for the force in Bromley when he committed some of the series of offences that spanned 13 years.

He admitted 18 sex crimes dating back to 2000, including two counts of assaulting a girl under 13 by penetration.

Even after his arrest, Wheatley, from Sidcup, Kent, continued to make indecent images of children.

He was jailed for five-and-a-half years at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday.

Scotland Yard detectives said it is 'highly likely' Wheatley abused other children and urgedÂ  victims to come forward.

Wheatley, who worked as PCSO in Bromley, filmed himself sexually assaulting a young girl, took indecent photos of children and kept thousands of indecent images and videos of youngsters on his computer.

Officer's from the Met's paedophile unit raided his home and arrested him for possession of indecent photographs of children on September 13, last year.

Police found almost 69,000 indecent photos and films of children, and mobile phone footage of him sexually assaulting a girl aged five or six.

Nine more movies of young children were found that appeared to be taken by him wearing a secret camera.

He was arrested again on November 23 for sexual assault by penetration and causing a child to engage in sexual activity and voyeurism.

In interview he told police who the young girl in the film was and admitted assaulting her on two previous occasions.

He also admitted assaulting the girl's older brother when he was 13 or 14.

He pleaded guilty to 18 charges in 
February, including indecent assault on a boy under 14 between 2000 and 
2002, two counts of assault of a female child under 13 by penetration 
between December 31 2009 and September 12 2012, sexual assault of a girl
under 13, voyeurism and taking indecent photographs of girls and 
children, all between 2009 and 2012.

Wheatley was jailed at Woolwich Crown Court for five-and-a-half years. The court heard police found 69,000 indecent images and videos of children, including mobile phone footage of him abusing a girl

Speaking after the sentencing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Andrew Gattase said: 'As a PCSO, Wheatley was in a position of trust and had a responsibility to his local community.

'Instead he abused that position to take part in despicable crimes, an urge he couldn't control even after he had been arrested and bailed.

'It is highly likely there are further victims of Wheatley who we don't know about and I would urge them to come forward and contact us.

'I am pleased the dedicated and tireless work of the Met's paedophile unit has put an end to the activities of Wheatley.

'This case also shows the Met's commitment to ensuring those who commit crime are dealt with thoroughly and rooted out from the organisation.'
