Police in Florida say a young father decided to combine baby sitting duties with criminal activity when he brought his 5-month-old son to an armed home invasion. 

Corey Jame Earl Mathews, 22, from St Petersburg, was arrested Monday while allegedly acting as a lookout during a burglary.  

According to investigators, the recently married father of one was holding his baby son in a car carrier while his friend was trying to break into a house in the 300 block of Ninth Avenue North just before 6pm.

Multitasking: Police say Mathews pulled a knife on the owner of the home he and his accomplice were trying to burglarize and threatened to kill him, all the while holding his baby son 

Police say when Mathews spotted the homeowner approach, he alerted his accomplice. 

The other suspect fled, and the homeowner called 911 as he followed Mathews. The 22-year-old man then put down his son and pulled out a knife, allegedly threatening to kill the victim if he kept following him. 

The man backed away, allowing Mathews to flee with his child, reported St Petersburg Tribune. He was arrested a short time later still carrying the knife.

Mathews was held Tuesday on $15,000 bond on burglary and other charges, including violating his probation for battery on a law enforcement officer.

Police say Mathews' mother took custody of the baby.

Corey Mathews, who on Facebook has described his occupation as a 'stay at home daddy,' has a lengthy criminal record.

In December 2012, he was arrested on a slew of charges, including resisting an officer with violence, battery on an officer, and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

In January and February of 2013, Mathews landed behind bars on two separate occasions for trespassing and resisting an officer.
