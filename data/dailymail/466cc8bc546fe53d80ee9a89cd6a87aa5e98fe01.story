A speeding driver who killed a young bride-to-be in a horrific head-on crash on a country road has been jailed for 16 months.

Luke Anderson, 23, lost control on a dangerous bend while travelling at speeds of up to 81mph, and killed Hannah Seeley, 23, who was coming in the opposite direction.

Miss Seeley, a midwife, was buried in the wedding dress she never had a chance to wear down the aisle. She had been for a fitting session with her proud parents just three days before she was killed.

Grief: Hannah Seeley, 23, with her fiance Mark Wade, 27, who she was due to marry just months after she was killed in the car crash in Pakenham, Suffolk

Hannah's father Kevin, 50, said in an emotionally-charged statement directed at the killer driver: 'A wedding 
dress in a coffin, Luke, a wedding dress in a coffin.'

The midwife was due to marry her fiance Mark Wade, 27, on September 15 last year, five months after the fatal crash which happened in Pakenham, Suffolk.

Killer driver: Luke Anderson, 23, was jailed for 16 months for causing the death of Hannah Seeley after crashing at speeds of up to 81mph

Anderson, who was nicknamed 'The Stig' by friends after the Top Gear racing driver, crossed the middle of the road as he rounded the corner.

He collided head on with the Miss Seeley's Ford Fiesta and sent it crashing into a field, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

The young woman, who was driving home to Stanton from a shift at West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, when the accident happened, was declared dead at the scene.

In the days after her death, her heartbroken fiance Mark placed a wedding ring on her finger before her coffin was closed.

The devoted couple had got engaged in Paris in 2010 and had planned to go on a US honeymoon to New York and Las Vegas.

Anderson, of Barningham, Norfolk, admitted causing her death by careless driving on April 22.

Judge John Devaux said he had been driving too fast to negotiate the bend on the 60mph limit road in the wet conditions at about 9.20pm on the night of the crash.

Anderson, who wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was injured, was travelling between 71mph and 81mph when he lost control of his Volkswagen Golf.

Judge Devaux said there had been a sign warning motorists to reduce speed on the approach to the bend, the word 'slow' had been painted in the road and there were also a series of chevron boards on the bend.

He told the defendant: 'You were driving a VW Golf southbound on the A143 at Pakefield. The road surface has been described as wet or damp and was subject to the 60 mph national speed limit.

'While you were attempting to negotiate a right hand bend you lost control of your car, crossing central white solid lines into the path of Miss Seeley who had no time to take avoiding action.

'A high speed collision between the two cars occurred and she suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene'

'I have no reason to doubt you have feelings of genuine remorse'.

'Your speed was in excess of the speed limit and was too high for you to safely negotiate the bend '

Crash victim: Hannah had got engaged to her boyfriend Mark in Paris in 2010 and had planned to go on a US honeymoon to New York and Las Vegas

Miss Seeley's family did not speak to the media after the sentencing hearing yesterday.

However, a heartbreaking impact statement from her father Kevin describing the family's grief was read to the court at the last hearing,

He
said: 'On Monday, April 23, 2012, Karen, Hannah's mother, Kirsty, her 
sister, Mark, her fiance and myself, visited Hannah in the chapel of 
rest.

'Her eyes were half open as if she was waking up. If only that was true, rather than closed for eternity.'

'When I kissed her forehead she was so cold. Hannah didn't like the cold, never has, never will.'

Mr
Seeley said that just three days before her death Hannah had travelled 
with her proud mother to Norwich for a wedding dress fitting.

He
said he watched as his devastated wife Karen, 49, waited outside the 
undertaker's with her dream dress over her arm, waiting to 'dress Hannah
for the final time' on April 30.

Ian James, defending, said Anderson had no previous convictions and felt genuine remorse.

He said: 'He is truly sorry for what he has done.'

Mr James accepted Anderson had been driving too fast for the conditions that night and said the collision was the result of 'an error of judgement'.

He said Anderson had been left with a speech impediment following the accident and had recently had a brain scan.

Mr James said he genuinely couldn't remember what happened on the night of the accident and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.
