Within five minutes of taking a lethal sedative, Brittany Maynard was fast asleep and all of the pain from her struggle with cancer erased from her face.

She died another thirty minutes later, leaving the world just how she planned - surrounded by her loving husband, family and friends. 

Dan Diaz, the widower of the 29-year-old who has become the face of the right-to-die movement, spoke out this week in interviews with People magazine and Meredith Vieira to describe his late wife's last moments on November 1 and how he plans to honor her memory.

How she died: Brittany Maynard's widower Dan Diaz (pictured) appeared in a Today show Wednesday to describe his late wife's last moments, after deciding to undergo doctor-assisted suicide rather than continue to battle a painful and aggressive form of brain cancer

According to Diaz, 43, his wife marked that day to be her last, after a tumor was found rapidly growing in her brain and doctors gave her just six months to live.

While chemotherapy and radiation were an option for Maynard, they wouldn't significantly extend her life and she didn't want to spend what time she had left battling a torturous disease in a stuffy hospital. 

Instead, she decided to spend her last months on Earth rock climbing, traveling and spending time with her beloved husband, who she only married in September 2012. 

She decided beforehand that if she was feeling well on November 1, that she would delay her death. But a seizure in the morning led her to commit herself to follow through with the brave act.

'It was a reminder of what she was risking because what was coming next was losing her eyesight, becoming paralyzed, inability to speak and she’d be essentially trapped in her own body,'Diaz told Vieira. 

After breakfast, Diaz says he and Maynard took a 90 minute hike with friends and family and their dogs Charley and Bella near the home they rented in Portland, Oregon to apply for the drug. Oregon is one of three states in the U.S. that has legalized doctor-assisted suicide.

When they got back from the hike, Maynard said she knew it was 'her time'. 

'She was tired of the pain, the discomfort, the suffering, the seizures,' Diaz told People. 'Even that small one that morning was a reminder of how sick she really was.' 

She mixed her prescribed sedative secobarbital which comes in powder form with a glass of water and took it to their bedroom, where she drank the concoction surrounded by her loved ones.

Diaz says she put everyone at ease by talking and joking until she fell into a sleep. 

'Within five minutes she was asleep. And within 30 minutes, her breathing slowed to the point where she passed away. She was surrounded by the people she loved and her passing was peaceful,' he said.   

'It truly was the most peaceful experience that you could ever hope for when you talk about a person's passing,' Diaz added to Vieira.  

'The suffering and the torment and everything she had gone through, that was finally lifted,' he said. 

He added that his wife had never questioned taking a lethal concoction of drugs to end her life, despite reports at the time suggesting that she may be having second thoughts.

Many of these reports cited videos and photos in which Miss Maynard appeared to be in good spirits.

'The weeks leading up to Brittany’s death, her symptoms were getting bad,' he told the show, which will air later this week. 'Those videos were taped 2 weeks before, 3 weeks before.

'Brittany’s seizures were getting worse, they were getting more intense, they were becoming more frequent. The pain she was feeling, the discomfort, the headaches and when those seizures hit.

'There was one instance where we had to go to the hospital. She couldn’t speak for four hours, and the last seizure she had was the most horrific and scary for her.

'Unfortunately, that video, just because of when it came out it gave the impression, "oh, well she looks healthy", but that was not the case whatsoever. Her health was deteriorating daily.' 

Diaz promised to take up his wife's cause to get doctor-assisted suicide legalized in their home state of California, which is why he has decided to speak publicly about her final hours.

But one thing he won't reveal is her last words. 

'That's a sacred part of things for me, and I don't want to share that with the world,' he said. 

Diaz says his wife first read about the right-to-die in Oregon shortly after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, telling her husband: 'Look, if things get bad, this is an option.'

Things did get bad. While her initial diagnosis last year gave her three to five years to live, the tumor grew rapidly and just a few months later she was told she likely wouldn't survive past six months.

'This cancer was going to kill me and the way it was going to kill me was terrible,' she told Today before her death, explaining her reason to commit suicide rather than battle the disease. 

Since doctor-assisted suicide is not legal in California, the couple moved to Portland, Oregon and last May, she was approved a prescription for secobarbital. 

It was actually her husband Diaz who picked up the lethal drug at the pharmacy, while she was in Alaska fulfilling one of her many bucket list adventures.

Diaz struggled with his wife's decision at first, but was ultimately supportive.  

'Did I want her to die? Of course not. Did I want this whole thing to go away? Of course. But did I ever want her to change her mind? No. I would never want my wife to suffer for no reason,' he said.

'She was absolutely resolved to be in control of how she died.'

Speaking of his acceptance of his wife's decision to die, Diaz explained: 'You don’t want to let go of your loved one but to suggest that she should suffer for me, for anyone, no.

'That’s what you struggle with - here’s the person I love and I don’t want to see her go.'

Still on leave from his job as a senior manager in the food industry, Diaz is now working to help get right-to-die legalized in California by telling his wife's story.

'My preference would be not to be in front of any cameras. But this was one thing Brittany had asked, that we make this a reality in California. I want to keep my promise to her.'

California legislators plan to propose a right-to-die bill later this month, but it has in the past drawn criticism from religious groups.

While in New York this week, Diaz also met with Senator Diane Savino who hopes to get a measure passed in her own state.

Diaz also defended his wife's honor against those who say she was manipulated by Compassion and Choices the group which worked with her to generate support for the right-to-die cause.

'If you knew Brittany, anyone would say that was impossible for her to have been exploited by an organization. She did this. She pursued, applied for and was given it before she was even contacted by Compassion and Choices. She decided to participate because she believed in the casue. There's absolutely no chance that she was being exploited or manipulated at all.

He has since moved out of their rental in Oregon and taken their dogs back to California. While Maynard's choice of death provided a sense of closure, Diaz says he's still rocked by her loss.

'I have good days and bad days.,' he said. 'But the feeling of loss is always there - particularly in the morning when I first wake up. And at night, when the house is quiet and I'm just there with the dogs, I think about her every day. 

He says he keeps her driver's license in his wallet now, to see her smile and be reminded of their short, but loving, marriage.
