Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including the FA Cup, Premier League and a daft red card.

1. Glen Johnson still has plenty to offer Liverpool as he waits to resolve his Anfield future.

The 54 times capped England right back is out of contract in the summer, and despite talk of a new three-year offer on reduced wages seems no closer to agreeing a new deal.

In his first full game since collecting a groin injury against Manchester United in December he was the team’s top passer against Blackburn, finding a team mate with 82 of 87 passes – half of them in the attacking half of the field.

Johnson’s role in defence also allowed Emre Can to play his more natural position at the base of the midfield.

2. Eric Dier is starting to win his battle to establish himself as a centre half for Tottenham after being forced to play at right back at the start of the season.

The 20-year-old, who was born in Cheltenham but grew up in Portugal before moving to White Hart Lane from Sporting Lisbon for £4million last summer, turned down an England Under 21 call-up in the Autumn because he didn’t want to play at full back.

He is improving rapidly now alongside Jan Vertonghen. At QPR he made 11 clearances, more than any other defender apart from the 14 managed by his Belgian partner.

3. Nedum Onuoha deserved credit for his determination to play for QPR against Tottenham despite the horrific cut to his cheek he suffered a few days earlier in the defeat to Arsenal.

But the former Manchester City defender showed signs that he was still suffering from the collision with team mate Steven Caulker.

In the 90 minutes he gave the ball away 30 times as Rangers, whose survival depends on their form at Loftus Road, slumped to their fourth home defeat in a row.

4. Jonas Olsson, key defender for West Bromwich Albion for the last few seasons, is now rapidly looking surplus to requirements.

The 31-year-old Swedish international hadn’t played since September after being axed by Alan Irvine before then needing surgery on an Achilles injury.

His comeback game at Aston Villa saw him dragged off after 68 minutes during which he struggled against the running of Charles N’Zogbia.

5. Matt Lowton has been one of the big winners at Aston Villa from the arrival of new boss Tim Sherwood.

The 25-year-old had been out of favour under previous boss Paul Lambert who had picked him only four times all season, after bringing Alan Hutton in from the cold to play right back.

But Sherwood has trusted the former Sheffield United defender to solve a problem at left back for him, and Lowton has twice kept the involvement of West Brom’s wide midfielder Craig Gardner to a minimum.

6. Pavel Pogrebnyak remains an expensive legacy for Reading from the days when former owner Anton Zingarevich persuaded his fellow Russian to sign a £65,000 a week contract.

The striker was hugely unlucky not to find a winning goal for the Royals in their 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Bradford, twice hitting the post.

But that is symptomatic of the way his season has gone, with just four goals to show for 25 appearances.

The bad news for boss Steve Clarke as he tries to balance his budget is that the Pog, now aged 31, still has another season of his bumper deal to run.

7. It’s little wonder that Watford fought so hard to keep striker Troy Deeney away from both West Brom and Swansea in the January transfer window.

The 26-year-old was also the subject of a failed bid by Leicester last summer, signing a new contract and being appointed club captain.

He’d already made Vicarage Road history as the first player in 50 years to get 20 goals in two consecutive seasons – and after getting his 16th of this campaign to earn a point at Wolves he’s well on course to pass that target for a third year.

8. Steve Morison still has the faith of Leeds manager Neil Redfearn – even though he reaches the unhappy landmark today of two years since he last scored a goal for the club.

In fairness the 31-year-old former Welsh international did spend all last season on loan at Millwall where his goals and all-round team play helped the London side avoid relegation.

He’s failed to find the net in 18 Championship games for Leeds so far this campaign, but Redfearn insisted his work rate up front was a key factor in the 1-0 win at Wigan which brought the club their fifth win in seven games.

9. Daftest red card of the weekend went to Notts County’s Liam Noble who got booked for dissent at Swindon – and then moaned so much to referee Gavin Ward about that decision that he got a second yellow.

The 23-year-old former Carlisle midfielder has now been sent off three times this season and even manager Shaun Derry admitted: “I can’t back him.” At least Noble issued a heartfelt apology to the club afterwards – but the Geordie born youngster clearly has some red mist issues to overcome.

10. Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough has long since consigned Burton Albion to his personal history book – but his links with the club he took from part-time football into the League in 11 years in charge are still strong.

And that is already helping new boss Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink as he tries to mark his first spell of management in English football by achieving a promotion.

Clough last week loaned Belgian Under 21 midfielder Florent Cuvelier to the Brewers – and the former Stoke youngster marked his debut by coming off the bench to get the winning goal at Hartlepool which kept Burton top of League Two.
