Millions of passengers face air chaos during this Summer's Olympics unless the Government acts now to prevent a disaster, British Airways and the UK's leading airlines have warned Transport Secretary Justine Greening.

In a leaked letter obtained by the Daily Mail, the bosses of BA, Virgin Atlantic, BMI British Midland and Easyjet warn Miss Greening and her aviation team that they will be acting in a 'foolhardy and reckless' manner if they ignore the warnings contained in their two-page missive.

The near apocalyptic letter spells out how the airlines, air traffic controllers and the aviation industry believe ministers have not been listening to their repeated warnings of the impending chaos at airports and in the airspace above Britain and have rejected up to five solutions.

British Airways is among the airlines that have warned the Government there could be chaos at Heathrow Airport (pictured) this summer

Now 'time is running out.'

It states bluntly that there is now a 'significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of London's major airports unless urgent action is taken' causing misery to the millions of passengers who will fly into the Olympics this summer.

The airlines also warn of their 'significant concerns that insufficient progress has been made regarding the resilience of the airspace' through which thousands of planes will take off and land during the sporting extravaganza.

The letter says: 'All of the major UK airlines, major airport operators and NATS believe that further action can and must be taken to ensure the impact on both "business as usual" travellers and visitors to London 2012 is reduced and that appropriate mitigation is available in advance of and during the period of the Games.

'As the situation currently stands, the industry believes that there is a significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of London's airports unless urgent action is taken.'

The words 'urgent action' are printed in bold to ram home the point.

The letter gives a stark ultimatum to the Government about the scale of the impending crisis, concern about ministerial inaction, and an action plan of what needs to happen before a crunch meeting set for March 22.

The letter says bluntly: 'Time is running out to ensure that any changes to proceedings and the appropriate training is in place prior to the games.

'We urge both the DFT (Department for Transport) and the CAA to support and agree to the proposals that the industry, including NATS, have put forward.'

The letter stresses that an agreed solution is 'vital before the March 22 meeting if we are to succeed in our joint objective of ensuring that we as an industry play our part in ensuring commercial air travel to and from London for the Games is a complete success'.

But in a stunning ultimatum to ministers by the airlines the letter says: 'Failure to respond leaves the UK vulnerable to the type of major disruption that will cause significant reputational damage and would be foolhardy and reckless.'

Warned: Transport Secretary Justine Greening was told Heathrow will struggle to cope the amount of flights laid on for the Olympics

The letter was sent by the operations chiefs of the four major airlines whose emblems fly at the top of the first page  – BA, Virgin Atlantic, Easyjet, and BMI British Midland. It was sent to Jonathan Moore, the Director of Airport Strategy at the Department of Transport and to Andrew Haines, chief executive officer of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

The letter was copied in to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers and a host of leading industry figures including BA chief executive Keith Williams, BA's Willie Walsh who is chief executive parent company IAG; Virgin Atlantic boss Steve Ridgway, Easyjet boss Carolyn McCall, the head of airport operator BAA, Colin Matthews and the head of Britain's air traffic controllers at NATS Richard Deakin.

It is signed by British Airways' director
of operations Andy Lord, BMI's head of operations and crewing Sean 
Butler, Virgin Atlantic's director of operations, safety and security 
Corneel Koster, and Easyjet's chief operations officer Warwick Brady.

The Games, most of which will take place at the Olympic Park (pictured) in Stratford, east London, is expected to put extra stress on London's transport network

One insider close to the row said that the major airlines and air traffic controller bosses had together come up with a list of potential solutions to the expected air chaos caused by the extra traffic during the Olympic period – particularly the three days before the Games, the period of the men's 100 metres final, and the period immediately after the closing ceremony.

The senior source said frustrated airline chiefs believe ministers are 'burying their heads in the sand' by suggesting that the industry had raised no concerns. Their letter, dated Thursday March 15  and copied in to Miss Greening and her team, is their riposte to that.

The insider said: 'We can't just wait until July and then say 'Houston – or rather Heathrow – we have a problem. Ministers must deal with it now.'

'It's like cars on the M25. On a quiet Sunday morning, it's fine and everyone can cope. But on a Friday evening or a busy Bank Holiday, it doesn't take much for the whole system to end in gridlock. And that's the message we're trying to get across to ministers.'

Another aviation insider said: 'This will affect millions of passengers at the busiestt time of the year and cause mayhem. The skies above Britain and its airports will be gridlocked.'

In simple terms, the airlines and air traffic controllers have been calling for more flexibility to prioritise the bigger airports such as Heathrow and Gatwick over smaller airports such as Farnborough in Surrey during times of highest demand.

The airlines believes 'insufficient progress' has been made with the CAA and the government when planning to cope with the expected extra flights, the impact that sudden and adverse weather could have if flights are cancelled, the impact of a 'security event' or the response of the security services to it, the effect of non-scheduled additional general aviation and business traffic, and even the impact of aeroplanes and helicopters used by television companies to get aerial shots.

The airlines say they sought additional 'resilience measures' from the Department for Transport last December. Measured sought additional 'temporary permissions' to allow airports, airlines and air traffic controllers to operate more flexibly and 'differently' during the Games.

But these were denied.

The letter sets out how air traffic controllers recently presented 'five different options for prioritising air traffic' in the southeast of England.

But it was rebuffed because the CAA claimed that under the current terms of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) licence, the CAA 'could not consent' to any revisions of the traffic management criteria during the Olympic period.

Damningly, the letter adds: 'Further, we understand that the DFT are under the impression that industry is satisfied with the steps taken so far – this is far from the truth.'

It warns ministers and aviation chiefs bluntly: 'Time is running out.'

The airlines conclude to ministers: 'As a group, we encourage you both to ensure that the appropriate action is taken to enable the industry to deliver the service that is so critical to the success of London 2012, and we and our teams are available to provide whatever support and clarity is needed to enable the right outcome.'

Earlier this year, airport officials admitted that passengers arriving at Heathrow during the Olympics face the threat of baggage chaos as thousands of athletes and officials bring in up to three times as much luggage as normal. Heathrow said there will be a 45 per cent increase in the number of passengers arriving on July 26 alone, the day before the Olympics' opening.

National Air Traffic Services which is responsible for controlling aircraft flying in UK airspace and the eastern part of the North Atlantic said despite measures already in place there is 'still a risk of delay and disruption during the Games'

In a statement it said: 'NATS is committed to a successful Olympics for our customers and for the UK. For us, this means ensuring flights pass through the UK air traffic system safely and as efficiently as possible.

'With this goal in mind, we will have implemented new airspace, procedures, operational radar positions, facilitated MOD security airspace measures and communicated to the aviation community the changes they can expect during the Games.'

But significantly it added: 'There is, however, still a risk of delay and disruption during the Games. This may be from security incidents, runway over capacity or bad weather (e.g. thunder storms).

' We continue to work closely with the wider industry and with the Civil Aviation Authority and Government to find the right mechanisms and responses to these issues.'

A CAA spokesman said: 'Managing air traffic during the Olympic period will require careful co-ordination between NATS, the aviation industry, the CAA and Government.

'A range of proactive measures have already been put in place to help manage airspace as a whole network during the Olympics, and we will continue to work very closely with NATS, the Government and the aviation industry to prepare for the Games and ensure that everything possible has been done to effectively manage UK airspace.'

A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: 'The Government is committed to delivering safe and efficient transport services for the 2012 London Olympic Games, and aviation is clearly a major part of this.

'That is why we have already announced a range of special measures designed to protect scheduled air services from disruption during the Olympics period.

'We are confident that the majority of these additional issues have now been addressed and we look forward to discussing them with the airlines concerned at a meeting next week.

'We continue to work closely with the CAA, NATS and the industry to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum.'
