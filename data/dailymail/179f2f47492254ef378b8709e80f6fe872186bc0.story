Mike Phillips has promised not to give up his Wales jersey without a fight after the selection panel sent a warning to their under-performing Lions stars ahead of the second Test against South Africa.

The coaching staff are ready to wield the axe and Phillips, the 31-year-old scrum-half, is among a group of senior players who could pay the price for Saturday’s humiliating 38-16 defeat in Durban.

Wales have some exciting prospects – including No 9s Gareth Davies, 23, Rhodri Williams, 21 and the injured Rhys Webb, 25 – waiting in the wings but Phillips is ready to turn up the heat to keep his place in the starting XV.

Defiant: Mike Phillips won't give up his jersey without a fight

‘It is always tough and we have good competition throughout the squad, and particularly at nine,’ said Phillips. ‘Gareth Davies did really well we he came on last week, which is great for him. I am being pushed all the way but it is great to have competition; you have to relish it.

‘No-one takes the jersey for granted and everyone knows Gatland will have no hesitation putting big names on the bench. The performance last week was not good enough for the jersey and what we represent. We are feeling under pressure for our places, when you lose you are there to be shot at.’

Phillips will discover his fate at Thursday’s team announcement in Nelspruit, where the tourists will arrive after a short stopover in Cape Town. Wales had just one training session to prepare for the opening Test, but preparations are well underway for the series-decider at the Mbombela Stadium.

Below par: Phillips admits the performance against South Africa was not up to scratch

There can be no repeat of the display on the Eastern Cape and defence coach Shaun Edwards admitted Wales were ill-prepared for the tour opener.

‘It is an excuse but we only trained together once last week,’ said Edwards.

‘We were intent on preparing the Tuesday team and getting them up to speed after what had happened in the Probables vs Possibles game, so we had only one training session with the first team and the captain’s run on Friday.

Ill-prepared: Shaun Edwards admits Wales were not ready for the first Test

‘I hadn’t seen Jonathan Davies for three months, except for the Probables vs Possibles game. Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies had only played together for 20 minutes.

'We’ve been able to get some drilling in this week and hopefully we can get back to speed.’

Asked how Wales will deal with the threat of South Africa full-back Willie Le Roux, who was the standout performer in the opening Test, Edwards added: ‘I was thinking of locking him in the toilet before the game and getting a padlock for it.’
