Partying hard with an older man she met on a swingers website, this is Robyn Gardner out in Aruba with murder suspect Gary Giordano just two days before she vanished.

Pictures released by authorities in Aruba show the young American tourist looking dishevelled, blissfully unaware of the fate which would befall her.

With Mr Giordano still being held without charge on the island, police are attempting to piece together Miss Gardner's last movements before she disappeared to try to gather enough evidence to pin the crime on her male companion.

Unaware: Gardner and Giordano are seen partying two days before she disappeared

Giordano, 50, is the only suspect being 
questioned in relation to the
disappearance of Gardner, 35, who has been missing since August 2. The 
older man
is being held in custody for 60 days, but police need
more evidence to charge him with murder.

In an attempt to re-enact what happened, police will use witness statements, CCTV footage and pictures of their last days together.

In the photographs of the two out dancing, Miss Gardner is wearing the same long dress she wore on the day of her disappearance.

The reconstruction of events will 
take place in the early evening - around the time of day Miss Gardner is
thought to have vanished.

'The
whole key of re-enactments is to try to go back and first of all 
understand and be clear about the movements of people prior to a 
criminal act occurring,' retired FBI profiler Brad Garrett told ABC 
News.

'Now, unfortunately, in this case you don't have a crime scene to eventually end your re-enactment.'

Giordano and Gardner were last seen leaving a restaurant - the Rum Reef Bar & Grill at Baby Beach - at about 4pm on August 2.

Two hours later, Giordano is seen alone on security camera, wearing no top but with his toupee still in place.

He reported his companion missing, 
saying she had drowned while snorkelling. Giordano was arrested as he 
later tried to flee the country.

Shocking surveillance video from the 
day before Robyn Gardner disappeared shows her being led by Giordano to 
the stretch of beach from which she would vanish a day later, in what experts believe could have been a test run before she was murdered.

The footage
shows the Toyota Rav-4 which the pair had rented parked in the same 
spot it would be left on the day of Robyn's disappearance.

Other
shots show them walking near the restaurant where they shared their 
last meal on the following day. The video was taken at 3.41pm, around 
the same time of day she vanished a day later.

Officers
having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms 
Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him 
in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.
