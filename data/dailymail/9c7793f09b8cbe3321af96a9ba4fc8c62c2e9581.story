A government scheme to help 160,000 young people get into work has so far reached just 4,600, it emerged today.

Nick Clegg’s Youth Contract promises to pay employers up to £2,275 for taking on an 18 to 24-year-old who has been out of work for at least six months.

But latest figures show that the wage incentives, claimed after someone has been in work for six months, have been paid for more than 4,690 young people.

Painting over the cracks: The Youth Contract scheme was launched with great fanfare by Nick Clegg as a solution to rising numbers of under-25s out of work

Mr Clegg has admitted that government policy for young people has failed, complaining that millions of pounds have been wasted on a ‘hotchpotch’ of schemes which have failed to stem the tide of youth unemployment.

The Deputy Prime Minister has ordered a major review into Whitehall schemes which are supposed to get teenagers and people in their twenties into a job.

Wage incentives under the Youth Contract have been paid to employers for more than 4,690 recruits between June 2012 and May 2013.

Ministers hoped it would help 160,000 young people find work over three years – equivalent to around 53,000 people each year.

The Department for Work and Pensions insisted the scheme ‘has encouraged UK businesses to offer over 21,000 jobs to young people at risk of long-term unemployment’.

Employment minister Mark Hoban insisted the government was 'not complacent'

Most of the incentive payments are only made once the employee has been in work for six months.

The DWP claimed more than 21,000 jobs have been offered to young people at risk of long-term unemployment under the Government wage incentive scheme.

Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘Youth unemployment has fallen by 59,000 since the Youth Contract was launched and tens of thousands of people have benefited from work experience, apprenticeships or the wage incentive.

‘Through the different elements of the Youth Contract, this Government is delivering on our commitment to offer young people the best chance to get on in life, but we're not complacent about the scale of the challenge still facing us.’

The Department for Work and Pensions said take-up of the incentive got off to a slow start, but is now on a ‘clear upwards trajectory’.

But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘It is far too early for the Government to be hailing the Youth Contract a success.

‘Closer reading of today's figures show that of the 7,810 people who started on this scheme 26 weeks or more ago, only 2,870 found long-term jobs. In other words, 63 per cent of those who started left employment before six months.

‘There is also still a huge issue with employer take-up. Research published last month shows that nearly one in three of firms are still not aware of this initiative, and of those that are, fewer than one in five intend to make use of it.’

Dole queues: The number of people aged 18-14 who are unemployed has risen by 50 per cent in five years

Latest figures show that from March to May this year there were 3.63 million 16 to 24 year olds in employment, down 31,000 from December 2012 to February 2013.

Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: ‘The Youth Contract has utterly failed to get our young people back to work.

‘This flagship scheme is on course to miss its target by more than 92% - no wonder there are still almost a million young people out of work.

‘The welfare revolution we were promised has fallen apart. The Work Programme doesn't work, Universal Credit is disappearing into the sunset, and now we know that the Youth Contract has been a disaster.’
