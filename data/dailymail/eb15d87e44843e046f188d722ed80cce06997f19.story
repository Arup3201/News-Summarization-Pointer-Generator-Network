President Barack Obama has signed a secret order allowing the Pentagon to target Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, broadening previous plans that had limited the military to counterterrorism missions against al-Qaida, it was revealed Friday. 

The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed. 

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counterterrorism and training mission for the next two years.

Not going anywhere... yet: US officials say President Barack Obama has quietly approved guidelines in recent weeks to allow the Pentagon to target Taliban fighters in Afghanistan

Obama's moves expand on what had been previously planned for next year. 

In May, the president stated that US forces would have no combat role in Afghanistan next year. Missions for the remaining 9,800 troops would be limited to training Afghan troops and to hunting the 'remnants of al Qaeda.'

One US official said the military could only go after the Taliban if it posed a threat to American forces or provided direct support to al-Qaida, while the latter could be targeted more indiscriminately.

'To the extent that Taliban members directly threaten the United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al-Qaida, however, we will take appropriate measures to keep Americans safe,' the official said.

The Taliban's presence in Afghanistan far exceeds that of al-Qaida, adding significance to Obama's authorization. 

The president's decision came in response to requests from military commanders who wanted troops to be allowed to continue to battle the Taliban, the US officials said.

The New York Times first reported the new guidelines. Officials confirmed details to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Obama's decisions by name.

Some civilian aides have argued against risking American lives next year in operations against the Taliban, saying there should only be a narrow mission against al Qaeda, The Times reported.

But generals urged Obama to define the mission more broadly if intelligence showed extremists threatening American forces.

The decision to expand the military's authority does not impact the overall number of US troops that will remain in Afghanistan after this year. 

Months earlier, Obama ordered the American force presence to be cut to 9,800 by the end of this year, a figure expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015.

The president wants all US troops out of Afghanistan by 2016, as his presidency draws to a close.

Some of the Obama administration's planning for the post-2014 mission was slowed by a political stalemate in Afghanistan earlier this year. 

It took months for the winner of the country's presidential election to be certified, delaying the signing of a bilateral security agreement that was necessary in order to keep U.S. forces in the country after December.

Afghanistan’s parliament has approved agreements with the U.S. and Nato allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country past the end of this year.

The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year.

The new agreements ratified by parliament allow the US and Nato to keep a total of 12,000 troops in Afghanistan next year to support local forces.

The agreements come after U.S. officials said president Barack Obama had approved new guidelines allowing American troops to engage Taliban fighters, not just al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan.

Mr Obama’s decision also means the U.S. can provide air support when needed.

In approving the agreements in a 152-5 vote, Afghan parliamentarians made no mention of Mr Obama’s expansion of the US role in fighting militants in the country.
