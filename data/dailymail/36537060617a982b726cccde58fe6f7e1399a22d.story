The filmmaker father of virgin killer Elliot Rodger sells erotic black and white photography of naked women's behinds.

While his son produced numerous videos and a 140-page manifesto plainly spelling out his raging hatred of women, Peter Rodger has composed a rather more tasteful, albeit risqu√© portfolio, as Showbiz 411 has revealed

Rodger, who was the assistant director on Hollywood smash, The Hunger Games, even asked one of his nude models to pose at that monument of eternal love, the Taj Mahal - built by an Indian emperor in memory of his beloved wife who died.

Erotic: These are some of the $1,250 prints of naked women on sale online produced by Peter Rodger, the virgin killer's father

Twenty of the British director's photographs are on sale at the website of the respected Saatchi Gallery and cost as much as $1,250.

Rodger's artful images have been taken all over the world, from the romantic streets of Paris and Cannes to sultry retreats in Marrakech.

The limited edition prints feature suggestive images of women's derrieres in a seedy New York hotel room and freely walking across the snow in Aspen, Colorado.

The sexually provocative photographs produced by Peter Rodger are a stark contrast to his son's aggressive, emotionally stunted attitude to women that led him to murder six people on Friday in Santa Barbara and injure 13 others.

In one particularly chilling video that he posted online, Elliot Rodger explains that he is a 22-year-old virgin, who despises women and the men who they sleep with.

He promises to kill them all for slighting him and for denying him the attention he thinks he has been denied.

The Rodger family and photography have a deep connection. Peter Rodger is the son of George Rodger, the legendary British war photographer who was one of the founder's of the Magnum photo agency.

George Rodger was one of the first men to document the horrors of the Bergen Belsen concentration camp and passed away in 1995.

His son, Peter, is best known in Hollywood circles for his role in the production of The Hunger Games in addition to the documentary, Oh My God, which he directed, wrote and starred in - and which featured, Hugh Jackman and Ringo Starr.

His Saatchi Art profile describes him as growing up looking through a camera lens, assisting his father.

He studied at Maidstone College of Art and has shot print and commercial advertising campaigns in more than 40 countries.

On Sunday it was revealed that Peter Rodger had read his son's chilling manifesto and were frantically trying to stop their son carrying out his plan when they heard of the massacre on the radio.

Elliot Rodger emailed the 140-page document to his father and mother, Lichin Rodger, just hours before he went on his shooting rampage.

Lichin Rodger, the suspect's mother, reportedly received the email at 9.17pm and immediately went on to her son's YouTube page where she found the newly uploaded video titled 'Retribution' which describes his plan of 'slaughtering' women at a sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

According to CNN, Mrs Rodger then alerted her estranged husband, Peter, and after he watched the video she called 911. The former couple then set off from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to try find their son.

Later that night, their worst fears were confirmed when they were told their son was behind the massacre that left six victims dead and 13 injured.
