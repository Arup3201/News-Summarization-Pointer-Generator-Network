Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad has launched an astonishing attack on Britain, accusing the 'arsonist' government of being 'naive, confused and unrealistic' in its approach to the ongoing conflict in his country.

He went on to warn of 'grave' consequences if the West armed its rebels.

Assad said that Britain has been unconstructive in its attempts to militarise the rebels

In an interview with the Sunday Times he said Britain was sacrificing peace talks to push for an end to an EU arms embargo, which would allow rebels to be armed.

Warning this would accelerate the road to
war, he rejected the possibility of help from Britain to end the 
conflict, saying: 'We do not expect an arsonist to be a firefighter.'

He added: 'How can we expect to ask Britain to play a role when it is determined to militarise the problem?

'How can you ask them to play a role in making the situation better, more stable?

'How can we expect them to make the violence less while they want to send military supply to the terrorists and don't try to ease the dialogue between the Syrian(s).

'To be frank, Britain has played famously
in our region (an) unconstructive role in different issues, for 
decades, some say for centuries.

'This Government is acting in a naïve, 
confused, and unrealistic manner. If they want to play a role they have 
to change this, they have to act in a more reasonable and responsible 
way.'

Assad warned that if the West made moves that ended up with rebels being armed, there would grave consequences.

'Syria lies at the fault line 
geographically, politically, socially and ideologically. So playing with
this fault line will have serious repercussions all over the Middle 
East

'Any intervention will not make these things better. It will only make them worse. 
Europe and the United States and others are going to pay the price 
sooner or later with the instability in this region. They do not foresee
it.'

Foreign secretary William Hague branded Assad 'delusional' on The Andrew Marr Show after the Syrian president spoke out against Britain's actions to push for an end to an EU arms embargo

Today, foreign secretary William Hague dismissed Assad's criticism of Britain as 'delusional' and said Britain could not afford just to 'sit on the sidelines' and watch the slaughter continue in Syria.

Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, Hague refused to rule out the prospect that Britain could arm the Syrian rebels, despite Assad's warning.

'The longer this goes on the greater the danger that extremism takes 
hold, the greater the danger of destabilising neighbouring countries, 
and the greater the extreme humanitarian distress involved. So we cannot
just sit on the sidelines and watch this.

'We will be doing more and we will have to steadily do more if there is 
no diplomatic or political breakthrough.

'The situation in Syria now is 
too dangerous to the peace and security of that entire region and 
thereby to the world to ignore it.'

Hague, who is set to announce further non-lethal assistance to the rebels later this week, said that the UK would continue to 
step up support for the opposition as long as there was no diplomatic or
political breakthrough in the two-year long conflict.

'I don't rule anything out for the future,' he said.

'If this is going to go on for
months or years and more tens of thousands of people are going to die 
and countries like Iraq and Lebanon and Jordan are going to be 
destabilised it is not something we can ignore.

'These are the reasons why we can't just sit it out in Syria.'

The conflict in Syria has killed an estimated 70,000 people since it started two years ago, while thousands of refugees have fled the country.

Assad has also offered the opposition the chance of peace talks, if they are willing to put down their weapons.

The Syrian president said: 'We are ready to negotiate with anyone, including militants who surrender their arms.'

The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces denied any offers of peace talks from Assad's government. 

The UK has said that they will not provide rebels with arms despite supporting the opposition.

But, Foreign Secretary William Hague has not ruled out possible intervention in the future and is expected to detail an aid programme in parliament next week.

A Foreign Office spokesman said earlier this week: 'We want to do more and we want to give more types of support and we’re pushing to do that.'

This comes as newly appointed US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on his first overseas tour in the role.

He said: 'The opposition needs more help. We think it's very important that more of our assistance gets to areas that have been liberated from the regime.'
