Sergio Aguero and his girlfriend Karina Tejeda spent the weekend in Barcelona and met up with fellow Argentina international Lionel Messi and his partner Antonella Roccuzzo.

Manchester City striker Aguero has been linked with a move to Barcelona and got a private plane back to England ahead of training with the Barclays Premier League champions on Monday.

Barcelona press remain convinced Messi wants Aguero to join the Spanish giants as soon as their transfer embargo for breaching rules over the signing of under-18 players is lifted in January 2016.

Pablo Zabaleta was also on the trip to Barcelona with his wife Christel Castano as the City stars enjoyed a rare weekend off due to FA Cup fifth-round action.

They will meet again when City face Barcelona at the Etihad on February 24 in the last 16 of the Champions League, before the return trip to the Nou Camp on March 18.

Aguero and Messi are close friends having played alongside each other on the international stage since youth level, and the duo have shared rooms the night before Argentina matches since 2005. 

Messi played in Barcelona's 5-0 win over Levante at the Nou Camp on Sunday and scored a hat-trick as the La Liga club made it 11 consecutive wins. City next face Newcastle United on Saturday.
