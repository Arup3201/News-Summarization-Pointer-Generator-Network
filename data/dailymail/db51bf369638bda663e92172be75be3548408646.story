Many have suspected it for years, but now research proves it – driving with your other half sends your stress levels soaring.

Motorists feel four times more stressed or anxious if their ‘significant other’ is alongside them in the car.

The research released today by Allianz Insurance concludes: ‘Drivers are happier, more confident and focused when driving by themselves.’

By contrast it notes: ‘Partner Pressure’ almost quadruples a driver’s likelihood of feeling stressed or anxious behind the wheel, a potentially dangerous combination.

‘Having their ‘significant other’ in the car alongside them makes drivers feel twice as rushed which reduces the chance of them feeling calm and relaxed by nearly 65 per cent.’

Allianz Insurance says this ‘increases the risk of having an accident’.

Drivers told pollsters that the addition of any passenger increases their stress levels but that having one’s wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend or ‘partner’ alongside.

But it’s not equally matched between the sexes, with men appearing to wind up women more than the other way round.

When driving with their partners in the car, fewer than a third (32per cent) of women feel calm and relaxed, compared to 43per cent of men.

And the maternal gene clearly doesn’t help when it comes to off-spring. For  when driving with their own children in the car, only a quarter of women (25per cent) feel calm and relaxed, compared to a third of men (33per cent).

Also in the top five in-car  stress-inducers are: other people’s children, your own children. Parents, and other family members.

When it comes to road  locations where drivers feel most stressed, city centres  top the poll with nearly 1 in 5 (18per cent) citing it, followed by  town areas (8 per cent), motorways (8 per cent) and dual carriageways (5 per cent).

Drivers feel most rushed when commuting to and from work (15per cent), driving to appointments such as visiting the doctor (15per cent) and driving children to school (11per cent).

By contrast the calmest drivers can be found on Britain’s country roads, cited by more than half of those polled (52per cent).

The biggest worry  for drivers on the road are  ‘other drivers’, cited by more than half of respondents (52%), followed by tailgating (45%) and aggressive ‘road rage’ drivers (41%).

On motorways some 1 in 6 (16%) of women feel anxious, compared to only  1 in 12  (8%)  men – half the proportion.

By contrast fewer than a third ( 29%) of women feel calm and relaxed on a motorway, compared to almost half (46%) men.

Driving in town areas, some one in 6 (12%) of women feel anxious, compared to 1 in 12 (8%) of men. And while only  40% women feel calm and relaxed, that rises to almost half again (49%) of men.

Women are also bigger worriers. Of respondents who have had a car accident, nearly one in ten (9%) of  women feel more worried as a consequence, compared to just one in 20 (5%) of men.

The research was carried out  by Omnibus with 1,000 respondents who drive regularly.

Jon Dye, CEO of Allianz Insurance said: ‘The tales of back seat drivers and in-car arguments we’re all so familiar with, cause stress and distraction when drivers should be feeling calm and focused.

'It’s important that motorists and their partners are aware of the risks a stressful environment in a vehicle can create.’
