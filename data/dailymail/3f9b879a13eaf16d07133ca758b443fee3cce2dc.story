Hundreds of mourners including the Danish Prime Minister have attended the funeral of a filmmaker gunned down as he tried to stop a massacre in Copenhagen last week.

Finn Noergaard, 55, was shot dead on February 14 during a seminar on free speech and Islam in the first of two attacks by a jihadi gunman who also killed a Jewish man outside a synagogue. 

Today Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was among 750 people who gathered at Grundtvigs Church, Copenhagen, to pay their respects.

Around 750 mourners including the Danish Prime Minister attended the funeral of documentary maker Finn Noergaard, 55, in Copenhagen today after he was shot dead during the terror attack a week ago

Around 40 heavily armed police were present at the service to guard members of Denmark's Jewish and Muslim communities after a spate of deadly attacks across Europe.

Jesper Lynghus, a spokesman for Mr Noergaard's family, said: 'The last thing Finn would have wanted in this life was for an incident like this to... push people further away from each other.'

Friends of Mr Noergaard paid tribute to the documentary-maker an hour-long ceremony before tearful mourners emerged from the church carrying a white coffin covered in flowers.

They then assembled behind a hearse before the coffin was driven down a cordoned-off street.  

Zubair Butt Hussain, a Muslim activist and former spokesman for the Muslim Council, said: 'I think they have honoured him in a very special manner.'

According to reports of the shooting gunman Omar El-Hussein, 22, a Dane of Palestinian origin, fired 30 bullets at the Krudttonden cafe during his attack.

Members of Denmark's Muslim and Jewish communities joined together to pay their respects today after rising tensions between the two communities in recent weeks

Mr Noergaard was killed with a single shot from a M95 assault rifle, police said, before the cafe was sprayed with 27 bullets, wounding three police officers inside.

Witnesses said Mr Noergaard deliberately put himself between the shooter and the cafe.

In an open letter, his sisters said: 'We do not know what Finn was thinking in that situation, but we are sure it was not his own security but that of others he was concerned about.

'Finn was a human who took action when help was needed or in dangerous situations.'

Known for his documentaries, Noergaard had a special interest in the problems of integration. One of his best known works was a 2004 film about a young Australian boomerang thrower.

The Finn Noergaard Foundation, set up by the filmmaker's family to aid 'the integration of immigrants and their children' into Danish society, had  received 50,000 Danish kroner ($7,600) in donations, by this afternoon.

Mr Noergaard was killed with a single bullet to the head by Omar El-Hussein who opened fire outside a free speech event being held at the Krudttonden cafe, Copenhagen

The funeral is the last for those killed during the attack, after Dan Uzan, the Jewish security guard shot outside a Synagogue shortly after Mr Noergaard, was buried last week.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt also attended that ceremony, which was watched over by police snipers while sniffer dogs patrolled on the ground.

Around 500 people also attended the funeral of shooter El-Hussein, who was killed by police after opening fire on one of their cordons.

Prominent Salafist campaigners such as Adnan Avdic took photographs next to his tombstone, despite the owners of the cemetery raising objections. 

Police say El-Hussein, 22, shot Mr Noergaard before riddling the cafe (pictured) with 27 bullets, injuring three police officers inside

The service for Mr Noergaard comes a week after similar scenes at the funeral of Dan Uzan, 37, the Jewish security guard killed outside a Synagogue during the same shooting spree

Around 00 mourners also arrived at the funeral for shooter El-Hussein as he was buried in a Muslim cemetery, despite protests from its owners

Meanwhile, questions mounted Tuesday over whether Danish police had done enough to prevent the February 14 attack in which Noergaard lost his life.

Unnamed employees of the cultural centre  told the daily Politiken that Danish police sat with their backs to the entrance drinking coffee before the venue's staff alarmed them to the shooter outside.

Swedish Mohammed cartoonist Lars Vilks - who fled into the kitchen as his permanent security detail reacted to the attack - said last week he thought Danish police had underestimated the threat against the seminar following the January Paris attacks, in which jihadist gunmen killed 17 people.
