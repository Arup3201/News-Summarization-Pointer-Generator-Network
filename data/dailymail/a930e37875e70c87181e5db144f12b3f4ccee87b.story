A rhino horn worth more than £160,000 has been stolen by thieves who raided the home of Lord of the Dance creator Michael Flatley.

The Irish star was playing computer games with his wife Niamh and their son Michael when their home Castlehyde, Ireland, overlooking the River Blackwater was invaded.

Burglars are thought to have severed the horn - valued at £164,000 or 200,000 euros - from the stuffed rhino's head mounted on the wall in a safari room at the sprawling mansion, north of Cork.

Mr Flatley raised the alarm after hearing the intruders and is understood to have tried to give chase in his car, but the gang escaped.

The Gardai, the Irish police force, said the burglary was reported at 6.20pm on Monday.

No one was injured and no arrests have been made.

A source told The Daily Express: 'Michael and his wife were extremely distressed. A notorious traveller gang are suspected of carrying out this raid.'

The gang has made a lucrative business out of targeting museums, country estates, auction rooms, galleries and collectors for rhino horns.

Illegal dealers can sell the horns for up to £39,000-a-kilo on the black market.

In Asia rhino horn is prized in traditional medicine despite serious health risks from the arsenic used to preserve older specimens.

There have been a spate of thefts in recent years. One gang targeted a special storage unit used by the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin last year, escaping with four horns, which had been removed from the public eye for fear of thieves striking.

Policing agency Europol issued a threat notice relating to an Irish traveller gang, dubbed the Rathkeale Rovers. The organisation believes the gang are behind a string of similar robberies across Europe.

Gardai officers are scouring CCTV recovered from the Flatley mansion as part of their investigation.

The Lord of the Dance creator has come under increasing criticism from animal rights campaigners, incensed that Mr Flatley would have an item, which has connotations of cruelty, on display at his home.

Activist group Aran, said in an open letter: 'Whilst I am sure the 
break-in was traumatic and stressful on you and your family’s part, has 
it set in or even occurred to you that neither you nor those who stole 
the horn are the rightful owners?

'The animals are literally on the brink of being wiped off the face of the planet.'

Aran went on to suggest that if the horn is recovered, Mr Flatley should hand the item over to them to allow them to destroy it.

Castlehyde was bought by Mr Flatley in 1999. The 19th century castle was the ancestral home of Ireland's first president Douglas Hyde.

The star's website reveals the home stands in 150 acres of pasture and woodland and is worth an estimated 100 million euros.
