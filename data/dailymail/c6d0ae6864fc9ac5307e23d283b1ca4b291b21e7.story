Miss Alabama was in New York City today rubbing shoulders with the owner of the beauty pageant that started her rapid rise to fame - Donald Trump.

Katherine Webb, who became an almost household name when an ESPN announcer drooled over her as she appeared on camera in the BCS Championship game this month, announced on Twitter that she had met with the real estate mogul at his Manhattan office.

'Great time with @realDonaldTrump today. Showing some of his goodies laying around in his office!' she wrote, as she shared a photo of herself and a beaming Trump.

The 66-year-old also boasted of the encounter with the bombshell, who won the crown for Alabama last year and went on to finish in the top 10 of the Miss U.S.A. competition.

He uploaded a photo of the pair on Facebook, with the caption 'Miss Alabama @_KatherineWebb stopped by to say hello today.'

Webb's career is going from strength to strength after ESPN's cameras lingered on her during the Crimson Tide's rout of Notre 
Dame on January 7 and announcer Brent Musburger commented on her looks to the 
extent that the network had to offer an apology to viewers.

She tweeted that the Big Apple trip was to meet clients.

'Mtngs all day with clients in the concrete jungle! #NYC Hanging with my cool agents from New York Model MGNT,' she wrote today, adding, '..meeting @realDonaldTrump next!'

The catch up comes after Trump, who co-owns the Miss Universe Organization, took to Twitter the day after the game to 
say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA 
Pageant - also sparking rumors she might appear on his show, Celebrity 
Apprentice.

'We
are proud of her,' he wrote, adding of her Alabama star quarterback 
boyfriend AJ McCarron: 'What a great couple... Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron. They 
are both winners.'

But work on Trump's TV shows is not the only job offer she's received.

It was revealed yesterday that the 23-year-old will be back in front of the cameras ahead of the NFL's title game, serving as a correspondent for 'Inside Edition.'

The gig is in the lead up to next month's Super Bowl in New Orleans.

Webb calls the temporary job at 'inside Edition' 'an honor and a dream come true.'

She
said she'd 'give fans an insider's look at what goes on as the teams 
prepare to battle and as the fans get ready to cheer on their 
favorites.'

The show 
said on Wednesday that she'll start work January 28. 'Inside Edition' is
syndicated by CBS Television Distribution but not part of CBS' coverage
of the Super Bowl, which Webb won't be involved with.

Oops: Miss Webb hastily deleted her tweet about the magazine shoot - but it was retweeted by fans

A
week ago, the beauty queen let slip on Twitter that she is also set to 
feature in Sports Illustrated, sparking speculation she could be 
appearing in the coveted swimsuit edition.

'It's official...shooting with Sports Illustrated! #Blessed,' she tweeted, before hastily deleting the post.

If
she does feature in the swimsuit edition, she would join an impressive 
list of supermodels including Elle Macpherson, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, 
Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell.

And judging Miss U.S.A is not the only new job offer she has received since the football game.

The high-profile projects come despite Webb previously shunning interviews following her appearance in the stands on January 7.

Webb told TMZ that
she cancelled eight interviews scheduled for last Thursday because she is 
concerned her relationship with McCarron will simply be seen as a 
'celebrity status' thing.

'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.'

Who's that girl? Miss Webb, quickly became an internet sensation after appearing on camera on Jan. 7

Focus: Miss Alabama Katherine Webb has cancelled interviews so that her relationship with Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron is viewed as sincere, rather than as a celebrity stunt

She insisted that McCarron had not 
asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that 
he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend.

The
website had reported that the quarterback was unhappy that media 
outlets were ignoring his spectacular win over Notre Dame last Monday, and
giving coverage to her instead.

But
other sources said the sports star just wanted to keep his private life
out of the public eye, and wants his team's accomplishments to be 
recognised instead.

Webb became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Musburger.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you 
get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 
'What a beautiful woman.'

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If
you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw
it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married
to his wife Arlene for 50 years.

With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize the following day.

'We
always try to capture interesting
storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss 
Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test.
However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far
and Brent understands that.'

But the reigning Miss Alabama simply said she was 'flattered' by their remarks.Â 

'If he had said something along the 
lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, 
that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show after the game.

'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.'

But as well as Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger.

Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed'

'On
one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' 
he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what 
that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I 
think they need to give Brent a break.'

Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening.

And ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Trump told Page Six.

'She
was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting 
thousands and thousands of calls. Katherine has to stay grounded now 
that she's become a big star.'

Webb
was in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was 
drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and 
calls, but to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise.

'I know she's good looking,' McCarron 
said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I 
guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with
me.'

Star player: McCarron threw four touchdown passes and finished with 264 yards through the air

Webb, who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top 10 in the Miss USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

McCarron and Webb met over Twitter 
when a friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman
went to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Webb ended her 
reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 at the game to win their third college football title in four years.

McCarron threw four touchdown passes 
and finished with 264 yards through the air, while running back Eddie 
Lacy and receiver Amari Cooper had two scores each.
