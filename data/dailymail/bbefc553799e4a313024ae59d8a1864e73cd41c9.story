Attacker: Ajit Sekhon, pictured, beat his own son and wife with a cereal bowl and heavy ornaments, leaving them seriously hurt

An abusive father attacked his own son - and almost killer his wheelchair user wife - in a row over watching Emmerdale.

Ajit Sekhon, 59, was watching the soap over breakfast with his wife Manjit and son Paul, 32, but flew into a violent rage when the picture cut out.

He battered his son, who had been adjusting the aerial to fix the television, with a metal cereal bowl before trying to strangle him.

Mrs Sekhon managed to escape the attack to raise the alarm, but when she came back her husband turned on her, beating her with a heavy ornament, pouring burning liquid on her and even biting her fingers.

He used a heavy ornament to attack her head, causing significant injuries to her scalp.

Sekhon was found standing over his unconscious wife - whom he had beaten and abused for years - in his blood-spattered home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

He was jailed for sixteen and a half years after admitting two counts of grievous bodily harm against his family members at Sheffield Crown Court.

Sentencing him at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Julian Goose said: 'It was a sustained attack on both of them with repeated blows when they were defenceless.'

Kirstie Watson, prosecuting, explained that Mrs Sekhon, who had been married to her Sikh husband for 38 years, had missed an episode of Emmerdale and wanted to catch up over breakfast.

She was watching the show with her son Paul when her husband came into the lounge and got two breakfast bowls for them.

'There was a problem with the reception and Paul tried to improve the picture,' said Miss Watson.

'Suddenly and without any warning the defendant jumped up and with his metal cereal bowl began to hit Paul about the head,' she said.

The prosecutor described how he fell onto his mother, who has mobility problems and uses a wheelchair, as she sat on the sofa.

Sekhon repeatedly hit his son with the bowl on the head and arms as his mother screamed 'you are going to kill him, you are going to kill him.'

Sekhon then began strangling Paul, who nearly passed out. He then picked up a sharp-edged bracelet and began hitting his blood-soaked son with it on his arms and body before Mrs Sekhon escape through the a patio doors and raised the alarm.

When she returned shortly afterwards her husband was still brutally attacking her son on his legs. But he managed to escape, leading his father to turn on Mrs Sekhon.

Sentenced: Sekhon was given a sixteen-and-a-half-year prison term

He turned to his wife, grabbed her by the hair, pinned her face down on the floor and said: 'I’m going to kill you now you have let that bastard go.' He struck her repeatedly about the head with a heavy ornament and sat on her as she was face down.

Miss Watson said at one point she pretended to be dead but when she moved her husband began beating her again. He bit one of her fingers and she felt he was trying to burn her as some liquid was poured over her.

When the police arrived Sekhon was stood over his unconscious wife who was still on the floor and he then stopped the attack and went to wash his hands.

Officers said Sekhon could only stare at them when they arrived - and they had to use a Taser to restrain him.

Miss Watson said: 'The police and paramedics found a scene of complete devastation. There was blood all over the room, on the walls, on the floor and on the sofa.'

Mrs Sekhon was rushed to hospital where she needed emergency treatment to survive.

She has been left scarred for life and has had three operations on her badly damaged scalp and suffered injuries to her head, arms and hands and had broken fingers.

Her son had cuts to his head, arms and hands as well as broken fingers.

The court heard Sekhon had been controlling and abusive to his wife from the start of their marriage, both verbally and physically.

He broke her arm only a week after she had a caesarean birth and was also violent towards his children, one of whom ran away from home in fear of him.

Sekhon was effectively his wife’s carer on October 18 last year when the attack took place. She said in a victim impact statement that she still bears the mental scars, is scared to be alone and her road to recovery 'will be a long one.'

She said: 'I consider the arrival of the officers saved my life.'

Her son Paul had to take time off from his work as a carer and was now his mother’s main support. 'I don’t understand why my father acted as he did,' he said.

In mitigation Nawaz Hussain said the attack was not pre-meditated. He said: 'It was a normal family gathering and what came afterwards was all the more horrifying. It was a horrific loss of temper and self-control.'

He had clearly failed in his role as a 'husband and father' and when accounts of the incident were given to him he was 'sickened' as he remembered little of it.

'He will have no family on his release from prison and will not seek to contact them', said Mr Hussain.

'He may well see his final days in prison.

'He will have to live with the horror he has inflicted on his family to his last days.'

Judge Goose said: 'An argument developed, the cause is irrelevant but you lost your temper and began to attack Paul in a sustained and violent attack whilst your wife begged you to stop.'

He said Paul was defenceless as he was repeatedly struck with the bowl and then he was nearly strangled.

The judge went on: 'You knew your wife was vulnerable and had mobility problems and required a wheelchair yet still you struck her repeatedly on the head.

'You threatened to kill her and carried on a sustained attack with a heavy object. It was feared she might not survive due to the amount of blood she lost.'
