West Bromwich Albion chairman Jeremy Peace is considering his options on head coach Alan Irvine, but the club is not expected to make an announcement on Monday.

Irvine came in for fierce criticism from Albion fans at the end of the 2-0 loss to Stoke City and could pay with his job following a run of seven defeats in nine matches.

The Scot is still scheduled to face the media on Tuesday afternoon, however, in a press conference ahead of the New Year’s Day clash with West Ham.

Peace has acted decisively in the past when results have been in decline and is understood to be concerned at the club’s slide down the table to one point above the relegation places.

There has been a desire, though, to make what was a bold decision last summer work if possible. Irvine, while under huge pressure, still retains support from players for his training methods and works fastidiously within West Brom’s structure as head coach.  

But a vocal number of supporters have never been in favour of an individual who was sacked from Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday in his two previous managerial roles – and that could ultimately tip the balance.

Travelling fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and ‘Sacked in the morning’ at Irvine during the defeat at the Britannia.

Peace will mull over whether there is a candidate available who would meet the club’s standards. Tim Sherwood, who came close to the job last summer, is likely to emerge once again. 

Irvine's team have been on a bad run and they were beaten 2-0 by Stoke in the Premier League on Sunday

Irvine retains the support of his players and defender Joleon Lescott insisted he has their full backing despite their desperate run.

'Yes, of course, and that has never, ever been in question,' said Lescott, who worked with Irvine at Everton.

'It's wrong that he is under pressure because it is the players out there who have put in performances like that and are not getting results.

'They (the West Brom fans) are entitled to their opinion. Some of it is harsh, but they paid their money and travelled up to Stoke, so they are entitled to their opinion.

'But hopefully they understand we are trying, and we are behind the manager and want to win games.'
