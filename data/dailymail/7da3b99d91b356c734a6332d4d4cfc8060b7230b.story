A sprawling Hamptons 'castle' belonging to the family of billionaire Hard Rock Cafe mogul Peter Morton was completely destroyed by fire on Wednesday.

The blaze broke out at the oceanfront East Hampton Village mansion in the early afternoon, with fire crews spending hours putting out the flames, which were fanned by strong winds.

While the cause of the fire remains unclear, crews began knocking what was left of the house down at 5pm, and by Thursday morning there was nothing but the burnt out shell of the former estate. 

The home, according to Page Six, is owned by Morton and his family, but, fortunately no one was home at the time.

The property was last appraised in 2008 for $21.5 million.

Leveled: The 10-bedroom Hamptons home owned by Peter Morton (right) was completely destroyed by the fire. Investigators will now look into what caused the blaze. No one except workers and builders were at the property at the time, according to reports 

A source told The New York Post column: 'Nobody was hurt in the fire, the only people who were there were the builders, a construction company, who were working on the property.'

'It is the Morton family house, he shares it with his three children. Peter wasn’t at the house when the fire started, he is in LA,' the source added.

The house, which has 10 bedrooms, is located at 57 West End Road near Georgica Pond.

Morton paid $10 million for the house in 1998, according to reports. 

Firefighters said the road was too narrow for the tankers to get through and a dump tank was stationed at the corner of Lily Pond Lane and West End Road to help pump water, 27 East reported today.

Ambulances were also seen at the scene on standby, prepared for anyone who might have been injured.  

Attorney Errol Margolin, who represents Morton, told 27East.com that the summer home was 'a total loss.'

'It sounds like it was a horrible accident,' Margolin said. 

'This is [Mr. Morton's] East Hampton residence. He loves his house … now he doesn't have a house.'

The home itself was valued somewhere between $6 and $7million

It is believed that Morton had passed the home down to one of his children some time in 2008 or 2009
