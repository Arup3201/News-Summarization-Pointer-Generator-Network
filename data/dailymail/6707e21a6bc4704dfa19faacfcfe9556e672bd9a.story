A new sex club which sparked outrage after opening in a quiet city suburb without planning permission has been ordered to close by council chiefs.

The 'kinky hotel', called Club Kiss, is situated in a neighbourhood where many residents are pensioners or young families.

It caused outrage when it opened in a former NHS rehabilitation centre in Southampton, Hampshire.

The property has been reinvented by owner Martin Millar, who has installed two 'superbly equipped dungeons' and a 'kinky room'.

The building, named Milton House, also features five themed 'playrooms', a 'UV room' and a 'mirror room'.

But a planning committee at Southampton City Council today unanimously refused an application for retrospective planning permission.

They had received a 1,000 name petition and 150 letters of objections from neighbouring residents.

A planning application report said the change of use had the potential to 'cause harm to the residential amenities and character of the area.'

It recommended the hotel's operations 'should cease as soon as possible'.

Despite the ruling, ward councillor Warwick Payne admitted it could be months before the hotel is shut down as Mr Millar said he plans to appeal.

Councillor Payne, who is also the city's leisure boss, said: 'This is a vital decision and signifies residents have won the battle and gone a long way towards winning the war.

'If the application is taken to the planning inspectorate this could rumble on for weeks if not months.

Unassuming: Club his boasts a dungeon, five themed 'playrooms', a 'UV room' and a 'mirror room'.

'But I would urge Mr Millar to find an alternative use for Milton House that residents are happy with, rather than going down that route.'

The venue hosted an opening event in September, called 'Couples and Singles Grand Opening Party'.

Running from 9pm until 2am, the party offered guests 'the perfect night for meeting other couples and single males/females'.

The new hotel has replaced the former JCT2 swingers club, which operated 20 minutes away in Calmore, Southampton.

That was ordered to close after planning inspectors agreed it was being run illegally as a business from a residential property.

And now Southampton City Council has vowed to 'fight tooth and nail' to make sure Club Kiss is also closed.

But, the new venue's website is already boasting a stacked programme of events throughout November and December.

'We are simply opening a hotel which is also open to those who enjoy an alternative lifestyle.'

Mr Millar, 37, said: 'I understand some local residents are unhappy about the arrival of my venue in the area and they are fully entitled to their opinions.

'We are simply opening a hotel which is also open to those who enjoy an alternative lifestyle.

'The events we will be holding do not attract large numbers of people, so will not cause any traffic or parking problems.

'The average age of those attending will be 40-plus - it is not going to be youngsters who may get drunk and be too noisy.

'I will stress to all our guests that at all times they should respect the privacy of our neighbours, especially when leaving the venue.'

He added: 'Naturally I am disappointed with the result of the hearing but it did not come as a big surprise to me.

'I fully intend to appeal against the decision.'
