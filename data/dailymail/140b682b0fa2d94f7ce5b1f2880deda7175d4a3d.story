Charlie Brooker, 26, (pictured) was today jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to assault and making threats to kill - he was described by police as a 'danger to women'

A stalker who bombarded a woman with 25,000 threatening texts and forced her to drive him around while screaming abuse at her has today been jailed.

Charlie Brooker, 26, who has a long history of convictions for violence and harassment, called his victim constantly on both her personal and work phones on top of sending the deluge of text messages.

His campaign of abuse escalated on May 17 when Brooker forced the woman to drive him around in circles before finally stopping at a shop in Crayford, in Bexley, East London.

A court heard while there the woman asked the shopkeeper to call the police because she thought Brooker was going to kill her. 

He then dragged her outside and slammed her up against the side of a delivery van.

Brooker, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to assault and making threats to kill at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, and was today jailed for 18 months.

The court also heard Brooker threatened to head butt a female police officer while in custody.

The court heard even when police officers answered his calls on her behalf, Brooker threatened to 'wring her neck'.

He also told his victim he would slit her throat and harm members of her family.

After his arrest detectives from Kent Police downloaded 5,000 pages of text messages from Brooker to his victim, averaging about five texts per page.

Detective Constable Becky Saunders, of Kent Police, said: 'Charlie Brooker is a violent offender with 44 previous convictions, most of which in recent years are for violence and harassment.

'He was in breach of a suspended sentence when committing these most recent offences and therefore now serves this term.

'Brooker is a danger to women and belongs behind bars where he can cause them no harm and where they are free from his barrage of abuse.'
