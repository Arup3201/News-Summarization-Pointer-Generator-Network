In a trip that one journalist described as a 'floating group therapy' session, more than 100 victims, their families and first responders from last year's tragic bombing at the Boston Marathon have just returned from a trip to southern France where they celebrated some of the incredible bonds that were created by the tragedy.

In all, 114 survivors, family members and emergency responders were given an all-expenses-paid cruise through the south of France where they made stops to drink wine and explore the culture as they briefly set aside the nightmare that was occurred on April 15, 2013, when two brothers detonated two explosives near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

'This has been the largest gathering of the survivors since the 
bombing,' Casey Sherman, a crime writer who is writing a book about the bombing with journalist Dave Wedge, told FoxNews from Avignon, France last month. 'People have 
come together at different events marking the bombing, but they haven’t 
had a chance to sit down, relax and just talk to each other.'

Sherman and Wedge have recently published an article about the trip in Esquire magazine. The article goes in-depth about the experience these survivors had together during both the bombing and the trip to France.

The trip was paid for by Boston-based Vantage Deluxe World Travel, the same company that hosted similar getaways for wounded war veterans in the months leading up to the Boston bombing.

Challenges: Bauman - like many of the survivors - face challenges as they attempt to re-learn how to do everyday tasks

The group includes many of the familiar faces from the tragedy - bombing survivor James Costello and nurse Krista 
D’Agostino, who are now engaged after falling in love while D'Agostino was helping Costello revocer at Massachusetts’ Spaulding 
Rehabilitation Hospital.

Also on the trip were survivor Jeff Bauman and hero Carlos Arredondo, who are seen in an iconic image of the terror in Boston the day of the bombing rushing Bauman to safety, famously holding the tourniquet that was keeping Bauman from bleeding out - Bauman lost both of his legs in the bombing.

Both Bauman and Arredondo were honored at Tuesday's State of the Union Address.

Also on the trip were many of the unknown survivors, like Lu and Ling Jun, who lost their daughter Lingzi in the attack.

Speaking through an interpreter, the Juns and Arredondo bonded on the trip and comforted each other through hugs and other gestures.

Dave Wedge also was on the trip. The book he is writing about the bombing with Sherman is set to be released later this year

By the end of the trip, the Juns invited Arredondo to their native China - an invitation he happily accepted.

'We hope that this vacation will give these Boston heroes a 
well-deserved break, and a chance to connect with other inspirational 
people who may understand the experiences they have gone through,' Kevin
 Wallace, chief operating officer of Vantage Deluxe World Travel, said 
in a statement. 'The south of France is one of our most popular 
destinations, so we felt this was a wonderful way for our company to 
show our support and express our pride in Boston’s tremendous spirit.'

Sherman and Wedge's book is titled Boston Strong. It's expected to be released later this year.
