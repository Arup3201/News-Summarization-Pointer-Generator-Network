Not many people would have the courage to return to the scene where they almost lost their life.

But Australian big-wave surfer Ryan Hipwood could not pass up the chance to take on the 7m-high tubes formed by a middle-of-the-ocean break dubbed The Right, off the coast of Perth.

And despite some failed attempts during the eight-hour long session, he walked away being able to say he conquered the wave.

Ryan Hipwood and other fellow big-wave surfers challenged The Right - which swells to about 7m - and walked away triumphant

The Right was the same location Hipwood almost drowned two years ago

The swell seen at The Right is similar in power to Tahiti's Teahupo'o - which is considered one of the deadliest breaks in the world.

In a new video, Hipwood and a few other daredevils are seen taking on the gigantic waves - at times failing - and some emerge triumphant like the Gold Coast surfer.

Speaking about this adventure, Hipwood told The Courier Mail that during the near-death experience, he was 'tossed around like a rag doll' and was held under, while white-water pounded him.

Deeply affected by the 2012 incident, Hipwood didn't return to the spot until recently. Footage has just surfaced showing the fearlessness of the big-wave surfers against the massive break.  

He said The Right was 'pound for pound' the heaviest wave in the world and instead of breaking left like the fearsome Teahupoo it, like its name suggests it breaks to the right.

'It probably only gets really good once or twice a year. It’s a spot where you need all the elements to come together,' he told The Courier Mail.

'My main goal was to try and make as many waves as possible to get my confidence back up.

'I pretty much made every one I took off on although I did see some crazy wipeouts, including one of the skis.'

Hipwood said he witnessed one of the locals burst his ear drum and hurt his ribs while surfing the wave.

He is making a name for himself over in the United States being the only Aussie surfer to feature in a new cable reality show that follows some of the world’s best big-wave surfers.

Hipwood is sponsored to chase and surf the biggest swells around the world, and hopes to compete in a new professional big wave tour.
