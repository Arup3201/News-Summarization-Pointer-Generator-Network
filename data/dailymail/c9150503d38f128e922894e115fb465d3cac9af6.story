Perez Hilton re-ignited his feud with Lady Gaga on Tuesday during an appearance on the Australian talk show Mornings in which he claimed she has been 'poisoned' by fame.

The 36-year-old celebrity blogger told show hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell his friendship with the 28-year-old superstar started to unravel after she got drunk and became upset with questions he asked her during an interview.

But Perez truly believes Gaga's fame was the main reason their friendship fell apart.

Feud origin: Perez Hilton appeared on the Mornings show on Tuesday and told about the origin of his public feud with former friend Lady Gaga

'Actually, all the drama went down in 
Australia in the summer of 2011,' the blogger, real name Mario 
Lavandeira Jr, told the hosts.

Perez said he was in Sydney hanging out with his then-friend and she was taking part in a special he was filming for television that included a cooking session with the singer.

'She proceeded to get obliterated drunk, drinking Jameson, and she was a surprisingly functioning drunk woman,' said Perez who was wearing a T-shirt that read 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content.'

Perez said he was sober and interviewing Gaga when she became upset over a question about her single Judas.

'The [question] framing made her real angry,' Perez recalled.

He followed that up with a question about her boyfriend and he claimed that further angered the Poker Face singer.

'The fact that I brought up her boyfriend made her livid and she stormed off the set and stopped the interview,' Perez said.

'No, I think it was fame that just poisoned her,' he said.

'She had an album Fame Monster, her second album, and she became consumed by that which she was fascinated about. You know, fame can be a very deadly drug and it has damaged her personally,' he said.

He also said he no interest in rekindling their friendship.

'I have zero interest. I don't want to be her friend. I don't need friends like that in my life,' he said.

He also blasted her latest artistic efforts.

'I think she has unfortunately become a victim of this character she created. Instead of being an artist she became this freak and this cartoon character and so unrelateable to people,' Perez said.

The public feud between the two hit its height last August when Gaga released a 445-word statement urging her fans to stop sending death threats to her haters.

The online storm broke after a fan alerted Gaga about a Perez sighting in her New York apartment building.

'STAY AWAY FROM ME + MY FAMILY YOU ARE SICK TRYING TO RENT AN APARTMENT IN MY BUILDING TO STALK ME. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!' the artist formerly known as Stefani Germanotta tweeted.

Perez followed that up with a 352-word posting on his popular website titled 'A Statement On LadyGaGa's Lies'.

Gaga asked her fans to stand down and instead channel their anger through art.
