A couple has been pulled before a judge after they refused to let their eight-year-old daughter undergo chemotherapy for a brain tumour, opting for alternative treatment instead.

Sarah Parisian, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, had 90 per cent of the cancerous tumour removed last December and underwent a cycle of chemotherapy - but endured painful suffering, her parents said.

When they told doctors they would not allow her to go through it again, Jon and Karen Parisian were reported to Child Protection Services and ordered into court.

Court battle: The parents of Sarah Parisian, 8, refused to allow their daughter to undergo chemotherapy for a brain tumour and wanted to opt for other treatments instead

There, the family was told if they did not work on a treatment plan with doctors, Sarah would be taken from them.

This week, the family and physicians reached a compromise so she will undergo less treatment that doctors hope will still be effective - but the family is bitter about the pressure.

'Parents should have freedom,' Sarah's mother Karen told the Brainerd Dispatch.

Sarah underwent the operation to 
remove the tumour last December. The family sought a treatment that 
would yield fewer side effects, and chose proton therapy, which could 
only be done in Chicago.

After the treatment they stayed in Illinois 
for seven weeks, where Sarah suffered from exhaustion, nausea, a sore throat, hair and weight loss, her mother told WCCO.

'The week that we started chemo she was sleeping 22 hours a day,' said Karen, who has another daughter, 11-year-old Savannah, with her husband.

Orders: Doctors contacted Child Protective Services and the Parisians, pictured with Sarah and their oldest daughter, were ordered to make a compromise in court - otherwise Sarah would be taken from them

Pain: They argued that after one cycle of chemo she suffered weight loss, illness and slept for 22 hours a day

Struggle: Doctors said that every day her parents withheld treatment, Sarah's survival was compromised

'She is very sick from the standard 
treatment so we wanted to explore an option of modifying the treatment 
so that it would be more appropriate for Sarah.'

But doctors argued the child's chances of survival worsened each day she was not treated.

'So in order to modify her treatment we had to go in front of a judge and fortunately we seem to be working this out,' Karen, a financial adviser, added.

Dr. Kevin Conners, an integrative cancer specialist, told WCCO a compromise could be reached to 'do what's best for the patient'.

'Let's take her case as an individual case and... look at her as an individual what she can tolerate what other therapies added to a traditional approach is going to be best for her,' he said.

The youngster will now stay at home but undergo some treatment that will not 'send her tipping over the edge,' Dr. Connors said.

The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office 
said that it respects the right of parents to make decisions for their 
children, but that the Parisians were not doing what was best for their 
child.

Moving forward: The court ordered Sarah (second left) to undergo less treatment and her parents agreed

Anger: But Karen Parisian, pictured talking to local reporters with her family, said she was frustrated she was not allowed to decide what was best for her daughter

While the family are happy to have 
reached a compromise that will benefit Sarah, Karen said she was annoyed
that she had not been able to make a decision she believed was best for
her daughter.

'As parents, you don’t have the right to choose the kind of treatment you want your child to have,' she said.

Sarah begins testing and treatment on Friday.

After Sarah was diagnosed with the brain tumour, her mother and older sister cut their hair in solidarity and donated it to Locks for Love, which makes hair pieces for cancer patients.

'I didn’t want her to have to go through it alone,' Karen said.
