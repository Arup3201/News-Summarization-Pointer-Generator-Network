Rather than splash out on a lavish white wedding, one couple from Kent decided to 'make do and mend' by taking inspiration from the 1940s.

Julie Parker, 54, and Andy Kennet, 44, celebrated their nuptials at the War and Peace Revival event in Folkestone.

The event is the largest gathering of 
military vehicles in the world and the area is decked out in 1940's decor.

Vintage: Julie Parker and Andy Kennet celebrated their nuptials at the War and Peace Revival in Kent

Dressed for the era: The bride wore a white lace dress while Andy appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence Royal Artillery uniform

Authentic experience: The guests were also asked to wear Forties-style clothes and eat food that would have been available at the time

The vintage festival is held every year and the World War Two fanatics knew it would be the perfect place for them to exchange vows.

The venue has a small replica village of a
 war town which includes a home front office, a police station, shops 
and a village green with tea room.

Julie and Andy could think of nowhere 
better for their big day, and invited 100 guests to their wedding, even stating it would be held in July 1941 on their invitations.

Mum-of-one Julie wore a white lace dress while Andy appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence Royal Artillery uniform.

Guest of honour: World War Two veteran Albert Figg, 96, joined the newly weds

Celebration and remembrance: The couple were delighted the veteran could attend

Now Mr and Mrs: Julie said, 'it was absolutely amazing. It was a very different wedding'

Their guests were asked to wear 1940s dress and to bring simple food, which would have only been available in the forties thanks to rationing, such as pickles and hams.

Former policewoman Julie and Andy, who is a technician who restores military vehicles, were married on the village green by a registrar who wore top hat and tails.

Julie said: 'It was absolutely amazing. It was a very different wedding. I wanted the whole atmosphere to take them back to that period.

'I scattered the simple sheet table clothes with war leaflets and made jam jar candles so everything was of the time.

'It was the best day ever. As soon as Andy proposed to me we knew we would get married there. Every year we went and said someone should get married here but at the time we never thought it would be us.

Perfect venue: The couple have long been fans of the annual War and Peace Revival

Pastime: The bride and groom sign the register in a 1940s memorabilia decked room

'I had a lot of people texting me before the event asking what they should wear and worrying about it but on the day everyone just looked fantastic.'

The couple also hired a 20-piece jazz band who played into the night as guests sat around candle-lit tables in a canvas marquee.

Also attending the event was Albert Figg, 96, a World War Two veteran who was invited as a guest of honour.

Andy said: 'There was no better place to get married than the show I've been going to for the past 10 years.

'We both wanted to remember the men that fought for our country and hoped our guests would appreciate the history of the wars that are gradually fading from people's memories.

'The icing on the cake was seeing Albert Figg a man I have great respect for.'
