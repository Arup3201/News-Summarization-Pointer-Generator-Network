This is the moment a 15-year-old girl trying to jump a ticket barrier is picked up and slammed on the floor head-first by an officer.

CCTV footage in Flinders Street Station, Melbourne, Australia, captured the girl and a friend slipping through a side gate before Metro inspectors race after them and grab them by the clothes.

But the situation escalates when the girl turns to slap one of the men in the face.

Outrage: Politicians blasted the July 31 incident in Melbourne which saw a 15-year-old girl hurled to the floor

He grabs her feet and plunges her to the floor before piling on top of her.

The encounter on July 31 this year has sparked outrage with politicians blasting it as 'absolutely brutal and unnecessary treatment'.

And following an investigation, the girl has been charged with assault as the officers were deemed to be 'acted in accordance with company policy'.

'At one stage there was three men on top of the one 15-year-old girl, which was just completely ridiculous,' witness Nick Manual told ABC News.

Sneaking past: The girl and a friend were seen on CCTV slipping through a gate in Flinders Street station

Escalates: After the girl slapped one of the officers, all three close in forcefully and one goes for her feet

Commotion: Her friend and passers-by are seen to be shouting as the girl lies on the floor after the encounter

'She was yelling that she couldn't breathe.'

Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber, said the footage, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, 'wouldn't even be allowed on a rugby field', The Age newspaper reports.

Mr Barber said: 'This sort of violence ... should never have been used against a slight, 15-year-old female.

'The effect could have been fatal, or even more likely, the girl could have been paralysed for life.

'Why did they pick her up, turn her upside down and drop her on her head? Because they could. They were big blokes, she was a tiny woman.'

Capture: The officer, dressed down, lunges to grab the girl as she makes her way through the side gate

The moment: Politicians have blasted the moment the officer picked the girl up as 'unnecessary'

In a leaked memo, investigating officer Alan Gosland, wrote: 'Spoke to Victoria Police Sergeant Craig Tepper who advises that they are not looking into any action by the officers as they have not received a complaint about them. They are however charging the two females with assault on the officers. Cheers.'

The officer in the footage stated his actions were to stop the girl escaping after 'verbal reasoning ... to de-escalate the situation initially' had failed.

In a compulsory Use of Force Incident Form, he wrote: 'Assaulted by the offender, punched in the face and bitten on left upper thigh when told to loosen hold due to offender saying she couldnâ€™t breathe.'

Public Transport Minister Terry Mulder told The Age he was 'really concerned' by the footage and the incident would be investigated.
