Michael McIntyre has said he is ‘heartbroken’ after his step-mother revealed his father committed suicide.

The comedian, 38, said he disapproved of disclosing the ‘painful and personal’ information, which has been kept secret for more than 20 years.

McIntyre was brought up believing his father Cameron had died of a heart attack, and only discovered that he had killed himself four years ago.

His father, who was also a comedian and worked for four years on the Kenny Everett Show, suffered from depression after a downturn in his career.

He shot himself in the head in the utility room of a Hollywood apartment block in 1993, aged 55.

His widow Holly, now 58, decided to shield the truth from McIntyre, who was only 17 at the time, and his 15-year-old sister Lucy.

But yesterday, she revealed that she was forced to tell her two step-children the truth in 2010 after McIntyre was invited to take part in a BBC series probing his background. She feared his death certificate would be found, revealing the real cause of death.

She said: ‘That was the hardest phone call of my life. I was shaking when I told him. For years I kept this terrible secret and finally I was sharing it.

‘I said, “Michael, your father didn’t have a heart attack. He killed himself.”

‘There was a paralysed silence on the other end of the line. He was crushed. How are you supposed to react to news like that?

‘He just said, “Oh my God, Oh my God… are you sure?”’

Mrs McIntyre said she had found a suicide note from her husband apologising for what he had done and asking her to protect the children.

In the years after his death, her stepson Michael left Edinburgh University to become a stand-up comedian and found worldwide success.

In his autobiography, Life And Laughing published in 2010, he detailed his father’s heart attack and said that his death was his inspiration to succeed.

But that year he was approached by the BBC’s genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, and she realised she would have to tell him the truth.

McIntyre said: ‘I’m heartbroken my stepmother has chosen to share painful and personal information publicly’

Cameron McIntyre’s death certificate is freely available in US public records, and clearly states he died of a ‘self-inflicted gunshot wound to head’.

His widow told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Michael grew up believing his dad went out for his morning walk and suffered a heart attack at the side of the road.

‘I didn’t think the children needed the burden of growing up under the shadow of a parent committing suicide.

‘If Michael hadn’t become famous the truth would never have come out because I wouldn’t have told anyone.

‘But he emailed me and said he would be doing this show and could I help the BBC with information about his daddy.

‘I knew the researchers would find the death certificate because it is a matter of public record. I had to come clean.’

Cameron killed himself after work began to dry up and the family had to give up their lifestyle of lavish homes, nice cars and private school for the children.

He had been pinning his hopes on getting a commission for a series with the BBC, but after making a pilot episode the corporation decided not to run with it.

He wrote in his suicide note: ‘I cannot tell you what to say to the children, but I know you will make the right decision. My instinct is to shield them if you can. I’m guessing that will be yours, too.’

In the wide-ranging interview, she also told how much her step-son values money after watching his father lose all of his.

She also revealed she has recently been on bad terms with the comedian, after several rows involving her two children with McIntyre’s father, Georgina, now 22, and son Billy, 28.

Georgina told the newspaper: ‘I only found out the truth about the suicide last year. I thought with me being the youngest, he might care to comfort me and build a bond.

‘But he’s not interested. I feel abandoned by him.’
