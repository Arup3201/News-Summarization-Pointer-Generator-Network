Mary Adams was left with a fractured spine after being thrown against the wall by the automatic door

An 80-year-old woman was left with a fractured spine after being thrown 7ft backwards by an automatic door at Marks & Spencer, she claims. 

Mary Adams had been food shopping at the store in Birmingham when she became caught in the doors at the rear exit. 

The pensioner says she was catapulted 7ft when they reopened, throwing her to the ground and causing her to lose consciousness. 

The divorcee later discovered her ribs, back and head had been bruised. 

An MRI scan revealed she had fractured her spine, though doctors were not able to tell how old the break was.  

'I was just popping in to the store to get some ready meals for the week ahead,' she said. 

'I had a mooch around and was going through the automatic rear door which was open and it literally just shut on me. 

'It was a folding door that trapped me and then I was thrown into a wall seven feet away as they reopened.

'I remember being thrown through the air, sliding down the wall and hitting my head and then waking up on the steps in a lot of pain.

'I was unconscious for a few minutes. My head, neck and rib cage were all bruised.

'I went back to measure afterwards and it threw me at least seven feet to the steps outside.

'I was literally catapulted through the air before I smashed off this wall and cracked my head on the steps.

'It was terrifying.' 

Staff at the store rushed to the woman's aid, propping her head up on a pillow before taking her for a coffee. 

An incident report said she was 'unhurt' except from having a sore head from where she crashed against the floor. 

The company compensated her with a bunch of flowers and a £20 discount voucher.

But Ms Adams, who lives alone,  feels she is entitled to more.

'I thought M&S were a great company. 

'I thought they would look after me and at least call to see how I was.

'But after a first call when I told them I was feeling very groggy, no-one called back.

Ms Adams was sent flowers and given a discount voucher for the store in Birmingham City Centre (pictured) 

'Then they sent me a letter saying they were sorry I had fallen. It’s ridiculous to say that I had a fall when it was their doors that trapped me and flung me across the floor.' 

The pensioner is now appealing for a woman who rushed to help her and tried to call an ambulance to come forward, so she can continue legal action against the major company.

A spokesman for M&S said: 'We are sorry Mrs Adams was disappointed by her experience in our store.

'The safety of our customers is our top priority and an engineer immediately inspected the doors and no fault was found.'
