A rough and tumble Cincinnati Reds baseball star who killed himself after years of mental instability suffered from trauma-induced brain disease, researchers revealed Sunday.

The Boston University School of Medicine announced that former fan favorite Ryan Freel, 36, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, making him the first major league baseball player diagnoses with the illness.

The concussion prone father of three, who was forced into early retirement in 2009 after eight seasons of repeated head and body injuries, died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 2012 and researchers diagnosed him after running post-mortem tests.

Suffered: Ryan Freel, who suffered from mental issues and drug problems in the years leading to his 2012 suicide, suffered from concussion-related  degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy

Freel is now the first MLB star diagnosed with CTE, a disease that has increasingly become a plague to former pro football players.

‘The real important issue is that he hit his head multiple times--small hits, big hits, in baseball and outside of baseball,’ Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University, told CNN.

Freel showed no fear as he ran into walls, hurtled into the seats and crashed into other players trying to make catches. His jarring, diving grabs often made the highlight reels, and he was praised by those he played with and against for always having a dirt-stained uniform.

Rough and tumble: Freel became known during his 8 season career for his daring dives and cringe-inducing tumbles on the field. He suffered at least 10 concussions as a major leaguer

In May of 2007, he was in center field when he collided with right fielder Norris Hopper's elbow on—an injury that caused Freel to be taken off the field in an ambulance.

Freel sustained a concussion that caused headaches and an impaired memory, and he didn't return until early July. It was one of ten concussions Freel once said he suffered in total while a major leaguer.CTE is a progressive disease linked to multiple concussions. It has made headlines in recent years with the deaths of some former professional athletes, and lawsuits filed against the NFL by others worried about the still unclear toll of a sport that can bring repeated blows to the head. Symptoms include memory problems, behavior changes including aggression, and eventually dementia.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the progressive accumulation of a protein called tau in nerve cells within certain regions of the brain.

The effects of protein accumulation are often seen amongst boxers and football players, or anyone who's suffered multiple head trauma - and it often disturbs brain function.

Freel is the first pro baseball player, a sport less associated with concussions, to be diagnosed with the disease.

'Baseball is just as dangerous,' said Freel's mother.

Freel suffered from depression and alcohol and drug abuse problems in the years leading to his death, reports CNN.

Freel raised more than a few eyebrows in 2006 when he was quoted by the Dayton Daily News as saying he had an imaginary friend, Farney.

‘He's a little guy who lives in my head who talks to me and I talk to him,’ Freel said. ‘Everybody thinks I talk to myself, so I tell 'em I'm talking to Farney.’

He was arrested in northern Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, in April 2005 and was charged with drunken driving, careless driving and driving with an open container in a motor vehicle. A month later, he pleaded guilty. 

More common in football: Former Kansas City Chiefs' linebacker Jovan Belcher's body was exhumed Friday, more than a year after he killed his girlfriend and himself so that his brain can be examined for signs of the degenerative condition linked to repeated concussions

The NFL has reached a $765 million settlement in August over concussion-related brain injuries among its 18,000 retired players, agreeing to compensate victims, pay for medical exams and underwrite research. Plaintiffs included Junior Seau (pictured here with George W Bush), who suffered from CTE

The following January, he was arrested at a pool hall in Tampa, Fla., and charged with disorderly intoxication, a misdemeanor. Prosecutors settled the case by having Freel do community service.

And months before his death, Freel and his wife of 11 years were divorced.

‘It provides some solace that there is a reason now for Ryan having done what he did,’ Freel’s stepfather Clark Vargas told CNN. ‘Knowing that he's been suffering for 11 years and that CTE is a progressive disease, it gives explanation (for) some of the irrational things that he may have done. You know, he had a reason.’

Freel’s mother Norma Vargas echoed her husband’s sentiment and hopes the revelation their father was suffering from a disease might cushion the blow for Freel’s three bereaved daughters.

‘He's gone no matter what,’ Norma Vargas said. ‘But I want that closure for his daughters.’
