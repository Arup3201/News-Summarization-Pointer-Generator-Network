Catherine Mayer's book (pictured) is set to be released next Thursday

A picture of one of the world’s ‘least understood figures’ emerges in a new biography of Prince Charles.

It quotes actress Emma Thompson, a close friend, as saying: ‘We talk a lot about the guilt of privilege. Sometimes I think he’s driven by guilt.’

It describes Charles as a prince who will ‘never be remote and silent like his mother’ and is driven to improve the human condition. He’s quoted as saying: ‘I want to raise aspirations and recreate hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation.’

Author Catherine Mayer talks of a prince who ‘rarely recognises his own achievements’ and is described by one of his inner circle as ‘a glass-half-empty man’, a ‘Prince of Wails’.

Another close figure talks of Charles’s temper. ‘The royal rage, I call it. Here comes the royal rage.’

Ms Mayer discovered a man whose despondency, she said, ‘has been profound’ at the darkest moments in his life.

Prince Charles confided to her: ‘Each thing I did, you had to meet another lot of people who have all sorts of views of you beforehand, all sorts of prejudices.’

The private Charles, however, may have a luxury lifestyle but, says former private secretary Clive Alderton: ‘When you are having tea with him, (he) gets any leftovers wrapped up and brought back for his next meal, and the next one. I’ve rarely met someone who is so frugal, not in the sense of meanness but an absolute allergy to waste, and in particular waste of food.’

Nor is this frugality confined to his eating habits.

In the biography, Ms Mayer (editor at large for Time magazine) reveals how, one hot summer, he syphoned dirty water through a pipe from his bath at St James’s Palace onto his garden below.

Of course, there is, as ever, a fundamental contradiction in such behaviour.

The book says: ‘He lives high on the hog . . . but combines the showiness of royal life — the banquets, the acreage of cut flowers, retinues larger than most other family members employ — with a frugality absorbed from his parents and from the austere schooling at Gordonstoun, and more consciously informed by his environmental concerns.’

Ms Mayer describes him wanting to be King as ‘the least of his ambitions’ but, confusingly, goes on to say he is ‘gnawingly impatient’ to accede to the throne.

Yet he is said to ‘dread’ the death of his parents, and still mourns ‘with a startlingly raw grief’ his grandmother (the Queen Mother), his great-uncle Earl Mountbatten (murdered by the IRA) and his guru Sir Laurens van der Post.

On a lighter note, some of Charles’s staff refer to wealthy dinner guests who the Prince entertains in return for their donations to his worthy causes as ‘Bond villains’. And a member of his household at Clarence House reveals there is a competition there ‘to see how deep you can curtsey without falling over’.

Ben Elliot, Camilla’s nephew, describes Charles as warm and ‘extraordinarily tactile’. The Prince, we learn, made the tea at the family gathering after the funeral of Camilla’s adventurer brother Mark Shand last May.

Charles is revealed also to organise surprise parties for friends and people he admires — one of these being a joint 80th birthday party at Clarence House for the playwright Sir Ronald Harwood and the actress Dame Maggie Smith.

Extracts of the book, Charles: The Heart Of A King, have been released on Kindle in advance of publication next Thursday.

The publisher boasts that Ms Mayer’s work is ‘based on exclusive interviews with members of the Prince’s inner circle and underpinned by rare direct access to the Prince himself’. It is believed she has interviewed the Prince and more than 50 of his friends, family confidantes and staff.

Ms Mayer says her access to him included trailing him for six months, ‘struggling to keep up as he strode across muddy fields’, and she dined with him at Dumfries House in Scotland. The Prince’s cousin Tim Knatchbull (whose twin brother, Nicholas, was killed aged 14 by the same bomb that blew up Lord Mountbatten) describes Charles as ‘an expert mimic . . . a sort of Rory Bremner . . . ’

Although ‘fundamentally serious’, Charles is seen as a natural comic. One of his favourite gags involves instructions given to air passengers afraid of being marooned on a desert island.

The advice begins with them being told always to make sure they’ve got a cocktail shaker and the means of making a martini. The punch-line centres on the moment they start to mix the drink — ‘I can guarantee within a minute someone will jump out of a tree and say: “That’s not the proper way to mix a martini!” ’

Prince Charles shares a joke with Prince Harry. Charles is said to be a natural comic and he has a number of favourite gags

His delight in the absurd was witnessed at Prince Harry’s 13th birthday party, when he was ‘laughing uproariously while competing with Emma Thompson in a game in which players donned hats covered in Velcro to try to catch felt-covered balls’.

Incidentally, Ms Thompson is also quoted as saying that dancing with Charles was ‘better than sex’.

If Ms Mayer has the right birthday for Harry, and the party took place on the day itself, it would have been just 16 days after Princess Diana’s death.

In what she calls her ‘fundamental reappraisal’ of Charles and Diana’s marriage, Ms Mayer concludes that in the so-called War of the Waleses, the Prince ‘could never match Diana’s lustre or her blood-lust’.

She concludes with a rather unfortunate tribute, saying Charles III ‘promises to be as memorable a king as Charles I’ — who, of course, was the only English monarch ever to be executed.
