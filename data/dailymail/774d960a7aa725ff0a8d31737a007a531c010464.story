A new billboard campaign featuring images of pregnant boys has been launched in Chicago with the intended aim of reducing teen pregnancy rates in the city.

The Chicago Department of Public Health has said it choose the unusual images because it wanted to impress upon young males that teen pregnancy is not just the girl's responsibility.

The ad campaign has been rolled out this week in the city and suburbs, on transit buses, trains and billboards.

The ad campaign has been rolled out this week in Chicago and suburbs, on transit buses, trains and billboards

They have been placed close to local high schools where the teen pregnancy rate has recently increased, reports MyFoxChicago.

A similar campaign ran in Milwaukee last year and has been credited with helping to reduce teen pregnancy rates there.

Earlier this year a new teen pregnancy prevention ad from New York's Human Resources Administration (HRA) came under attack for using 'slut-shaming' insults to deter unwanted pregnancy.

The campaign, which launched on March 3 in bus shelters and subway stations, featured pictures of toddlers next to messages that read: 'Honestly, Mom… Chances are he 
won’t stay with you' and 'I’m twice as likely not 
to graduate high school because you had me as a teen.'

Those ads were accused of using threats and ridicule to 'promote 
the difficulties of teen pregnancy,' instead of offering assistance and eduction to address what the HRA calls 'the real costs of teen pregnancy for teens and their children.'

New York City's Planned Parenthood denounced the ads, saying they are not the answer.

Haydee Morales, Vice 
President of Education and Training explained: 'The latest NYC ad campaign creates stigma, hostility, and negative 
public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering
 alternative aspirations for young people.

'The City’s money would be better spent helping teens access 
health care, birth control, and high-quality sexual and reproductive 
health education, not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value'

An interactive component to the campaign also offered young people the choice to 'Text "NOTNOW" to 877877 for the real cost of teen pregnancy.'

Once teens texted the number, they are faced with 'sobering facts about teen pregnancy,' according to the campaign's press release.

Different scenarios depicted how a teen mother would gain an excessive amount of weight, be ignored by the child's father, and shunned by her parents. However the texts offer no information on how to avoid a pregnancy.

'The ad creates stigma, hostility, and negative 
public opinions... rather than offering
 alternative aspirations for young people'

One text message received by MailOnline 
came from a hypothetical 16-year-old teen named Anaya, who wrote: 'OMG! 
My BF Louis and I got pregnant. He was going to take me to prom, now I 
will look huge in my dress. Should I go?'

After responding 'yes,' Anaya replied: 'My BFF called me a "fat loser" at prom. I was devastated.' A later message added: 'Ugh, now I have morning sickness during an exam! Should I throw up or finish the test?'

The ads were accused of being judgmental and problematic, resulting in emotional anxiety and stress, rather than creating a productive discourse surrounding teen pregnancy.

Jezebel's Laura Beck called the campaign a 'shortsighted outreach' that will 'create a deeper chasm between the people who want
 assistance, and the organizations that are ostensibly offering it.'

She wrote: 'Way to attempt to make every teen mom/person with a teen mom feel like utter s**t when they ride the subway, NYC!

'Shaming people isn't a pregnancy 
prevention tool. Education, assistance, and condoms are, but misguided 
subway ads aren't. There are so many wonderful teen moms, and this is basically a middle finger to them.

'Think of how it must feel for the
 child of a teen mom who sees this poster. What message does that send 
them? "Better drop out now, because you're doomed to fail,"' she added.

The HRA told MailOnline that the purpose of the 
campaign is to highlight the challenges facing teen parents - hurdles such as raising a child before they are emotionally ready 
or financially secure.

'Many teens may not be aware that having a
 child before they finish school and get married means both that they 
are more likely to live in poverty, and that their children will be less
 likely to graduate from high school and avoid poverty in their own 
lives,' HRA explained.

'Eight in 10 teen parents do not marry each other in the first 
year, and the parent without custody (usually the father) is required to
 pay child support until the child is 21.'

The backbone of the campaign may use factual messages to deliver a 'wake-up call', but the strong messages already appear to have backfired.

Waste of money? New York City's Planned Parenthood said: 'The latest campaign creates... negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people'

One
 Jezebel commenter wrote: 'Speaking as the child of a teen mom, I can 
also say there's already a pretty awful sense of guilt that hits you 
when you realize that you were unplanned and your birth completely 
altered your mother's life (and more often than not, negatively affected
 the quality of her life). So... yeah. Pretty crummy on a couple levels 
here.'

There are also many successful
 single teen parents who raise brilliant children, a fact not lost on their children.

One commenter, who called the campaign a 'slut-shaming pile of garbage' explained: 'My mum was 17 years old when she had me and I am extremely proud of how we both turned out.

'She may have been young and inexperienced, but the trade off was having a mum who had tons of energy, who was open minded, who gave me a fantastic education in pop culture... I could talk to her about things that no one else I knew could mention to their parents.'

She continued: 'I would never recommend that someone chooses to be a teenaged mum - but I am who I am because of of my mother, and her age was a part of who she was when I was growing up.'

After Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Doar unveiled the campaign, Mr Doar explained in a statement: 'Teens giving birth before they are 
ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to 
raise children.

'We cannot dictate how people 
live their lives, and sometimes even the best plans don’t work out, but 
we must encourage responsibility and send the right message, especially 
to young people.'
