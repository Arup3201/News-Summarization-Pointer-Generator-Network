A snow shortage across Europe which put paid to World Cup alpine races last week is now threatening to ruin pre-Christmas skiing holidays for thousands of Britons.

Pistes across France and Switzerland have been badly affected by the record-breaking shortages during a week where thousands of Britons are preparing for festive getaways.

This time last year, pistes across France - where most UK Alpine sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open.

But nine out of 12 resorts have currently yet to even start their season. These include ones which are particularly popular with the British, including the Grands-Montets at Chamonix, Meribel and Megeve.

Les Deux Alpes, which has almost 100 runs open during the high season, currently has just a dozen open.

Of the 36 resorts on the other side of France - in the Pyrenees - only two, Puigmal and Vallnord, is open. 

It is the same in Switzerland, where canons are working overtime to produce fake snow at Klosters, where only a handful of runs on two out of five mountains have opened.

Last week the French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent.

Snow go area: The Val D'Isere resort in France has had the World Cup alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow

Markus Unterfinger, a spokesman for the resort, which is popular with both Prince Charles and Chancellor George Osborne, said: 'It was the driest November here for 150 years, since records began.'

Although snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week, a spokesman for weather institute Meteo France said an 'exceptionally warm and extremely dry' November included temperatures 2.5C above normal.  

This has meant that December - traditionally a busy period on the slopes when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could be a wipe out.  

Snow joke: Just nine out of 12 resorts in France have currently yet to even start their season.

With government austerity measures biting in the UK, the French fear a lack of spare cash will combine with the poor weather to stop people travelling for last-minute breaks too.

In the meantime, those who have already booked will be checking travel insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because of the lack of snow.

Most policies pay out nominal fee if 
there is no snow, but only if every ski lift is shut down. Resorts are 
known to keep one lift open at all times, no matter how poor the snow 
cover, to stop this happening.  

Some 400,000 British people travel to France to ski every season, with 250,000 heading for Austria, and 150,000 to Italy.  

Only around 75,000 go to Switzerland, but these tend to be richer holidaymakers, making the market an extremely lucrative one.  

If
conditions stay as they are, then many of them are expected to switch 
to skiing holidays in the USA, where conditions are currently far better
than in Europe.  

Despite 
the gloom, a spokeswoman for the Ski Club of Great Britain, said: 'There
is a lack of snow cover lower down in the Alps but snow is forecast 
over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions.

Slopes which are normally thick with snow at this time of year are currently barren and brown due to the snow shortage
