A 21-year-old woman had acid thrown in her face as she prepared for her engagement party after telling her attacker she already had a fiance.

Hong Kim Huoi, 21, suffered 30 per cent burns to her body, including face, arms and thighs in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Seven other people were also burned when Nguyen Van Dung attacked the woman and her friends as they prepared to leave for their engagement party.

Dung was arrested on Sunday after the terrifying attack, which he carried out on a scooter while Huoi and her friends were waiting for a taxi.

The group of girls were heading to the airport to return to her hometown on Phu Quoc Island for the engagement ceremony.

He splashed acid on them and ran after them, continuing the acid attack as they tried to escape.

Three bystanders including a 45-year-old woman and two children, both 11 years old, suffered burns.

Dung tried to escape on his scooter but was seized by locals who handed him over to the police.

He confessed to police he had declared his love to Huoi who told him she was engaged to another man.

Huoi's fianci Dang Minh Tri, 22, said he and Huoi have been in relationship for more than two years and their betrothal ceremony was planned for Tuesday.

The news follows in the wake of a spate of similar attacks, including on two British tourists in Zanzibar in September.

Two 18-year-old girls, Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, were left badly injured after two men on a moped threw acid at them while they walked to dinner on the Indian Ocean island.

Terrorist group Al Shabaab have been linked to the attack after several of the 15 suspects arrested were confirmed to be members.

They were taken into custody following another acid attack on Catholic Priests shortly after the Britons were targetted.

Last month 16-year-old Liam Robert Sibbons was jailed for eight years for spraying Tara Quigley, 28, with chromic acid after he knocked on her door.

Sibbons, who was also burned during the attack, admitted the offence but refused to say why he did it, claiming that he could not remember how he had ended up at the house.

Just two weeks ago Indian newspapers reported that a jilted lover met up with his ex-girlfriend before trying to force her to drink acid.

Jitendra Sakhpal, 21, had proposed to the unnamed 18-year-old girl but she had refused because her family did not approve of him.

According to police, he allegedly met up with the girl, held her mouth and tried to pour acid into it before pushing her into the sea.

Some of the acid spilled on her face and she suffered 10-15 per cent burns, leaving her in critical condition.
