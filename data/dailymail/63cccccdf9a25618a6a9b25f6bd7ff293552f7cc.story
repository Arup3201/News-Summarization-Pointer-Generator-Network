A furious Roy Hodgson blew his top over criticism of England’s uninspiring performance in their 1-0 victory over Norway at Wembley.

Clearly irritated when asked to comment on the fact his side had only two shots on target, Hodgson snapped back: ‘I’m not going to judge it because someone is going to tell me, “Well, you only had two shots at goal” because that is absolute f****** b*******, I’m sorry.’

The England coach was also prickly when pressed about the poor turnout at Wembley and admitted it could take years before England get the best out of his young Lions.

The heat is on Hodgson as he prepares for Monday’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in Basle. He is coming under increasing pressure after fans turned their backs on an England team that returned from the World Cup with one point from three games.

A paltry 40,181 turned up on Wednesday — the lowest crowd since the new stadium opened in 2007.

On the Wembley crowd, he said: ‘Now we have 40,000 to see us play against a much more difficult opponent than Peru (who England played in May).’

Referring to the abject campaign in Brazil, he added: ‘I can’t put that right because I can’t turn back the clock, but what I can do is analyse what I have seen and judge that through my own eyes.’

Bright spark: The performance of Raheem Sterling against the Norwegians was one of few positives

England’s head coach pleaded for patience, saying it could take years before we see the best from Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones and Raheem Sterling.

He said: ‘I say, and will continue to say, that as long as they continue to give performances like they did against Norway, some of these are top, top players in the making. But you can’t play five games for England and be a regular in the Liverpool team for six or seven months and be David Beckham.

‘You can’t come in, like Phil Jones, after all the injuries at the moment, nail down a place in Manchester United’s central defence and become John Terry.

‘You can’t be Jack Wilshere, who has lost all that football through injury and then all of a sudden be Bryan Robson. Let’s be fair about these things. That is all I am asking.

‘But also, allow me to be excited by what they can do and allow me also to stand in front of an assembled press conference when they play well and say, “I think they did well” even though there might be some cynicism out there.

‘I am talking to people here who have followed England for many years, and follow Premier League football every week and there is no chance of pulling wool over the eyes of people who have seen top-class players and know what top-class players look like.’

Hodgson appeared ruffled when he walked into the media auditorium at Wembley on Wednesday and said: ‘Come on then, get on with it, I haven’t got a lot of time,’ before a question had even been asked.

He later claimed it was because his family and friends were waiting upstairs in a corporate lounge, but it emerged that he was furious about the quoting of negative statistics from England’s performance.

Bizarrely, the England coach countered the question about England having had only two shots on targets by quoting another statistic: that England had more possession than their opponents.

Hodgson has always insisted that he has no interest in statistical analysis or data, which is a massive departure from the new-school approach of modern managers.

After regaining his composure, England’s head coach later spoke in a separate briefing designed to be a more considered reaction to the performance of the team against Norway.

He added: ‘The bottom line is this. Before the World Cup and the euphoria, we were getting 75,000 to watch us play Peru who, with respect, were nowhere near as difficult an opponent as we played tonight.

‘We can’t get rid of the baggage, we can’t change the fact we had a bad World Cup. If we had played badly against Norway, if a lot of players performed really badly, if the quality of our passing and movement was nothing like what I wanted to see, I would be the first to say so.’
