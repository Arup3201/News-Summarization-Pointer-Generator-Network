With a daily regime that includes 7am starts, intensive military fitness training and a mountain of tack to clean, a stint at the Northern Racing College in Doncaster would be challenging for anyone.

But the students who take the 10-week intensive courses offered by the college are no ordinary teens. Many have been in trouble with the police, can barely read or write and have been expelled from school.

'Without this place, some kids would 
probably never achieve anything,' explains Malcolm Bygrave, the course manager. 'All our kids are turnarounds. Every one
 of these kids has come in here with a goal and if we can get them out 
into a racing yard, then they might achieve that goal.'

Now the school is to feature in a new Channel 4 documentary that follows the teenage pupils as they bid to overcome their problems and become the Grand National winners of the future.

Among them is Stacey, 15, from Cumbria, who has spent most of her short life in and out of trouble with the police thanks to her penchant for fighting.

'A lass came to pick on us one day,' she says of her last fight. 
'She started saying stuff about about my family and pulled my hair, and I 
flipped. I just saw red. But I'd really damaged her and put her in 
hospital. I got expelled for 
it.

She adds: 'My mum and I do fight. We start punching each other. I've got 
scars all over my knuckles from fighting with her.'

Joining her is traveller Tyler, 16, from County Durham who was expelled from school aged 14 and struggles to read and write but dreams of becoming a jockey.

The dream: Tyler and Stacey dream of emulating A.P McCoy, winner of last year's Grand National

'If I've had a bad day then I'll jump on a horse and it'll calm me down,' he explains. 'I'm
 hoping to be a jockey. If I didn't have this opportunity, I'd probably 
be riding around with horses, signing on the dole and I don't want that.'

Both will take part in a 10-week intensive course at the National Racing College, after which, provided they pass, they will be given a placement in a racing stable and the chance to become a professional jockey.

But it won't be easy. Instructors at the school enforce a tough regime with strict rules on behaviour that include prohibitions on swearing, wearing make-up and fraternising with the opposite sex.

Along with yard duties and riding, the teens also have to endure daily bootcamp-style workouts under the eagle eye of military fitness trainer Rudy - much to the horror of many.

'He's evil!' sniffs Stacey after being made to complete laps of the paddock followed by a tough set of squats and lunges.

Rudy is less than impressed. 'The racing industry's hard - it's hard,' he explains. 'They need to grow up a little more and toughen up.'

Toughening up is a key part of the educational experience at the Northern Racing College, although maths and English also form part of the curriculum.

'We have all sorts,' adds Malcolm. 'We have students that
 come in with very low level of education. We have students who come in 
that would struggle to write their own name.'

But while he's sympathetic, it swiftly becomes clear that Malcolm has no intention of putting up with teenage tantrums once his students arrive on the gallops.

Hard work: Fitness is a crucial part of becoming a racing jockey - hence the military style workouts

Painful process: Students at the Northern Racing College spend hours riding, then do hours of yard chores

'Whinging and whining - you always get 
this in the first couple of weeks but we'll soon knock it out of them,' he fumes after hearing Stacey moaning during a circuit on the gallops.

'Everyone's got their own style of teaching and mine's probably more aggressive than most but that's what some of these kids need.'

One who seems to need a bit of tough love is Tyler, who repeatedly invites the ire of instructors thanks to his constant larking about.

'Sometimes you're teaching him and he 
thinks he knows best,' grumbles Malcolm. 'Tyler's come here on the attitude he's going to 
get by on his charm, what little he has, and now he knows its about hard
 work. He needs to stop being a boy and start being a man.'

Despite the harsh regime, it becomes clear that the school has worked wonders on the troubled teens by the end of the course.

Stacey, who arrived with a hair trigger temper and an over-reliance on her fists, seems calmer, while Tyler manages to pass his English and maths exams for the first time.

Graduates: A handful of students are given placements on racing yards after completing the course

Future star? Tyler, who passed the course, says he plans to go on and become a race-winning jockey

'I have changed... I've changed quite a lot,' says Stacey, who will be heading home to Cumbria after the course ends. 'I was one of the worst when I got here but my attitude, my anger levels... they've just changed.'

Tyler, by contrast, is staying on to be primed for a career as a racing jockey - much to the tearful delight of his parents and Auntie Charlene.

'I'm over the moon,' he beams, utterly thrilled. 'I had to go and call my Auntie Charlene [to tell her he passed the course], and she said she felt like crying. I have made me family proud and me mum's proud of us - I definitely will make it as a jockey.'

'It's not all about the horses,' explains an equally proud Malcolm. 'It's 
about putting a good grounding into them so that when they go to a trainer's 
yard, they might not be the finished product but they'll be well on the 
way to it.

'Not every student is cut out for racing but we can train them up to the point where they'll be of value to someone.'
