Charged: Clive Sharp leaves Mold Magistrates' Court today after he appeared there charged with the murder of Catherine Gowing

The family of missing vet Catherine Gowing vowed to ‘bring her home’ today as a man appeared in court charged with her murder.

Ms Gowing, 37, has been missing since she failed to arrive at work at the Evans Veterinary Practice in Mold, North Wales, on Monday.

Catherine Gowing's sister, Emma Gowing, sat in the public gallery at Mold Magistrates' Court as Clive Sharp, 46, stood just yards away in the dock.

Sharp, of no fixed address, spoke only to give his name and date of birth and confirm that he understood the charge - that he murdered Ms Gowing in North Wales between October 11 and 17.

After the short hearing, Detective Inspector Iestyn Davies said on behalf of Ms Gowing's family: ‘Our primary concern and objective is that we find Catherine.

‘The support we have received from the police, the public and all Catherine's friends and family has kept us going and will continue to do so.

‘We will bring Catherine home.’

Ms Gowing's burned out car was found  abandoned in a country lane in Alltami, near Mold, police confirmed yesterday.

The car was found at about 7.15pm yesterday just two miles from Ms Gowing’s home in New Brighton, Flintshire after a member of the public contacted police.

Detectives say they have devoted ‘extensive’ resources to the search, including dog teams and underwater search specialists.

Detective Superintendent John Hanson said today: ‘Following an appeal for information regarding the whereabouts of Catherine Gowing’s Renault Clio motor vehicle, at about 7.15pm yesterday evening a member of the public contacted police regarding the discovery of a burnt-out car in Pinfold Lane, Alltami, near Mold.'

Ms Gowing was last seen on Friday night at a supermarket in Queensferry, Flintshire. A broken text message was sent from her mobile phone to one of her work colleagues that evening. Officers have been scouring CCTV and carrying out a forensic examination of her home as they try to establish her whereabouts.

Appearing at a press conference on Thursday, Ms Gowing’s distraught sister Emma Gowing asked the public for help in tracking down her 'beautiful sister', whom she described as the 'light of my life'.

‘Please look, please search, please help us find our beautiful sister,' she said. 'Catherine is a kind, sensitive beautiful person. She’s passionate about animals and utterly devoted to my family.

'She’s my best friend, she’s the light of my life and she’s the light of my parents’ life.

'If you have any information about Catherine, no matter how trivial you think it is, please contact the police.'

David Evans, owner of the veterinary practice where Ms Gowing has been based for 18 months, said staff became worried after receiving the text at the weekend.

'One of the nurses was concerned about her on Saturday or Sunday because she had half a message from her, from her mobile phone anyway,' Mr Evans said.

'We thought, since her car was missing, we thought maybe she had gone somewhere for the weekend or got into some difficulty or something like that.'
