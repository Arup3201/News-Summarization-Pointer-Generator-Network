Two Iranian girls have been ridiculed on the internet after a video of them crashing their car while recording a karaoke session at the wheel went viral.

The video of the accident in Iran has sparked a spate of copycat videos making fun of their dangerous stunt.

The 14 second clip shows the two young women in a car with one of them driving without her hands on the steering wheel.  They are singing to a song identified as an Iranian pop song called 'Ghorboni' by Saeed Shayesteh.

Two Iranian girls have been ridiculed on the internet after a video of them crashing their car while trying to film themselves dancing at the wheel went viral

The video of the accident in Iran has sparked a spate of copycat videos making fun of their stupidity

Both of them take their eyes off the road as the driver makes a heart with her hands while her blonde friend grins into the camera.

Seconds later, they crash, and an airbag can be seen activating over the camera before the film ends.

The pair were taken to hospital for treatment - where they uploaded the video of the crash - and it spread across social media.

In the photo one of them has blood across her face while the other girl has an IV attached to her hand

After realising how popular the video had become, they then uploaded a photo from their hospital beds believing people wanted to know if they were safe - one of them has blood across her face while the girl has an IV attached to her hand.

But most people had only shared the video to ridicule their dangerous stunt.

Many internet users have created spoof copies of the video - one of them shows two man faking a crash under the same circumstances, and then posting the same hospital style photo.

At first it was unclear if the video was a spoof, but the Iranian media widely reported the incident last week and the photographs from the hospital seem to suggest the clip is authentic. 

It was reported that the girls are now recovering well.
