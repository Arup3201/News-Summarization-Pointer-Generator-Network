Jilted first lady Valerie Trierweiler last night arrived in India to begin a ‘Princess Diana-style’ charity trip – while insisting she is still in love with Francois Hollande.

Ms Trierweiler arrived at Mumbai airport soon after midnight local time and was swamped with photographers as she made her way to a waiting limousine.

Ms Trierweiler's webpage on the official Elysee Palace website has already been removed, along with her official Twitter account.

Her five staff office at the Elysee has also been shut down, and she is not expected to enter the palace again.

Ms Trierweiler was wearing a dark trouser suit and looked relaxed and happy after enjoying first class service on the Air France plane.

Three bodyguards and a number of Indian Army soldiers tried to keep the crowds back as Ms Trierweiler smiled broadly and waived regally without commenting.

Ms Trierweiler got into the back of a waiting black limousine by herself and continued to smile and waive as she was driven to the five star Taj Majal Palace hotel.

The rest of her entourage followed in a second limousine.

Her arrival comes within a few hours of the president confirming his separation from the firebrand 48-year-old with a brusque 18 word statement.

Despite the split, Ms Trierweiler has made clear she wants to remain on the world stage.

It led to her being widely mocked by senior women politicians, with former health minister Roselyne Bachelot tweeting: ‘Valerie – the new Diana?’

Despite losing her perks, Trierweiler (pictured today) was driven to Charles de Gaulle airport in a limousine accompanied by police outriders, and will have a bodyguard with her in India

Police secure Trierweiler's route. French president Francois Hollande announced yesterday that the couple have officially split

The late Princess Diana and 
self-styled ‘Queen of Hearts’ famously devoted herself to humanitarian 
and charitable causes following her divorce from Prince Charles.

Diana
 was always a member of the Royal Family but Ms Trierweiler, in 
contrast, has now officially lost her title of first lady, and all the 
perks that go with it.

Earlier today, she was driven on to the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport in a limousine 
accompanied by police outriders, and will have a bodyguard and her old 
chief of staff, Patrice Biancone, with her in India.

But
 an Elysee Palace aide said this was solely to ensure they can ‘keep an 
eye’ on a woman who is now viewed as a loose cannon who could do a great
 deal of harm to Mr Hollande.

It will be the last time Ms Trierweiler enjoys government support on a foreign trip, the aide insisted.

The
 twice divorced Paris Match journalist nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’ has 
been briefing the media ever since photographs were published on January
 10th which proved the president was having an affair with the actress 
Julie Gayet, 41.

Ms Trierweiler is said to have smashed up antique furniture on hearing of her then boyfriend’s cheating, and then spent eight days in a public hospital suffering from stress

Ms 
Trierweiler is thought to be behind reports in today’s Le Parisien which
 contain ‘a friend’ saying: ‘What’s sad for her, is not so much leaving 
the Elysee and all its decorum, but losing the man whom she loves’.  

She
 refused to sign a legal agreement confirming the split, leaving Mr 
Hollande to awkwardly announce it by himself in a phone call to French 
news agency AFP on Saturday.

Ms
 Trierweiler is said to have smashed up antique furniture on hearing of 
her then boyfriend’s cheating, and then spent eight days in a public 
hospital suffering from stress.

She
 then moved to La Lanterne, the hugely luxurious presidential retreat in
 Versailles, west of Paris, which comes complete with heated swimming 
pool and wine cellar.

Such 
behaviour infuriated ordinary French people, who have seen Mr Hollande’s
 Socialist policies plunge the country into economic disaster.

Mr Hollande, who had never married, is now 
expected to remain a 'bachelor president' for a while, while continuing 
with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside the Elysee.

Organised
 and partly funded by the charity Action Contre La Faim (Fight Against 
Hunger, ACF), the trip to India will see Ms Trierweiler staying at the 
five star Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai.

One
 of her trips in India will be to a children’s hospital, and her friend 
Charlotte Valandrey – who is accompanying her on the trip – said today: 
‘This is a strong woman, a woman of heart, who is engaged in the ACF 
project since long before Francois Hollande became president’.

Nadine
 Morano, another former minister, said she had ‘no sympathy’ for Ms 
Trierweiler, and that the whole saga proved how much the Socialist 
government was ‘prepared to lie’ to the people of France.

Jean-Marie
 Le Pen, founder of the Front National, in turn said that Ms Trierweiler
 had not even divorced her second husband, and attacked Mr Hollande for 
having four children out of wedlock.

‘Exemplary
 president?’ tweeted Mr Pen. ‘Not in private – four children out of 
marriage and a non-divorced mistress whom he couldn’t even be faithful 
to!’

A mass ‘Day of Anger’ 
demonstration was held against the Hollande administration in Paris 
today, with organisers saying 120,000 people calling for the president’s
 resignation took part.

Strikes against President Francois Hollande took place in Paris today

Demonstrators wore masks and had signs with 'Police Politique' tied around their necks for the protest

Riot police were out on the streets of Paris tonight as protestors went on the rampage.

By nightfall, there were 150 arrests, mainly for public order offences, and some 20 officers were injured.

Many were protesting against the Socialist’s appalling economic record, which has seen unemployment soar above the 3 million mark and the cost of living spiral.

The worst violence was in the upmarket 7th arrondissement, close to the French Parliament, where hooded protestors started to light fires and throw missiles at police.

‘Iron bars and garbage was among the material being thrown, and we had to respond with tear gas,’ said one officer. 'Some police have been very badly injured'.

Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, immediately appealed for calm, blaming the trouble on ‘individuals, disparate groups, and the extreme and ultra right’.

He said there aim was ‘to create confusion by violently attacking representatives of law enforcement’, adding that ‘everything will be done to find the perpetrators of these outrages.’

Organisers say 120,000 attended the Day Of Anger protest today

However, police estimated the figure was more like 17,000

An opinion poll published over the weekend confirmed that Ms 
Trierweiler was by far the most unpopular first lady in the history of 
modern France.

Mr Hollande, 
who had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor president’ 
for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms Gayet 
outside the Elysee.

Ms Gayet
 has not spoken since the pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving
 their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash 
helmet as a poor disguise.
