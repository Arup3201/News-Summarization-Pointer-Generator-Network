Errol Flynn as Robin Hood. Historian Sean McGlynn believes the legendary figure was actually William of Kensham

Robin Hood did not rob from the rich to feed the poor in Sherwood Forest, he was a freedom fighter attacking French invaders in Kent, a historian has claimed.

The legendary figure, who is said to have resided in the Nottingham area, may have actually been William of Kensham, according to historian Sean McGlynn.

William conducted a guerrilla war against the French forces of Prince Louis who invaded England in 1216.

Mr McGlynn has suggested that William led a band of archers who attacked the French forces in the forests of the Kent Weald before the little-known 18-month occupation by the French of a large part of England was finally thwarted.

Writing in the magazine History Today, Mr McGlynn said: 'It’s hard to find another contender for the Robin Hood story from this age or afterwards who is both a hero and an outlaw.

'In William we have both: a feted resistance fighter, loyally protecting the crown, but also, from Louis’ perspective, an egregious outlaw defying the righteous rule of the imposed new regime.'

The academic said that other contenders for the legend such as Roger Godberd were at the wrong time and were thieves and outlaws that lacked the hero status.

He also said that William would have travelled to the Nottingham area because it was the main headquarters of the English army at the time.

But Mr McGlynn accepts that William could only be one of many inspirations for the famous story.

'The most probable truth behind the Robin Hood legend is that over time storytellers incorporated and conflated various characters from a range of stories and settled on the instantly recognisable name of Robin Hood as the woodsman.'

John Cottee, Committee Chairman for Culture at Nottinghamshire County Council, which manages Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve, said: 'Robin Hood was a man of the people and his legend is shared today throughout the world, so challenges can come and go, but Nottinghamshire will always celebrate its legendary association with the world's most famous outlaw and continue to conserve the precious remnants of Sherwood Forest where he once roamed.'

It is not the first time that historians have speculated on the originator of the Robin Hood story.

In 2006, Stephen Lawhead said the medieval outlaw was actually a Welsh freedom fighter who never set foot in Nottingham.

Kevin Costner, with Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian, famously depicted Robin Hood as Robin of Loxley

Lawhead said the folk hero and his band of merry men
would have carried out their thieving in the Marsh, a primeval
forest in Wales in the 11th century, more than a hundred years
before the English Robin Hood.

The English Robin Hood is first mentioned by name in the official documents for Yorkshire of 1230, where he is described as Robertus Hood fugitivis who has failed to appear in court.

Many believe him to be nobleman, the Earl of Loxley, who was deprived of his lands by greedy churchmen.

Ancient stories tell how he even helped Richard the Lionheart reclaim the throne of England after his return from the Crusades.

Since then Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn have both portrayed the legend on the big screen.
