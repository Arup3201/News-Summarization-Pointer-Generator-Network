Victim: Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, pictured, was murdered last month

The investigation into the murder of a Dallas assistant district attorney last month continues as investigators look to an Aryan Brotherhood for clues in the prosecutor’s death.

Mark Hasse, who was an ADA in Kaufman County, was shot dead in the courthouse parking lot in January; authorities believe the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas to be behind the murder.

Now, state officials have set up a makeshift command center in an old armory to better investigate the white supremacist group’s role in Hasse’s killing.

The Dallas Morning News reports that while officials have been working round the clock to charge a people or persons with Hasse’s murder, they do not have any hot leads.

No arrests have been made in the case, and Hasse’s autopsy report has not yet been released.

However, a member of the U.S. Marshals Service out of San Antonio recently wrote in an email that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could be responsible for the ADA’s death.

According to NBC DFW, the command center at the armory helps officials at the local, state, and federal level achieve better communication. And, since it is not open to the public, there are fewer risks of leaks that could compromise the investigation.

Kaufman County District Attorney Mike
McLelland told the station that his staff members are still deeply 
troubled by Hasse’s murder, and are forced to walk through the parking 
lot where he was murdered to get to the courthouse.

‘You see a shadow at your door, and it kind of looks like him. That happens several times a day,’ he told NBC DFW.

Brotherhood member: James Marshall Meldrum is one of the alleged white supremecists involved in the trial Kaufman was prosecuting

The DA told the Morning News that he was not aware that Hasse had any involvement in Aryan Brotherhood Cases. 

The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas is a white supremacist prison gang formed in the 1960s. 

The reward for any information regarding his slaying has climbed to $71,000.

The apparent assassination took place
at around 8:50 a.m on January 31 in a parking lot near the courthouse 
where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed murder and drug 
cases.

Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said he had never seen such a case in his four decade career.

'I've
been doing this 43 years and I have never experienced anything like 
this before,' he told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference.

Hasse was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. He was unmarried and had no children.

Witnesses
told police they saw two suspects flee the scene in an older, silver 
Ford Taurus. However, the number of suspects had not been verified.

Kaufman Chief of Police Chris 
Aulbaugh said the shooting appeared to be targeted at Hasse for a number
of reasons. 'The fact it was not an ongoing rampage, it was one 
individual being shot and then (the gunmen) leaving the scene,' he said.
'It was a very small, very short confrontation.'

The
suspects were of unknown race but were reportedly wearing all black, 
with one or both of them wearing a tactical-type vest. Some reports 
claim they were wearing masks.

A widespread manhunt is underway for 
the culprits with the help of police and sheriff's 
departments from across the county. 'Every police department in the county is involved,' county spokesman Pat Laney said.

Shortly after the prosecutor was shot and killed, the Department of Justice put out a statement crediting the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office with helping in the investigation of two known members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang.

The gang members pleaded guilty last month to racketeering charges, after Hasse's shooting.

The release states that Ben Christian
Dillon, known as 'Tuff', of Houston, and James Marshall Meldrum, aka 'Dirty'
both 'agreed to commit multiple acts of murder, robbery, arson, 
kidnapping and narcotics tracking' for the Aryan Brotherhood.

Tonya
Radcliffe, a board member on the Kaufman County Appraisal District 
whose office is adjacent to the scene of the shooting, told NBC that a staff member heard the gunshots and called police.

Radcliffe said she and her staff of 
about 25 were in the building and under lockdown along with seven Kaufman
Independent School District campuses.

Lawyer
James Lee Bright, who arrived at the Kaufman courthouse just as 
officers flooded the scene, told the Dallas News that the veteran 
prosecutor had worked on numerous cases over his career that could be 
connected.

'When you hear a DA at 8:40 in the morning is gunned down by two people, I think there's a reasonable presumption that it's not random,' he said.

Defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the Dallas News that he immediately feared Hasse had been targeted. 'I felt it very certainly had to be work-related,' he said.

Smenner added that Hasse parked in the same area of the courtroom parking lot each day. 'So if somebody was out to get him all they'd have to do is watch him a little bit,' he told the Dallas News.

According to CBS, Mark Hasse graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1981 and had been licensed to practice law since 1982.

The 57-year-old had been a Kaufman County District Attorney since July of 2010. He was chief of the Dallas County district attorney’s organized-crime section from 1985 until 1988.

Steinke said: 'Mark was really a great guy, 
he was the consummate prosecutor, he was hard-working, loved his job, 
and juries loved him for some reason. He wasn't very large in stature, 
but juries loved him and he exuded confidence.'

Hasse had recently bought a house in Kaufman County and was in the process of renovating it, McLelland said.

'It's a scary deal,' Dallas attorney Ted Steinke told WFAA.com regarding the role of a prosecutor. 
'Every prosecutor every once in a while gets a death threat, and we take
them seriously, but this is the first time in 20 years that I can 
remember here in North Texas a prosecutor actually being assaulted.'
