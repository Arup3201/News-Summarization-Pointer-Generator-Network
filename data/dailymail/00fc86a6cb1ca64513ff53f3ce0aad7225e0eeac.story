The number of prisoners being put to death in the States  has fallen to a 20-year low as concerns grow in the wake of a series of botched executions.

There were just 35 executions carried out in 2014, compared to 39 the year before, according to a Death Penalty Information Center report issued on Thursday.

The Washington-based non-profit organisation also noted the number of people being given a death sentence was also down to its lowest in 40 years, reaching 72 by mid-December.

The number of executions carried out in the United States fell to its lowest since 1994 

It also points out high profile botched executions in Ohio, Arizona and Oklahoma - states all using a new drug combination - have led to what the center described as 'outcry and delays' indicating increasing concerns among the public about how the death penalty is imposed.

The new drugs took longer to kill the inmate, with witnesses in some cases saying the prisoners appeared to be in pain before they died.

In particular, the death of Clayton Lockett - convicted of killing 19-year-old Stephanie Neiman in 1999 and burying her alive - has horrified the public.

Shocking court documents revealed a doctor burst Clayton Lockett's artery during his execution at Oklahoma state prison - an execution which used a combination of experimental drugs (pictured)

According to a report into his death on April 29, a doctor tried to insert an intravenous line into his groin in a frantic attempt to save him, but hit and burst an artery instead.

It caused blood to splatter over the doctor's jacket before the execution was officially stopped. Lockett's heart stopped beating moments later.

The report quotes Oklahoma state prison warden Anita Trammell  as saying that the procedure was a 'bloody mess'.

Oklahoma's 21 death row inmates are fighting the state through the court - arguing Clayton Hackett's bungled execution is evidence they likely will experience pain and suffering from the state's lethal injection protocol.

Lawyers are due in federal court in Oklahoma City on Thursday, where the inmates are challenging the state's method of execution.

The court will hear testimony about the process - which left Lockett 'writhing' on the gurney, before he mumbled and lifted 13 minutes after he had been given the lethal cocktail.

Much of the case centers on the use of the sedative midazolam as the first in a three-drug combination, used for the first time during Lockett's execution. 

Attorneys for the state say new execution protocols and staff training will prevent similar problems from happening again.

Oklahoma's next execution is set for January 15 next year.

Oklahoma carried out no more executions in 2014 after Lockett's death, while only seven of 32 states that have the death penalty on the books executed inmates during the last 12 months.

The bulk came from just three states: Texas, Missouri and Florida, the Death Penalty Information Center report said.

Richard Dieter, the center's executive director, said evidence in recent years suggests 'the death penalty is becoming irrelevant as a criminal justice tool'.

Bit Michael Rushford, president of the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, said there is little evidence that juries are less likely to impose death sentences or that the public at large is opposed to the death penalty.

The lower number of executions is, in part, a result of fewer death penalty-eligible crimes being committed in recent years, he said.

However, even a reduced number is likely to place the United States in the top 10 countries for executions: 2013 saw the US execute fifth most people in the world, behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, according to a report released in May by the human rights organization Amnesty International.
