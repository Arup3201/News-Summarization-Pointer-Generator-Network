Get used to 'nightmare' bad weather causing chaos on Britain's  roads as it's only going to get worse - and not even a 'gritter on every corner' will be able to cope with extreme wintry conditions, the RAC Foundation warned today.

A growing number of potholes will follow in the wake of the savage cold snaps, as well as lurking hidden beneath sudden snowfalls, which remain ' a matter of concern' it warns.

A combination of more frequent and more 'extreme' bad winter weather means drivers will have to change their habits and expectations and follow the Scouts' motto of 'Be Prepared'.

Too many drivers fail to heed weather warnings 'and had been caught out or unprepared,' the RAC report found

Despite the severest conditions, some drivers still expect their journeys to be 'normal' the 54-page dossier discovered

Even with masses of the latest technology, man still cannot deal 'with whatever nature might throw at us,' it concludes.

The 54-page dossier called 'Ploughing On' was commissioned by the RAC Foundation from expert  Brian Smith, a former director of Environment and Transport at Cambridgeshire County Council and member of the Government's Quarmby Winter Resilience Review in 2010 following widespread chaos during the severe winters of 2008/09 and 2009/10.

It concludes that the official response to the extensive ice and snow across England and Wales in January 2013 - and again in parts of the South East of England in early March -  was 'generally good'.

Local highway authorities and the Government's Highways Agency were this year well prepared for winter and there was no shortages of salt though there were sometimes glitches in supplies, and councils did not  cut back on winter resilience spending,  the report concludes.

But at temperatures of minus -7C and below, the effectiveness of salt decreases.

It found that although councils and 
the Highways Agency responded well to snow and ice in January and March,
changing weather patterns mean changing strategy from trying to change 
the conditions to one of 'coping' with them.

Motorists must also take responsibility for their actions and 'be prepared' - by staying at home if necessary, it says.

Too many drivers failed to heed weather warnings 'and had been caught out or unprepared.'

One of the biggest problems in extreme weather is gritters getting trapped in jams caused by stranded or abandoned cars and 'inconsiderate' drivers, and therefore unable to lay grit

There are also concerns about 'poor driving and lack of experience and skills.'

One of the biggest problems is gritters getting trapped in jams caused by stranded or abandoned cars and 'inconsiderate' drivers, and therefore unable to put down their grit on the affected roads.

The  Highways Agency should consider more removable sections of central reservation barriers to allow gridlocked  snow ploughs and gritters easier access to the points where they are needed.

On potholes the report notes: 'RAC patrols expressed concerns about the  number of potholes in all types of road, and the observation that these are particularly dangerous when it has snowed. Because they cannot be seen.'

'It is inevitable there will be many more requiring repair as a result of this winter.

'Snow and ice not only  exacerbates damage but also hides potholes, through which road users then unwittingly ride or drive.'

Professor Stephen Glaister, director 
of the RAC Foundation, said: 'When we are warm and snug in our modern 
cars it is tempting to think we are immune from the elements and have 
the technological resources to deal with whatever nature might throw at 
us – but the experience is that we do not.

'We need to consider revising our view of what is "normal".

Drivers need more advice on the potential benefits of winter tyres and 'add-ons' such as snow-socks and snow chains, the RAC found

'As the climate appears to change we should not confuse extreme weather with rare weather.'

There was a balance to  be struck between need, expectations and expense.

It said:'Councils could put a gritter and a snow plough round every corner if that is what the public desire but the trade-off is greatly reduced expenditure on other essential services.'

Professor Glaister noted: 'For hundreds of drivers who were trapped in nightmare conditions it will be hard to believe, but this report concludes that by and large the authorities have significantly upped their games in recent years. The reality is that the climate is an evolving beast. No longer can we regard periods of severe weather as isolated incidents. They seem to be getting more frequent and more extreme and the impact of one compounds the effects of another.'

Many drivers do change their travel plans following severe weather warnings, but there are still too many who do not. Despite the severest conditions, some drivers still expect their journeys to be 'normal' it notes: 'They may feel that we have the technological resources to  deal with whatever nature might through at us – but the experience is that we do not.'

But drivers need more advice on the potential benefits of winter tyres and 'add-ons' such as snow-socks and snow chains, as well as keeping adequate – rather than legal minimum -   tread depth on normal tyres  of around 4mm.

Despite common perceptions to the contrary  in Britain , the review says much of Continental Europe also suffers disruption from snow and ice and is just as heavily criticised, though winter tyres are often obligatory.

The report took evidence from the Highways Agency, 32 local authorities in England and Wales, Boots, Asda, the RAC breakdown business and 13 motoring clubs across Europe.
