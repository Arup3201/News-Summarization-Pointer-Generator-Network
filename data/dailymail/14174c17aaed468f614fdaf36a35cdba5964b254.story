A woman who visited McDonald’s for the first time in nearly two years was confronted with a nauseous sight when her ‘healthy’ chicken McWrap was served up ‘raw’.

Shocked Gizela Tahuri posted a disgusting image online of the uncooked chicken she found inside her wrap when she visited a McDonald’s store at Deception Bay, a north 32 kilometres north of Brisbane, in Queensland.

‘So much for healthy choices McDonalds when you serve RAW chicken. I haven't eaten McDonalds for nearly 2 years and now I know why. Mmm I'm not loving it,’ she wrote on Facebook.

'So much for healthy choices': Gizela Tahuri bit into this raw chicken at a McDonald's store in Queensland

The personal trainer told Courier Mail she probably had 'two mouthfuls' of the spicy mayo crispy chicken wrap before realising it wasn't cooked. 

'I thought the chicken was really soft and it looked raw,' Ms Tahuri said.

A McDonald’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We are disappointed that this has happened.

'We take food safety very seriously and have strict processes and systems in place. An investigation is currently underway with the restaurant, and we encourage the customer to contact us to help us to investigate fully.'

The chicken McWrap is advertised as boasting 'a strip of succulent, marinated and crumbed chicken'. It is accompanied by 'fresh Australian lettuce and creamy mayonnaise' and is 'carefully' hand wrapped in a tortilla.

McDonald's have promised to investigate 'fully' what happened at the store in Deception Bay
