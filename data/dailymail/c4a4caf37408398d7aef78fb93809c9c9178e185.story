A massive outbreak of measles last year was triggered by an Amish missionary coming back from the Philippines, it has been reported.

Experts say there were 644 cases of the highly contagious disease across America in 2014 – the highest number in 20 years – with 382 people falling ill in Ohio's Amish country.

It has emerged that a volunteer brought the virus back after working in the Philippines – a country that was already dealing with a major measles outbreak.

'Patient zero' fell ill on his return to the community and was misdiagnosed with Dengue fever before passing the highly infectious disease on to his friends, according to Vox.com.

Jacqueline Fletcher, the public health nursing director for Ohio's Knox County, has described how she was told of a case of the virus in April last year.

She immediately feared a 'perfect storm' since many in the Amish community had rejected the vaccine MMR - which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella - amid fears over potential adverse effects.

At one point she described a household where six teenage children with measles were sitting in the dark.

'They were covered in the spotty rash that's characteristic of the virus, miserable, and sick. It was a scene from the last century,' she said, according to Vox.

The outbreak ended in August last year and although nobody died, nine ended up in hospital with serious cases.

Measles is uncommon in many countries because of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia.

It is uncommon in many countries because of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination.

Early symptoms of measles can be seen at about 10 days after you are infected and include a red-brown spotty rash. This will usually start behind the ears and then spread around the head and neck before moving to the rest of the body, according to nhs.uk.

The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children.

There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. 

But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications.

According to the World Health Organization, the disease remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. Approximately 145,700 people died from measles in 2013 – mostly children under the age of 5, WHO says.

Researchers then launched a study to determine what had caused the sharp increase in cases in the U.S. last year and turned their attention on Americans travelling abroad and returned with the virus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that of the 288 cases in the first half of 2014, 97 per cent were linked to importations from at least 18 studies. Many of the cases were association with people returning from the Philippines.

Measles, considered one of the world's most contagious viruses, brings on fevers and rashes that can last weeks – but in most cases is not deadly. 

According to the World Health Organization, the most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

Around the world, it is still one of the leading causes of death among young children.

More than 90 people have been diagnosed with measles across the U.S. after an infected person visited Disneyland in California

More than 90 people have been diagnosed with measles across the U.S. after an infected person visited Disneyland in California.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged Americans to get vaccinated amid an outbreak that began when the individual visited the theme park in December. 

On Wednesday, a high school in Palm Desert, California barred dozens of non-vaccinated students from attending school over concerns that a classmate may have contracted the highly contagious disease.

Measles was all but eliminated in the United States in 2000 but Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it could still easily be brought in by a traveler from abroad.

'This is a wake-up call to make sure we keep measles from getting a foothold in our country,' she said.

Health officials in California say the virus has been reported in eight states and 67 cases can be clearly linked to Disneyland, according to NBCnews.

The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated.

Dr Schuchat called it 'frustrating' that some Americans had opted out of the vaccine for non-medical reasons, saying it was crucial that they be given good information about the safety and reliability of inoculations.

Asked if health officials were worried about the possibility that the outbreak could be further spread at the Super Bowl in Phoenix, she said only that people everywhere should be on their guard but declined to label the football game on Sunday as an area of special concern.

'I wouldn't expect the Super Bowl to be a place where many unvaccinated people will be congregating,' she said.

The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children.

There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. 

But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia.
