Desk belonged to King Louis XV most famous royal mistress Madame de Pompadour

Furniture dating back to 1757 set to make between £3-5m when it goes under the hammer at Christie's

Madame de Pompadour was once one of the most powerful women in 18th century France thanks to her long-standing affair with King Louis XV.

And while the monarch could not make her his wife, the king wanted to ensure his royal mistress lived in an opulent Versailles apartment decked out in the finest furniture.

Now two items that once took pride of place in the rooms of Madame de Pompadour are going under the hammer at London auction house Christie's.

Going under the hammer: Madame de Pompadour's desk from which she could have written to the King and kept her most private documents

Expensive taste: A desk with gold coloured leafing and Japanese style pannelling is expected to fetch between £3-5million

A desk with a fold down table and lockable draws is expected to fetch between £3-5million while a bureau is valued between £2-4m.

The desk could have been where Madame de Pompadour, who was born Jeanne Antoinette Poisson but given a title by the king after he fell for her charms, penned intimate love letters to her royal beau and kept her most private documents.

Historic: The desk was seen in Madame de Pompadour's apartment in 1757

Christie's treasure: Along with a bureau in the same design, this rare item of furniture will go on sale on Thursday at the London auction house

Renowned designer Lazare Duvaux noted in his journal seeing the desk in the apartment of the famous mistress in 1757. She was famed for her exquisite taste in art and design which is evident in the luxurious pieces that will go on sale on the evening of Thursday, 6 December.

The lacquer furniture by Bernard II van Risenburgh is decorated with gold colour leaf detailing and Japanese designs in porcelain plaques.

Adored: Madame de Pompadour, as depicted in a painting by Francois Boucher, captured the heart of the married king so he made her his royal mistress

The style and design of the pieces is said to be extremely rare, with the only comparable bureau currently in the Royal Collection, in Queen Elizabeth II's private apartments at Windsor.

After Madame
 de Pompadour's death in 1764, the furniture came to the UK and formed 
part of the collection of Dukes of Richmond at Goodwood House, Sussex, 
where it remained until 1993.

It was then owned by Monsieur and Madame Riahi who are now auctioning it off along with a number of other rare items from their collection.

A portrait of Madame de Pompadour in her twilight years

Madame de Pompadour came from  bourgeoisie beginnings to become one of the most powerful woman in 18th century France.

She was named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson when she was born in 1721 and was the illegitimate daughter of a financier exiled for fraud. She was well-educated as her mother hoped that would help her secure a rich husband. She married Charles Guillaume le Normant d'Etoiles in 1741 but they separated legally in 1745 when the king pronounced her the Marquise de Pompadour - his official mistress.

The monarch had fallen for her after meeting her at a ball that year. He moved her into an apartment in the Château de Versailles above his own with a secret stairway so he could visit her whenever he wanted.

As the pair got older, their relationship became platonic but she still acted as one of his main advisors until her death in 1764 - with many blaming her ill-advised foreign policy for the Seven Years' War.
