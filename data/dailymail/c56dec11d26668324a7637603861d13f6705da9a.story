Suspicions: Jude Law, pictured with Sadie Frost, said he was subjected to a 'sustained campaign' of surveillance, pursuit and harassment

News International’s soaring phone-hacking bill was approaching £10million last night after dozens more celebrities and politicians received large payouts.

Actor Jude Law’s £130,000 award was the highest settlement as Rupert Murdoch’s media empire continued to count the devastating cost of the News of the World scandal.

The Oscar-nominated star was one of 18 victims who received a combined total of more than £645,000. There were a further 19 victims whose awards were not disclosed.

All payments were exclusive of legal costs, which News International has agreed to pay and are expected to dwarf the damages. The company has also amassed huge bills for its own legal representation.

Mr Law said he had been the victim of a ‘sustained campaign’ of surveillance, pursuit and harassment, and received damages and a public apology at the High Court.

Solicitors said that yesterday’s 37 awards are merely the ‘tip of the iceberg’.

Police investigating voicemail interceptions by the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire on behalf of the newspaper discovered 5,800 names in his notebooks, of whom they believe about 800 may have been victims of hacking.

Mr Murdoch has already paid out £3million to the parents of murdered schoolgirl  Milly Dowler, and huge six-figure sums to PR man Max Clifford and Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor – quite apart from dramatically closing down the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid.

Next month singer Charlotte Church, comedian and actor Steve Coogan and Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes are among ten more phone-hacking victims taking their cases to court for a full hearing which may provide a ‘tariff’ for future settlements.

The payouts announced yesterday are 
likely to encourage more claims and Mark Lewis, the Dowler family 
solicitor, said: ‘While congratulations are due to those solicitors and 
clients who have settled their cases, it is important that we don’t get 
carried away into thinking that the war is over.

‘This
is just one of the early battles. Fewer than 1 per cent of the people 
who were hacked have settled their cases. There are many more cases in 
the pipeline.

‘There will 
be lots more revelations of wrongdoing and lots more compensation to be 
paid. It is too early to celebrate, we’re not even at the end of the 
beginning.’

Payout: Jude Law, pictured with Guy Ritchie at the Sherlock Holmes 2 premier last night, received a £130,000 payout from News International

The phone-hacking saga began with the conviction in 2007 of private investigator Mulcaire and the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman.

At the time News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers said the hacking, involving the voicemails of royal aides, was an isolated incident.

But the settlement of legal action by Gordon Taylor and Max Clifford led to speculation that phone hacking was more widespread.

Payouts: Lord Prescott, left, received £40,000 compensation while Joan Hammell, his former aide, received the same amount. Gavin Henson, right, who used to date Charlotte Church, received the same amount

As more details of the scandal emerged last summer, NGN decided to close the News of the World and David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry to examine the behaviour of the Press.

The 37 settlements announced yesterday included former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott, who received £40,000 after his voicemails were intercepted, as did his chief of staff Joan Hammell.

Lord Prescott said: ‘This at long last brings clarity, apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone messages by Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers.’

Other politicians who received damages were Labour’s Chris Bryant and Denis MacShane and former Labour MP Claire Ward.

Compensation: Sadie Frost, the designer, received £50,000 while Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole was given an undisclosed amount

Sportsmen who were awarded damages were footballer Ashley Cole and rugby player Gavin Henson.

Statements were read out in court concerning 18 of the victims and in each case the NGN barrister Michael Silverleaf, QC, said it offered its ‘sincere apologies’ for the damage, as well as the distress caused by ‘the unlawful accessing of voicemail messages and obtaining confidential information’.

Gavin Millar, QC, for Mulcaire, said the private investigator – who is also being sued for breach of confidence and misuse of private information – was not involved in agreeing the wording of yesterday’s statements and was not a party to them.

When their marriage ended in 2003, Jude Law and Sadie Frost agreed to remain friends for the sake of their three children.

But as increasingly intimate details of their private life continued to appear in the pages of The News of The World, Mr Law said the pair became ‘distrustful’ of each other and those close to them.

Despite repeatedly changing his mobile phone and even registering it under another person’s name, articles still appeared in the newspaper concerning Mr Law’s personal life.

The increasingly wary actor even hired security consultants to undertake a sweep of his car and house to ensure that no listening devices had been installed, but the intrusive stories continued.

Both he and Miss Frost were also concerned that journalists appeared to know the location of where they were going, even if they had decided at the last moment. Unable to understand how the paper was acquiring such personal information, the actor began to suspect those closest to him.

In reality, he said, ‘no aspect’ of his private life was safe from intrusion by journalists from the paper, who had been illegally accessing both his and Miss Frost’s voicemail messages.

They also hacked the phones of Mr Law’s personal assistant Ben Jackson, and that of Ciara Parks, who represented the actor and his girlfriend Sienna Miller for a period, in the pursuit of stories.

At one point in 2003, an article was published referring to phone calls Mr Law received from his assistant on arrival at an airport.

Even messages left by Mr Law and Miss Frost on the voicemail of their children’s nanny, Jade Schmidt, were intercepted by people working for the Sunday tabloid.

In total, 16 articles about Mr Law were published in the News of the World between 2003 and 2006 based on intercepted material. The paper conceded it had subjected him to ‘repeated and sustained physical surveillance over a number of years’, both in Britain and abroad.

After settling for agreed damages of £130,000 yesterday, Mr Law said the behaviour was ‘appalling’.

‘For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press,’ he said. ‘I started to become distrustful of people close to me.

‘I was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years.’

Miss Frost, who accepted £50,000 in damages, said she ‘could not understand’ how her ‘private information was ending up in the public domain’. As a result she ‘began to suspect everyone close to her’ and she and Mr Law began ‘to suspect each other’, she said.

Others to speak out included Welsh rugby star Gavin Henson, the ex-partner of Charlotte Church, who accepted £40,000 damages after his phone was hacked.

When the News of The World began publishing a series of articles in 2005, he said he ‘initially suspected Charlotte Church’s family of leaking the information and this led to arguments’.

Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole and his solicitor Graham Shear were both targeted by the paper. After accepting an undisclosed sum in damages, the player said he was ‘appalled’ about the hacking.

Nightclub owner Guy Pelly, a close friend of Prince Harry, was also under surveillance by the tabloid, and yesterday received £40,000 compensation.

The businessman said he could not understand how private information ended up in the News of The World, and once phoned his own voicemail remotely only to find it engaged.

Glenn Mulcaire’s notes included Mr Pelly’s mobile phone number ‘and other confidential information about him, his family and friends’.
