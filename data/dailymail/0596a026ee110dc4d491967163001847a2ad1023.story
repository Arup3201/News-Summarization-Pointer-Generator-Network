A family has launched a campaign to make their health insurers cover the costs of a cochlear implant for their six-month-old son after the company said the life-changing procedure was 'elective'.

Nixon 'Wildcard' Hunter, from Tustin, California, was born prematurely and has battled jaundice, gastric tube surgery and open heart surgery. He also suffers from profound hearing loss.

After the family's insurance company, United Healthcare, covered procedures needed to overcome his other health issues, Nixon's parents were stunned when they would not pay for the implant.

Fighter: Nixon Hunter was born premature and has undergone open heart surgery and gastric tube surgery

His mother Stephanie and father Rich learned that the expensive procedure was considered an 'elective surgery' and was not covered by the policy, KTLA reported.

'The fact that my son can't hear me - it 
breaks my heart,' Stephanie Hunter told KTLA. 'That I can't sing to him to soothe him - it breaks me up 
inside.'

They have now launched a campaign onÂ change.org to make insurance companies cover the procedure, which doctors say would help him to hear in his right ear.

They note on the page that the procedure would cost around $125,000 for each ear - which is not something Mr Hunter, an EMT, can afford, he said.

A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound.

It will not cure deafness, but is a 
prosthetic substitute for hearing. The sooner a child receives the 
implant, the less therapy will be needed to help him or her learn 
speech.

The device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours. It involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear.

The devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve. The currents activate the nerve, which sends a signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing.

In the U.S., around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received them.

'The fact that United Healthcare is calling the ability to hear an elective surgery is just unbelievable to us,' Rich Hunter said.

'When you go with a particular 
healthcare plan through your company and pay for it, the expectation is 
that the procedures your family needs the most are going to be covered,' Mrs Hunter added.

But the insurance company said the family are best to take up the issue with their HR department.

The insurance is provided through Stephanie's employer and United Healthcare said the procedure is covered only for its fully insured members.

But the representative said he was looking into the case and hoped to be able to help the family.

For the Hunters, it's about a wider issue - and their desire to help other people across the country in need of the procedure.

'When
we found out that more than 90 per cent of commercial health plans in 
the country do cover cochlear implant surgery, we decided to start this 
petition to fight for Nixon and other families like ours who aren't 
being treated fairly by insurance companies when it comes to hearing 
needs and services,' they write on the petition.

'This is a decision we think is best for our son and we should have the option to choose it for him.

Heartbreak: Stephanie Hunter became emotional as she said she hates how her son can't hear her voice

Hopeful: His parents have now started an online petition in the hopes the company will cover the costs

'United Healthcare should change their policy and allow Nixon, and other children like him, to have the gift of hearing. No one should have to go through what we have, especially when learning is so huge at Nixon's age.'

More than 37,000 people have signed the petition so far.
