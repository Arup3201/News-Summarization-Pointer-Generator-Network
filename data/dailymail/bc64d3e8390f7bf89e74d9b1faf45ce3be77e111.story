The investigation into the murder of a British family in the French Alps has taken a new twist as detectives probe a possible link to Romania.

Police are trying to find out why the brother of Saad al-Hilli - gunned down alongside his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, inside their BMW car close to Lake Annecy - made repeated calls to five numbers traced to Romania.

French detectives have made a formal request to the authorities in the eastern European country for help in identifying who Zaid al-Hilli had been calling.

Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor leading the inquiry, said: 'There were calls made from the phone of Saad al-Hilli's brother to Romania.

'We know calls were made to Romania but we do not know who was at the other end of the line or why the calls were made.

'A formal request for assistance was made to Romania several months ago but so far it has not produced anything.'

'It is simply that we can leave no stone unturned.

'This is part of the masses of data we are gathering month after month.'

Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy

The men's father, Kadhim Al-Hilli, 
died in Spain two years ago, leaving a number of properties and cash 
including the equivalent of some £800,000 in a bank account in Geneva, 
which is less than an hour's drive from the murder scene.

Saad put a legal block on his father's
will, effectively preventing Zaid from inheriting his share until 
'unknown' disputes had been resolved, according to published legal 
documents.

It is also claimed Saad kept a Taser stun gun protection 
weapon at his home in Claygate, Surrey, and had also changed the locks 
of the £1million property.

The French wanted to question Zaid 
over claims that he tried to use an expired credit card to withdrew cash
from the Geneva account shortly before the killings on September 5, 2012.

Mr Al-Hilli was interviewed by French detectives earlier this year close to his home in Chessington, Surrey.

Prosecutors consider Zaid a key 
figure in the case because of an alleged bitter dispute with his brother
over a family inheritance, though he denies any wrongdoing.

He has not been arrested and is not considered a suspect by police.

Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave

Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis were murdered

Mr Maillaud said that because Zaid 
al-Hilli is not being treated as a suspect he had not been asked to 
explain the calls from his phone to Romania.

'Those are the type of questions that 
cannot be asked of a witness in Britain,' the prosecutor said. 'He would
have to be considered a suspect.'

The Romanian link is the latest twist 
in a far-reaching trans-European investigation. So far detectives have 
focused on Britain, Iraq, Switzerland, France and Italy, but this is the
first link to Eastern Europe.

Mr
Maillaud refused to confirm reports in Le Parisien that the phone calls
were made between the Al Hilli family's landline and Romania, or 
between Saad al-Hilli's sister-in-law and Romania.

Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered head injuries after being pistol whipped in the attack and was also shot in the shoulder.

Her sister, Zeena, escaped unscathed after hiding under her mother's skirt in the back of the family BMW.

Both girls are now in the care of social services.

There have been no arrests since the murders happened, with Mr Maillaud admitting that the baffling case 'may never be solved'.
