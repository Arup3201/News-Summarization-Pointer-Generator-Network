Gerard Baden-Clay has applied to be moved into a 'cushy' part of his jail

Wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay has requested to be moved from his maximum security cell and relocated into a more 'cushy' part of his Queensland jail just months into serving a life term.

Baden-Clay, who was jailed  for the murder of wife Allison in June, has applied to move from his 50-bed unit cell inside Wacol's Wolston Correctional Centre, near Brisbane, to the prison's six-bed unit section.

The 43-year-old old has also applied for work inside the prison workshop, part of a requirement that favours applications for an upgrade in living standards.

In order for prisoners to be relocated they must prove they are trustworthy, be working or looking for work and have a good association with prison bosses, The Courier Mail reported.

His application for an upgrade comes just over two months after the 43-year-old was convicted at Brisbane's Supreme Court for the murder of Allison Baden-Clay.

Since then he has been confined to the cells of the Wolston Correctional Centre where a prisoner's day starts at 7.30am for breakfast.

Baden-Clay is walked each morning from his cell for a simple serving of toast or basic cereal.

He is than provided lunch, consisting of two slices of cold meat or a vegetarian alternative with a fruit salad.

Exercise follows thereafter, and headcounts of inmates are conducted routinely alongisde strict eating times.

A serving of chicken, beef or fish and basic vegetables is provided for dinner about 4.10pm before inmates are locked away at 5.30pm.

Among his fellow inmates is Brett Peter Cowan, who was convicted of the 2003 murder of schoolboy Daniel Morcombe on the Sunshine Coast.

It was originally thought that Baden-Clay would be subjected to harsh treatment from fellow inmates but according The Courier Mail this is not the case.

He also has not been invovled in any incidents.

Baden-Clay was escorted by police vehicles which accompanied his prison van on its 22km journey from the court out to Wolston prison after his July sentencing.

Upon his arrival, he was led to one of three holding cells before being strip-searched and was issued green prison uniform and tracksuit, denim jeans and shorts, and a hat.

Two photographs would have been taken for police records and for his  prison ID.

He would have spoken with a psychologist about his mental state and had a physical check before being locked up.

It took a 21 days of deliberations inside the Brisbane Supreme Court, before a jury found the 43-year-old guilty of murdering his wife Allison.

He was been sentenced to 15 years in jail before he is eligible to apply parole.
