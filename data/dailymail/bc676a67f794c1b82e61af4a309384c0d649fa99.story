Ed Miliband today revealed he was 'absolutely convinced' that Britain should stay in the EU - as he ruled out promising a referendum. 

The Labour leader rejected calls from the party's biggest union backer Unite to match David Cameron's pledge or lose votes at the next election.

But Mr Miliband said who had 'no truck' with those wanting to take Britain out of the EU and said a referendum was not one of the country's 'priorities'. 

Foreign Secretary William Hague said Labour was 'too weak to trust the British people'. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband today ruled out offering voters a referendum on Europe - unless there was a transfer of powers to Brussels

 He was backed by Ed Balls who said a pledge now would threaten jobs and investment in the UK. But the Tories accused Labour of not trusting the people

Mr Miliband said: 'There should be an in/out referendum if there is a further transfer of powers from Britain to the EU.

'But I am not going to follow others in saying that we should commit to spending the next three years focusing on an EU referendum in 2017, when we have so many other things to sort out in this country and we need businesses to invest here.

'It is not the priority for the country. Instead we must act now to reform the European Union to make it work for Britain.'

Mr Miliband said: 'Many business people are worried about the drift of our country towards exit from the EU. I understand your worry.

'Let me be clear: I am absolutely convinced that our future lies in the EU.

'For jobs. To tackle big strategic questions from climate change to crime and terrorism. And because I care about the outward-looking character of Britain.' 

Mr Miliband's remarks came after Unite called on Labour to 'urgently reconsider' its opposition to a referendum.

The Prime Minister has pledged to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels if he is re-elected next year. He will then hold an in/out referendum in 2017.

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said denying a referendum would suggest that Labour was part of a 'political elite' that did not trust the electorate.

He told delegates at the union's conference last week that 'ducking this question is seen as part of Labour's commitment to business'.

Unite chief Len McCluskey said blocking a referendum could leave Labour open to accusations that it was part of a 'political elite' that did not trust the public

UKIP leader this week dismissed David Cameron's pledge to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU. He said the Prime Minister was 'whistling in the wind'

But he said: 'That is a vast hostage to fortune. I would not like to be Ed Miliband explaining why he is not joining other parties in offering the British people a vote on something that is clearly a growing source of public concern.

'It is time that Labour's leadership took a new look at the referendum question. We do not seek a referendum to take Britain out of the EU, we seek a referendum rethink in order to help Labour into power.

'Without such a pledge, our party will stand exposed, Ukip will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the Tories will hypocritically charge Labour with being anti-democratic. In a tight election, this can make the difference.' 

Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'It’s the same old Labour: they’re still too weak to trust the British people.

'An EU referendum is about democracy, it’s about dealing with the problem of democratic consent for our EU membership that’s part of Labour’s disastrous legacy: signing away powers from Britain to the EU without the British people’s democratic permission.

'The only way to ensure a referendum on our EU membership in 2017 is to vote Conservative, because Labour won’t give the people their say.'
