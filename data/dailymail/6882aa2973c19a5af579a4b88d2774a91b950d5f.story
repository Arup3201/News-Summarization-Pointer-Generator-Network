Tiny tiddler: The near-record stickleback which was reeled in by angler Craig Birchall

Angler Craig Birchall is the butt of jokes after he caught one of Britain's smallest ever fish - a tiny stickleback that weighed a tenth of an ounce.

Craig, 23, was looking to catch a big roach or perch fish when he cast his rod into a lake.

As he relaxed on the bank his small float bobbed up and down on the surface of the water, prompting Craig to grab his rod in readiness.

When he picked it up he could barely feel anything on his line but reeled it in and found a small spec on the end of his hook.

On closer inspection he identified the catch as a three-spined stickleback, a common tiddler in British waters.

After
laughing to himself about the catch, Craig placed the 1.5 inch-long 
specimen on a set of kitchen scales and it weighed in at three drams, or
5.1 grams.

Although he 
missed out on a record for the biggest ever stickleback, which stands at
four drams, Craig has caught one of the tiddliest of tiddlers ever in 
British angling.

Big catch: Angler Craig Birchall with the stickleback which he hooked with bait

Craig, a palletiser operator from Scunthorpe, Lincs, has been jokingly mocked by friends and family for his not-so-big catch.

He said: 'I was just fishing for roach and perch and was using squatt as bait, which is like a maggot but smaller.

'After a while my float stated dipping up and down and I thought it might be a small perch just messing about.

'So I pulled it in, not really expecting to much on the end of the line, and saw this very small stickleback.

'I weighed it using a set of kitchen scales, took a photo and it then went back into the water safe and well.

'It is the smallest fish I have ever caught and I had no idea it was so close to the record until I checked later.

'My mum, girlfriend and family members have had a good laugh about it because the fish was so small.'

Dr Mark Everard, an aquatic scientist and author of 'The Little Book of Little Fishes' said: 'The three spined stickleback is the most widespread fish in UK waters.

'They do very well in urban waters because they are quite tough.

'They are one of the most smallest species and one of the most important in the food chain as they get eaten by other fish and water birds.'

The current British record for a three spined stickleback was set in 1998 by Dennis Flack in Cambridgeshire.
