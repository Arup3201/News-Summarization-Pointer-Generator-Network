An aide to former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos told an undercover reporter that he was sure Simon Cowell was gay, her drug trial heard yesterday.

The singer’s manager and agent, Gareth Varey, made the extraordinary allegation as he negotiated  a £3million fee for her to star in a fictitious Hollywood blockbuster, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Undercover Sun on Sunday reporter Mazher Mahmood posed as a Bollywood film producer offering Contostavlos a leading role in a British Slumdog Millionaire-style movie.

The singer is alleged to have arranged to supply the fake movie mogul with cocaine worth £820 in a bid to secure the role, saying she was desperate to leave The X Factor, where she was being paid £1.5million.

An aide to former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured, told an undercover reporter that Simon Cowell was gay, her trial heard yesterday

The jury 
was told that after a drunken night out at a nightclub with Contostavlos
 in May last year, Mr Mahmood secretly recorded a 2am conversation he 
had with Mr Varey about The X Factor supremo Cowell.

Mr Mahmood said: ‘Is he gay?’

Slurring his words, Mr Varey answered: ‘Who?’

Mr Mahmood replied: ‘Simon Cowell.’

Mr Varey answered: ‘Yes.’

Mr Mahmood asked: ‘Have you slept with him?’

Mr Varey answered ‘No’, adding ‘One day I will, when I make my move.’

Mr Mahmood continued: ‘But how do you know he is gay?’

Mr Varey replied: ‘I know people who have.’

Since the conversation, Cowell has fathered a baby with his girlfriend Lauren Silverman.

Earlier the
 court heard how Contostavlos arranged for 13.9g of cocaine to be taken 
to Mr Mahmood’s hotel because she believed he was offering her a 
starring role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in a film based loosely on her
 life story as a former ‘bad girl from the ghetto’.

Tulisa's manager and agent Gareth Varey made the allegation about Simon Cowell, pictured right talking to X Factor judges, as he negotiated a £3million fee for her to star in a fictitious Hollywood blockbuster, Southwark Crown Court was told

Jurors were
 shown secretly filmed footage of the N-Dubz singer’s excitement at the 
prospect of a film deal. She said: ‘Well, if the money is there, the 
dates are – I am free.'

Told she 
would star with DiCaprio, Contostavlos said: ‘That’s so weird you say 
that as I had a dream about Leo. To be honest he’s the only actor I’ve 
ever had a crush on.’

But days 
after the drugs were delivered by a friend, Contostavlos realised she 
had been duped in a tabloid newspaper sting, it was alleged.

Yesterday it was claimed she was lured into a trap after her drinks were spiked.

Jeremy 
Dein, QC, defending, accused Mr Mahmood of plying her with drink, 
encouraging her to be a drug dealer and then threatening that Keira 
Knightley would get the part if she didn’t supply the cocaine.

He asked Mr Mahmood: ‘You spiked her drinks to get her to incriminate herself, didn’t you?’

The journalist replied: ‘That’s absolutely outrageous. No, that’s complete and utter nonsense.’

Mr Dein 
continued: ‘You gave Miss Contostavlos the impression she would have a 
better chance of getting the film if she was a drug dealer in real 
life?’

Mr Mahmood replied: ‘Not at all.’

Mr Dein 
said the ploy was ‘irresistible’, adding: ‘Miss Contostavlos was told it
 was to be the first urban British role for a US audience. You knew how 
the story would really be designed to reflect her life.’

The singer 
was flown to Las Vegas for a luxury two-night stay as part of the sting.
 Jurors heard that she insisted staying another night and called 
paparazzi to take snaps of her in a bikini by the pool to show off her 
new tattoo.

As part of the elaborate ruse, Mr Mahmood pretended to take calls from Cameron Diaz and Miss Knightley.

Contostavlos
 is accused of getting her rapper friend Michael Coombs to take ‘white 
sweets’ – alleged code for cocaine – to Mr Mahmood at the Dorchester 
Hotel in London.

Coombs, 36, whose rapper name is Mike GLC, has already pleaded guilty to supplying drugs.

The alleged
 drugs deal was reported in The Sun on Sunday and Contostavlos
 was arrested in June last year, two weeks after she was dropped as an X
 Factor judge.

She denies being involved in the supply of class A drugs.

The trial continues.
