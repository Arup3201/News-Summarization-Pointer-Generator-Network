Henry Stangroom, 21, suffered fatal stab wounds to the heart and lung in the attack at his Clapham home

A young chef was stabbed to death just months after he escaped prison for killing a teenager in a hit-and-run.

The body of Henry Stangroom, 21, was discovered with fatal stab wounds to the heart and lung at his home in trendy Clapham, South-West London.

A 30-year-old man, believed to be his flatmate, was discovered at the scene with neck injuries after apparently attempting to kill himself.

He was taken to a South London hospital where he was arrested on suspicion of murder, the Met said last night.

It is understood that the suspected murderer is being examined for mental health problems.

Last year, Mr Stangroom escaped jail after killing a 19-year-old man in a horrific hit and run accident on a rural road in Hampshire.

He drove three miles in a severely damaged car claiming he was not aware he had hit and killed 19-year-old Jack Bland.

He was sentenced to a suspended eight month prison term after admitting dangerous driving as a judge said his actions ‘beggared belief’.

Detectives believe Mr Stangroom was killed early last week in Lavender Sweep, a short distance from Clapham Junction railway station.

The young man, who worked as a pub chef in Greenwich, on the other side of the capital, moved into the property after his older sister Michelle moved out last year.

His body was discovered by police officers who broke down the front door shortly before 9pm on Thursday night.

Neighbours said the victim’s sister pleaded for help to get inside the flat before his body was discovered by police.

One man said: ‘My housemate had a friend visiting from Australia for two weeks. She heard the doorbell ringing but she ignored it because it wasn't her place.

‘But after a while she went downstairs and there was this hysterical girl who begged her to help her get into the flat saying, "my brother's in there, he needs help."

‘They called the police who came and said there was no sign of life in the flat, to keep her back, and then the rest of the emergency services showed up.’

The man added that detectives believe Mr Stangroom may have been dead for more than a day before they found him.

Candida Wooldridge, 26, who shares a house with Michelle, said her family is ‘dealing with a horrible thing’.

She said: ‘Michelle does not live here anymore, she might be coming back, but after what happened she is understandably spending time at home.’

Neighbours said young people often gathered at the ground-floor flat for noisy late night parties.

They were shocked to discover that a murder had taken place and feared the victim may have lain undiscovered for some time.

Bennedict Austen, 75, said: ‘I feel so scared and frightened. I've had trouble sleeping since Thursday, I haven't been myself, I feel like I've been going potty.

‘Seeing all that going on, seeing the body bag being fetched out, it was like Midsomer Murders.

‘This is such a nice street, lots of lovely people who work and have high-paid jobs or work in TV. I have lived here for 25 years and I have never seen anything like this.

‘They have come and spoiled it now. You don't know what people are like once they have locked their doors.’

Speaking about the flat, she added: ‘You couldn't keep tabs, there were too many people always coming and going in and out.

‘They were very noisy, drinking and all that. Sometimes they were in the back garden, they would laugh loudly and drink all day in the summer.’

Mr Bland was killed by Mr Stangroom as he walked home from a wedding reception along the A287 in Odiham, Hampshire, on September 11, 2011.

He was found by a taxi driver but died hours later in hospital.

Mr Stangroom, who had three penalty points for speeding, was criticised for driving home after his car was badly damaged.

He claimed he thought he had hit a deer and refused to answer questions at an inquest as he did not want to further incriminate himself.

His ground-floor flat has been boarded-up with perforated metal sheeting after forensic teams finished their work.

Bags of rubbish and items of clothing are strewn across the front of the house, with empty McDonalds cartons and other refuse piled up by the door.

A Met spokesman said: ‘Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation at this time.

‘Detectives believe the arrested man was known to the deceased.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
