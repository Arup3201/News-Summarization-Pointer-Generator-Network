The wife of one of Britain's biggest buy-to-let tycoons has been ordered to pay more than £3,000 in overdue council tax on nine of their estimated 1,000 properties.

Judith Wilson, 64, was due to attend court but failed to turn up after her millionaire husband Fergus asked to change the date.

The 66 year-old - who usually represents his wife - made the request because he was filming a forthcoming episode of Panorama about his empire.

Judith Wilson, pictured with her millionaire husband Fergus, was charged with not paying council tax on nine of the couple's properties 

His wife is charged with ten counts of not paying council tax for nine homes which are part of the couple's portfolio.

Magistrates in Maidstone, Kent heard that the local borough council had contacted her number of times to pay up.

Carole Stevenson, court officer for Mid Kent Revenues and Benefits Partnership, requested that 10 liability orders demanding payment be sent to Mrs Wilson in relation to nine properties in the Maidstone area.

The request was approved by the court with a total of £3,288 to be paid, including a £60 summons fee and £500 in costs.

But Mr Wilson had protested it was not their responsibility to pay. 

He disputed claims by Maidstone Borough Council that the properties were unoccupied for more than one month and is now planning to appeal.

The businessman is ranked 453 on The Sunday Times 'Rich List' with a fortune of £180 million and nearly 1,000 properties. 

Speaking after the court case, former professional boxer Mr Wilson said: 'I plan to appeal these orders on the basis that the forms I was sent were impossible to understand and that Maidstone Borough Council said the properties were unoccupied for more than one month which is not the case.

As of last year Wilson and his wife, from Maidstone are thought to have owned nearly 1,000 two and three-bedroom properties around Ashford, Folkestone and Maidstone

'I have had a number of issues with the authority regarding my properties and now I no longer take tenants who are called Wilson, which is the third most common surname in the UK, as there are many instances of me and my wife being asked to pay amounts which those tenants owe.

'I have invested £100million in property in Ashford but not Maidstone simply because I have faced so many problems in the area.

'Business is all about getting along with people and that is the problem with the council. They do not get on with me and as a result there are many single mothers in the borough who need housing but have to stay in bed and breakfasts.

'I wanted to be in court to dispute the charges but unfortunately the reality is I'm a busy man and had important filming to do. I can't be in two places at once.'

He added that he is keen for legislation to be passed that requires land lords to collect council tax from tenants and that he's sure the council are too as this will no doubt stop issues in future. 

As of last year Mr Wilson and his wife, from Maidstone are believed to have owned nearly 1,000 two and three-bedroom properties around Ashford, Folkestone and Maidstone.

In August 2009, Judith Wilson had her court case thrown out by the judge.

She had demanded £3,000 for a new bathroom suite from a tenant who had damaged a cistern lid despite the tenant offering to replace the lid.

A judge branded the claim 'exaggerated', and said he 'had doubts' that work to replace the bathroom suite would ever be carried out.

In January 2014 her husband sent around 200 eviction notices to every tenant getting housing benefit, claiming he had lost around £800,000 because of them.

He told letting agents that he would no longer accept tenants who required housing benefit.

And in April last year he was found guilty of attacking an estate agent over a dispute over a boiler in one of his homes. 

Mr Wilson has said previously he planned to sell his empire and wanted to retire so he could write children's books.

A spokesman for Maidstone Borough Council said: 'Due to the Data Protection Act we cannot go into details about individual cases. However, there are circumstances where an owner of a rental property might be responsible for council tax arrears such as when the property is empty.'
