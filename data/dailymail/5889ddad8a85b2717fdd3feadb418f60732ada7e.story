Olympic hurdler turned bobsled champion Lolo Jones is no stranger to controversy: just last month she criticized her paycheck from the U.S. Bobsledding Team on Twitter, and now she’s at the center of an alleged bar fight in the early hours of Saturday morning.

She was allegedly involved in the early morning altercation with Jenny Enquist, stepdaughter of Tony Carlino, the former head of Team USA who runs the track at Lake Placid. The incident took place after 1 a.m. at Roomers Night Club, a local bar.

Jones is one of a number of athletes currently training at the Team USA facilities at Lake Placid, New York ahead of an important event later this month.

A witness told Deadspin that Enquist was drunk when she confronted Jones, who pushed her to the ground and then left the bar.

Enquist followed Jones outside and they had to be separated by bouncers. Another athlete, Aja Evans, was also allegedly involved.

After the event, USA Bobsled & Skeleton spokesperson Amanda Bird said the organization was looking into the allegations and speaking to the athletes and witnesses that were at the bar.

‘We are treating this like we have with any other situation by investigating to see if there is a code of conduct violation,’ she said. No charges were filed with police.

On Tuesday night, the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said it has found no reason to sanction Olympic hopeful Lolo Jones for her role in the altercation.

The story was first reported on Fox Sports Tonight on Monday by host and former Olympic champion swimmer Amy Van Dyken.

She reported that federation officials gathered athletes after the incident and specifically told them to keep it quiet.

Carlino, known as the ‘Bobfather,’ is a US Bobsled and Skeleton Federation hall of famer who now manages the Olympic Sports Complex in Lake Placid.

Former track star Jones is less than a year into her quest to make the 2014 Olympics in bobsled, but already has a world championship gold medal under her belt.

She is an outspoken figure and some within the sport feel she receives special treatment because of the publicity she brings.

Jones has already found herself in hot 
water this summer after posting a video last month criticizing her check
from the U.S. Bobsledding Team.

Olympic athlete Lolo Jones caused controversy last month when she posted a video mocking her $741.84 paycheck from the bobsled season

Mocking: In the video, Jones appeared to be making a phone call to her landlord, saying she's going to be a 'bit late' with her rent this month; she even shows the amount to the camera

Recording a brief video of herself, the athlete mocks the total amount - $741.84 - that she received from her seven-month season.

In the video, she says: 'Seven months with bobsled season. The WHOLE season. That's it?'

She then appears to be on the phone to her landlord, saying she's going to 'be a bit late' on her rent this month.

Jones has become a well-known sports personality for her outspoken tweets and social media updates.

But she has been criticized for receiving more attention and endorsements in the media that her sporting achievements warrant.

Glamorous: Former teammates say Jones' image and endorsements overshadowed their sporting achievements

Her
social media activity has also got her into some difficulty. In October
last year she caused offense to some after she told a paralyzed former 
football player to 'get checked for concussion' after he challenged her 
on Twitter to a race.

In her tweet, Miss Jones said former 
Rutgers player Eric LeGrand must have 'clearly been hit in the head'. 
She later defended her comments saying she did not know who Eric was.

Fortunately the former footballer didn't take offense.

The athlete was at the center of another Twitter storm earlier this year, when the 30-year-old hurdler announced that she was still a virgin on the micro-blogging site.

And last year it was reported she became embroiled in a nasty cat-fight with two of her USA teammates in the aftermath of the Olympics.

Peers Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who finished second and third respectively in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final, suggested that their medal success was overshadowed by Jones because of the hype around her personal story and a nude photo-shoot for ESPN magazine in 2009.

Jones was the gold-medal favorite for the 2012 London Olympics 100-metre hurdles, but finished fourth.

Four years earlier in Beijing, the American came in as the favorite and was in position to win gold when she hit the ninth of 10 hurdles and wound up seventh.

Miss Jones was one of 24 athletes announced last October as members of last season's U.S. bobsled team, giving her another chance to vie for a spot on the World Cup circuit.

After disappointment in the 2012 Olympics hurdles event, Miss Jones decided to try out for a spot on the national bobsled team, and scooped gold in the World Championships in January

April 2012 - Dating tweets...

Miss Jones has proved to be extremely open about her personal life, particularly dating, and especially on Twitter.

In
the media frenzy run-up to the 2012 Olympics, she tweeted in April: 'If
a guy doesn't return my call, I get mad they give NO reason but if 
twitter ppl [sic] tell me WHY they unfollow me, I get mad they do.'

She also tweeted that month: 'I don't have a hard time finding dates but hard finding the right one to date'

May 2012 - Hard to stay a virgin...Miss
Jones was at the center of a Twitter storm earlier this year, when the 
30-year-old hurdler announced that she was still a virgin on the 
micro-blogging site.

The
Iowa-born star made headlines this summer when she said that staying a 
virgin was 'the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life - harder than 
training for the Olympics, harder than graduating from college, has been
to stay a virgin before marriage.'

Miss Jones said on HBO's Real Sports that it was 'harder than graduating from college'.

'When
I was 22, 24, it was cute,' she said. 'But 24 to 29, it's not cute. You
get judged a lot, a lot of guys won't return your calls after they find
out.'

August 2012 - Snide comments from Olympic team mates...Miss
Jones became embroiled in a nasty catfight with her own Team USA peers 
Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who finished second and third respectively
in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final.

Fellow U.S. hurdlers Ms Harper, 28, and Ms Wells, 30, spoke bitterly about Miss Jones prior to an after-party filled weekend.

During
an interview on NBC Sports, Ms Harper attempted to explain that her own
life story is just as interesting as Miss Jones', who she called the 
media's 'favorite'.

Ms 
Harper said: 'Because their favorite [Miss Jones] didn't win all of a 
sudden it's just like, "We're going to push your story aside, and still 
gonna push this one". That hurt.'

Ms Wells also spoke about Miss Jones, who has gained a large amount of attention since outing herself as a virgin.

She
said: 'Well, I think that, on the podium tonight, the three girls that 
earned their spot, that got their medals and they worked hard and did 
what they needed to do, prevailed. And that's all that really needs to 
be said.'

August 2012 - 'Drooling' with rapper Nas...American
rapper Nasir Jones, known by his stage name Nas, tweeted a picture with
Ms Jones, at a boozey night out at London's Roundhouse, in Camden, the 
week after the Games.

His tweet sparked rumors the pair would leave the party together.

One
commenter wrote on Nas' profile: 'It looks like there's dribble stains 
on her top', the hurdler re-tweeted the image saying: 'I wasn't 
drooling... someone spilled a drink on me... Ok I was drooling.'

October 2012 - Insulting a Paralympian

Miss Jones managed a spectacular gaff after the Games by suggesting former footballer and Paralympian Eric Legrand  'get checked for concussion' after he challenged her on Twitter to a race.

In
response to inadvertently insulting the sportsman, Lolo tweeted: 'Great
I'm gona get murdered for the tweet. When I had no clue who that dude 
was. Just responding to any athlete who challenges me to a race.'

While
she received an outburst of criticism from followers on twitter and 
other social media, paralympian Eric LeGrand, took to the airwaves 
himself to calm the situation, tweeting: 'This stuff between @lolojones 
is ridiculous, she is a great person who misunderstood what I tweeted. 
People stop bashing her it's not right.'
