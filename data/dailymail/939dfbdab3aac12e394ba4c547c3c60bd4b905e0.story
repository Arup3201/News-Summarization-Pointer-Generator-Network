Australian restaurants are using the internet to sniff out information about the eating habits of their diners.

Online reservation sites, social media and Google searches are being used to track the dining experience of food lovers.

By simply browsing these sites, restaurants can find out every little tidbit about their diners - including the quantity of food ordered, whether or not a person is a generous tipper, their attitude towards wait staff or how long they stayed after a meal finished.

Stevan Premutico - chief executive officer of online reservation site dimmi.com.au - said the data mining was all part of the process of the restaurant's process of getting to know their customers.

'What they look like, their job, their title, where they live, their social connections, any special celebrations and whether they are an avid foodie are all key things,' Mr Premutico told Good Food.

The site's most shared information among restaurants was food and wine preferences, noteworthy habits, seating preferences, allergies and how a customer tips - good or bad.

But Dimmi's ResDiary takes it one step further by providing restaurants with a coding system to indicate a person's dining quirks, including if a person is a wine connoisseur, an adventurous eater, a get-in-get-out diner or acquainted with the chef or owner.

There are also codes for diners who talk loudly, regular reservation no-shows or demanding customers - PIAs also known as pain-in-the-ass customers.

Other information restaurants can gain from ResDiary are the customer's postcodes, if a diner is an 'upgrader' who love all the trimmings to a meal - including a drink or coffee after eating - and the level of attractiveness of a customer. Mr Premutico said some joints seated people based on their looks.

By doing their homework, some restaurants are reaping the benefits.

Information available includes whether or not a person is a good tipper, how long they stay at the restaurant after finishing their meal and even if they are attractive or not

Darran Smith - who has been in the restaurant business for 20 years - said he strived to find more about his customers - from politicians to lawyers to movie stars.

'I remember (Hollywood actor) Owen Wilson was coming in and finding out he really likes tequila so I made sure the bar was stocked with tequila...It paid off,' he told Good Food.

Mr Smith also remembers the time he found out via Google that one of his diners at Bondi Beach's Icebergs Dining Room and Bar had sold his company the day before and ended up spending $5000.
