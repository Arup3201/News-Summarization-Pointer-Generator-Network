Anti-terror police in Kenya have accused the British of ignoring their warnings that Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was a dangerous radical.

Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of leading a jihadist plot to cross the border into lawless Somalia and join the ranks of the Al Shabaab terrorist group.

But the Kenyans claim that when they presented their evidence to the British Embassy, it was insisted Adebolajo had no criminal record.

Sources in Kenya also claim the 
British Embassy put them under pressure to release Adebolajo after he 
complained he had been tortured, starved for two days and denied access 
to a lawyer.

And another Kenyan source yesterday claimed the British failed to help them build a case against Adebolajo.

Adebolajo was detained for several days before being deported to the UK.

It came as Adebolajo’s family claimed harassment by MI5 in the months before the attack may have ‘pushed him over the edge’.

On his return to the UK from Kenya, 
family members claim he was ‘pestered’ by MI5 agents who tried to 
recruit him as an informant and infiltrate Islamic extremist groups.

Adebolajo’s brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr 
claimed the intelligence services put Adebolajo under pressure to spy on
Muslim clerics and become an informer.

Mr Zuybyr, who is married to 
Adebolajo’s sister Christiana, said: ‘That is what [Adebolajo’s] family 
is saying: that the secret service pushed him over the edge.’

He said Adebolajo was ‘elated’ following the birth of his child, but ‘then things became a little strange’.

The family of Adebolajo, pictured during a 2007 march in London, said he was harassed by MI5 in the months before the attack

Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Mr Zuybyr said Adebolajo went to Nairobi in 2010 to study Arabic and Islam.

Following his return to England, Mr Zuybyr said authorities repeatedly questioned family members about Adebolajo.

His elder brother, Jeremiah, who had 
gone to Saudi Arabia to teach English, was arrested and quizzed. And Mr 
Zuybyr said he was questioned at gunpoint when he visited Yemen four 
years ago to learn Arabic with his wife.

He said: ‘When I came back to Britain,
MI5 contacted me and showed significant interest in Michael. I was 
harassed for a while, with constant calls from people claiming to be 
from the FBI.’

In Kenya, Adebolajo was seized with 
five others after travelling by speedboat to an island off the coast 
near Lamu Island, 68 miles from the Somali border.

A married couple who owned a guest house where they had been staying and a worker were also arrested.

The Kenyans believed Adebolajo, 28, 
had played a crucial role in recruiting his co-accused, including two 
secondary school-aged boys, after they were radicalised during weekly 
visits to a mosque in Mombasa.

It is believed the Kenyan cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo – who was killed by gunmen in Mombasa last year – had helped to fund the men.

Adebolajo was eventually deported without charge but the Kenyans insist they warned the British that he was dangerous.

Mombasa’s anti-terrorist police chief Elijah Rop said: ‘We advised the British police about the man but they ignored us.

‘That is the man we deported to the UK
in 2010 after discovering he is among Islamic radicals who were 
recruited to train as Al Shabaab in Somalia three years ago.’

killing. It was claimed that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six 
months ago

At the 
time of Adebolajo’s arrest, the security services were aware of the risk
that radicalised British Muslims were heading to Somalia to join with 
Al Shabaab, which has links to Al Qaeda.

Only two months before, the then-head 
of MI5 Jonathan Evans had warned Britons were training in Somalia and it
was ‘only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets 
inspired by those who are today fighting alongside Al Shabaab’.

It is now accepted that Al Qaeda cells in Mombasa were at their peak around 2010.

Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive 
‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay is still on the run over 
her role in a suspected plot to bomb western hotels in the city.

However the security forces appear to 
have been relaxed that Adebolajo – who was travelling under the name of 
Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo – may have been prepared to train and fight 
with the brutal Al Shabaab.

Kenyan government spokesman Muthui 
Kariuki said: ‘We handed him to British security agents in Kenya and he 
seems to have found his way to London and mutated to Michael Adebolajo. 
The Kenyan government cannot be held responsible for what happened to 
him after we handed him to British authorities.’

After their arrest Adebolajo  and the 
eight co-accused were taken to Mombasa and spent a number of days in 
prison before appearing before a magistrate.

Kenyan detectives suspected Adebolajo 
may have been a ringleader because he was most vocal in court and 
appeared to know how to ‘play the system’.

In court he claimed: ‘We are being tortured by police and we haven’t eaten for two days now.

‘We have been denied the right to talk
to our family members and lawyer. We are being treated as criminals and
we are innocent.’

The court told police it had three 
days to build a case but after the clean bill of health from the British
embassy Adebolajo was deported.

Another Kenyan source yesterday 
accused the British of failing to help them build a case against 
Adebolajo. He said: ‘It was a major anti-terror investigation and we 
were given three days by the courts to build up a case.’

Last night the Foreign Office 
confirmed Adebolajo had been arrested in 2010 and it gave consular 
assistance ‘as normal’ in the circumstances.

A Foreign Office statement said: ‘We 
can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. The 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided consular assistance as normal 
for British nationals.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
