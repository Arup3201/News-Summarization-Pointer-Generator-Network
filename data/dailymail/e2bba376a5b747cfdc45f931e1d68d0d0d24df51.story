Australia's richest MP turned heads this morning, rolling up to Parliament House in Canberra in a sparkling vintage-style grey Rolls Royce.

The eccentric member for Fairfax, who made his billions in the mining industry, chose the passenger seat for his dramatic entrance to Capital Hill, delivered by a private chauffeur.

AAP reports Mr Palmer was listening to Van Morrison as he stepped out of the extravagant vehicle and into a press pack interviewing Labor's Brendan O'Connor about employment figures.

Maverick Palmer quickly stole the show, with the assembled media more interested in his penchant for luxury travel than the political lines being peddled by the member for Gorton.

'Members of parliament really don't need comm (Commonwealth) cars that cost the taxpayer a lot of money,' he told reporters when asked about his choice of transport.   

'That money could be better spent giving it to pensioners.'

He added that members without a Rolls Royce in their garage should catch a taxi to work.

Mr Palmer was pressed on whether his snazzy ride was an inappropriate look when arriving for a sitting of the House of Representatives.

He remained defiant, telling reporters that any Australians - regardless of race, colour, wealth or creed - had the opportunity to become parliamentarians.

'I would say only two per cent of Australians have lobbyists in Canberra, the other 98 per cent are unrepresented,' he said.

'I am here to represent them.'

Summing up the bizarre interruption, Brendan O'Connor - the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations - remained philosophical.

'Clive's Clive,' he said.

'If he wants to present that way, of course, that's entirely up to him.'

Clive Palmer's Palmer United Party recently earned official registration in the Northern Territory.

He is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion and has plans in place to build a full-length replica of the RMS Titanic.
