Sir Paul: 'If your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children, you should not have them'

Couples who want to have children should get married to provide a stable family environment, a High Court judge said yesterday.

Sir Paul Coleridge said would-be parents have ‘responsibilities and duties to do right by [children]’, while also accusing politicians of displaying a ‘high level of ignorance’ towards the virtues of married life.

The senior judge, who will retire from the bench next year after a career as a family lawyer and judge, said: ‘If your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children, you should not have them.

'If your relationship is stable enough to cope with the rigours of child rearing, then you should consider seriously adding the protection of marriage to your relationship.’

Almost half of births in England and Wales are now from unmarried mothers, according to the Office for National Statistics, which recorded a record figure of 47.5 per cent last year. 

The family court judge’s remarks follow a report by a think-tank he founded warning that unmarried couples are four times as likely to break up than married couples. The research by the Marriage Foundation also said unmarried couples accounted for more than half of family breakdowns.

Sir Paul, who has long been known for his strident, common-sense views on the issue of children and divorce, told the Daily Telegraph that the lack of support from colleagues on his views around marriage was partly to blame for his decision to step down from the judiciary next year.

While insisting that he did not mean to ‘preach morality’, Sir Paul said many in the upper echelons of the establishment believe that cohabitation and marriage are indistinguishable.

He said: ‘There is this idea out there that it doesn’t make any difference whether you cohabit or marry [to which I say] no it doesn’t – except one tends to last and the other tends not to last.’

Sir Paul also criticised selfish parents for being more concerned with their own ‘rights’ than the welfare of their children.

He said: ‘In the courts people talk about
 their rights – you have no right where children are  concerned. What 
you have are responsibilities and duties to do right by them.’

Family values: Children will benefit from having stable married parents, said Sir Paul (posed by models)

Despite his impassioned defence of marriage, Sir Paul insisted that he was not suggesting that only those who are married should have children. He added: ‘I don’t think they should have children until they are sure that their relationship is stable enough to cope with the stresses and strains.’

Almost six out of ten pregnancies in England and Wales were outside marriage in 2011, records from the Office for National Statistics showed.

The 57 per cent of conceptions to women who were not married compared with 52 per cent in 2001 and 44 per cent in 1991.

A higher proportion of conceptions outside marriage end in abortion than those among married women.

The latest figures show that just under seven out of ten conceptions to unmarried women ended in a birth, compared to more than nine out of ten pregnancies among married women.

Motorbike enthusiast: Sir Paul Coleridge is a staunch defender of children after more than four decades in family law

Sir Paul Coleridge, 64, who is to retire after more than 40 years as a family lawyer and judge, has for years been an outspoken defender of children in family break-ups.

Last week the straight-talking lawyer called upon warring parents to think of the impact of divorce in terms of the 'sheer pain and human suffering' it causes to children.

He said: 'The children [of divorce] are given no choice, are never consulted, and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives, slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives.'

Married to Judith since 1973, he has three children and three grandchildren, and enjoys motorbikes, gardening and spending time in the Dorset countryside.

He says he and his wife have been through 'good times and bad times' but says the key is to keep going.

'People also seem to think good, stable marriages arrive fully formed and drop out of the sky, and if you're lucky you'll catch one,' he said.

'But actually, long, stable marriages are carved out of the rock of human stubbornness and selfishness and difficulties. The way you make them work is by chipping away bits over the years so you end up with something beautiful.'

Last year he set up the Marriage Foundation think-tank to champion marriage as a source of strength for families with children.

He said: 'I have seen the fall-out from these broken relationships.  There are an estimated 3.8million children currently caught up in the family justice system.  That is a complete scandal.'

A year ago, Sir Paul blamed the curse of Hello! magazine and other similar glossies for giving young people unrealistic expectations of marriage, saying aspirations based on celebrity lifestyle were 'dangerously flawed'.

And in 2011 he said: 'Divorce is easy in the sense that obtaining a divorce is easier than getting a driving licence.

'It's a form-filling exercise and you'll get your divorce in six weeks if everyone agrees.'

And he said there was no longer a stigma attached to divorce.

'In about 1950 you weren't allowed in the royal enclosure at Ascot if you were divorced,' Sir Paul said. 'That now would exclude half the Royal Family.'
