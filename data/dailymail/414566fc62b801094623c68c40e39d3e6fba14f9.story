The Leaning Tower of Pisa is more than a degree straighter than it used to be when it got its name.

But luckily, there is another iconic Italian landmark ready to take its place in the wonky hall of fame.

Rome's world famous Colosseum is now around 40cm (16 inches) lower on the south side than on the north.

Gladiatorial struggle: Experts have been monitoring the sight for several months to see if urgent repairs are needed

Concerned authorities are investigating whether it needs urgent repairs, after experts noticed the incline about a year ago.

Rossella Rea, director at the 2,000-year-old monument, revealed in Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Sunday that officials have been monitoring it for the past few months.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa, another of the country's most popular attractions, was reopened in 2001 after being shut for more than a decade as engineers worked to prevent it from falling over and to make it safe for visitors.

Restorers' efforts to clean off centuries of grime from the Tuscan landmark helped stabilise the historical building by removing soil from beneath one side of its foundations.

Before and after: The Pisa landmark's lean was straightened by just over a degree from 1990 to 2001, though there is still a significant - but not dangerous - tilt, as shown on the right

The tilt was reduced from 5.5 degrees from the perpendicular, to only 3.99 degrees away from perfectly straight.

Now Ms Rea has asked Rome's La Sapienza University and environmental geology institute IGAG to launch a study into the Colosseum, with investigations to be concluded in a year.

Tests have also started to observe the effects that traffic on nearby busy roads may have on the monument.

Professor Giorgio Monti, from La Sapienza's construction technology department, warned there may be a crack in the base below the amphitheatre.

Off-kilter: There are fears over Big Ben's stability as the tower's title of 0.26 degrees is said to be visible to the naked eye

'The slab of concrete on which the Colosseum rests, which is like a 13-metre (yard)-thick oval doughnut, may have a fracture inside it,' he told the newspaper.

He said intervention along the lines of the stabilisation work carried out in Pisa could be necessary if the concerns are confirmed, but he added that it was too early to judge what kind of intervention would be most suitable.

The Colosseum - famous for hosting bloody gladiator fights in the days of the Roman Empire - attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and is usually packed with visitors.
