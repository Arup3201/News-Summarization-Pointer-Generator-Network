This is the incredible moment that bichon frisé Leo was carried away from a devastating fire at Manchester Dogs' Home - just 20 hours before being reunited with his overjoyed owner.

Dawn Bradbury, 29, was convinced her two-year-old dog had perished after the blaze swept through the animal shelter on Thursday, claiming the lives of more than 60 dogs.

The fire, believed to have been started by an arsonist, prompted an outpouring of generosity from animals lovers around the world and even caused a standstill on the M6 earlier today, as people flocked to donate food and blankets to the home.

But a determined worker had plucked little Leo from the burning home in a round-the-clock rescue effort by staff, volunteers and firefighters.

The rescuer was seen clutching the frightened pet under her arms as she frantically made off from the wreckage, carrying him to safety.

Reunited: Twenty hours later, Dawn Bradbury, 29, was reunited with her beloved pet, despite fearing he had been killed in the blaze

And today, Ms Bradbury 'cried tears of joy all day' as she and her children were finally reunited with their beloved pet at their home in Offerton, Stockport.

She told the Telegraph: 'It is a miracle and we have been crying tears of joy all day. We are absolutely delighted.'  

Ms Bradbury was due to collect her pet on Friday after he was found wandering the streets by a local dog warden earlier in the week.

When she heard about the suspected arson attack, she raced to the home, fearing the worst.

She knew Leo was being kept in 'adoption row' - the part of the home which was  gutted by the fire.

Before realising he had been rescued, Ms Bradbury said: 'I have been awake all night and haven't slept. I spent all night down at the dogs' home to try and locate him, it was horrendous.

'I have four kids here and they are all screaming and crying for him.'

Ms Bradbury had been due to collect him on Friday, but a devastating blaze broke out on Thursday night 

But 20 hours later, Ms Bradbury went to the home where the surviving pets were being kept and found Leo.

She said: 'I stayed there most of the night just praying that he would be ok and pestering the wardens and police for news. 

'Eventually I had to go home because I was convinced he had died. I found out he was in Block Five which is where the fire was. 

'There were two other Bichon Frises who could have been Leo and I have promised to adopt them both. I could not leave therm there after all that has happened.' 

Firefighters said the 150 dogs rescued from the blaze at 7pm on Thursday had been moved to a sister site, Cheshire Dogs' Home. Several of those killed were days away from being taken to a new home.

A 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of deliberately starting the fire, but the teenager has been bailed pending further enquiries. 

Today, hundreds of families set off for the charity’s sister site in Warrington today loaded with blankets, food and other items.

More than £1,275,000 has been raised for the kennels. Food and blankets have also been donated

But staff soon issued a warning, asking people to stay away after massive tailbacks were reported on the M6 motorway.

Service stations close to the site have agreed to act as drop-off points for people wanting to help.

Manchester & Cheshire Dogs' Home said: 'We've gridlocked the M6 & Warrington, can donations now be done next w/end, police concerned with H&S (health and safety) wow, we've stopped the M6.'  

Police confirmed that 53 dogs had died in the blaze, which home manager Lisa Graham said was concentrated in kennels dedicated to dogs which were ready for adoption. All but two of those dogs died. 

Truck-loads of food have been donated to the home by kind-hearted members of the far and wide community

It took 30 firemen just over an hour to bring the blaze under control.

But, after the fire, money poured in to the home’s JustGiving page from as far afield as Australia, the US and Canada, as thousands of social media users posted ‘dog selfies’ to promote the cause. 

The craze has helped received more than £1,275,682 for the Manchester kennels.The

The hashtag #ManchesterDogsHome was the top trending topic on Twitter last night, as dog owners across the UK donated after posting pictures of their pets online.

Celebrities including  Piers Morgan, Phillip Schofield, Kate Lawler and former TOWIE star Maria Fowler encouraged their Twitter followers to donate.

The dogs home was so overwhelmed with donations that a spokesman said police were concerned about health and safety

Lisa Graham, who works at the kennels, said: 'To think that for the length of time we've served this community and the many generations we've been serving this community and that one of them would come and do this to us is sickening.

'We had staff here last night that were coming out of the kennels in tears with dogs they knew. There were dogs in there that they cared for that they lost.' 

Thousands of selfies featuring dogs – alone or snuggled up to their owners – soon appeared on social media with messages of support.

Tia Louise Hibbert posted a picture of her jack russell with the message: 'My Jack-Jack was very upset when he heard the news ... donated x'.

Many shared photos of dogs adopted from the Manchester home. Catherine Young captioned her pet's picture: 'I've donated ... that's where my family got me from x'.
