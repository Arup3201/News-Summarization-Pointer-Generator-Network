A defiant father is refusing to leave the £1million house he built himself despite being completely surrounded by fields of muddy floodwater on the Somerset Levels.

Builder Sam Notaro, 40, has kept the house in Moorland safe from the rising floodwater by building his own flood defences which consist of a five-foot deep moat around his house, brick waterproofing and a pump system.

He insisted his partner and their two young children left in case the defences breached, but Sam refused to evacuate despite the impending storm and inevitable deluge.

An Englishman's home: Sam Notaro built his own flood defences to protect his four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset

Marooned: Sam Notaro is keeping his house dry by using a moat, water-proofing and a pump system. He built the house himself four years ago

Mr Notaro spent around £1million building his four-bedroom detached home from scratch and moved into it just two-and-a-half years ago.

The home sits on a four-acre plot which is the highest point in Moorland.The house was built on a spot which according to records had never previously flooded - and Mr Notaro is determined to maintain the record.

The flood water is currently 2ft away from the top of the barrier and any water which breaches his blockade is quickly pumped back out of the house.

He has also wrapped the bottom of his house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks.

The father-of-two is using diggers to make sure the defences remain firm under the mounting pressure

Mr Notaro said: 'All around the house is completely flooded but because we've built a band around it we've managed to stop it actually coming into the house.

'If we hadn't have put the band around the house it would be completely flooded now.

'As it stands the barrier we've built is about 2ft higher than the water, so that's how much more we're hoping it'll take.

'Obviously
 it might collapse if the pressure of the water gets too much. For about
 three days solid we've been pumping water out with two big pumps and 
stopping it from getting in. It's our home. I'm determined to stay here 
and look after it.

'I won't be able to get out of here now anyway - the water all around the house is up to my waist.

'We can't even get up and down the drive. I've got to stay here. I need to man the pumps anyway.'

A friend in need:  Mr Notaro's neighbours have delivered food to the home and helped keep the water at bay

Mr Notaro's partner Alana O'Dell, 31,
 and their two children, who are 18-months-old and 20-weeks-old, left 
the house on Tuesday.

He added: 'My friend came out last night on his boat and delivered me some food. It's a disaster area around here.

'Rescuers waded through waist deep water at 2am to knock on the door and tell me to leave.

'I told them I wasn't going and they just shook my hand and said fair play, good luck.' Sam brought his land with Alana nearly four years ago.

Knowing
 that the area was vulnerable to flooding they ensured the house was 
built as high as the Environment Agency would allow - much higher than 
any recorded flood.

In spite of this their house is now completely surrounded by water 3ft deep in the lowest points and 8ft deep in other areas.

Mr Notaro added: 'We brought the land four years ago. When we brought it we were sure that it would be safe from flooding.

'The
 land around here has always been managed well to prevent flooding. We 
brought it and knocked the old farm house here down and started again. 'We
 spent about £1 million on the house - buying the land and then actually
 building and decorating the house. It took us about 18 months, then we 
moved in.

'Just to be on
 the safe side we made sure we built the house higher than the highest 
recorded flood. Ironically we wanted to build it higher than we did but 
the Environment Agency wouldn't allow it. The water level is higher than
 ever at the moment and that's how the house has ended up at risk.

'We all know it's called "Moorland" 
but it's not meant to flood like this. All four of my acres are under 
water now. Another thing that's upsetting is how much this will have 
devalued the house - if we want to ever sell it now we'll struggle.'

The
 builder's planning has saved him from some of the most destructive 
weather the UK has encountered in years. But the torrential rain and 
powerful winds is far from over.

Sam Notaro is the last man standing in flooded Somerset - after creating improvised flood defences around his home

Winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the Atlantic tomorrow, in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter.

Flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more. Yet again, the worst hit will be the South West of England, where coastal homes and businesses have been severely damaged.

The flooded Somerset Levels meanwhile, where hamlets have been turned into 'ghost villages' after homes were evacuated due to rising flood waters, is also expecting a new deluge of torrential rain.

Royal Marines who had been in the region building sandbag defences were drafted in to assist with the evacuation of residents in the village of Moorland this morning.

Two weather systems are on course to collide in the coming days, bringing more than an inch of rain to some areas.

The warning came as Prime Minister David Cameron faced growing pressure over the floods. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last night said an extra £130million was needed for emergency repairs and clean up.

He criticised the Environment Agency, saying its chairman, Labour peer Chris Smith, was wrong to suggest the countryside would have to be sacrificed to protect urban areas. ‘We will work to defend both town and country,’ Mr Pickles said.

Lord Smith has faced criticism for the quango’s decision to stop dredging rivers in flood-prone areas. After claiming that Britain must choose between saving ‘the town or country’, he is sure of a vocal welcome from locals, many of whom have called for him to resign.

King Canute, pictured right, also known as Canute the Great, lived between 985 and 1035.

Although Danish he was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time.

Canute's claim to the throne of England was initially rejected by this country's noblemen so he returned home.

There raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the Thames.

According to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide.

He tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned.

However, some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery.

After his death Canute was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester.

However, during the English Civil War, his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered.

His bones remain at Winchester Cathedral but are intermingled with those of other deceased English kings.
