Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 

A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard.

Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin.

In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing.

At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne.

The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs.

However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. 

She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves.

She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with.

'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.'

She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'.

Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious.

When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time.

Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs.

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs.

She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs.

'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on.

'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known.

'She was gullible, naive and easily-led.

'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'
