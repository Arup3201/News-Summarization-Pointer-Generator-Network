With a vast selection of clipper gradings, combs, scissors and mirrors and television screens from wall to wall, these images are not too far removed from the scene at scores of barbershops on High Streets all over the UK.

But while some of the paraphernalia and equipment adorning the walls and worktops might seem familiar, the culture that accompanies them might not.

Much more than being somewhere frequented out of vanity and a far cry from some of the more glamorous salons we might be used to in the UK, this fascinating collection of photographs show how barbershops in west Africa are a place to relax, socialise and meet up with friends.

Life style: One of Andrew Esiebo's photographs taken of a barber shop named after the U.S President in Mali. The photographer has travelled across west Africa capturing the culture surrounding African barbershops

Diversity: Some of the barbershops captured by Esiebo would look at home in the western world, while some, including this one in Liberia are little more than makeshift huts

Tools of the trade: As well as taking pictures of the barbers and their customers, Esiebo also took pictures of some of the equipment they use

Seats one: This barbershop in Senegal, which is sandwiched between a clothes store and a vacant unit, is only big enough for one customer at a time

Hair idols: Much like anywhere else, many of the hairstyles requested in Africa are influenced by musicians and sports stars. This is apparent from the giant picture of Tupak Shakur in this Ivory Coast barbers

Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo 
has explored the barbershop culture in an attempt to show how, like the 
English pub, the barbershop can be a sort of cornerstone of society in 
some African towns and cities.

The
34-year-old told the New York Times: 'The barbershop is an intimate 
space where people come to discuss what they cannot speak about in their
homes or in public, including politics and even their lovers.

'It’s one of the few spaces where people from different walks of life, from different classes, mix.'

His photographs were taken in seven west African countries - Liberia, Mali, Ghana, Senegal, Benin, Mauritania and Ivory Coast - and feature high end barbers all the way down to establishments that are no more than one man with a pair of scissors and a chair.

Sense of community: Barbershops like this one in the Ivory Coast are not just somewhere to go and get a haircut, but also a good place to socialise or just relax

No nonsense: Some of the tools used to cut hair in this Ivory Coast shop look archaic compared to what we're used to at UK salons

Quiet time: These two barbers sit and wait patiently for a customer in their shop in Ivory Coast

Upmarket: This barbershop is perhaps one of the swankiest among Esiebo's pictures. Football seems to have an influence on many of the shops

But according to Esiebo, many of the 
styles and what they tell us about the individual choosing to have their
hair cut that way transcends nations, cultures and political division.

While some of the barbers were 
relatively plush and some as basic as you can get, most seem to be 
adorned with pictures of icons of black culture, sport and music - the 
inspiration for many of the haircuts requested.

Esiebo found that often the 
hairstyles reflect the way that the customer wants to be perceived - in 
some parts dreadlocks are the sign of a 'ruffian' while in others a 
style with a fancy pattern is a clear show of the wearer's artistic 
prowess.

Colourful: This barbershop in Mali is covered wall to wall with posters of sports stars, musicians, pinups and even U.S President Barack Obama

Family affair: The barber in this shop in Liberia has brought his daughter to work and she makes the most of the lack of customers by relaxing in the chair

Something for the weekend, sir? This customer checks himself out in the mirror at a barbers in Mali

Hangout: A customer in Ghana keeps in check with the latest football score while getting his hair cut. Alongside pictures on the wall of the likes of Barack Obama and the Jackson Five is Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard

Different styles: Once again football is an influence on the decor in Mali, but this barbershop features something akin to a menu of possible haircuts

Exhibition: A selection of Esiebo's pictures have gone on display as part of the permanent collection at the Musée du quai Branly in Paris

New 'do: A variety of Esiebo's subjects pictured before and after their haircuts and shaves

In some of the more restrictive 
Islamic countries such as Mali or Senegal, the haircut can be a 
statement of freedom and individuality.

Esiebo was inspired to take the 
photographs after talking to a barber in Lagos who said that he 
regularly cut the hair of a former Nigerian president.

That made Esiebo realise the important role of the barber in west African society.

Ten of his photographs have just gone on display as part of the permanent collection at the Musée du quai Branly in Paris.
