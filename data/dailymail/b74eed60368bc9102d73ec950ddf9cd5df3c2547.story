Four drunken teenagers beat a man to death in a savage attack in an underpass before going on to a party, a court heard.

The group - three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 at the time and a girl who was 16 - launched a vicious group assault on Michael Green, 23, which left him with fatal head injuries, Cambridge Crown Court heard.

Mr Green was hit twice  with a vodka bottle by the 16-year-old boy, knocking him to the floor, before the other boys kicked and stamped on him repeatedly as he lay dead or dying in May, the jury was told.

The girl then walked over to his prostrate body and stamped on his face in apparent revenge for him accidentally striking her earlier that evening, the court heard. 

Bretton murder victim Michael Green was  beaten to death by four teenagers on their way to a party, a court has heard

Jane Bickerstaff QC said: 'It began with a vicious assault by the 16-year-old using a weapon inflicting brute force to Michael Green's head and causing him to fall to the floor. He never got up from that blow.

'The other three defendants saw that blow and saw its effects clearly. They saw Michael Green fall to the floor. They then got in on the act using ... either their fists or their feet while Michael Green remained on the floor defenceless.'

All four defendants had been drinking heavily before the attack, the court heard, including two who had been bought vodka by Green and spent the afternoon and early evening drinking with him at his home in the Bretton area of the city.

Green was also heavily drunk and affected by medication he was also taking.

The defendants, all but the youngest of whom are now 17, all deny murder and grievous bodily harm.

The girl also denies a charge of attempting to pervert the court of justice relating to claims she tried to make a witness change her evidence before the trial. 

The 23 year-old was found dead by a dog walker in a subway in Peterborough, on May 28 this year

The court heard that while drinking at his home earlier with the 16-year-old girl, the 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old female friend of theirs, Green became very drunk and came on to the 15-year-old, making her feel 'uncomfortable', and urging her to dump her boyfriend, the then 16-year-old defendant.

When the 17-year-old defendant told Mr Green to stop he became violent, pinning him by the throat.

The court heard Mr Green was on antidepressants and painkillers after fracturing his collarbone and should not have been drinking while taking them. 

Mr Green's mother, Barbara, told the jury that, despite not wearing a sling, her son had nevertheless been in some pain from his collarbone injury, caused by falling from a tree, and still could not lift his arm up to his head.

She said he had appeared drunk on the night of his death but when she told him not to go out he swore at her.

'I said 'You should go to bed, you are not well, you have a bad shoulder and you are not in the right mood',' Mrs Green added.

She thought the two girls at the house looked under-age but her son told her they were 18, she said, adding that he said knew them through Facebook.

She described his hitting of the female defendant as an accidental 'flamboyant' wave of the arm for which he immediately apologised, which the girl seemed to accept.

Mr Green was hit twice and knocked down in the  underpass with a vodka bottle by the 16-year-old boy, before the other boys kicked and stamped on him repeatedly as he lay dead or dying, the jury was told

Damen Fitzpatrick, Mr Green's best friend, who had been with him and the girls earlier in the day before going home unwell, told the court that his friend had been going through a tough time, having split with a girlfriend a few months previously as well as injuring himself.

He said he had also warned his friend not to drink while taking medication, adding: 'I told him not to because I was really concerned about him.' 

The three friends then left Mr Green's house to meet the two other defendants who had been at a party.

The court heard that the victim followed them and when they met at the underpass the 16-year-old confronted him about his actions at the house.

Mr Green offered to fight all the boys before shoving the 15-year-old girl out the way, the court heard.

This prompted her boyfriend to 'whack him' with the bottle, the prosecution claims, starting the attack.

Miss Bickerstaff said after the initial assault the group walked a few metres away but could still see the victim laying in the same position.

The defendants, all but the youngest of whom are now 17, all denied murder and grievous bodily harm at Cambridge Crown Court

She added: 'The girl then said something like 'f*** this' and then ran over and turned Michael Green over and stamped on him hard on the head, saying 'that is for hitting me earlier'.'

 She added: 'The girl had clearly seen what they had done and she joined herself to the enterprise by using the same type of force they had used and then she left with the others.'

The group robbed Mr Green of his wallet, mobile phone and a neck chain and bracelet, the court heard, before going on to the nearby party.

Other partygoers claim they were boasting at the party of having beaten up Mr Green, the court heard, with the 16-year-old boy telling a friend he had 'bottled someone' and the 17-year-old saying 'yeah, I hit him really hard'.

The four defendants voluntarily went to police the following day, May 28, after news broke of Mr Green being found dead in the underpass, and were later charged.
