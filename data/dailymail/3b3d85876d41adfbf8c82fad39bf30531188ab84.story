Lewis Hamilton heads into the Formula One title-deciding showdown in Abu Dhabi later this month conceding to being in a far from comfortable position.

It will be the third time in Hamilton's F1 career he will have faced a last-race decider, having done so previously in his rookie year in 2007, and again in his title-winning campaign of 2008.

They were both nerve-jangling affairs for Hamilton as in each he went into the final grand prix with a lead over his rivals.

Lewis Hamilton heads into the final race in Abu Dhabi with all to play for in the drivers' championships

With double points at stake the title will be won by either Mercedes' Hamilton or teammate Nico Rosberg

1. Lewis Hamilton         Mercedes         334

2. Nico Rosberg           Mercedes          317

3. Daniel Ricciardo       Red Bull            214

4. Sebastian Vettel       Red Bull           159

5. Fernando Alonso      Ferrari              157

In 2007 an early technical issue in the race in Brazil resulted in Hamilton missing out on the championship by a point to Kimi Raikkonen who was then in his first spell with Ferrari.

A year later only a dramatic overtake in the final corner of the last lap gave Hamilton the minimum fifth place he required to snatch the title from Felipe Massa's grasp as the Brazilian had already crossed the line ahead of him as the race victor.

Six years on and Hamilton heads into this season's denouement, where the controversial double-points system comes into play, with a 17-point cushion over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton knows a top-two finish will guarantee him his second title, but it is the unknown and unpredictability of F1 that means he cannot rest.

'There is zero comfort going into the last race,' said Hamilton.

Hamilton won his first and only driver's championship on the last day of the season in 2008

'There are 50 points to gain, which has never happened in Formula One before, and it just so happens to be this season.

'In the last race you never know what is going to happen, so I'm going into it to win.'

Hamilton's positive mindset means he is refusing to contemplate for a moment the possibility he may not be crowned champion.

'Why would I think that? It's not the way to approach any race weekend,' insisted Hamilton.

In Sunday's race in Brazil, however, Hamilton underlined mistakes can happen at any time as he appeared poised to take the lead - which potentially would have resulted in the win - only to spin off the Interlagos circuit.

That handed the advantage back to Rosberg, with Hamilton coming home second to bring the curtain down on his five-race winning streak.

Again, though, Hamilton is not going to let that haunt him, adding: 'Ultimately it was a mistake, but I'm not going to look back at it.

'It's done and dusted. I'm not going to have any regrets.

'I was just pushing to win, same as every race. I don't think I took any unnecessary risks.

'There are still plenty of positives to take from the day.'
