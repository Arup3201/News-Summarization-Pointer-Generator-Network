A young woman shed 10st after she was mistaken for her own mother on Facebook.

Lauren Thomas, 28, of Llanelli, shrunk from size 26 to a size 14 after a friend thought a photo Miss Thomas had taken of herself was of her 66-year-old mother, Brenda.

Miss Thomas said: 'I knew I'd put on weight but I had no idea I put 30 years on to my life too.

Lauren radically changed her diet, dropping from 20st (left) to about 12st 7lbs (right)

'I immediately changed my privacy settings so no-one could see the photo but I was utterly mortified.'

Miss Thomas grew up surrounded by sweet and savoury treats because her family owned a bakery.

She said: 'Pasties were my downfall. I was always eating them.

'When I got home from school I would always ask mum if I could help myself to a cake - she rarely said no, so I put on a lot of weight by the time I was a teenager.

Lauren's weight continued to rise after her father died when she was 14 and she was bullied at school

'I was bullied awfully. Some of my classmates called me Mandy Dingle because they thought I looked like Lisa Riley.'

Miss Thomas's weight continued to rise after her father died when she was 14 years old.

She said: 'I was very upset and I ate for comfort. One day I couldn't cope with the bullying anymore and lashed out at a boy who was teasing me.

The headmaster called me into his office and I broke down when I told him about the bullying.

Lauren often ate chocolate for breakfast, a Cornish pasty for lunch and an evening meal of sausage and mash

'I spent a long time feeling angry but I learned to live with my size, even though deep down I was very unhappy.'

Shortly after she left school her weight topped 19st.

She
 said: 'I was working in a care home when I tried to help an elderly 
gentleman up and I pulled a muscle in my back very badly.

'I
 couldn't work for six weeks while I recovered. A doctor took one look 
at me and told me he wasn't surprised I'd injured myself because I was 
so overweight.

'I felt he was quite rude and tried to brush it off but his words stayed with me for a long time afterwards.'

In the wake of the appointment Miss 
Thomas developed bulimia, a condition she would suffer with until she 
discovered she was pregnant with her daughter Rhiannon, now three.

She
 said: 'I had been struggling, and was desperate for control. But 
becoming pregnant made me comfortable in myself again. I made sure I ate
 properly while I was pregnant and after Rhiannon was born I started to 
put weight on again.'

Although she originally dropped down to 10st, Lauren says she feels and looks better around 12st (pictured)

In the midst of all these weight issues, in early 2012, weighing 20st, Miss
Thomas updated her profile picture on Facebook.

It was then that her friend sent the message that was to change her life. The acquaintance posted: 'Oh my god, is that your mum? You look like twins'.

'She'd made an honest mistake but I was embarrassed beyond words. It hadn't occurred to me that I'd got to that point.

The very next day Miss Thomas began the Cambridge Diet, which replaced the fatty and sugary foods she was used to with calorie-controlled milkshakes.

Before beginning the programme, she often ate pieces of chocolate for breakfast, a Cornish pasty for lunch and an evening meal of sausage and mash with gravy or spaghetti bolognese with generous portions of cheese.

She would snack on biscuits and crisps.

Within just six months she weighed 14st, having lost more than 5st.

By July 2013, she was down to 10st 7lbsÂ  although today, she weighs around 12st 7lbs.

She said: 'People said I looked ill when I was at my lowest weight. I'm 5ft 7in and I can't be too thin. 12st is a healthy weight for me and I'm trying to get down to that level now.

'I've finally found something which works, and for the first time I feel as if I've got some control.'
