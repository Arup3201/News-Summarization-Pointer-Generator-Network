Pc Tom Leyden was barred from using a neighbourhood Facebook account after he joked that a teen suspect may enjoy being 'touched'

A policeman has been barred from using a neighbourhood Facebook account after he joked that a teen suspect may enjoy being ‘touched’ by officers.

The status, posted by Pc Tom Leyden on the Irlam and Cadishead police page, was taken down after users complained that it was inappropriate.

Greater Manchester Police confirmed it had removed the post and had suspended Pc Leyden from using the neighbourhood social media accounts.

But now fans of the officer’s posts have set up their own campaign page calling for the ban to be lifted.

Pc Leyden’s offending post described how officers were called out to a street in Irlam after a 15-year-old was spotted holding a carving knife.

It goes on to describe how a boy fitting the description took exception to being stopped and searched.

It read: 'Funnily enough, the same boy is always being stopped and searched.

'I’m not a suspicious person but I think that, either the lad enjoys being touched by Police Officers, which would make him very strange, or he’s what we call in Scotland, a numpty (It is a recognised word in Scotland and my granny used to call me it, so it can’t be offensive.)'

The post has since been removed and it was replaced with an apology which reads: 'We posted over the weekend and this clearly caused some concerns.

'We have also received a complaint and as a result the post has been deleted.

'We apologise for any upset caused and can assure you that the issues raised are being investigated.'

Greater Manchester Police says the boy who was stopped was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and has since been bailed.

A spokesman said: 'A recent post on the Irlam and Cadishead Facebook page was deleted as some of the content was found to be inappropriate.

'An apology was also issued.

'The officer responsible has been suspended from using the neighbourhood social media accounts.'

This is the Facebook comment the officer wrote, which was later deleted and apologised for

Facebook users have also created their own ‘Bring Back Tom Leyden’ page, with the sub heading ‘Bring back our local Pc to facebook campaign’.

In one post, it states: 'Well another day without sight or sound of our comic legend Tom Leyden. Bring Back Tom, our district needs him.'

Another post simply reads: 'Tom, Tom Tom, we want Tom.'

Pc Leyden was unavailable for comment.
