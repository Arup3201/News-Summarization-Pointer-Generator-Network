Among a pile of everyday rocks and rubble, a gardener has uncovered an exquisitely carved Anglo-Saxon stone.

John Wyatt, 32, from Chester paid just £50 for the pile of natural stones, but the carving could fetch as much as £10,000 ($15,680) at auction.

The front panel of the stone is carved with the Celtic cross, while a bird is carved along the top.

Mr Wyatt had the 21-inch long and 15-inch wide piece examined by an expert at Duke’s auctioneers in Dorchester.

It is believed to have once formed part of a cross-slab from an early Christian monument, and it is possible it was smashed by Viking invaders as an act of defiance against the Christian population of Britain in the ninth century.

Alternatively, it may have been a grave marker, or part of a decoration around an internal doorway or window.

The expert also suggested the carving of the bird may be older than the carving of the cross.

Mr Wyatt said: ‘I was doing a bit of work in my own garden and saw an advert for some natural stone. I phoned the people up and went to collect it.

‘The stones were covered in mud and moss, and when I got home I saw what I thought was the tail of the dragon on one of them.

‘I cleaned it off and realised it was carved so I contacted a museum and the archaeologists got very excited.

‘No one could really say exactly what it was but they knew it was important.’

Duke’s is auctioning off the find tomorrow, with a pre-sale estimate of £10,000 ($15,680) and Mr Wyatt said he hopes to pay off some of his mortgage with the money it makes.

Experts claim the bird (pictured) carved onto the stone resembles an eagle - a symbol used for St John the evangelist

Discussing the symbolism of the piece Dr Rory Naismith from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic told MailOnline: ‘The cross was a completely ubiquitous religious symbol in Anglo-Saxon England: much like today, it was visual shorthand for the Christian faith.

‘It can be found in manuscripts, jewellery, on coins and also sculpture.

'People would see it every day, often in their purses or on their clothes as well as in and around their churches.’

He added there is  a famous poem in Old English, called The Dream of the Rood, in which the poet experiences a vision of the cross explaining its role in the crucifixion to him.

‘The [animal] is a little harder to place,’ continued Dr Naismith.

‘A common form of ornamentation found on lots of stone sculpture was foliage inhabited by creatures including birds, and that could be what's going on here.

'But the bird on this stone looks quite aquiline, so it may well be an eagle: a symbol used for St John the evangelist.’

This view was shared by Levi Roach, a lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Exeter.

He told MailOnline: ‘Given that [the bird] is found in close proximity to the cross, it is conceivable that it is meant to be an eagle, and thesymbol of John the Evangelist.

‘This interpretation would certainly sit well with the bird’s pronounced beak.’

Guy Schwinge, valuer at Duke’s added: ‘The Anglo Saxon stone is an important find and the stylistic vocabulary on the cross is indicative of an Anglo Saxon origin. It probably dates from the 9th or 10th century.’

Also going under the hammer at the same sale is a Roman sarcophagus that for years acted as a plant pot in an Oxfordshire garden. The estimate is £25,000 ($39,200).

St. John (illustrated left) was said to be one of the original twelve apostles and is traditionally taken to be the author of the fourth gospel, John. When pictured among the evangelists and other apostles, St John is often depicted as an eagle. The cover of a gospel book is pictured right

St. John was said to be one of the original twelve apostles and is traditionally taken to be the author of the fourth gospel, John.

When pictured among the evangelists and other apostles, St John is often depicted as an eagle, and at times, as a human with the head of an eagle.

Eagles are used as symbols throughout Christianity, because they soar upwards, making them symbolic of Christ’s resurrection or ascension.

In Ezekiel 1:10, the gospels are described as each having 'the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.

An eagle with a halo, specifically, is said to represent St John because of his ‘lofty and soaring’ gospel. His gospel is said to more theological than the other three, for example.

This symbolism is reported to have originated in Jerome’s Commentary on Matthew, which said: ‘John the Evangelist who, having taken up eagle’s wings and hastening toward higher matters, discusses the Word of God.’ 

Eagles are used as symbols throughout Christianity, because they soar upwards, making them symbolic of Christ’s resurrection or ascension. In Ezekiel, the gospels are described as each having the face of a man, lion, ox and eagle. St John is depicted on the 9th century Brandon Plaque (pictured)

The sarcophagus dates from the 2nd or 3rd century AD and, although damaged, remains a rare and important find.

Made from white marble, it depicts two river gods holding cornucopiae while reclining on the back of dolphins while flanked by palm trees.

In the centre is Cupid embracing a mourning figure, who in turn is holding a quiver of arrows.

‘We can only speculate on how this important Roman artefact ended up in an Oxfordshire garden, but in all probability it was brought back in the 18th century by a gentleman on the Grand Tour,’ continued Mr Schwinge.

‘It had been used for bedding plants to bring a bit of colour to the garden.

‘Both these lots show just what value can be found in gardens across the country.
