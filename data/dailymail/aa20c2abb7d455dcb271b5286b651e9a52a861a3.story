In the latest video installment from Moda Operandi, a group of adorably precocious kids talk about their high-fashion Christmas wish lists.

Twin sisters in the clip, which advertises the luxury online fashion retailer's holiday collection, say in unison: 'A gold iPad!'

And when asked what she's planning to give her mother, one fiery girl responds: 'Probably like some sort of jewelry or maybe a new purse or something. Like a crocodile Birkin.'

Simple pleasures: When asked what she's planning to give her mother, one fiery girl responds: 'Probably like some sort of jewelry or maybe a new purse or something. Like a crocodile Birkin'

The video takes place in a grand living room decorated with a huge plush panda bear, a Christmas tree, a tartan sofa and piles of Moda Operandi shopping bags.

'We're talkin' bout what we want for Christmas,' says one of the young children, who are nicknamed 'Fashioneasters' by the online luxury fashion retailer.

The girls are all decked out in sparkling jewelry and fancy apparel, with one wearing a big fur hat with the price tag dangling from it.

'What are you getting your mommy for Christmas?' one girl asks another. 'A beautiful necklace with diamonds!' she exclaims.

High hopes: Twin sisters in the clip say in unison that they want: 'A gold iPad!'

Another young girl reveals her plans to get her mother 'a private plane, so she can go all over the world!'

The wishlists get even more high-end when one girl declares: 'We should get Mommy a Basquiat.' Her sister agrees: 'Yeah she would love it!'

Back in September, the Fashioneasters did a video on New York Fashion Week, chalking it up to a minefield of confounding footwear, agonizing outfit decisions, and difficult-to-pronounce designer names.

'It's very hard to walk in high heels. It's gonna take a lot of practice,' asserts one young star earnestly from behind a large pair of statement sunglasses, later pronouncing Salvatore Ferragamo as: 'Salva-ferman-gono.'

The comical video, which featured the same seven girls who star in the holiday video,  sees its subjects try on a range of opulent clothing, answer questions about high-end designers and dole out their sartorial opinions.

'You just need to be, um like, a really good fasion-easter who thinks you can do anything,' offers one opinionated young girl, proudly sporting a navy blue bow in her hair.

'If you'd like to be a fashion-easter, tell me, and I'll probably tell you all about how to be a fashion-easter.'
