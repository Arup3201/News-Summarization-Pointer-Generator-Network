Mr Clegg told colleagues not to lose their nerve ahead of a probably drubbing in elections as rumours swirl of plot against his leadership

Nick Clegg urged Liberal Democrats not to ‘lose their nerve’ yesterday as the party prepared for a drubbing in this week’s European and local elections.

With rumours swirling of a plot against his leadership, the Deputy Prime Minister told colleagues it would be ‘highly self-defeating’ to turn inwards just as the Government’s key decisions are being ‘vindicated’.

He also snapped at the BBC’s Andrew Marr, accusing him of ‘sneering’ at him for insisting the Lib Dems could form another coalition with the Tories after 2015 despite rising tensions between the two parties.

The Lib Dems are braced for humiliating results at the polls this week, with strategists saying that hanging on to just four of their 12 MEPs would be a good result. Candidates were said yesterday to have been shaken by the hostility of many voters towards Mr Clegg. Senior party figures dismiss as fanciful the idea that he could be replaced  by Danny Alexander or Vince Cable, but are preparing for a difficult period if the results are as bad as expected.

In several European election polls the party has been languishing in fifth place behind  the Greens.

A poll yesterday suggested  that only 46 per cent of Lib Dem voters would want Mr Clegg to stay in his job if the party does end up in that position. One idea that has already been floated in Lib Dem circles, but rejected by his allies, is for Mr Clegg to remain Deputy Prime Minister but relinquish the party leadership, allowing another senior  figure to front next year’s general election campaign.

David Cameron and senior Tories, meanwhile, are said to be planning a ‘Save Clegg’ operation that will see the Lib Dems given ‘wins’ in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech.

The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday: ‘Of course it has been tough. We had to take all those difficult decisions to repair and reform the deeply damaged British economy.

‘I am immensely proud that our resilience, our unity – despite endless breathless predictions, which we’re seeing again right now to the contrary – have actually delivered the stability necessary to deliver economic recovery.

‘Sure, there might be individual decisions which people don’t like that this government’s had to take – the Liberal Democrats have had to take.

‘But I think it would be highly self-defeating precisely at the point when our big judgments are being vindicated for us to lose our nerve, and that’s why my party is not going to.’
