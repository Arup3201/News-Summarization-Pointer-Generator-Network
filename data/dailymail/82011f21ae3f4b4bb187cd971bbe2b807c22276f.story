Team spirit at QPR was once so bad that Bobby Zamora wished that he could skip training and fast forward to match day.

Zamora, who joined the club in January 2012 and was plunged straight into a relegation dog fight, says that the rifts in the squad then were so deep that he would have gladly missed the weekdays because of the animosity in the team.

‘For myself, it was more a case of just wishing at times that you didn’t have to go training for a week and could just turn up for a Saturday,’ said Zamora. ‘Because when game time comes everyone is fighting for the same cause. Two seasons ago, during the week sometimes tempers could flare.’

Recalling the negativity of 2012 and 2013, when QPR were a team characterised by their lack of fight, serves a purpose. For, though bottom of the table now with four points, with Liverpool coming to Loftus Road today and with manager Harry Redknapp under pressure, Zamora has some perspective. Bad though it may seem, things were infinitely worse then.

Ironically, in 2011-12, despite the rancour QPR stayed up. However, the following season, with an equally bad atmosphere in the dressing room, they were relegated, with Redknapp overseeing only the latter half of the season before guiding the club back to the Premier League last May.

‘Two and half seasons ago we stayed up with all that,’ said Zamora. ‘And this season we’re in a better position all round: the club, the players, the squad. And there are 31 games to go there is plenty of time to get out of this.

‘The club has come on in terms of the squad, the management, the facilities, the training pitches. All aspects of the club are a lot better than two and half years ago. There are only four or five lads left from that time and there has been a big turnaround. There is a good togetherness. The lads all get on now. Rio Ferdinand has come and he has been impressed at how the lads are together. He was at Manchester United a long time and he can’t believe the togetherness of the lads and the spirit.’

That said, Ferdinand and the new signings such as Eduardo Vargas, Mauricio Isla, Niko Kranjcar, Steven Caulker, Sandro and Leroy Fer will have to start delivering victories soon. QPR spent significantly again in the summer despite the financial issues at the club. The latest financial results show a loss of £65.7million for the last season in the Premier League, on a turnover of £60m — figures that are unlikely to improve after a season spent in the Championship.

The fine for breaching the Football League’s Financial Fair Play rules could be as much as £40m when the new figures are revealed — and the Football League are threatening to relegate the club to Football Conference if they are relegated and fail to pay it. With the planned new 40,000-stadium in Old Oak being opposed by the current landowner, these are unsettling times at Loftus Road.

Having Les Ferdinand seated alongside owner Tony Fernandes today as the newly-installed Head of Football Operations does not help calm matters. Though Ferdinand was appointed by Redknapp as a coach at Tottenham, he is these days more associated with his last boss, Tim Sherwood, who along with Tony Pulis, would be a candidate to replace Redknapp.

Redknapp has been unfortunate in that key signing Jordan Mutch is injured as is captain Joey Barton while Sandro is struggling for fitness. But losing Loic Remy on the eve of transfer deadline day to a well-advertised buy-out clause was less of a shock. Failing to support Zamora and Charlie Austen up front has been the obvious huge omission from the summer spending.

The only possible solution for all concerned is simply to stay up this season to avoid the multitude of looming issues. And Zamora insists it is far too early to be concerned and that the players are behind Redknapp. ‘Harry has a wealth of experience. He’s seen it all: relegations, promotions, finals,’ said Zamora. ‘It really is crazy there is speculation with so many games to go. You can win two games and you’re right back up there.’

‘We don’t talk about the speculation at the minute because it’s so early. You literally just need a couple of wins. Although they are tough games they can be won. He brought most of us in. Harry has supported us and wanted us here. Everyone is behind him and now we have just got to do our part on match day.’

QPR face Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City in the next three weeks – though you would imagine that the results against Aston Villa (home), Newcastle (away) and Leicester (home) are more likely to define Redknapp’s future.

Zamora puts on a good positive front. ‘Catch me in four or five months to have this conversation,’ he says. ‘We’ll have plenty of points on the board then, I’ m sure. The spirit is there.’
