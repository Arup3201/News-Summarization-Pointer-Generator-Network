'Obamacare architect' Jonathan Gruber formally apologized to Congress and the American people on Tuesday for his 'glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting comments' about the fashion in which health care reform was passed in Congress and the intelligence of the American people.

'In some cases I made uniformed and glib comments about the political process behind healthcare reform. I'm not an expert on politics, and my tone implied I was, which is wrong,' Gruber told a House committee.

'In other cases I simply made mean and insulting comments which are uncalled for in any context. I sincerely apologize for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion,' the economist testified.

Gruber denied that he did anything more than provide economic advice to Congress and the Obama administration during the creation of the health care law and pleaded with lawmakers, who used the hearing to rub his comments in his face, not to allow his hubris to sully their view of the health care law.

'Obamacare architect' Jonathan Gruber formally apologized to Congress and the American people on Tuesday for his 'glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting comments' about the fashion in which health care reform was passed in Congress and the intelligence of the American people

'I did not draft [Massachusetts] Governor Romney's health plan, and I was not the architect of president Obama's health care plan,' he told them.

'It is never appropriate to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others. I knew better, I know better, I'm embarrassed, and I'm sorry.'  

Gruber, an economist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, came into the national spotlight this fall after videos surfaced of him asserting that Democrats intentionally deceived the American people during the health care reform debate. 

Two critical videos of Gruber riffing on Obamacare at an academic conference have rankled Republicans, who have long claimed that the Affordable Care Act should be gutted and replaced with 'commonsense' legislation.

In one he said the law was purposefully written in a 'very tortured way' so it wouldn't be counted as a tax.

In another he claimed 'lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.'

'And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass,' he added.

At a House Oversight hearing that was to be the swan song for the committee's fiery chair, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, the California congressman called the statements 'troubling' and said they were 'not only an insult to the American people but revealed a pattern of intentional misleading the public about the true impact and nature of Obamacare.'

He later asked the economics professor point blank: 'Are you stupid? Does MIT employee stupid people?'

When Gruber answered in the negative, Issa said, 'OK, so you're a smart man, who said some really stupid things.'

The Republican congressman, stepping down as head of the powerful committee at the end of the current legislative session, set to end this week, shoved Gruber's comments back in his face during Tuesday's hearing and played the damning clip on the 'stupidity' of Americans for the committee.

Confronted with his own contentious words, Gruber smiled and laughed awkwardly as all eyes turned to him. But when it came time for him to testify, Gruber apologized profusely.

Accompanying Gruber at today's hearing was Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. Tavenner's agency, located within the Health and Human Services Department, is responsible for the implementation of the health care bill.

At the last minute Democrats asked that a witness, a DC resident named Ari Goldmann, who was scheduled to be on a secondary panel  be seated at the table with the key witnesses.

After first denying the minority party's request, Issa relented and asked the government witnesses if they minded having Goldmann at the table.

'I understand he is a waiter at a local restaurant that thoroughly loves Obamacare,' Issa snarked before stating that Goldmann is 'actually an independent consultant.' 

'They gave him a new title,' he snidely said.

in making his opening remarks Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings lamented that throughout the last Congress Republicans held 29 hearings on Obamacare and 'not one' was about how to implement the law.

Just think 'what we could have accomplished had we devoted that same amount of time and resources to more constructive efforts,' he told his colleagues. 'So I mourn what could have been.'

Cumming said that today's hearing appeared to be no different.

'As far as I can tell we are here to beat up on Jonathan Gruber for stupid, I mean absolutely stupid, comments he made over the past few years, and then grill, and grill, Administrator Tavenner,' he said.

'This may be good political theater, but it will not help a single American get health insurance.It will not help a single person get well, it will not help a single person get the care that they need.'

The Maryland Congressman took advantage of the opportunity, however, to state for the record that he was 'extremely frustrated' with Gruber's statements. 

'They were irresponsible, incredibly disrespectful and did not reflect reality, and they were indeed insulting,' the Maryland congressman said.

Growing angry, Cummings said that Gruber does not speak for him or other committee chairs who directly worked on the health care law.

'Worst of all Dr. Gruber's statements gave Republicans a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down ACA and eliminate health care for millions of Americans,' he said, noting that 'many Republicans now allege some kind of Democratic conspiracy.'

Cummings said such an assessment is 'completely wrong,' he said, as is the idea that Gruber lied to aid Democrats. 

The Democratic congressman pointed out that former Republican presidential nominee and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had also praised Gruber's work in the past.
