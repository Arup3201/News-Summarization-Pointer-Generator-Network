A 61-year-old grandmother who brought up seven children on benefits says she wants an eighth with her 34-year-old fiancé - which would make her the oldest natural mother in the world.

Sandra Gallagher said she fell in love with Richard Broom while dating his uncle and says 'none of my exes' have treated her like he has.

The pair want to marry in June and have a child - but their plans have stalled after they were evicted for not keeping up with the reported £115-a-month contribution to their £500-a-month rent.

Together: Miss Gallagher and Mr Broom will appear in a documentary about people on benefits tomorrow

They and Richard's mother Ida are now reportedly living in a homeless B&B costing taxpayers £588 a month, where they continue to receive £733 a month in other benefits, according to The Sun.

But despite the course of love not running smoothly, the couple told how they are determined to begin their new family life once they find a permanent home.

'I didn't want any more kids before because of the people i was with, but now with Richard I don't mind,' Miss Gallagher told the Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work.

'I'd prefer to have one with him because I really care for him.

'I didn't think he would go with me because I'm older but he has been with another older person before me. Not quite as old as me, but I thought that's nice, I might have a chance.'

If she succeeds Miss Gallagher, who has been out of work for 40 years due to health problems including kidney stones, would be two years older than the world's oldest mother not to use IVF.

She already has seven children spanning two relationships, the oldest of which is 41 and the youngest is 29.

Career ambition: Mr Broom during a session to take casting photos at an actors' studio in London

Mr Broom said: 'I wouldn't say I can't work, because I can. I guess it's just my laziness really'. According to the Channel 5 programme, he was evicted but later found full-time work on the railways

Mr Broom, a former road cleaner, was unable to find work for two years but has not given up his dreams - he said he wants to be an actor like those in Hollywood or EastEnders' Danny Dyer.

Although his only screen offer so far was £5,000 for a part in a porn film, the programme showed him travelling to London to have casting photos being taken in a bid to be employed.

'It's my passion to become a Hollywood star,' he told the show. 'To become like Danny Dyer, to bring more money in, to help my mum out. We're just struggling but we try to make up the payments.

'Mostly I play on computer, Facebook, games and stuff like that, dossing around doing nothing. I normally check Facebook every ten minutes when I'm sitting there thinking of nothing. 

'I wouldn't say I can't work, because I can. I guess it's just my laziness really.' 

The couple have been on holiday together to Blackpool and have been together for two years. 

Miss Gallagher told The Sun the couple's sex life had improved three years ago when she had a labiaplasty - commonly known as 'designer vagina' surgery - costing £2,500 on the NHS.

Abuse: The couple had already moved in with Mr Broom's mother to make ends meet when they were filmed

She said she went in with a gynaecological complaint and was surprised to be given the surgery, but since then the results had been 'wonderful'. 

The pair will appear tomorrow night on the Channel 5 show Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work, the third in a four-part series looking at the long-term unemployed.

It follows in the footsteps of Channel 4's Benefits Street, which prompted a national debate pitching those shocked at benefits 'abuses' against those who said the 'stars' had been exploited. 

When the Channel 5 show was filmed the couple had already moved in with Mr Broom's mother to make ends meet, and were on emergency measures after having their benefits suspended.

It showed them arranging their whole lives on a shoestring, including the wedding, for which Mr Broom bought a suit for £30 from eBay.

The situation unraveled further when it was discovered the household was £5,000 behind on rent.   

By the end of the programme they had been evicted - though it said Daniel had since found full-time work on the railways. 

Even though the programme has not yet aired, the couple said they have already received abuse from people they know for appearing on it.

Benefits: Can't Work, Won't Work airs tomorrow at 8pm on Channel 5.
