When she rolled out her helpline for the elderly struggling to cope with loneliness, she set herself a target of reaching 100,000 people.

But a year since it was launched nationally, Esther Rantzen said The Silver Line has dealt with almost 300,000 calls.

The former That's Life! presenter said the demand for the service reveals the vast scale of hidden emptiness and isolation among the elderly, which is driving some to contemplate suicide.

And this time of year is particularly painful for many elderly people who face 'solitary confinement'.

She said: 'I think the combination of the long evenings, the cold nights, it's harder to get out and about. And the fact that Christmas and the New Year are associated in people's minds with happy memories of their own past. And if you're on your own, you're in, what I call solitary confinement.'

Miss Rantzen said many older people often feel ashamed or humiliated by their feelings of loneliness but the telephone service has provided many with confidential support.

She explained: 'I had a fantastic letter from someone called Beryl, who said that for the first year after her husband died she just wanted to give up. Life was not worth living.

'Then she rang The Silver Line and she was able to pour out feelings she'd been unable to talk about to anyone else. By pouring out her heart to our Silver Line team she said she had a good night's sleep for the first time.

Speaking ahead of BBC 1 programme Meet The Street, a series looking at loneliness which begins on Monday, Miss Rantzen said the helpline has now matched 1,100 callers with Silver Line friends and said more are being trained to provide similar support.

Her ambition next year is to take up to one million calls.

 • 'Christmas gives you a great reason to make contact. That quaint old fashioned formal Christmas card gives you an excuse to bang on the door of the house next door or the house along the road or the flat along the corridor and say how do you do, I just wanted to wish you a happy Christmas.'

• 'I think we need to bear in mind in these busy, hard pressed times, you can make the time to make that phone call and it can just make a difference. A phone call is very important.'

• 'If you are lucky enough to have your health and strength and the time to do it, I think volunteering is probably the best fun.'

The subject of loneliness is one Miss Rantzen has first-hand experience of. Her husband Desmond Wilcox died from heart disease in 2000. Their relationship began as an affair in 1968, when they both worked at the BBC. They married in 1977, had three children and spent 30 years together until his death, aged 69.

Three years ago, after her youngest child Joshua moved out, she sold the family home and moved into a two-bedroom flat. At the age of 71 she found herself living alone.

Miss Rantzen said: 'I was coming home to a dark flat with no one to make a cup of tea with and no one to ask about my day, it hit me quite profoundly.

'When I started to talk about it working in the elderly care sector, I realised how it resonated with so many hundreds of thousands of people.

'One of the things I discovered was the stigma attached to loneliness, people don't like admitting it, partly because they don't want to be a burden, and partly because they're ashamed, they feel humiliated by this feeling nobody wants them or cares about them. So there is a pride and an independence in the older generation. We want them to know that they're not alone and that we do care.' 

Although she is surrounded by friends and family, Miss Rantzen admitted she has still has moments when she is overcome with emotion at losing her husband.

She said: 'I don't think I have dealt with it, (Desmond's death) I think it's still there and I think it still gets me at moments. I cope by recognising it.

'I recognise it's a feeling I'll probably have… loneliness is usually about loss. And for me it was the loss of Desmond, my late husband.

'I've got a fantastic grandson whom I absolutely adore, who calls me Etta, and I spend as much time with him as I can, my children are superb, I've got lovely friends. But none of that can really take away the loss of Dessy.'
