An investigation into the offensive online postings of the teenage daughter of a New Jersey police officer - who dressed up as Hitler and threatened to 'bomb' a shop where Jewish people were congregated - has cleared the girl of any criminal charges.

The teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - posted a series of outrageous items to Twitter, including photos of herself dressed as Hitler adorned with homemade swastika symbols. 

One photo, in which she appears to be wearing a State Police hat, was captioned: '1944: crematorium crew.' 

Her father is a State Police sergeant, the Ashbury Park Press reported. 

Another showed an Italian ice shop in Jackson, New Jersey, where a large group of Jewish people had gathered, with the caption: 'perfect bombing time.'

Shocking: The offensive online postings by the Jackson teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - were found to pose no credible threat, according to an investigation

Offensive: One of the most shocking posts showed a large group of Jewish people congregated outside an Italian ice shop in Jackson, New Jersey, with the caption: 'perfect bombing time.'

In another tweet, the user wrote: 'I really wanna drive around Lakewood and run over every Jew with my car.'

Jackson is a neighboring township of Lakewood, which has an increasing Jewish population. 

The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office launched an investigation into the array of posts.

However it was concluded that, while abusive, the teen had not committed a crime and the posts did not amount to a credible threat.

'There was never any danger being posed to the community,' a spokesman for the office told the Ashbury Park Press. 

'It didn't rise to anything criminal.'

The spokesman also maintained that the position held by the girl's father did nothing to sway the decision.

But the outcome has angered many, who say the situation would have been vastly different if the girl wasn't white.

Outrageous: The teen uploaded pictures of herself dressed as Hitler  and tweeted about killing Jews

'If it had been a Muslim, this almost certainly would have been handled differently,' Ibraham Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties advocacy organization, told the APP.

'If it's associated with Muslims, it will be viewed as terrorism. 

'If not, it will be viewed as something random and minor.'

An investigation found the posts - most of which featured the girl, but others featured people she knew - posed no credible threat and were not criminal 

The Tweets were put up in January.

Some of the offensive content came from different people, but most was the daughter of the police officer.

Her account has since been deactivated.

The Jackson Township School District - where the girl goes to school - confirmed it had been made aware of the matter but refused to comment further.
