The $200 SmartSwing can be remotely controlled via a phone app, allowing parents to stay in bed.

'Download the free Smart Connect app and you can respond to baby’s need for soothing from anywhere in your home using your smart phone or tablet!' the firm says.

'Just open the app and control the swing right from the palm of your hand!'

The has 6 distinct swinging speeds from low to high so you can find the perfect rhythm to help soothe your child, and it can also swing either  side-to-side (like a cradle) or head-to-toe.

'When baby’s ready to rock, just remove the rocker seat, set it on the floor and baby can enjoy either of two rocking motions,' Fisher Price said.

The app can also play music, even when not near the cradle.

To add to the excitement for children, the cradle also has 16 songs, 3 nature sounds, and a 'deluxe overhead mobile with light-up birdies (one with a mirrored belly).'

The app, called Smart Connect, works upto 164 ft. away from the cradle, and also has the same swing songs that can be played anywhere.

Fisher Price says the cradle can be used 'from birth until child attempts to climb out of product.' 

The announcement comes days after the View-Master toy, beloved of children from the 1960s onwards, got a hi-tech modern makeover.

Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google on the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery.

The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’.
