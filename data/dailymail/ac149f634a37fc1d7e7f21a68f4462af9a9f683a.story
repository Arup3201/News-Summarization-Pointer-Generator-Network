An aviation technician with extremist Islamic views was charged on Friday after he planned to detonate a car bomb at a Kansas airport.

Terry Lee Loewen, 58, was arrested on Friday morning at Mid-Continent regional airport in Wichita, according to U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom, after being thwarted by an undercover FBI investigation.

Grissom said Loewen planned to drive a car that he believed was full of explosives into a terminal at the airport and trigger the device in a suicide mission.

Investigators say Loewen is an avionics technician who lives in Wichita and works at the airport.

Grissom said the 58-year-old spent months developing his plan of driving a car filled with explosives into the airport, triggering the bomb and killing himself.

He was arrested at 5.30am this morning after he tried to open a gate on to the tarmac at the airport with his security pass.

Loewen believed his car was filled with explosives but the FBI confirmed today that the material was never at risk of causing an explosion. 

The U.S. Attorney said that Loewen was radicalized from reading extremist Islamic texts online.

Richard McKown, 81, who lives two doors down from Loewen, told MailOnline today that he was deeply shocked by the crimes that his neighbor had been accused of.

He also said that the terror suspect lived with a woman whom he believed to be his wife. A woman called Deborah Loewen is also listed at the same address.

Mr McKown, who has lived in the neighborhood for six years, said: 'They kept themselves to themselves. In the summer evenings, all the neighbors would be out talking but they never participated.

'It's a complete shock, no one can understand why.'

A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita on Friday charges Loewen with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.

He is also accused of attempting to 
damage property by explosives and attempting to provide support for a 
foreign terror organization.

The 58-year-old is due to be arraigned at 3pm (CST). If convicted, Loewen faces life in prison.

The FBI said that the suspect had 
been under constant surveillance for the past six months and at no 
point, had the public faced any danger.

FBI Evidence Response Teams are processing several locations. No further arrests are expected.

At a press conference on Friday, authorities stressed that there was no indication that the defendant was involved with or working with any religious community in Wichita and that his alleged actions in no way should reflect on any religious group.

According
 to an affidavit, Loewen had engaged in online chat with an individual 
who was actually an undercover FBI agent. He reportedly said that he 
wanted to commit 'violent jihad against the United States on behalf 
of al Qaeda'.

The FBI said that Loewen studied the 
layout of the airport, took photographs of access points and 
researched flight schedules.

He also took part in buying components for a car bomb and talked about how he wanted to set off the device.

According to the affidavit, the undercover agent was told by the suspect on August 5 this year: 'As time goes on I care less and less about what other people think of me or my views on Islam.

'I have been studying subjects like jihad, martyrdom operations and Sharia law.'

He later continued: 'I feel so guilt-ridden sometimes for knowing what's required of me but yet doing little or nothing to make it happen.'

In a later message to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit, Loewen said: 'Brothers like Osama bin Laden and Anwar Al Awlaki are a great inspiration to me...'

The terror suspect later said that he had been studying Al-Awlaki's methods of jihad and 'printed out something called the Al Qaeda manual'.

Loewen also told an undercover agent during the online chats of some of the deadly plans he had in mind. He explained his plot in detail, offering a supposed accomplice a tour of the airport and said how he could be the 'access' guy.

He wrote: 'I'm 58 years old and spending my remaining years behind bars for a good reason is not out of the question for me.'

Loewen
 sent pictures to the undercover agent of what appeared to be fighter 
jet trainers on the tarmac outside of the hanger where he worked at the 
airport, according to the affidavit.

The
 interactions between the suspect and the agent continued to the point 
of purchasing material that Loewen believed to be capable of creating a 
bomb.

According to the affidavit: 'In discussing the specifics of the operation, which included taking a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) to the terminal near a number of passenger planes, Loewen suggested that another individual could come in to the terminal with a suicide vest...'

On Wednesday, 
the FBI employee made the final preparations on the bomb and Loewen said
 that he was 'happy' with the plan which was set for December 13.

This morning before 5am, Loewen was picked up by his believed accomplice at a local hotel and taken to a location where they had stored the bomb.

The suspect finished wiring the device, believing that it would be 'operational', according to the affidavit. They drove to the airport and at a security gate, Loewen tried twice to use his access badge, which was unique to him, to enter the tarmac.

However the gate had been disabled by authorities and Loewen was taken into custody.

In a suicide letter that Loewen wrote for a family member, he wrote, according to the affidavit: 'By the time you read this I will - if everything went as planned - have been martyred in the path of Allah.

He continued: 'The operation was timed to cause maximum carnage + death.'

He closed the letter with the words: 'I expect to be called a terrorist (which I am), a psychopath, and a homicidal maniac'

U.S. Senator Jerry Moran released the following statement after learning of the arrest: We are grateful for the law enforcement officials who kept individuals, including many Kansans, safe today.

'This incident is a reminder that we must remain vigilant and reaffirm our commitment to protecting this country and its ideals from those who wish to do us harm.'
