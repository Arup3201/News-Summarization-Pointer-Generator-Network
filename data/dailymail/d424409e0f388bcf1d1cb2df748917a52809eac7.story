Mo Farah claims he has left his injury woes behind and is poised to become the first British winner of the Great North Run since 1985.

‘I was two years old the last time a Brit won,’ said Farah. ‘It would be nice to change that this year.’

Farah, 31, was breathing down the neck of Kenenisa Bekele in last year’s race, finishing just one second behind in a defeat which he admitted was tough to take.

‘I was gutted last year to be pipped at the end,’ he said. ‘You just have to come back stronger.’

For many of the British athletes on Tyneside, the Great North CityGames brought down the curtain on an excellent season with record-breaking performances at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships.

Christine Ohuruogu was one of six British winners and planned to celebrate with her team-mates and ‘loads of cake, loads of pizza and a dance in high heels’.

Ohuruogu, the reigning 400m world champion, won the 500m race on the banks of the River Tyne in 1:07.46, clear of team-mate Lynsey Sharp.

Another who ended the season with a flourish was Richard Kilty. The self-styled ‘Teeside Tornado’, who won the 60m world indoor title this year, beat American Michael Rodgers into second in the 150m.

‘If you’d said this time last year I’d end the year as world champion, I would have never believed you,’ he said. ‘It’s completely changed my life.’
