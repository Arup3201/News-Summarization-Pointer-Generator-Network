Belgian backpacker and self-dubbed world explorer Johan Lolos captured the spectacular moments Northern Territory turtles emerged from the ocean to lay their eggs on Bare Sand Island beach.

The island is located south west of the Darwin coast and the photos, taken last week, capture the flatback mother turtles on the sand during a super full moon.

Once on the beach, the turtles found a spot to dig their nest before laying their eggs during dusk.  Upon laying their eggs, the mothers to be cover the eggs and then head back into the sea.

As well as the stunning beach scapes, Johan, 26, was also lucky enough to photograph some new born baby turtles minutes after hatching.

Smaller than a adult human hand, Johan captured a researcher holding one of the babies, moments before it was put down so it could find its way to the water for the first time.

With the images featured on the Australia.com Facebook page, they had attracted nearly 86,000 likes as of Tuesday afternoon.Â 

Backpacking around the world for almost a year, Johan said observing the turtles laying their eggs was a moving experience.

'Definitely one of the most intense experiences since I've been in Australia,' he said and compared it to swimming with a whale-shark in Western Australian and sea lions in South Australia.

'It was not really about interaction since we are not allowed to approach the turtles too closely, but it was all about observing life. Nature at its finest,' he said.

'I was so impressed by the exhausting work these turtles have to do to lay her eggs, and that was probably the most moving part of the trip. I had great admiration and respect for these animals.'
