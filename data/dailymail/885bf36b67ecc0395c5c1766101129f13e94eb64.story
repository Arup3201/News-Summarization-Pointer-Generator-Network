Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists Arsenal can compete with Chelsea for this year's Premier League title.  

Arsene Wenger's Arsenal  were the only team to win out of City, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool at the weekend, and Pellegrini believes they should not be cast aside just yet. 

Pellegrini, who overlooked United and Liverpool in the title race, lost 2-1 against West Ham on Saturday, but believes City's bid is very much alive.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side were held to a 1-1 draw against United at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon

'We have 87 points more to try and continue adding more points to our team,' says Pellegrini.

'It is not only Chelsea, (but also) Arsenal, so we will see what they do in the future. At the final (match), the team that wins more points will be the champion.' 

Chelsea remain top of the Premier League after drawing 1-1 at Old Trafford - six points clear of City and nine of Arsenal. They failed to take full advantage of City dropping points, as Robin van Persie's equaliser in the 94th minute salvaged a point for Louis van Gaal on Sunday.

Arsenal, on the other hand, avoided any hiccups by seeing off struggling side Sunderland with a 2-0 win at the Stadium of Light, courtesty of two Alexis Sanchez goals.
