Eight airport security workers have been suspended for alleged blunders including sleeping on duty and not checking luggage for potential bombs.

Some of the suspended TSA screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey had even allegedly stolen items from passengers.

Hidden CCTV cameras allegedly caught staff at Terminal B - which handles airlines including Delta, British Airways and Virgin - sleeping on the job.

‘A plane goes out at 2am and there’s no activity for a while - so they’ll sit down and go to sleep,' a law enforcement source told the New York Post.

A federal probe caught several TSA screeners sleeping on duty and eight were disciplined as a result, reported the New York Post.

In addition one assistant supervisor has reportedly been suspended for improperly overseeing staff she was supposed to be watching.

A Transportation Security Administration spokesman only told the New York Post that it takes ‘immediate action’ when standards are not met.

Meanwhile screener Kujuanne McNiel is likely to be sacked after allegedly causing two planeloads of luggage to be taken off and rescreened.

He allegedly failed to properly check two bags last month after they raised concern - but this was spotted immediately, reported the Star-Ledger.

The incident was just one of various 
security lapses at Newark, which saw the airport’s federal security 
director Barbara Bonn Powell dismissed.

A TSA union rep said that Mr McNiel’s mistakes were probably because of poor training given.

‘It has a lot to do with the training,’ union rep Stacy Bodtmann told the Star-Ledger. She added: ‘It has a lot to do with the management.’

Terminal B at Newark was voted the eighth-worst airport terminal in the world in a survey earlier this month by travel website Frommer's.

Last spring it emerged air traffic controllers would get an extra rest hour between shifts under new rules after five dozed off in a matter of weeks.
