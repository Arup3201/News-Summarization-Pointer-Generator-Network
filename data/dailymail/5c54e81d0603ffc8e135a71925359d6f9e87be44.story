A New York City jail guard who was impregnated by a convicted cop killer has lost custody of her young son after it was revealed she got drunk with the murderer's family twice after he was sentenced to death.

Nancy Gonzalez's attorney says the family of Ronell Wilson was manipulating her and blamed her for a jury condemning him to the death penalty.

Wilson was convicted of capital murder for shooting dead two undercover NYPD detectives during a 2003 gun bust.

Ploy: Prosecutors say Wilson got Gonzalez pregnant so that he could use the baby as a reason not to be executed

The New York Daily News reports that a judge revoked Gonzalez's parental rights after learning about the two meetings she had with Wilson's family over the summer.

The baby, which was conceived by in an 'activity room' at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center while Gonzalez was working there, is named 'Justus' and is now five months old. He was placed in foster care with Gonzalez's maternal aunt.

A family court judge found that Gonzalez's behavior was neglectful because Gonzalez, a recovering drug addict, was not allowed to use alcohol while free on bail.

She is awaiting sentencing on charges of having sex with an inmate.

Anthony Ricco, the lawyer for the 29-year-old for corrections officer, says his client was being manipulated by Wilson's family.

Gonzalez's pregnancy threw up a monkey wrench in the death penalty case against Wilson - though she ultimately refused to take the stand and testify on his behalf

They were 'subtly blaming her' for Wilson being sentenced to death by a federal jury this summer.

Gonzalez, 29, refused to testify at his sentencing hearing.

Prosecutors said they suspected Wilson targeted Gonzalez and impregnated her so that he could use his child as an argument not to sentence him to the death penalty.

In court filings, Mr Ricco described his client as mentally unstable and vulnerable.

He claimed that she had been sexually abused and raped by her step-father, her uncles and other men.

As an example of her emotional instability, Mr Ricco said that his client had sexual relations with eight other guards - some men, some women - during her two years working at Metropolitan Detention Center.

She is set to be sentenced November 15 on charges of having sex with an inmate.

She faces 15 years in prison, though Mr Ricco urged a judge to give her probation so she can continue getting psychological treatment.
