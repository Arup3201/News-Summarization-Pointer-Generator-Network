A Minnesota air stewardess has finally welcomed home her three adopted daughters seven years after she first met the girls in a Guatemalan orphanage.

Suann Hibbs met her daughters in 2008, but when the Guatemalan government cut back on foreign adoptions the family were left in legal limbo.

It took seven years, 30 trips abroad and a lot of help from Senator Amy Klobuchar before officials finally allowed Ms Hibbs to take the three sisters home last week.Â

Mother's love: Suann Hibbs hugs one of her three adopted daughters

It is a dream come true for Ms Hibbs who had been keen to become a mother for years.

'I still feel like this is so surreal. I
 mean, I just have to pinch myself. When they come in, in the morning 
and crawl in bed with me. I just have goose bumps thinking about it,' she told CBS News.

When she first met the children, twins Savanna and Sophia were one-year-olds and their sister Sydney was a newborn.

'I just fell in love with them as soon as I saw them. I just thought morally, I just can't let them go,' Ms Hibbs, who is not married and found the girls through a church adoption group, said.

The adoption agency Ms Hibbs had used estimated that within six to nine months the paperwork would be completed and the girls would be with her in Edina, Minneapolis.

But the process was massively delayed as developing countries including Guatemala started to restrict foreign adoptions while they tackled problems with fraud and child trafficking.

In November 2007, her adoption case was put on hold during a country-wide investigation, and it looked as though she may lose her children.

While the case was being slowly processed the three sisters were moved between several orphanages and foster homes.

The constant moving made it hard for Ms Hibbs to keep track of them, and also meant that the girls have not had any formal education.

'They needed a permanent home,' Ms Klobuchar, who met Guatemalan officials on Ms Hibbs' behalf, said.

'It took a little time, but 
they got to the right place and allowed these children to be adopted.'

She added: 'A lot of times when you personally meet
 with the ambassador like I did and you tell the story of these three 
little girls and this mother who has been trying for seven years, they 
listen.'

Although the girls, now aged eight and seven, speak only a little English, they are settling into their new home well.

They will start school in a couple of weeks and attend summer classes to help them catch up with their new classmates.
