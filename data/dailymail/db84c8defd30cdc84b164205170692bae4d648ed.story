It was heralded as a fresh start after last season's torrid time under David Moyes, and nobody can deny Louis van Gaal's arrival at Manchester United has had its ups and downs.

But after the 1-0 defeat in the Manchester derby on Sunday, United sat in 10th place in the Premier League, which they have won 13 times.

They are undoubtedly struggling to adjust, and a depleted back line makes the outlook up to Christmas bleak. Records have been smashed, and not the type Sir Alex Ferguson used to break with pride.
