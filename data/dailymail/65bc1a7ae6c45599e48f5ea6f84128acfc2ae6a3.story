A UK Border Agency officer read secret files at work to give migrants 'tailored' visa advice in a £113,000 scheme run by her fake lawyer boyfriend.

Anjali Patel passed on confidential information to 28-year-old law student Abdul Farooq, who was charging desperate immigrants up to £13,000 while posing as a fully-qualified lawyer.

Farooq - who had gambling losses of £12,000 - then used the information to 'subvert' the system, a court heard.

Patel and her boyfriend, from Croydon, south London, will both be sentenced next month after she admitted two counts of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.

Farooq had already pleaded guilty to identical counts, alongside two charges of unlawfully providing immigration services.

Those caught up in the scheme in 2010 and 2011 were immigrants from Bangladesh, Colombia and Pakistan who were nearing the end of their visa terms or facing deportation.

Desperate to stay in Britain, they handed over thousands of pounds in cash to Farooq.

He was secretly assisted by Patel, who also had gambling debts and owed money to payday loan firms - though she insisted she did not receive a penny.

She was an executive officer with the UKBA's case resolution directorate, Croydon Crown Court heard, so was able to access personal information which would help the so-called clients' cases.

But the scheme unravelled when one migrant - failing to get the results she was promised - became so fed up that she reported Farooq to police.

Karen Robertson, prosecuting, said: 'Despite not having a law degree Farooq held himself out to be a solicitor or someone qualified to give immigration advice.

'He persuaded vulnerable individuals to part with substantial amounts of money in the hope he could assist them stay in this country.

'Patel assisted him by the unlawful access of database and document files, personal data and other sensitive information.

'The information she provided enabled Farooq to tailor advice to applicants and she gave advice to Farooq on how to subvert the application process.'

Failed Colombian asylum-seeker Maria Garcia-Zuniga, who had been in Britain for more than a decade and was working illegally as a cleaner, was the one who called police.

She had paid Farooq £2,000 cash to 'regularise' her status after he 'told her that he was her solicitor and she did not need anyone else to help', said Miss Robertson.

After shopping Farooq she pursued a bid herself to remain in Britain under human rights legislation.

Investigators later discovered an image on Patel's phone of Farooq illegally giving immigration advice to a client at a hotel.

One client, Bangladesh-born Mamunmar Rahman, gave Farooq £12,950 cash to help him secure a five-year work visa which could lead to permanent residency for his wife and child.

Farooq - also known as Zen - falsely told Mr Rahman he was an employee of Voyage International Relocation Ltd.

The firm offered work experience placements to students at London's Brunel University, where he studied.

Their meetings took place in a Croydon hotel and Farooq always insisted on cash payments, but the visa Mr Rahman wanted never materialised.

Another client, Pakistani-born Arman Ali, was in custody for immigration offences and facing deportation when Patel told him to lie his way out of trouble, the court heard.

'That was advice designed to frustrate the removal of an illegal person from this country,' added Miss Robinson. 

Prosecutors had initially charged Patel with laundering £73,000 in criminal property, but the charges were dropped after an aborted trial.

The total losses to the victims were estimated at £113,000. 

Judge Nicholas Ainley told Patel, who left the UKBA and joined the Ministry of Justice's parole board, that she would be unlikely to be sent to prison when she is sentenced next month.
