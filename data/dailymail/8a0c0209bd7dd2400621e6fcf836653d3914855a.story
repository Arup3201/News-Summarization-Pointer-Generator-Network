Smokers who nip out of the office for fag breaks work a whole week less than their non-smoking colleagues each year, research shows.

Every day smokers spend an average of 45 minutes away from their work, which adds up to nearly four hours per week.

Over a year this amounts to smokers working seven fewer days than their colleagues who do not smoke, according to a study for Voucher Codes Pro.

Fewer than one in five of those surveyed believed that smoking made them a less hardworking employee than their non-smoking peers.

Nearly half of those surveyed, 46 per cent, thought smoking actually improved their work performance because they felt it relieved stress and was a chance to chat to colleagues.

One smoker said: ‘The smoking area at work is one of the most sociable places in the office to get to know co-workers well.’

Another said: ‘If I didn’t smoke I would be a lot more stressed and wouldn’t be able to get half the things done in a day that I currently do.’

George Charles, marketing director of Voucher Codes Pro, said employers might think twice about hiring smokers due to the amount of time they spend not working.

‘The subject of employing smokers is an undoubtedly controversial one, but clearly one that needs to be highlighted looking at the results of our study,’ he said.

‘Whilst it could be argued that there are many different reasons as to why employees may need to take time out of work, it is not surprising that many employers would be wary of hiring smokers if they are going to be using more than 170 hours a year feeding their habit.’

Those who were surveyed said they took six fag breaks a day and spent seven minutes and 30 seconds to get through their cigarette.

The smokers who responded to the study also said they tend to take five sick days a year due to illnesses or medical appointments directly linked to smoking.

Mr Charles added: ‘Only the employers themselves will be able to assess for sure if their non-smoking employers outperform those that smoke to the extent that it makes a huge difference to their business.

‘However, with the rules on smoking in the UK becoming stricter, who knows what this could soon mean for those with an addiction for cigarettes.’
