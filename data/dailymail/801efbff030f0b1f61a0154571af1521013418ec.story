From the dress to the flowers to the cake, it’s the second-most important event of a woman’s life. You’ve had your Big Day, now it’s your daughter’s time to shine. But being the mother-of-the-bride is fraught with danger. While you want to look your best, you don’t want to overshadow your darling girl. I may be 54, but I take care of my appearance and I feel — and look — better than I did in my 20s.

But my daughter Catherine, 26, is getting married soon, to her lovely fiance Kristopher, 27, in a historic church in Kent, and I certainly don’t want to steal the spotlight. So how to choose the perfect outfit? I asked bridal experts to compile five of the best mother-of-the-bride outfits the High Street has to offer. Did I find ‘The One’? Read on to find out . . .

Pink lace dress, £295, and shoes, £160,  lkbennett.com Hat, £30, coast.com

THE EXPERT VIEW

‘The length of hem can make or break your outfit,’ says wedding wear designer Catharina Eden. ‘Too long and it looks dowdy; too short and it looks as if you think you’re 21.

‘The mother-of-the-bride needs to be able to bend down to smooth your daughter’s train, reach up to fix her veil, and sit down and stand up in church without your hem rising. Go for one inch above the knee if you have great legs; one inch below if you don’t.’

KIM'S VERDICT

I love the way this look is modest, but not mumsy. The pretty lace overlay means I can show a little bit of decolletage without having any cleavage on display. The nude colour is slimming, and it fits well, skimming over my hips. I’m not so keen on the hat, which looks like a piece of fishing kit. I thought black was out of the question for weddings, but used sparingly in details such as the lace, shoes and hat, it sharpens up the outfit.

THE EXPERT VIEW

‘Every 
mother-of-the-bride wants to cover her arms,’ says Catharina. ‘You don’t
 need to have full sleeves — you can go for a lace overlay or wear a 
cropped jacket or bolero you can take off later for dancing.’

KIM'S VERDICT

This 
outfit ticks all the boxes for me. Flowery dresses can look chintzy, but
 this watercolour floral print is on trend and you could pick out any 
shade, from pink or purple to teal or blue, for your jacket and hat. 
It’s fitted but not restrictive, a great length and the neckline doesn’t
 show too much cleavage. The bracelet sleeves are comfortable. I’m a big
 fan of this hat — it’s like a fascinator, making a statement without 
swamping your head.       

SCORE: 5/5

Goat dress, £450, fenwick.co.uk

Hat, £280, ginafoster.co.uk

Shoes, £39.99, zara.com

Clutch, £165 russellandbromley.com

THE EXPERT VIEW

‘A plain outfit can be worn with an 
elaborate hat, while an embellished dress works with simple headwear,’ 
says milliner Sara Gadd.

‘Full hats and larger headpieces are 
popular this season, but choose a style that won’t cast a shadow over 
your face in photographs.’

KIM'S VERDICT

THIS saucer-shaped creation is a 
showstopper but it isn’t too big and it’s incredibly light, so there’s 
no danger of ‘hat hair’.

The pastel crepe dress won’t crease when you 
sit down and the darts are slimming.  

SCORE: 5/5

Hobbs dress, £149, johnlewis.com

MaxMara coat, £439, and Whiteley hat, £99, Fenwick fenwick.co.uk

Shoes, £88, boden.co.uk

THE EXPERT VIEW

‘The bride’s mother chooses the colour 
of her outfit first, getting her cue from her daughter,’ says Catharina.
 ‘The mother of the groom should then go for a complementary hue from a 
different colour group. So, if the bride’s mother chooses lilac, the 
groom’s mother should go for metallics. As to how pale you can go, if 
your daughter’s happy for you to wear cream, try it with gold, which 
reflects light on to the face.’

KIM'S VERDICT

Truly lovely. The long jacket will look 
smart, but I can take it off for dancing. It’s a flattering length, and 
not too restrictive, while the metallic spots give it the wow factor. I 
love the gold shoes, which take the outfit up a notch. The hat is light 
and unobtrusive, and the weave matches that of the dress and 
coat.

THE EXPERT VIEW

‘If you’re not comfortable showing your 
legs, trousers can be very chic — just be careful not to look 
underdressed,’ says Catharina. ‘A super-smart coat can be the answer, 
made from silk with a little natural shimmer, or a detailed design. If 
you’re pear-shaped, it’ll draw the eyes to tour top half and skim over 
your hips.’

KIM'S VERDICT

I would never have considered trousers 
as I’d have assumed they’d be too casual. But while these are fairly 
simple, the coat transforms them into something special, and I 
particularly like the combination of white with eau de nil. The hat is 
by top milliner William Chambers, so you get designer style at a High 
Street price.
