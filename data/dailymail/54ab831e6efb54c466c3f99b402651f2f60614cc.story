Plans to strip British jihadis of their UK citizenship will be unveiled by David Cameron tomorrow

Draconian plans to strip British jihadis of their UK citizenship will be unveiled by David Cameron tomorrow.

He will ban them from entering the UK, forcing them to stay in Iraq, Syria or other countries such as Turkey, from where many fly back to Britain.

The Prime Minister will argue that they must be stripped of their passports – and their right to come back to the UK – because they could be plotting terrorist attacks.

The move could land the Government in trouble with human rights judges, however. It is against international law to make an individual stateless – they can be stripped of their citizenship only if they have dual nationality.

The Prime Minister intends to get round this by claiming the ban is temporary – and justified following a warning by intelligence chiefs that the risk of a major terrorist attack on the UK mainland is ‘severe.’

The tough response from No 10 comes a week after former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis and Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, called for similar action.

Writing in The Mail on Sunday a week ago, Mr Davis poured scorn on Home Secretary Theresa May’s ‘limp’ plan to use anti-social behaviour orders to curb the risk posed by British jihadis.

‘Asbos for terrorists? It is hard to imagine ISIS killers quaking in their boots,’ he said.

His comments were echoed by Lord Carey who, in a separate article, said Britons pursuing jihad in Iraq and Syria should be forced to give up their passports.

London Mayor Boris Johnson and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe demanded similar measures.

British intelligence officers believe at least 500 British citizens have travelled to Iraq and Syria to wage jihad.

About half are thought to have returned, and some experts believe the number of British jihadis could be far higher. 

Turned away: Mr Cameron will ban them from entering the UK, forcing them to stay in Iraq, Syria or other countries such as Turkey. The move could land the Government in trouble with human rights judges, however

Mr Cameron has said he is determined to avoid ‘knee-jerk’ measures. However, he will also announce new plans to stop more young British Muslims joining IS by beefing up powers to strip them of their passports.

Rules brought in by the Coalition last year have resulted in only 23 passports being removed.

Downing Street sources have denied that there is a rift between Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who has resisted similar measures in the past on the grounds that they infringe civil liberties.
