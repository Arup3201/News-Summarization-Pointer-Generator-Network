Electronic ID wristbands could be given to all tourists visiting Thailand, the country's tourism minister has revealed.

Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul said the devices would be used to help identify and locate tourists who get lost or into trouble.

'When tourists check in to a hotel they will be given a wristband with a serial number that matches their ID and shows the contact details of the resort they are staying in, so that if they're out partying late and, for example, get drunk or lost, they can be easily assisted,' Kobkarn said.

The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15

The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament 

The minister said there were plans for these wristbands to eventually incorporate some sort of 'electronic tracking device'.

She said a 'buddy system', pairing tourists with a local minder at tourist spots, was also being discussed.

But Kobkarn admitted that not everybody was comfortable with the wristband idea.

'Most people welcome the idea but some hotels are concerned that tourists may not want to wear the wristbands.' 

Concerns have also been raised about the safety of tourists in Thailand following the murder of two Britons.

The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. 

Detectives investigating the murders on the island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched.

Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers

In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon.

'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 

'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.'

The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence

Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims.

A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. 

A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results.

The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. 

Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits.

Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder

Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15.

A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. 

Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death.

'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang.

'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' 

Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach.

The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man

DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved.

'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang.

'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.'

He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. 

Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body.

In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs.

'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice.

'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'
