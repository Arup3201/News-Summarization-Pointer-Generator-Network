Jamie Carragher has slammed Manchester United for their failure to bring in a top defender to the club during the summer transfer window despite being the top spenders in the Premier League.

Sportsmail's Carragher was working as a pundit for Sky Sports on the game between Leicester and Manchester United on Sunday, after the game airing his views on United's defensive frailties - clear for all to see during their 5-3 defeat against the Foxes.

Even after landing Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, the argument from Carragher is that United lack a commanding centre-half, despite spending over £200million on new additions. 

Jamie Carragher says it was mismanagement by Manchester United not to bring in a top defender

 Carragher spoke honestly and passionately as he gave his thoughts on Manchester United's defence

Carragher said: 'Manchester United were the biggest spending team in the Premier League and haven't even bought a proper defender.

'To spend that much money and not bring in a top class defender is mis-management at the end of the day.

'You look at Liverpool last season and the goals they conceded which ultimately cost them the league, United look vulnerable like that at the back this season.

'They look like the United of old in terms of their attacking play and are showing real pace and quality in that department for sure, but defensively you have to question them.' 

To compound matters for the Red Devils Jonny Evans was taken off injured in the first half, while Tyler Blackett was dismissed in the second half for a professional foul which led to Leicester's fifth and final goal from the penalty spot.

The latest defeat, which leaves United firmly poised in mid-table with just five points from as many games, will come as a huge blow to Louis van Gaal who would have be looking for his side to build on their  emphatic win against QPR last weekend and make it back-to-back wins against Leicester.

Van Gaal was understandably bemused after seeing his side throw away a two-goal lead, admitting he didn't know exactly what had happened.

He said: 'We had complete control. How is it possible that you give this game away?'

'You never expect that when you're 3-1 ahead. You have to kill the game and keep possession. We couldn't do that.'
