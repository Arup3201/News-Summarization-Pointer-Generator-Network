Mauricio Pochettino will have to personally fork out £2million if he wants a move to Tottenham Hotspur.

The Southampton boss is among chairman Daniel Levy's top candidates to replace Tim Sherwood after he was relieved of his duties at White Hart Lane this week.

Pochettino has been credited with turning Saints into one of the Premier League's most attractive sides to watch.

He's gone! Tim Sherwood was relieved of his duties at White Hart Lane earlier this week

The Argentine has a year left on his 
current deal at St Mary's and will have to pay the huge figure because 
of a clause in his contract.

Levy has already made checks on Ajax boss Frank de Boer, but Pochettino's stock in England continues to rise.

The 42-year-old is highly thought of after guiding Southampton to eighth this season while allowing Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw to flourish.

There is a slight rebuilding job to be done in north London this summer after Andre Villas-Boas' £107m transfer splurge last year failed to pay off.

Record signing £30m Erik Lamela, Romanian centre back Vlad Chiriches, Etienne Capoue and Roberto Soldado - all signed before this indifferent campaign - are subjects of interest from abroad.

It means any incoming manager will have the opportunity to mould their own squad - something Pochettino would relish given the potential outgoings at Southampton.

Shaw and Lallana appear geared to leave the south coast, with a number of other stars courted by Premier League rivals.

Having a look: Chairman Daniel Levy has a raft of potential candidates to take over ahead of next season
