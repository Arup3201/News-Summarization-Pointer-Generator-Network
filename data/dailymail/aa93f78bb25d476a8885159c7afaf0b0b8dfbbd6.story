When strangers kept telling Aron Dale he was a dead ringer for Harry Styles, the student hit on a brilliant idea.

He gave up university in the hope of making a lucrative living as a lookalike of the One Direction heart-throb.

But the 25-year-old has had only six jobs in more than a year – mostly at children’s parties – at £100 a time.

Lookalike: Aron Dale, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, insists that whenever he goes shopping he is 'surrounded' by screaming fans who think he really is the floppy-haired One Direction singer

That is despite him signing up with five lookalike agencies and claiming that he can’t go out without being mobbed by fans of the 20-year-old singer.

He even says he can’t have a girlfriend because they get too jealous of all the attention he receives.

The former engineering student claims 
he is a ‘distraction’ for women who cannot stop looking at him - and 
often brings crowds of females ‘to a standstill’.

He
 added: ‘At first I didn’t really notice I looked like Harry because One
 Direction is more for young girls, so I didn’t really take an interest 
in the band.

‘But soon 
people were stopping and gawping at me in the streets and friends and 
family were commenting on our similar looks. It has its ups and downs, 
looking like a famous singer.

‘But
 I can bring a whole coffee shop or restaurant to a standstill when I go
 out dressed in Harry’s trademark clothing - bandana round my head, 
skinny jeans and leather boots.

‘On
 top of this, I talk like him and I have the same swagger - I just am 
him. It can be difficult looking like someone famous but I guess this is
 my life now. There’s not much I can do about my face.

Out and about: Mr Dale, who lives in a £90,000 terraced house in Redcar, is planning to move to London

Posed up: Mr Dale is currently signed to five 
lookalike agencies and makes £100 an hour for each appearance - but has 
had so little work that he is thinking of moving to the capital

‘When everyone fancies you, the novelty wears off after a while.’

He says his lukewarm success as a lookalike since packing in his Northumbria University engineering course is because everyone in his home town of Redcar, North Yorkshire, already knows he isn’t the real Harry.

He is now thinking of moving south. ‘When I’m in London I can’t walk around without being mobbed. There’s got to be money in looking like I do. I need to make the most of it while Harry’s so big.’

But not everyone in the seaside resort agrees that he is such a twin for the pop star. One local, 18-year-old Samantha Timmins, said: ‘He looks like Harry’s third cousin. I suppose he has the same hair. He looks more like my uncle Steve.’

Gemma Walker, 17, a One Direction fan from the town, was less subtle, saying: ‘He’s completely deluded.’

He said: ‘If I lived in London it would be a different story. Redcar is a small place and everyone knows who I am here, so they no longer mistake me for Harry.

‘If I get the right publicity, I could be huge.'
