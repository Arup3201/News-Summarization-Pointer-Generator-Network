Alex Salmond sparked outrage yesterday by comparing the Scottish referendum to South Africa’s post-apartheid election.

The first minister said the sight of his countrymen waiting in line to register to vote was similar to that of black South Africans forming long queues outside polling stations in 1994.

But while Scots have long enjoyed the full trappings of democracy – and elect both Scottish and UK MPs – black South Africans were having their first sight of the ballot box after centuries of cruel exclusion.

Alex Salmond said the sight of his countrymen waiting in line to register to vote was similar to that of black South Africans  in the first post-apartheid election

Peter Hain, a Labour ex-minister and anti-apartheid campaigner, said Mr Salmond’s South Africa comparison was ‘preposterous’.

‘It was the first free, democratic election in South Africa’s history, when people who had never been allowed to vote in their lives did so,’ he added.

‘Comparing that with the Scottish referendum just underlines how the Yes campaign is resorting to desperation and irrationality.

‘South Africa was a brutal police state, with state terror, state-sponsored assassinations, torture, absolute denial of human dignity if you had the wrong colour skin.

‘To compare it to Scots seeking independence is just insulting to the freedom struggle that Nelson Mandela led.’

Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ‘It is an outrageous comparison. Black people were oppressed and unable to vote, which has never been the case in Scotland.

‘It is insulting to anyone involved in democratic elections here over the century and belittles what people went through in South Africa.

'This is typical of Salmond’s hyperbole. Scots have always been a key part of running the UK, including with Scottish prime ministers.

‘He accuses the No campaign of panicking, but making this comparison is just desperation.’

And BBC broadcaster Sue MacGregor, who was raised in South Africa by Scottish parents, said: ‘Voting was not possible for many in South Africa until that election, that is why they queued for one or two days to vote. It is not comparable.’ 

Describing what he saw in Dundee, Mr Salmond had said: ‘[It was] almost reminiscent of the scenes in South Africa that some of us of a certain age remember from 20 years ago or so when people queued up to vote in the first free elections.’

Mr Salmond yesterday also dismissed reports that the Queen is concerned about the prospect of Scottish independence.

He said: ‘I want the Queen as head of state, as Queen of Scots of an independent Scotland as her ancestors were.

'Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots, and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land.

‘I had an audience at Balmoral some two weeks ago, but the proper position is you don’t discuss these matters in public.

'The statement from the palace about the Queen’s neutrality in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one.’

The first democratic elections took place in South Africa over three days from 27 to 29 April, 1994. Despite threats of violence, the voting was largely peaceful.

Mr Mandela, who had been imprisoned by the apartheid regime for 27 years, became the country’s first black president after his ANC party won 62.5 per cent of the votes.

The parliament in Holyrood was formed in 1999 following the referendum campaigned for by Donald Dewar two years previously. 

Its powers including running the health service and education north of the border. Since 1707 there have been 12 prime ministers who were either Scots-born or of Scottish extraction.

Jim Murphy, Labour MP for East Renfrewshire, who lived in South Africa for several years as a child before returning to Scotland, said: ‘To compare any vote in Scotland, no matter how important, with South Africa’s first ever democratic election is crass.  

‘Scotland is not Soweto and a decision on whether or not we stay British has no parallels at all with the beauty of the liberation of South Africa from the evil type of racism that was apartheid.’

He added: ‘Scotland’s first minister seems to be getting carried away with himself the nearer we get to referendum day.’
