Mystery: Christopher Brahney disappeared after losing his mobile phone at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29

Coronation Street bosses have scrapped a plot line in which a body is pulled from a canal because it bore too many similarities to the mystery death of a Stone Roses fan.

Christopher Brahney disappeared after losing his mobile phone at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29.

After an exhaustive search of the city, his body was found in the Manchester Ship Canal near Media City in Salford Quays on Monday.

But out of respect for the 22-year-old's family and friends, producers of the ITV soap said they have decided to pull the scenes which were filmed weeks ago.

An ITV spokesperson said: 'The producers of Coronation Street have 
taken the decision to remove references in this Friday's show, which 
although scripted and filmed weeks ago, bore some similarities to the 
manner in which Christopher Brahney’s body was found.

'Like many others, we were extremely saddened by the news of his death, and our thoughts and condolences are with his family.'

Mystery continues to shroud Mr Brahney's
death - which has sent shockwaves through the UK music community - 
after a post mortem failed to conclude exactly how he died.

Big atmosphere: Christopher had been at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29

More than 120,000 people joined the 'Help Find Chris Brahney' Facebook page following his disappearance.

And since his body was found, Stone Roses fans have launched an online campaign to propel the band’s anthem 'One Love' to the top of the UK singles chart.

Anyone wanting to support the campaign is being urged to Tweet it with the #ChrisBrahneyOneLove Twitter hashtag.

Missing: After an exhaustive search of the city, his body was found in the Manchester Ship Canal near Media City in Salford Quays on Monday

In a statement on the Stone Roses website, the band said: 'We'd like to extend our sincerest condolences to Christopher's family and friends. Our thoughts are with them at this incredibly sad time. Ian, John, Mani and Reni.'

From previous inquiries, officers believe that after the concert Mr Brahney used the park and ride facility at Bowlee Park, Heywood Old Road, towards Middleton. He could have been at Bowlee Park shortly before midnight.

Further inquiries also revealed that he may have been seen outside the Maccabi Sports Centre on Bury Old Road at about 12.05am on Saturday June 30.

Too similar: The plot revolved around troubled alcoholic Peter Barlow, played by Chris Gascoyne, who disappears before his father receives a call to say a body has been pulled from a canal

Officers now believe that Mr Brahney managed to get into Manchester city centre in the early hours of June 30 where he picked up shoes that he had bought earlier that day and hid in Rosenfields car park on Thorniley Brow near to Shudehill Metro link station.

He also had sunglasses on his head.

The scrapped Coronation Street plot had revolved around troubled alcoholic Peter Barlow, played by Chris Gascoyne, who disappears before his father Ken receives a call to say a body has been pulled from a canal

However, when they arrive at the morgue to identify the body, they find the corpse does not in fact belong to Peter.

ITV added: 'What we have removed is multiple references to a body being found in a 
canal. We have made the change so the finding referenced by a policeman 
is now broader, simply a body being found, no reference to where.'
