The family of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, pictured in 1996, say Italian authorities are refusing to say where his body is

The family of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, whose funeral was stopped because of angry protests, said today they do not know where his body is.

Family lawyer Paolo Giachini said he and the former SS captain's family lost track of Priebke's casket on Tuesday night, when they tried to hold a funeral Mass for him in a church compound in Albano Laziale, south of Rome.

At a certain point, he told Sky TG24, a group of about 30 people entered the compound and took the casket out following protests between Priebke's right-wing supporters and anti-fascist demonstrators.

Italian state radio said the casket was taken to a nearby military base.

But
Giachini said he had not been able to establish who has the body or 
where it is, and Italian officials have refused to divulge information 
about it.

'It's 
unheard of that a casket can be made to disappear in this country, taken
from those who had custody of it in a private place - a place of 
worship - and taking it by force without any order, any notification,' 
Giachini said. 'We want clarity.'

Priebke
died on Friday, aged 100, where he was serving a life term for the 1944
massacre of 335 civilians at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome.

It was one of the worst atrocities in German-occupied Italy during World War II.

His death sparked waves of outrage in Italy's Jewish community as he never repented for his actions during the war.

In a final statement issued by his lawyer upon his death, Priebke denied that Jews were gassed in Nazi death camps.

In
a separate video statement released by Giachini on Thursday, Priebke 
also defended his actions at the Ardeatine Caves, saying the orders to 
shoot the civilians came from Adolf Hitler himself and that members of 
his SS unit were told they would be shot if they did not obey.

Giachini
said he had been in touch with the German embassy for possible burial 
in Priebke's native land, once the body is located.

The mayor of Rome, Ignazio Marino, told state television RAI earlier this week: 'I
know that people are considering what decisions to take and I don't 
rule out contacts between our government and the government of Germany.'

Marino
said the body had been brought to the military airport at Pratica di 
Mare from the town of Albano Laziale, where clashes between angry 
residents and neo-Nazi visitors prevented the funeral going ahead.

A fringe 
right-wing group, the Catholic Society of St Pius (SSPX), had organised 
the funeral despite local protests.

The arch-traditionalist SSPX is at 
odds with mainstream Catholic teaching and has strained relations with 
the Vatican.

Rome daily Il 
Messaggero quoted Priebke's lawyer Paolo Giachini as saying he had 
ordered the suspension of the funeral after the neo-Nazis attempted to 
join the service in defiance of an agreement that the ceremony would be 
private.

Demonstrators outside the 
church landed kicks and punches on the hearse and set upon the priest 
until he was rescued by riot police.

Several
dozen skinheads and right-wing extremists dressed in camouflage clothes
and combat boots came to pay their last respects to a man who had 
become an icon for the far right.

Several
gave fascist salutes, prompting a crowd that included relatives of 
victims,  anti-fascist protesters and Jewish survival groups to surge 
forward chanting ‘Executioner’ and ‘Murderer!’

Protesters
and right wingers clashed, landing punches and throwing bottles, until 
armed police in full riot gear stepped in, launching tear gas.

The residents of Albano Laziale had turned out in force to oppose the funeral. 

Doctor
Ugo Piccarreta said: ‘It’s a national disgrace. The wounds that Priebke
has left in the hearts of the Italian population mean that he cannot be
compared to any other criminal. He doesn’t even deserve to transit 
through this town.

‘I don’t understand how the church can pardon him – he never even repented. ‘

Local
resident Giuliana Uccino said: ‘We are afraid that our town will become
a symbol or even a place of pilgrimage for neo fascists.’

‘This is not a fascist town. Priebke is not welcome here and not welcome in Italy.'

Priebke was in 
charge of SS troops in March 1944 who executed civilians in the 
Ardeatine Caves in retaliation for the killings of 33 German soldiers by
a partisan group.

Adolf 
Hitler had ordered German occupation forces to respond by executing 10 
Italians for every German killed.

The victims were rounded up from 
jails, streets and homes.

Priebke
was deported from Argentina to Italy after he was interviewed on U.S. 
television and admitted his role in the massacre, which he said had been
conducted against 'terrorists'.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Italy in 1998.

A row has raged for days over the 
officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave 
could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase.

Both
his birth town of Hennigsdord, in Germany and his adopted homeland of 
Argentina have made it clear that his remains are not welcome.

The Jewish Community in Rome threatened renewed protests if Priebke is permitted a tomb in the Italian capital.

‘It would be like killing those victims a second time,’ said Riccardo Pacifici, the Jewish organisation's president.

After the war Priebke had fled justice, making a home in San Carlos de Bariloche, a small town at the foot of the Andes.

He
managed to escape the Nuremberg Trials and although the Israeli secret 
services hunted him for years, he remained at large until 1994, until an
American journalist tracked him down.

A
year later he was extradited to Italy and convicted of mass murder. But
because of his age he was allowed to serve his sentence under house 
arrest with permission later granted for him to leave the house to go 
shopping, go to Mass and to the pharmacy.

In
the run up to his 100th birthday in July, Holocaust survivor groups 
argued that he should be prevented from celebrating.

Violence ensued 
when protesters clashed with a neo-Nazi supporter who had travelled from
Germany to bring him a bottle of champagne.
