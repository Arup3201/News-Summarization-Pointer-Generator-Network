A veteran who served in Iraq for 14 months has been denied in-state tuition by the University of North Carolina as she moved away briefly to a base in Texas where her husband was stationed.

Hayleigh Perez, 26, left the state for just six months in 2009 but continued paying the mortgage and taxes on their Raeford, North Carolina property, which they have owned since 2006.

Yet when Perez went to use her G.I. Bill for classes at UNC in Pembroke, near her husband's base in Fort Bragg, she was told she did not qualify as a state resident because of her time away from it.

Officials said she had not paid income tax in North Carolina during her time in Texas and Iraq - even though she had been moved on orders from the Army.

'I got frustrated. When I tried to inquire, they kept putting up roadblocks,' she told FoxNews.com. 'It’s just disgraceful that life in Iraq, where you could die, is easier than trying to go to school here.'

Perez told the news channel that she enlisted in 2005 and was stationed in Fort Bragg, where she trained as a radiology technologist.

She was later sent to Camp Bucca in Iraq, where she met fellow soldier, Jose Perez-Rodriguez.

They married and when they returned to the U.S. in 2006, they bought a home in Raeford. They lived there until 2009, when Perez-Rodriguez was assigned to a base in Texas.

'We were simply living there temporarily on orders from the United States Army,' she told WREG.

Perez returned to the home in 2009 and 
left the military that September. She went on to have her daughter, 
Calleigh, and began looking to the future - and different career 
options.

The G.I. Bill was enacted in 1944 following World War II to help soldiers readjust into civilian life. It gave them help with loans, education and living expenses. There have been numerous amendments since.

The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers financial support for education and housing to people who have served in the U.S. military for at least 90 days after September 10, 2001.

To receive the support, soldiers must have been honorably discharged from duty. The benefits last for 15 years following release from active duty and provide 36 months of coverage.

The Bill covers full tuition and fees paid directly to the school for public school, in-state students. Some funds are covered for private or foreign schools but they are capped.

It covers training including undergraduate and graduate degrees, vocational training and flight training.

She began applying for colleges to study for a master's as a physicians assistant, and was accepted to UNC's Fayetteville and Pembroke.

When she began studying at Pembroke, she was stunned when officials said she was not considered an in-state resident. In an unfortunate twist, UNC Fayetteville said she was.

She appealed the decision and said she was met with 'hostility and aggression'. Again, it was denied.

She later learned she was rejected as she had not paid income tax in North Carolina in the years in which she was in Iraq and Texas.

'The process was demeaning,' she told 
Fox. 'They [Pembroke] treated me so poorly I felt like I was a criminal 
on trial. They told me I couldn’t reapply.'

Sgt. Jason Thigpen, founder and 
president of the Student Veterans Advocacy Group, added that nearly 
250,000 other veterans have to pay for their tuition because of 'adverse
and short-sighted changes our federal government made'.

A
spokesperson for UNC did not comment on the specific case but denied it
would be granting in-school tuition for illegal immigrants, as had 
previously been debated.

Perez launched a petition on Change.org and has gathered 120,000 signatures in five days.

The Students Veterans Advocacy group,
which is representing Perez, and where she now runs social networking, 
will sue UNC and the federal government if the decision is not reversed.

Support: Even when they moved to a Texas base for six months, they paid property tax in North Carolina

Battle: Even after she appealed, UNC Pembroke refused to help her tuition so she left the school

'Hundreds of thousands of veterans across the country are facing an arduous battle proving their residency to a state - because of the unique circumstances that encompass our military duties,' she told WREG.

'We need and deserve the Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits we have rightfully earned through blood, sweat, and often tears.'

She added that she would not be returning to UNC-Pembroke and is now taking classes at a private college. 'I don't want to be associated with an institution that treats veterans this way,' she said.
