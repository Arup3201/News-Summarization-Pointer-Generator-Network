Generously donating a bag of clothes to the Red Cross could have cost an elderly woman her entire life savings.

No one has yet come forward to claim the significant sum, believed to be thousands of dollars, found in a bag of clothing donated to a Red Cross store in Coolangatta, Queensland.

It has been more than 48 hours since an elderly woman dropped off the bag and told the staff that she would come back to do some shopping on Tuesday morning.

An elderly woman has yet to come forward to claim the significant sum of cash that was found in a bag of donated clothes she dropped off to a Red Cross store in Coolangatta on Tuesday morning

But after the woman didn’t return, the staff took the significant sum of cash, which was inside in a small maroon money zip bag, to the Coolangatta police station.

The staff, who knew the woman as she had visited the store several times, suspected she was local to the area but were unaware of her name or address.

Although Red Cross area manager Michelle Webster could not confirm the amount of cash found, she conceded that it was significant enough to be missed.

‘Fingers crossed that the rightful owner comes forward,’ she told MailOnline. ‘Once our customers leave our doors it’s difficult to get in touch with them.’

Ms Webster did admit it was possible that the money could have been an intentional donation but the Red Cross wouldn’t accept the cash until there was clarification.

‘We need to make sure and check the donatee definitely did want to donate it,’ she said. ‘Whenever we are in doubt we take the valuables to the police.’

Coolangatta Acting Senior Sergeant Steve Quinn said the police were hoping to access CCTV footage from the store, and or the street.

‘No one has come forward yet to claim the money, which was a significant amount,’ he said.

Police urge anyone who knows the rightful owner of the cash to contact the Coolangatta police station
