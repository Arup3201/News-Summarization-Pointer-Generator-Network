The BBC handed one of its top executives a £200,000 golden goodbye – then rehired him two years later.

Former Radio 1 boss Matthew Bannister – once nicknamed ‘the fat controller’ by DJ Chris Evans – is still on the corporation’s payroll more than a decade after he pocketed the huge severance sum.

Details of his extraordinary payoff can be revealed by the Daily Mail as it emerged the BBC re-employed 233 staff it made redundant in the past decade, including another executive given £365,000 as he left.

It heaps further pressure on the broadcaster’s top brass to explain why millions of pounds of the licence fee has been handed to departing staff, including £25million to 150 senior employees.

Tory MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, said the latest revelations ‘drive a coach and horses’ through the BBC’s claim that payoffs helped reduce the overall salary bill by encouraging staff to leave.

High salary: Mr Bannister earned £153,000 as controller of Radio 1, head of production and head of marketing

He said: ‘There has been a revolving door at the BBC. You get paid to leave, then paid to come back again. The whole argument for payoffs has been that it reduces the headcount and salary bill.

‘But it is beginning to look like the senior executives approving payoffs were doing so with the expectation they would themselves benefit from similar deals.’ 

Mr Bannister is currently employed as a presenter on Radio 4 and the World Service.

The corporation has refused to disclose his current salary, the 56-year-old earned £153,000 as controller of Radio 1, head of production and head of marketing.

He left in 2000 after narrowly losing to Greg Dyke in the race to become director- general.

Figures buried in the following year’s accounts reveal he was handed a £140,060 ‘termination payment’, plus £54,590 towards his pension.

When he was in charge of Radio 1, Mr Bannister was most famous for hiring Chris Evans. The pair later fell out spectacularly after he refused to let the DJ work a four-day week, prompting Evans to walk out. 

As head of production, he was embroiled in another row when it was discovered Vanessa Feltz’s daytime talk show had featured fake guests. 

But instead of leaving the corporation for good after pocketing his payoff, Mr Bannister returned in 2002 as a late-night presenter on Radio 5 Live.

He later recalled: ‘I decided to withdraw from managing things and just get on with being a broadcaster, which was lovely.’

He has since become a well-known voice on Radio 4, where he hosts the weekly obituary programme Last Word.

According to The Sunday Telegraph, the BBC also rehired its former head of religion Michael Wakelin after handing him a £364,000 redundancy payment in March 2009. He was later given a part-time job as a producer on Radio 2.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that another nine managers earning £100,000 or more were also re-employed despite receiving severance pay. 

Tory MP Angie Bray said the revelation was ‘gobsmacking’, adding: ‘You would think if you’re getting a payoff, it would be “goodbye” and “thank you for your contribution”. Not “see you in a year”.’ 

In June, the National Audit Office revealed the BBC has paid out £369million in severance payments over eight years, including £60million to senior managers.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC policy states that former full-time employees who have been made redundant may apply and be re-hired into the BBC after a minimum of 12 months, and three months on a freelance contract basis.

‘Matthew Bannister was made redundant from the role of chief executive BBC Production in 2000 making savings on an executive post. He returned two years later.’ 

The BBC said Michael Wakelin is employed by an independent production company that makes programmes for Radio 2, rather than directly by the corporation.
