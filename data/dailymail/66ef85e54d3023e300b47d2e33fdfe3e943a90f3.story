Entrusting the best man with your wedding bands can be a treacherous undertaking.

One couple chose instead to leave their fate in the hands of technology, opting for a drone to deliver the rings during their recent wedding ceremony.

At their nuptials in Mafra, near Lisbon in Portugal on September 27, bride and groom Hugo and Lara received their rings during their wedding vows by drone which was remotely driven by their friend Tim.

A video on the high-tech device recorded the stunt, which thrilled wedding guests and luckily went off without a hitch.

Tim drove the drone down the aisle to the alter, where fellow guests Ana and Pedro collected the rings from a box attached to the unpiloted vehicle and handed them over the bride and groom.

It took some convincing for the couple to agree to the sci-fi approach, only agreeing to it five days before the ceremony.

There was some last-minute panic as well, Tim reveals, with unscheduled rain forcing the wedding inside and some adjustments made to the drone to accommodate the indoor delivery.

After the ceremony, the drone captured some moments with the couple and their guests.
