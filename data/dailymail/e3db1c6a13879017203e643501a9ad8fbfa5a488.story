Drink driver: William Haswell, 19, caused a four-hour blackout after crashing his father's car into an electricity pole while almost three times over the limit

A drunk teenager caused a four-hour blackout to dozens of homes after crashing his dad's Jaguar into an electricity pole while travelling for a McDonald's breakfast.

William Haswell was almost three times over the limit when he took the £11,000 car to a McDonald's drive-thru.

But as the 19-year-old travelled to the fast food outlet he lost control of the car. It spun around and smashed into an electricity pole just yards from his home in Boldon Colliery, South Tyneside.

The damage to the pole resulted in 39 homes in the area losing power for four hours between 6.45am and 10.45am on November 10 last year.

Haswell was arrested at the scene after a breath test showed he had 98mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35mg per 100ml of breath.

The teenager pleaded guilty to taking a vehicle without consent and causing an accident, drink driving and driving without insurance, when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday.

Paul Anderson, prosecuting, said: 'The car belongs to his father who works in Spain for the majority of the year and he left the defendant strict instructions not to use it.

'At 6.40am on the day in question the police received a report of an accident on Hedworth Lane.

'The defendant had lost control of the car which had spun out of control and hit an electricity pole, causing the lines to come down.'

When police got to the crash, Haswell told them it was his fault and that he had been on his way to McDonald's for some breakfast.

In his police interview he said he saw some flashing lights behind him, panicked, and put the brakes on.

Mr Anderson added: 'He said he had been in Newcastle drinking until 3am and had been home for a couple of hours before getting in the car.

'There was loss of power to 39 homes for four hours and it cost an estimated £1,500 to repair the damage.'

The court heard the car cost £11,000 and was not written off. Laura Johnson, defending, said: 'This was a very costly McDonald's breakfast and one, I can only assume, he didn't get to eat.

'He made a stupid decision to drive his father's car after only a couple of hours of sleep following a night out. He is deeply ashamed of himself and embarrassed.'

Magistrates gave Haswell a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaidwork and banned him from driving for two years.

He was also ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge.
