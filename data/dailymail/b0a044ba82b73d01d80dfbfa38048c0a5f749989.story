Barbara Bush, having changed her mind about her son's candidacy for president, now says that Jeb is Republicans' 'best chance of taking back the White House in 2016.'

The matriarch of the Bush family endorsed her son's expected presidential campaign in a fundraising email for his Super PAC on Wednesday in which she also announced that she was starting the 'Run Jeb Run' fund.

Two years ago, the former first lady tamped down rumors about her Jeb's rumored run, telling NBC, 'We've had enough Bushes.' 

But then, last month, after her son had already disclosed that he was exploring a bid, she indicated that she is now in favor of a third Bush presidency.

Bush

Potential presidential candidate Jeb Bush answers questions at the Rioz Steakhouse Wednesday morning in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Barbara Bush, in an email sent sent through her son's political action group, said today that Jeb is Republicans' 'best chance of taking back the White House in 2016'

At a dinner for their family foundation, Bush popped up on the big screens during Jeb's speech via a Skype call and said, 'Jeb, it's Mom. Listen, what do you mean, "too many Bushes'?... I changed my mind!"

Jeb had been talking about the number of family members who work with the charity when his mother interrupted him.

'My mother not long ago said, "There have been enough Bushes." And it got me thinking, if we've had enough Bushes in one forum, do we have too many Bushes in the family literacy forum today?' he said, according to CNN.

That's when his mother stepped in to say that her feelings had shifted. 

'Hey, Mom,' he said back to her. 'Can I get that in writing?'

'I said our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America, if America needs you for as long as you can help. And yes, you can get it in writing and in public,' she told him.

Jeb, who is known to be close with his mother, replied, 'I love you. You’re the greatest mother in the world.'

A former Florida governor who has been talked about as a candidate for president for nearly as long as his brother George W. has been out office, is nearly all in to the 2016 race, with the exception of an official announcement.

This month he visited consequential primary states Iowa and New Hampshire for the first time since leaving public office, and he is currently in South Carolina, another state that votes early in the nominating cycle.

He is considered the favorite of establishment Republicans and is running neck-and-neck with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is quickly amassing conservative support, in surveys of right-leaning voters.

In the email to backers of her son today, Barbara acknowledged, that 'when the idea of Jeb running for President first came up, I was hesitant.'

'You may have heard about that.

'When you see the pounding candidates, their spouses, and even their children take, what mother wouldn't be?' the former first lady and wife of former President George H.W. Bush, wrote in a message distributed by her son's Right to Rise PAC. 

She added: 'But our problems are so profound that America needs a leader who can renew the promise of this great nation.'

'Jeb is our best chance of taking back the White House in 2016, and I hope that you will join me in pushing him to run.' 

So far, her son has mostly raised money among high-dollar donors ahead of his expected announcement. 

This is one of his first asks from of the grassroots supporters he'll need to write him checks down the stretch, depending how long he stays in the race, and vote for him.
