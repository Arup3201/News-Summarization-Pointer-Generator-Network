Rugby World Cup winner Mike Tindall led Team England to glory while Zara Phillips looked on as the Celebrity Cup reached its climax at Celtic Manor on Sunday.

Actor Bradley Walsh, Dragons' Den entrepreneur Peter Jones, cricketer Graeme Swann, former world champion swimmer Mark Foster and actor Matthew Goode were among those enjoying the champagne celebrations for Team England.

In winning, they avenged defeat in last year’s final by beating Scotland to claim the trophy for the first time, and Tindall said: 'I’m happy because it means I can now ring Sir Steve Redgrave and tell him I’ve been able to do something he wasn’t able to do as captain last year.'

It left the the likes of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill, Irish superstars Ronan 
Keating, Brian McFadden and Keith Duffy, actors Dougray Scott, Philip 
Glenister and Andrew Howard, rugby legends Gareth Edwards and Gavin 
Hastings and TV presenter Gethin Jones on the losing side, though.

England clawed back an overnight deficit to consign home side Wales, 
captained by television star Rob Brydon, to the third-place play-off 
where they beat Ireland.

Brydon vied for the biggest laughs over the 
weekend with Walsh and Mrs Brown’s Boys star Brendan O’Carroll.

The latter said: 'Apart from raising money for the charities, the most 
important thing was not the golf but entertaining the people who came 
out to see us. I just hope they’ve had as good a time as we have.

'I play in charity golf events all over the world and this has been the 
best organised event and the warmest welcome I’ve ever had.'

Golf wasn't the only thing on the agenda, though, as challenges and Q&A sessions were held with Welsh rugby star George North and 
Jesse Metcalfe, the Dallas and Desperate Housewives heartthrob.

Lucky: There were large crowds to see the host of sports and showbiz stars in the Celebrity Cup

The two charities to benefit were the Caron Keating Foundation and the Play Golf Help Save Lives 
campaign, founded by former Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher, who was 
the Celebrity Cup’s golf ambassador and mentor to the star players.
