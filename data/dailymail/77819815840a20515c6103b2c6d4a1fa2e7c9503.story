Nasa has revealed a stunning animation that put viewers right in the heart of a massive solar storm.

It reveals an explosion of solar particles, seen as white static, as they were ejected from the solar surface.

The 2005 solar storm was incredibly powerful - but baffled researchers by barely affecting power on earth.

A coronal mass ejection on Jan. 20, 2005, produced an extreme amount of solar particles, seen as white static in this imagery from ESA/NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Closer to Earth, it created a solar storm with an unusual combination of strong and weak effects.

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.

Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks.

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.

Using new data and the animation, they were able to piece together what happened.

The space weather storm from the sun engulfed our planet on Jan. 21, 2005. 

The event got its start on Jan. 20, when a cloud of solar material, a coronal mass ejection or CME, burst off the sun and headed toward Earth. 

When it arrived at our planet, the ring current and radiation belts surrounding Earth swelled with extra particles, while the aurora persisted for six hours. 

Both of these are usually signs of a very large storm – indeed, this was one of the largest outpouring of solar protons ever monitored from the sun. 

But the storm barely affected the magnetic fields around Earth – disturbances in these fields can affect power grids on the ground, a potential space weather effect keenly watched for by a society so dependent on electricity.

Janet Kozyra, a space scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, thought this intriguing combination of a simultaneously weak and strong solar storm deserved further scrutiny. 

In an effort to better understand -- and some day forecast -- such storms and their potential effects on human technology, an unusual event like this can help researchers understand just what aspects of a CME lead to what effects near Earth.

'There were features appearing that we generally only see during extreme space weather events, when by other measures the storm was moderate,' said Kozyra. 

A filament of cold dense solar material moved toward the front of a Jan. 20, 2005, coronal mass ejection, which led to an unusually large amount of solar material funneling into near-Earth space during a Jan. 21 solar storm.

'We wanted to look at it holistically, much like terrestrial weather researchers do with extreme weather. 

'We took every single piece of data that we could find on the solar storm and put it together to see what was going on.'

With observations collected from ground-based networks and 20 different satellites, Kozyra and a group of colleagues, each an expert in different aspects of the data or models, found that the CME contained a rare piece of dense solar filament material. 

This filament coupled with an unusually fast speed led to the large amount of solar material observed. 

A fortuitous magnetic geometry, however, softened the blow, leading to reduced magnetic effects.

These results were published in the Aug. 14, 2014, issue of Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics.

The researchers gathered data from spacecraft orbiting in Earth's ionosphere, which extends up to 600 miles above the planet's surface, and satellites above that, orbiting through the heart of Earth's magnetic environment, the magnetosphere. 

Twelve spacecraft in Earth’s magnetosphere – in addition to other missions -- helped scientists better observe and understand an unusual January 2005 solar storm. The four Cluster spacecraft were in the solar wind, directly upstream of Earth. 

The massive amount of data was then incorporated into a variety of models developed at the University of Michigan's Center for Space Environment Modeling, which are housed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, a facility dedicated to providing comprehensive access to space weather models.

With the models in hand, the team could put together the story of this particular solar storm. It began with the CME on Jan. 20, 2005. 

The European Space Agency and NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, captured images of the CME.  

In this case, however, it seems that the dense filament sped forward, past the leading edge of the CME, so as it slammed into the magnetosphere, it delivered an extra big dose of energetic particles into near-Earth space. 

'Within one hour of the impact, a cold, dense plasma sheet formed out of the filament material,' said Kozyra. 'High density material continued to move through the magnetosphere for the entire six hours of the filament's passage.'

Despite the intense amount of plasma carried by the CME, it still lacked a key component of a super storm. 

The magnetic fields embedded in this CME generally pointed toward Earth's north pole, just as Earth's own magnetic fields do. 

This configuration causes far fewer disruptions to our planet's system than when the CME's fields point southward. 

When pointing south, the CME's fields clash with Earth's, peeling them back and setting off magnetic perturbations that cascade through the magnetosphere.

The magnetic field orientation is what kept this solar storm to low levels. 

On the other hand, the extra solar material from the filament catalyzed long-term aurora over the poles and enhanced the particle filled radiation belts around Earth, characteristic of a larger storm.

'This event, with its unusual combination of space weather effects really demonstrates why it's important to look at the entire system, not just individual elements,' said Kozyra. 

'Only by using all of this data, by watching the event from the beginning to the end, can we begin to understand all the different facets of an extreme storm like this.'
