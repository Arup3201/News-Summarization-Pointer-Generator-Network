Arrested: Arsenal defender Andre Santos was stopped by police on Friday morning

A Premier League footballer has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving after allegedly speeding away from chasing police at up to 130mph.

Arsenal defender Andre Santos, 29, is believed to have been behind the wheel of a powerful £110,000 sports car, a Maserati GranTurismo, when he was apprehended by officers only a couple of miles from his club's training ground.

The officers had reportedly noticed a car being driven erratically by a motorist who failed to stop.

Santos, from Sao Paulo in Brazil, was picked up by officers close to Arsenal’s training ground in London Colney in Hertfordshire, just inside the M25 motorway, last Friday morning.

The next day, the father of one was on the substitutes' bench for Arsenal's first match of the season against Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium.

The Sun newspaper reported that a car was driven for several miles at speeds of up to 130mph.

Santos, who joined Arsenal last year from Turkish club Fenerbahce, could be jailed if found guilty of dangerous driving.

A police source told the Sun: 'The allegation is that he was travelling at speeds up to 130 mph.

'Further enquiries are ongoing to verify the speed using on-board police cameras and technical equipment.'

Bailed: Santos was arrested by officers only a couple of miles from his club's training ground

A witness who saw the footballer after he was stopped told the newspaper: 'Two police cars were there and two or three officers were talking to the driver.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 9.30am on Friday August 17, a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop for police on the A1, near to Junction 22 of the M25.

'Officers’ attention was drawn to the vehicle due to the manner of its driving.

'The man has been bailed to return at a date in mid-September to a North London police station.'

The man was not breathalysed, police added.
