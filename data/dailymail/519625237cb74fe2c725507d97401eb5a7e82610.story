The brother of Gregory Smart, who was shot dead by his wife's teenage lover 25 years ago, has said the killer should be paroled.

Billy Flynn was just 15 when his teacher and lover, 22-year-old Pamela Smart, encouraged him to kill her husband, Gregory Smart, in their New Hampshire home in May 1990.

Flynn faces a parole hearing in Concord on Thursday, his 41st birthday. If he is paroled, he could be free as early as June 4.

'I think he did his time,' Gregory Smart's older brother, Rick Smart, told the Boston Herald.

'He was at a young age. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he shouldn't have been punished, but I want to put this behind me and I'm sure he wants to put it behind him.'

He added that although he would not use the word 'forgiveness' to describe his feelings towards the killer, he has realized that Flynn was influenced by Pamela Smart.

'I feel like he got his punishment,' he said. 'Maybe he can make something out of the rest of his life. What's important to me is Pam stays in jail for the rest of her life.'   

Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole.

Their case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix.

Smart was an instructor in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn, a fellow volunteer.

She told him she needed her 24-year-old husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced him.

Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990

On May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart, a sales representative for an insurance company, to his knees in the foyer.

As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn shot him in the head.

To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.'

Smart, whose trial was the first to be televised nationally from start to finish, was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering.

Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. 

Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband.

He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration.

Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing on Thursday and will address the board on speakerphone.

Gregory Smart's family members and friends have a right to make victim impact statements. State prosecutors will also weigh in.

The three board members are expected to confer among themselves without leaving the hearing room at the state prison in Concord and then render a decision.

If parole is granted, Flynn would not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 and only after his final parole plan is approved by the board.

Flynn's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to say what Flynn would tell the board.

But seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized.

'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said.

Gregory Smart's father, William, told Flynn then that he might be prepared to see him go free when Flynn reached 40 but that he wasn't ready yet. William Smart has since died.

Flynn married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license.

'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.'

Flynn's age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing.

'I desperately want you to know I'm not that weak person anymore,' Flynn said in 2008.

Smart's friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart is not taking a position on Flynn's parole bid but chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom.

Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.'

Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it.
