Police have come under fire after using one of their official riot vans to give Father Christmas a lift as part of a festive parade.

Crowds looked on in disbelief when Santa climbed inside the police van  in Aberdare town centre, Cynon Valley, rather than taking his sleigh.

Police used the vehicle to give him a taxi ride away from the event in what has been described as an 'ill-judged' stunt.

Officials said transporting Father Christmas in a police van had always been part of the plan

At one point children were left in tears and feared they would not get any presents after seeing Father Christmas taken away. 

In a video posted online, the crowd can be heard laughing before a voice shouts 'Santa's being arrested'.

Police said Santa had not been arrested and simply needed a ride home as he has a busy few weeks ahead. 

But parents who had taken their children to watch the family-friendly reindeer parade were furious at the 'ill-judged' stunt.

Jade Hughes, 20, from Maerdy, told Wales Online: 'There were a lot tears. People couldn't believe it actually happened.

'My four-year-old cousin started crying saying - Santa can't bring me toys now.'

'It left a lot children upset because they thought he had been arrested.

A police spokesman said: 'Santa obviously has a busy month ahead, so when he asked if we could provide transport  to help him get back to the North Pole, we were happy to oblige.'

'There was a lot of very upset kids thinking Santa wouldn't be around for them.'

The 20-year-old said the decision to transport Santa in a police van in front of a crowd of children was a mistake.

'It was a great family day but we were very let down by this error.

'Santa was there with the reindeer waving in his sleigh. Then the police van reversed, the side door was opened.' 

A  spokesman for South Wales Police said: 'Santa obviously has a busy month ahead, so when he asked if we could provide transport at the end of his sleigh ride through Aberdare town centre to help him get back to the North Pole, we were happy to oblige.'

Some members of the audience called the decision to transport Santa back home by police van 'a mistake'

Rhondda Cynon Taf council revealed that transporting Father Christmas in a police van had always been part of the plan, so he could make a swift exit. 

A spokesman  said: 'We are grateful to South Wales Police for assisting Father Christmas during his departure from Aberdare town centre after an amazing Christmas event, which was enjoyed by thousands of people.

'It was always part of the arrangements to transport Father Christmas out of the town centre in a vehicle provided by South Wales Police as quickly and as safely as possible as he has a busy few weeks ahead of him.'
