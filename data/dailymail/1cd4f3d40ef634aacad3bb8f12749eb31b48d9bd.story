It is thought babies are so comfortable in water because it reminds them of being in the womb.

And these adorable tiny tots certainly look pretty content beneath the surface of a Cheltenham swimming pool.

London-based photographer Annette Price, 49, has captured a series of nine incredible images of babies swimming underwater at a local pool.

Of the photos - which recall the iconic cover of Nirvana's 1991 album, Nevermind - she said: 'It's amazing how relaxed 
most of the babies are while underwater.Â  Some of them get a little 
stressed just before the pictures are taken.

'I wear a large diving mask, so they 
can't really see my eyes, and have a very large camera to point at them,
 there are lights, big blue background. The moment they enter the water, they mostly relax and often smile, it's really amazing to see that.'

Annette explained she has been experimenting with underwater portraits of adults at a pool in Hammersmith, where she encouraged her models to dress up and wear what ever they liked -
 to express something of their own personalities.

She continued: 'I was commissioned by baby swim 
school Aquatots in Cheltenham to photograph one of their baby swim swim 
lessons at Bettridge School.

'I suggested some underwater portraits
 of the babies too. The underwater baby pictures were really successful
 and Aquatots asked if I could do baby swim shoots for them.'

To capture the images, Price constructed a
 complete underwater studio with a five meter wide backdrop, off camera 
lighting, soft boxes and a DSLR in an Ikelite underwater 
housing.

The photographer said: 'Once the babies are placed in the 
water I have about two to three seconds to photograph the baby before 
they are lifted out of the water.

'All babies have already done at least
 one term of baby swim lessons including submersion, so that when they 
come to me, this is not the first time they have been underwater.'
