A prolific shoplifter who has been caught stealing 50 times has been spared jail once again.

Anthony Hill, 32, was caught trying to steal a £190 ladies handbag from upmarket fashion and jewellery boutique Folli Follie in Regent Street in April.

It was the heroin addict's 37th conviction for 63 separate offences, including 50 for theft.

He already has a three-month suspended prison sentence hanging over him following another bout of shoplifting in September last year.

But Hill, appearing at Westminster Magistrates Court, begged to be given one more chance.

Paul Brooks, chair of the magistrates, said: 'We have listened very carefully to the representations made on your behalf, and today we are not going to send you to prison.

'However, if you reoffend in the next three months, there will be two suspended sentences hanging over you and you will go to prison for six months.'

Hill, who was given a second three-month suspended prison sentence, told the court 'it's no problem' when he learnt of a night-time curfew imposed on him.

Mr Brooks said: 'We hope it is no problem, because we don't want to see you in court again.

'You are a prolific offender.

'On the next occasion in court, for a similar offence or indeed any offence, it is most unlikely the court will be as lenient.'

Hill himself gasped with surprise when Mr Brooks said there were 50 convictions for theft on his record.

He hugged and kissed his partner when released from the dock, and thanked magistrates profusely for letting him go free.

The court heard Hill, from Holloway, in London, suffers from psychological and physical impairments and has been diagnosed as bipolar.

He has recently become engaged to his girlfriend, who is helping him to recover from heroin addiction and episodes of self-harming.

The court heard he tried to swipe the handbag on April 4 to sell it on, because his benefits had been temporarily stopped.

When confronted by the shop's security staff, he admitted the theft and left behind a CV with his contact details.

He was arrested and charged with theft on May 22.

He will be electronically tagged and have to obey a curfew for three months to be at home between 8pm and 6am.
