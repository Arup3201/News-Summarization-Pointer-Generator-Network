A father who had separated from his wife was yesterday suspected of starting a fire that killed him and his nine-year-old son.

Darren Sykes and his two children were discovered by firemen as flames engulfed their semi-detached home.

Nothing could be done to revive the 44-year-old and his youngest son Paul.

Twelve-year-old Jack survived the blaze but was said to be in a critical condition in hospital. 

His mother Claire Sykes, 42, was at his bedside yesterday.

Detectives probing the tragedy said evidence pointed to the fire ‘being started deliberately’ and were treating it as ‘suspicious’.

However police stressed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the inquiry.

Neighbours said flames suddenly swept through the house in Penistone, South Yorkshire, at around 6.30pm on Wednesday.

The boys were staying with their carpet salesman father, and firemen found all three occupants on the first floor after they entered the building wearing breathing apparatus.

Police revealed they were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident which they described as 'suspicious' 

Flowers were attached to nine-year-old Paul's school gates with the message: 'You will be sadly missed'

Neighbours added that they heard no screams or cries for help from inside.

Post mortem examinations are due to be carried out today, but police said the victims’ injuries were ‘consistent with being involved in a fire’.

Barrie Hall, 73, a retired security officer, said he was returning from a nearby park when he saw ‘acrid smoke coming out of the house’. 

He said the ‘fire brigade came and started sorting it out’ and police told local residents to go inside. 

‘We didn’t know until later that anybody was in there,’ he added. ‘It was a shock. It’s terrible. It just blows you away.’

Mr Hall said the family had lived there together until the boys left with their mother at some point in the past few months.

‘Mr Sykes lived there on his own, I believe they were separated,’ he said, adding that Mr Sykes adored his children.

‘He loved his kids. You’d hear him playing with them all the time. I would say was he was a bigger kid than his kids.’

People arrived at the scene in Penistone in South Yorkshire to leave flowers for Darren and Paul Sykes yesterday

Police officers had cordoned off the quiet cul-de-sac yesterday morning as an investigation into the fire was launched

Neighbour Alan Shaw was returning from walking his dog when he saw ‘smoke everywhere’. 

He said: ‘I thought it was coming from a garage and then I realised the house was on fire. It was a big fire and soon fire engines turned up. It’s unbelievable.’ 

He added that the family had had a ‘domestic problem’ recently.

Andy Platt, headmaster at Springvale Primary School, paid tribute to the nine-year-old victim, describing him as ‘an outgoing, popular boy’ who ‘will be greatly missed’.

His brother Jack is said to be suffering from ‘life-threatening injuries’, although no further details have been released.

Relatives were too upset to comment yesterday.

Chief Inspector Debbie Mahmood, of South Yorkshire Police, said inquiries were under way but were at ‘a very early stage’. She added that her thoughts were with the family.
