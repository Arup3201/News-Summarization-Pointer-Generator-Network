Alexis Sanchez believes he still has to improve despite an impressive start to his Barclays Premier League career - and insists Arsenal have the 'quality stars' needed to challenge for the title.

The form of the Chile forward, signed from Barcelona in the summer for £32million, has been the one positive in an otherwise inconsistent opening by Arsene Wenger's side.

Sanchez scored his 12th goal at Swansea on Sunday, when Arsenal again failed to hold onto a lead and were beaten 2-1, having thrown away a 3-0 advantage in the Champions League tie against Anderlecht.

In a wide-ranging interview with AS Chile, the 25-year-old remains upbeat over the decision to leave Spain after the World Cup and that the Gunners can lift themselves back into contention after the international break.

'Little by little I am gaining confidence in my team-mates and am gradually learning more,' he said on www.chile.as.com.

'At first I had trouble understanding them, knowing where they ran, their movements, what gestures meant what, but every time I feel more confident.

'I am starting to memorise the moves of my team-mates and I learn to help them - clearly I need to improve and that is what I say in the dressing room, that I could stay a little less with the ball, play one touch play more often to facilitate counter-attacks, that is vital.

'I must learn that because the rapid transitions are key in this league and with this team.'

While Sanchez concedes the English Premier League is 'the most complicated football and not easy' in comparison with the competitions back home and after subsequent moves to Italy with Udinese and then onto Barcelona, the diminutive forward insists he 'likes the challenge'.

The Chile forward believes Arsenal have plenty of talent to come back to challenge leaders Chelsea and also progress in Europe.

Sanchez is still adamant that Arsene Wenger's side can win any competition they enter

'Now that I am here, sometimes I stop to look my team-mates during the training session and I realise that I am surrounded by a lot of quality stars,' he added.

'I have been impressed by their attitude and their talent.

'I love how they create spaces, their individual and collective movements.

'I tell you seriously: I like what I see so much that I have repeated myself many times, that if we have the required winning mentality, if we are positive and try to win every single game, I know we can win any competition.

'I know that with this team we can win many trophies in the coming years. I am convinced.

'I hope to win everything here. That's why I came.'

Wenger has seen his side struggle to hold onto leads against Anderlecht and Swansea in recent weeks 

Following defeat at Swansea, Arsenal find themselves in sixth place, four points behind Manchester City and already some 12 off Chelsea, who have yet to lose in their 11 league games.

Like most of their rivals, the majority of the Gunners' squad are expected to be in action during the international break, with Theo Walcott back in the England fold after his recovery from a long-term knee injury, one of six Arsenal players who could feature at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday.

France striker Olivier Giroud is on course to be closing in on an earlier than expected return from a broken bone in his foot.

Wenger will be hoping centre-half Laurent Koscielny can be available again following treatment on his troublesome Achilles for the visit of Manchester United on November 22, having been forced to deploy Nacho Monreal at the heart of what has looked a very suspect makeshift defence in recent games.
