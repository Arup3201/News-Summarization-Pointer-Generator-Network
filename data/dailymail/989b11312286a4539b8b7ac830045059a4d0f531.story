A shocking video has emerged showing horses that had been so neglected their hooves had grown into painful 'slippers'.

The footage was captured by animal welfare staff after they rescued the two horses from a farm in Somerset.

It shows the animals being led around a yard - with their coats matted, tails unkempt and hooves so overgrown they had curled upwards.

Overweight: The horses can also be seen carrying excess weight after being forced to eat a rich diet

They can also be seen carrying excess weight after being forced to live in a field with cows, which were being fed a rich type of hay by their owner.

The harrowing video of the horses, called Jerry and Jojo, was filmed by staff at HorseWorld, an animal rescue charity in Bristol.

Footage shows Jerry walking on hooves that have curled into 'slippers', which are pointed at the tips, covered in dirt and 'painful' to stand on.

Meanwhile, Jojo can be seen sporting slightly upturned hooves, a matted coat and a dirty mane.

The centre has now helped the animals get back to full health and lose the excess weight.

Jerry is part of a 
HorseWorld programme, which helps young people with emotional problems through interaction with horses, while Jojo has just been adopted.

Meanwhile, the animals' owner has been prosecuted.

Joanne Vaughan, HorseWorld's
 husbandry manager, said: 'Jerry and Jojo were in a bad way and had 
almost eaten themselves to death, so it was lucky we could rescue them.

'But they are the tip of an iceberg and there are many more animals relying on the work we carry out 365 days a year.'
