She would probably be horrified that her dirty laundry was being aired over 150 years after it was worn.

But Queen Victoria would perhaps be pleased that her once slimmer frame is being shown off, after an old pair of her knickers, with a smaller waist than expected, has emerged.

The linen bloomers were worn by the Queen when she was at Balmoral in Scotland, in the late 1850s, and have sold for £3,675 in an online auction.

The Queen famously piled on weight after the sudden death of her husband, Prince Albert, in 1861, reaching a size that would be today referred to as XXXL.

But the undergarments, which are believed to have been salvaged from her wardrobe, reveal her her figure wasn't always so robust, with a more modest waistline of 37ins. 

The linen knickers are embroidered with a small crown and the initials VR, standing for Victoria Regina. The number 29 is sewn in, a possible indicator of when they were in laundry. 

They sold for thousands of pounds in an online auction yesterday, alongside a pair of black silk stockings worn by Queen Victoria after the death of her husband.

The stockings which sold for £1,800 
are embroidered with her initials as well as a small thistle to 
symbolise her love of Scotland.

Richard
Davie, director at International Autograph Auctions in Nottingham, 
said: 'The knickers and stockings came from Queen Victoria’s wardrobe in
Balmoral.

'The
linen knickers are very plain, which could be because she felt that she
didn’t need to wear something elaborate when in Scotland as opposed to 
Buckingham Palace.

'They are
embroidered with the initials VR and the number 29 and the waist on 
them is 37 inches, which is very big.'The stockings are made from black 
silk which shows they probably belonged to her after Albert died, as she
only wore black during her mourning.

stockings which she wore to mourn the death of Prince Albert

'They also have a thistle design on them which shows her fascination with Scotland as that is a Scottish plant.

'Items like this are very rare and I think they will appeal to lots of royal collectors as they are a personal memory of her.

'They don’t turn up very often.'

A pair of black silk stockings were also sold in the auction. The embroidered stockings feature a crown with the initials VR underneath for Victoria Regina

It is believed the Queen plunged into misery when her beloved husband Albert died suddenly. Though the marriage produced nine children the Queen was inconsolable, and remained devoted to his memory throughout her widowhood.

She was buried alongside him in 1901.

Earlier this summer a collection of 
letters written by Queen Victoria to James Forbes, the man charged with 
running Balmoral, sold at auction for £15,000.

In 2011 another pair of the Queen's knickers sold for £9,375, and were a smaller 35in.
