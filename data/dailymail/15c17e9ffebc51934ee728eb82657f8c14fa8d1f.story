Carl Froch is poised to fulfil two lifelong ambitions by fighting Bernard Hopkins at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground this June and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas in the autumn. 

The Cobra is expected to relinquish his IBF supermiddleweight belt on Tuesday, allowing negotiations to be finalised for two defences of his WBA world championship. 

Carl Froch is set to vacate his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May

Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in March but had to withdraw with an injury

That decision also clears the way for James DeGale to fight for the vacant IBF title. Froch, at 37, intends bringing his career to a climax with the two fights. 

Both Hopkins, the 50-year-old phenomenon of the ring, and Chavez, same-name son of the legendary Mexican fighter, are willing to meet him.

Froch had always hoped to fight at the City Ground and has come to cherish the prospect of boxing in Vegas before hanging up his gloves.

The chance of doing both has convinced him to vacate the IBF title, which he would have been required to defend against DeGale in April.

Froch feels he has nothing to prove against younger domestic rivals following two victories over George Groves.

DeGale lost a contentious decision to Groves in 2011 and a rematch seems inevitable in the future

Both fights were deemed mandatory defences by the IBF, though Groves was not the leading contender. 

Froch says: ‘I’m not going to be rail-roaded into doing the same against DeGale, who would need at least another fight or two against quality opposition before being ready for me.’

The alternatives for DeGale will be detailed this morning by promoter Eddie Hearn. DeGale, his own chance of glory finally at hand, and Andre Dirrell, the American cancer survivor, are the mandatory rivals for the IBF title about to fall vacant. 

Hearn is keen to put that on at London’s O2 Arena on April 25. But Dirrell is reluctant to return to England. He feels he was robbed of the decision in a close fight with Froch In Nottingham. 

Unless Dirrell can raise the financial stakes to take the fight to America, DeGale will need another contender. 

A return with Groves, who beat him in their first match, would be big box-office here, but Groves is pursuing his mandatory world-title challenge to Dirrell’s brother, Anthony, the WBC champion.

One of Carl Froch’s bravest and most honourable rivals, Mikkel Kessler, is calling it a career after being left out of the current super-middleweight world title loop.

The Viking Warrior, who turns 37 himself shortly, hoped for a last hurrah against either Froch or the stand-out for latterly inactive champion Andre Ward.

Kessler was seeking either a rubber match with Froch – their series stands at one win each – or the chance to avenge defeat by Ward.

Mikkel Kessler beat Froch via unanimous decision in 2010 but lost the rematch on points in 2013

He says: ‘Since neither wanted it I’m in a state of retirement. I was approached about James DeGale or George Groves but I’m not interested. Only a big fight against a big name would have given me the motivation to get back into full-out training.’

Kessler bows out with a record of 36 wins against only three defeats. The other loss was against Joe Calzaghe on a memorable world championship night in Cardiff.

He goes with enormous respect, not only in Denmark where his a folk hero but throughout the wide world of boxing.

The final bell tolled at the weekend for a friend not only of boxing but of virtually everyone in the hard old game

Cedric Kushner climbed out of shoe-shining poverty in South Africa to become a true gentleman of a promoter in the midst of the rough and tumble of boxing in New York,

With his unfailing good manners and acquired cut-glass English accent, Kushner charmed us all while taking kindly and generous care of the careers of such notables as Sugar Shane Mosley.

Cedric Kushner was the popular promoter of Hasim Rahman and Sugar Shane Mosley

The zenith of his career came in South Africa in 2001, at the temporary expense of our own Lennox Lewis. Kushner’s big man Hasim Rahman pulled off the shock KO of Lewis to give him his only promotional share in the winning of the world heavyweight title.

The satisfaction was short-lived. Electric-haired promoter Don King arrived in Johannesburg bearing a bag full of half-a-million dollars with which to lure Rahman away from Kushner.

Lewis was to retrieve the title in the re-match.

Kushner went on to win his own battle, against obesity. ‘The elephant in the room is now a greyhound,’ he proudly announced.

But the physical strain of it all brought on a massive heart attack, at just 66.

The star had dimmed for the man who famously brought boxing to New York’s iconic Hammerstein Ballroom. But as times became harder Cedric was looked after by such as the current leading New York promoter Lou DiBella, fight-loving businessman Jay Wartski and Runyanesque boxing writer-turned-lawyer Michael Marley.

None of us will forget the long nights in renowned Manhattan restaurants listening to Cedric tell his colourful life stories.

As he would have put it himself: ‘Good night, my dear friend. It honestly has been the most tremendous pleasure.’
