Flanked by bargain-priced displays of women's wear and patio lighting, President Barack Obama came to a Wal-Mart store in Silicon Valley on Friday to praise new steps by businesses and communities to deploy solar energy.

The President was showcasing efforts to combat climate change that don't rely on a disinclined Congress.

But in choosing the giant retailer as 
the backdrop for his announcement, Obama also triggered a backlash from 
labor unions and pay equity advocates who say low wages paid by Wal-Mart
 fly in the face of Obama's vaunted push on pay equity.

'What
 numbskull in the White House arranged this?' former Labor Secretary 
Robert Reich, who served in the Bill Clinton administration, said on 
Facebook.

Obama said more 
than 300 companies and state and local governments have pledged to use 
solar technology, and he unveiled his own executive actions aimed at 
increasing energy efficiency with a goal of reducing U.S. reliance on 
carbon fuels.

The two tracks underscored Obama's 
strategy of sidestepping Congress to advance his own agenda, but they 
also illustrated the limits of his reach in a bitterly divided 
government.

'The commitments
 we're announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to 
tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time,' Obama said at a
 sprawling Wal-Mart store in Mountain View.

The solar effort will power the equivalent of 130,000 homes, the White House said, while Obama's administrative actions could reduce carbon pollution in an amount equal to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year.

The White House also announced that long-delayed energy efficiency standards for walk-in coolers and freezers have finally been completed.

Ticking off a list of economic and environmental benefits he attributed to solar technology, Obama cast the commitments as part of a broader campaign to reduce American energy dependence, create jobs in renewable energy and lower heat-trapping emissions blamed for global warming.

'This is what you call a win-win-win,' Obama told about 250 store employees as he wrapped up a three-day swing through California focused heavily on raising money for Democrats in advance of November's midterm elections.

Tweaking the mostly Republican opponents of his energy policies in Congress, Obama lamented that lawmakers have 'not always been as visionary on these issues as we would like.'

That's why he's seizing opportunities this year to act unilaterally to advance those goals, Obama said.

'Unfortunately, inside of Washington, we still have some climate deniers who shout loud,' Obama said. 'But they're wasting people's time on a settled debate.'

His policies unable to generate momentum in Congress, Obama has increasingly gone outside the federal government to press his agenda.

He has won commitments from colleges and universities to expand access to more students; he has created innovation hubs that link businesses and education institutions; and he has drawn attention to companies and state and local governments that have increased pay for workers.

Still, that choice of tactics has severely limited what Obama may be able to accomplish, a reality the president acknowledged the night before as he spoke to donors at a fundraiser in La Jolla benefiting House Democrats.

'Regardless of how hard I push, regardless of how many administrative actions I take, we're not going to be able to go where we need to go, and can go, and should go unless I've got a Congress that's willing to work with me,' Obama said.

The White House said it chose Wal-Mart because the company has committed to doubling the number of solar energy projects at its stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers.

The Wal-Mart location he visited gets about 15 percent of its power from solar panels.

Wal-Mart's president, Bill Simon, said. Obama is the first president to visit one of the chain's warehouse stores.
