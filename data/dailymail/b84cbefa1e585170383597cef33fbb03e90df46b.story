A mother has been shot dead allegedly by her estranged husband - a violent member of a whites-only biker gang who had previously threatened to peel her skin off  'layer by layer'. 

Jessie Doyle Cavett, 27, was shot in the head on Saturday at her home in Gresham, Oregon. Her ex Joshua Cavett, 36, has been charged with her murder.

Mrs Cavett's five-year-old daughter Peyton was standing over her mother's body when police arrived at the scene.

Joshua Cavett, 36, is believed to have shot dead his estranged wife Jessie and abducted their two-year-old daughter. The child was later found unharmed and Cavett arrested. His multiple police mugshots shows tattoos common with outlaw bikers and white supremacists

Living in fear: Jessie Doyle Cavett, a 27-year-old mother of two was shot in the head in front of her children. In August, she took out a restraining order against her ex-husband after he threatened to skin her alive

Mrs Cavett, a hair stylist instructor, died on Sunday at OHSU Hospital from her injuries.

The father abducted the couple's two-year-old daughter Paige from the home causing an Amber Alert to be issued.

Police who arrived at the scene said that Peyton had reportedly phoned a friend to tell them that 'Josh hurt mommy'. 

Cavett was arrested at 9pm on Saturday with a loaded gun in his backpack.

The alleged shooter was tracked down with his youngest daughter to an apartment block a mile from where his wife was shot dead after people recognized him from the Amber Alert.

The two-year-old girl was checked over in hospital but was unharmed.

Cavett allegedly told arresting officers: 'I'm not going to complain, I just (expletive) killed somebody.'

The 36-year-old has been charged with
his wife's murder. He appeared in court on Monday for his arraignment, sitting behind plexiglass and flanked by two guards.

He has pleaded not guilty to murder and two counts of felon in possession of a firearm.

He is next scheduled to appear in court on October 22. He is known to police and has previous convictions for assault.

Chilling: Cavett's estranged wife had taken out a restraining order against him in August after he threatened to tie her to a chair and peel off her skin

Mrs Cavett had been granted a restraining order in 
August after her husband made a series of chilling threats.

Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research, at the Anti-Defamation League told MailOnline that the SS lightning bolt tattoo is often a sign of white supremacy.

However in the context of outlaw biker gangs, some German/Nazi symbols were adopted long ago by the outlaw biker subculture - specifically the SS bolts, the Iron Cross and to a lesser degree, the swastika.

As a result, if someone has one of these symbols, such as the SS lightning bolts, but it is known they are involved in an outlaw biker gang, the presence of such symbols alone is not sufficient evidence to label them a white supremacist.

One of Cavett's neck tattoos explicitly identifies him as an outlaw biker gang member (the 1%er tattoo).  Cavett is a member of the Gypsy Jokers outlaw bikers gang, one of the prominent organizations in Oregon.

Most of Cavett's tattoos are decorative or biker/GJ in nature. The brass knuckles tattoo on his right cheek is a cover-up tattoo of an earlier tattoo.

The Gypsy Jokers are an outlaw motorcycle gang started in 1956 in Oregon. African Americans are not permitted membership to the whites-only gang.

Mrs
Cavett, who was divorcing him, said that he had a history as a meth user and threatened to give her a 'hot shot' - a drug injection which would kill her. 

According to Oregonlive, she wrote in the restraining order request: 'He says he will hurt me or have me hurt
by someone else that no one will ever know.

'He will not 
let me alone to be a mother.'

She added that her husband wanted to torture her by 'tying me up to a chair to peel my skin off layer by layer'.

She reported other abuse saying that in April he repeatedly hit her in the stomach and head.

The 36-year-old father was banned from seeing his daughter Paige after his wife won sole custody.

Kimberly Beddor, the owner of Bella 
Institute in Portland where Mrs Cavett worked, told Oregonlive that the 
27-year-old had been trying to cut off ties with her husband. 

Ms Beddor added: 'She was a loving mother and an amazing friend ... who lost her life in a senseless, violent act.'

Gresham Police are currently on the lookout for Keshia
Moritz, 28, who is believed to have witnessed the shooting of Mrs 
Cavett.

A man reported that Cavett turned up with the woman and a 
young girl at his apartment.

Moritz is described as 5'6, 140lbs with chest tattoos and a pierced nose and lower lip.

The Gresham police can be contacted on 503-618-2719 or 1-888-989-3505.
