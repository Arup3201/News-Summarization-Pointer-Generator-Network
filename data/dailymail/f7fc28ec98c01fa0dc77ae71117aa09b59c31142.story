Northerners use more Viagra to aid their performance in the bedroom 
than men in any other part of Britain, a new survey has revealed.

The
NHS now pays for around 2.3 million prescriptions of the anti-impotency
pills - with lads in the north of England most in need of a 
little pick-me-up.

Men in the South, by contrast, needed the least
amount of help, according to the figures from the Prescription Pricing 
Authority.

More Viagra is prescribed by the NHS in the north of England than in any other region in Britain.

Men in the south used the least Viagra, according to the figures.

The amount the NHS splashes out on the drug has also almost trebled from £30 million spent a decade ago.

The figures also showed the funding of Viagra prescriptions varied hugely from 
region to region with some spending more than half again as much as others on the drug.

The
NHS splashed out more than £5 million on Viagra prescriptions 
in the north east with another £12.6 million spent on providing the drug in the North West.

This works out as £1.89 per patient per day in the North East and £1.73 per recipient in the North West.

The amount spent per patient in the South was just £1.24 per patient.

The cost of funding the drug in the East was £8.3million while £7.7million was spent on it in the South West.

The rise is thought to be caused in part by GPs issuing the drug to 
lessen the risk of desperate men buying dangerous fake versions of the 
drug online.

Viagra's popularity has not decreased despite 
claims of side-effects by some patients including heart attacks, 
blindness and amnesia.

A pack of eight of the pills can cost the NHS almost £50.

Viagra is only supposed to be prescribed to men with no underlying health problems.

The NHS spent more on Viagra prescriptions per patient in the North East, including Tyneside (pictured), than anywhere else in Britain.
