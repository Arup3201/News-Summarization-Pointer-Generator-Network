Christmas lunch is the meal many people most look forward to all year: turkey with all the trimmings on the 25th, then turkey sandwiches on Boxing Day.

But why confine it to just two days?

In answer to that very question, Marks & Spencer have created a three-course Christmas dinner sandwich - helpfully named the 3-course Christmas Feast - to satisfy cravings from now until the New Year.

The first 'course' is smoked salmon with cucumber and dill; the second is turkey with pork and chestnut stuffing and smoked bacon; and to finish there is a sandwich filled with brie, grapes and chutney.

At 785 calories, it's certainly not the pre-Christmas diet option, but an M&S spokesman notes that it's relatively abstemious next to the average 1,000-calorie Christmas lunch.

Think of it as a warm-up.
