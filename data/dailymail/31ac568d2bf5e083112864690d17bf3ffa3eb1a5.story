The police watchdog is to interview ministers from the Thatcher government to establish if the former Prime Minister had been wrongly told that Liverpool fans were at fault for the Hillsborough disaster.

On the day after the ill-fated FA Cup semi final, in which 96 people died, Margaret Thatcher visited the Sheffield ground where she was briefed by Peter Wright, then chief constable of South Yorkshire Police. 

New inquests into the deaths of the Hillsborough victims commenced this 
week, but the ongoing Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe is a separate investigation into the 
aftermath of the disaster.

Findings: The IPCC is to interview ministers from the Thatcher government to establish if the former Prime Minister had been wrongly told that Liverpool fans were at fault for the Hillsborough disaster

Tragedy: The Hillsborough disaster unfolded on April 15, 1989 during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest

Former editor of The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie, has told the IPCC that
 claims made on the newspaper's front page story, which blamed drunken 
Liverpool fans for the tragedy, were backed up by what Mrs Thatcher was 
told by chief constable Wright.

The story, which ran with the headline
 The Truth, also falsely claimed that fans stole from the dead, attacked
 members of the emergency services and urinated on police officers.

Allegations
 made in the coverage had come from copy sent by a Sheffield-based news 
agency, which was based on briefings by the local Police Federation and 
an MP, and included comments made by police officers of violence 
directed towards them by fans.

Claims: Kelvin MacKenzie, has told the Independent Police Complaints Commission that claims made on the newspaper's front page were backed up by what Mrs Thatcher was told by Chief Constable Wright

Then sports minister Colin Moynihan and Home Secretary of the time Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd, joined Mrs Thatcher for her visit to Hillsborough on April 16, 1989.

She spoke with chief constable Wright,
 who died in 2011, but the Hillsborough Independent Panel found that 
after examining documents from the time of the disaster they could find 
no record of the briefing given to Mrs Thatcher and Lord Hurd.

The report, published in 2012, found there was no evidence that fans had conspired to arrive late at the stadium' and 'no evidence that they stole from the dead and dying'.

It also found that statements made by police officers and ambulance staff were doctored.

Aftermath: Then sports minister Colin Moynihan and Home Secretary of the time Douglas Hurd, now Lord Hurd, joined Mrs Thatcher for her visit to Hillsborough on April 16, 1989

Evidence: The Hillsborough Independent Panel found that after examining documents from the time of the disaster they could find no record of the briefing given to Mrs Thatcher and Lord Hurd

According to The Independent, Mr MacKenzie and ex-Sun political editor 
Trevor Kavanagh have both told the IPCC that Mrs Thatcher's 
foreign-policy adviser Charles Powell, now Lord Powell, had confirmed details of the 
newspaper's Hillsborough coverage to Mr Kavanagh before it was 
published.

Mr MacKenzie said IPCC officers told him they would be interviewing Lord Powell and Lord Moynihan, who is now chairman of the British Olympic Association, as part of their investigation into the aftermath of the tragedy.

Lord Powell said that 25 years on from the disaster he could not remember speaking to a journalist, and had not been at the stadium - so was unable to confirm any details. 

Lord Moynihan, Lord Hurd and the IPCC have not commented on the claims.

Distant past: Charles Powell, pictured with Margaret Thatcher in 2000, said he could not remember speaking to Trevor Kavanagh, and had not been at the stadium

Anger: The Sun's front page headlined The Truth falsely claimed that fans stole from the dead, attacked members of the emergency services and urinated on police officers

Result: The IPCC probe was announced after the commission reviewed the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which uncovered a huge amount of new evidence about what happened during and after the tragedy

Mr Kavanagh told the Independent: 'If you got something from a trusted source and you confirmed it separately with a conversation from someone reporting to the Prime Minister, you could scarcely ask for better sources.'

The IPCC's investigation - the biggest it has ever undertaken - is separate from Operation Resolve - the criminal investigation into the 1989 tragedy.

The IPCC probe was announced after 
the commission reviewed the report of the Hillsborough Independent 
Panel, which uncovered a huge amount of new evidence about what happened
 during and after the tragedy.

Apology: In September 2012, following the publication of the Hillsborough Panel Report, Mr MacKenzie apologised for the Sun's story

It
 is examining allegations including those surrounding amendments to 
police statements, the actions of the police officers after the disaster
 and the role of West Midlands Police, which investigated what happened 
at the time.

Operation 
Resolve, under the command of assistant commissioner Jon Stoddart, the 
retired chief constable of Durham Police, is a new, wider-ranging 
criminal investigation into the disaster.

Operation Resolve has supplied a report for coroner Lord Justice Goldring who this week began fresh inquests into the deaths of the 96 victims.

The new inquests, expected to take up to a year, were ordered after controversial verdicts of accidental death were recorded following the original inquests 23 years ago.

In September 2012, following the publication of the Hillsborough Panel Report, Mr MacKenzie apologised for the Sun's story.

He had said: 
'Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable 
news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior 
local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium.

'I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster.

'I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.'
