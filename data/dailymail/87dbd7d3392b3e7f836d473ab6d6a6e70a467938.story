The weekend wedding between the billionaire chairman of cosmetics giant Estée Lauder and the glamorous CEO of the Brooklyn Public Library was dramatically called off at the last moment after the couple decided things were moving too fast.

Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old son of Estée Lauder, and his intended, Linda Johnson, 55, have enjoyed something a whirlwind romance since meeting last year.

The couple had begun publicly dating in late 2012, just a year after Lauder had tragically lost his first wife Evelyn to ovarian cancer. They had been married for more than 50 years and had helped grow the family business together.

Lauder and Johnson were pictured attending several New York society events together last year and spent last New Year's Eve at the Metropolitan Opera Gala.

In May it was revealed that the couple were very happy and talking about marriage, news that caused much distress among aspiring socialites 'of a certain age'.

Launder, the chairman emeritus of Estée Lauder Co., is worth an estimated $8 billion and had been described as ‘New York’s most eligible bachelor.’

The couple had been planning to wed in Philadelphia in front of an intimate group of family and friends over the weekend.

But the New York Post reports that the couple had started to called guests just a few weeks ago to tell them that their big day was being ‘postponed.’

Although no new date has been fixed, the pair are still very much an item and are currently enjoying a holiday in Sardinia, which had originally been scheduled to have been their honeymoon.

‘Some people assumed that Leonard and Linda had not reached an agreement on a prenup in time for the wedding, but in fact the prenup had already been signed a while ago,’ a source told the Post.

‘They have been having a few ups and downs, and perhaps he feels it is “too soon” after Evelyn.’

Leonard and Evelyn Lauder married in 1959 and had two sons together. She had also worked at the cosmetics giant and was especially famous for spearheading the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative.

Johnson, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, studied law. According to her Brooklyn Public Library biography, she was formerly CEO of the National Constitution Center and collects contemporary art, contemporary craft and early American folk art.

Leonard Lauder is uncle to Aerin and Jane Lauder, who both work for the family business too. Aerin is described as a 'modern-day ambassador' for the brand, while Jane has been global president/general manager of the Origins and Ojon brands since July 2010.
