Palaces, yachts, white gold watches and a £47,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the 
presidential perks Vladimir Putin enjoys, according to a damning new report.

In 2008 the reinstalled Russian President  famously compared his life in office to a 'galley slave' during a press conference.

But now a lavish list of luxuries at his disposal have been revealed by Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister turned Putin critic.

Nemtsov estimated that the maintenance of Putin's 
residences, jets and cars alone costs £1.6 billion a year.

Life of luxury: Palaces, yachts, white gold watches, and a $75,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the presidential perks  Vladmir Putin enjoys, according to a new report

The 32 page document listed 58 planes
 and helicopters and 20 homes with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars,
 not to mention 11 watches which alone are worth several times Putin's 
annual salary.

Published 
under the ironic title 'The Life of a Galley Slave', it denounced the 
lavish spending as an affront to millions of Russians living in dire 
poverty.

Among the 32-page report, eye-catching details included:

20 palace and villas: with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars

15 helicopters

43 aircraft available include: an Airbus, two Dassault Falcon executive jets and an Ilyushin Il-96 airliner that features an $11 million cabin fitted out by jewelers -and that toilet which, the report says, cost close to £47,000

53.7-metre yacht: with a designer interior, a spa pool, waterfall and wine cellar 

11 luxury watches

Five-decked yacht:  with a jacuzzi, barbecue, a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble

'One of the most serious reasons 
prompting V. Putin to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and 
luxury to which he has become accustomed,' wrote the authors.

'One of the most serious reasons 
prompting V. Putin to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and 
luxury to which he has become accustomed,' wrote the authors.

'In a country where more than 20 million people barely make ends meet, 
the luxurious life of the president is a blatant and cynical challenge 
to society. We absolutely cannot put up with this.'

The Kremlin 
fleet of luxury yachts may draw comparisons to the lifestyles of 
Russia's high-profile business tycoons, the 'oligarchs'.

One 53.7-metre yacht with a designer interior, a spa pool, waterfall and wine cellar is relegated to second best, it said.

'The real diamond of the Kremlin 
flotilla,' the authors judged, is a five-decked yacht with a jacuzzi, 
barbecue, a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble.

The authors also identified from 
photographs a total of 11 luxury timepieces on the wrist of the head of 
state and calculated their total value at some £400,000, while noting 
Putin had declared an annual income less than £700,000.

The text was accompanied by 
photographs of luxurious homes, jets, helicopters, cars and watches, 
complete with footnotes citing Russian media as sources for many of the 
items.

Nine new residences had been added to the list available to the 
president since Putin first became head of state in 2000, it said.

Homes he could retreat to across the 
country, ranged from seaside palaces to a ski lodge, and boasted 
everything from saunas and billiard rooms to a 'presidential church'.

While not addressing Putin's personal
 wealth directly - the president once dismissed talk of him being a 
billionaire as 'snot' from the noses of Western reporters and smeared on
 paper - it challenged his self-portrayal as 'your humble servant' to 
paint him as a callous, Nero-like figure ignoring the corruption and 
poverty that has hobbled the economy and blighted lives.

It juxtaposed Putin's latest declared
 annual income and his account of 
owning only three old cars with a description of some of the 700 
automobiles at the disposal of the presidential administration.

The president has long denied rumors 
that he has built up a vast personal fortune.

The report did not address
 that but it illustrated in 32 pages how the former KGB spy has expanded
 the trappings of office since he rose to power in 2000.

Despite
 a wave of massive protests this winter that followed Russia's 
fraud-tainted parliamentary and presidential votes, Putin remains 
popular among average Russians, largely thanks to government-controlled 
television networks that critics compare to Soviet propaganda.

High-flyer: The report listed 58 aircraft that Putin had access to, including a $75,000 toilet

Eye-watering: The president's Ilyushin-96 airliner was reported to have cost $18m to be fitted out by jewellers and have a toilet that costs $75,000

The Kremlin, which has long portrayed
 the 59-year-old president as a man of simple tastes with a liking for 
popular sports and active outdoor pastimes, did not immediately comment.

Intended
 to foster faint stirrings of opposition to Putin's recent re-election 
for a further six years, the report may struggle for attention.

In
 a mark of the reluctance of Russians to challenge the Kremlin, Nemtsov 
said he had struggled to find a printer willing to produce the booklet.

And after publication, it was largely ignored by the country's major media outlets.

Many
 ordinary Russians seemed indifferent to opponents who reveled in 
eye-catching details, such as the $75,000 toilet on a presidential jet.

High maintenance: Nemtsov estimated that the maintenance of Putin's residences, jets and cars alone costs £1.6 billion a year

Tales of extravagance in the 
leadership, though familiar to Russians throughout their history from 
tsars to commissars, come at a potentially awkward time for Putin after 
the biggest protests of his 12-year rule, mostly from middle-class urban
 liberals who are now trying to fire up indignation more widely.

'I hope that after this report the 
numbers of people believing that Putin and his allies are swindlers and 
thieves will approach 70 percent,' Nemtsov said, using the labels for 
the ruling elite which have become a slogan for the opposition.

'After that, I think we will be able to free the country of them,' he said at an event to launch the pamphlet.

Though
 Putin may have little leisure time Putin to enjoy the assets at his 
disposal, and he can point to fellow world leaders enjoying special 
transport and country retreats - such as the U.S. president's Air Force 
One and Camp David - the report was scathing of the expense lavished on 
Kremlin facilities.

Speaking out: Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov (left) speaks as he presents the report in Moscow

Nemtsov,
 a deputy prime minister in the 1990s, has become one of Putin's 
fiercest critics and was among the leaders of a series of protests in 
the past nine months.

But 
the president remains popular for bringing order after the chaos that 
followed the collapse of communism in 1991, even if a recent opinion 
survey found a majority would prefer a new leader come 2018.

But the responses of the likes of 
Moscow pensioner Yelena Nikitichna suggested it might be an uphill 
battle to turn any dismay over Putin's perks into a boost for the 
protest movement.

'It's obviously too much, way beyond 
what is needed to do the job,' she said. 'But of course that is no 
surprise to me. I've lived here for 70 years. It's always been like 
that.'

Among the young, too, many did not share Nemtsov's anger:

'Russian authorities and leaders have
 always been famous for their rather luxurious ways. This is a 
historical pattern and he is not the first to live a fairly luxurious 
life,' said Yelena Malmova, a first-year university student in the 
capital.

'Personally, I don't care,' she said. 'For me, how well he does his job is most important.'

Putin's press service was not immediately available for comment but his spokesman had earlier words on the report.

'All of this is government property and Putin uses it all legally as an elected president,' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the RBK daily yesterday after parts of the report had appeared online.
