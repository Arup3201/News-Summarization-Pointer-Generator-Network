A Cardiff hero whose name appears on a monument to the fallen of the First World War actually survived the conflict.

Alf Norman fought in the Boer War, the Great War and worked in a munitions factory during the Second World War yet he is on the Grangetown Memorial remembering the war dead.

Sergeant Norman went on to live for three decades after the memorial recording his death was built.

He was serving with the Glamorgan Yeomanry, believed to be in Mesopotamia, when his wife received two telegrams - one to say he was missing presumed killed and another to say he had been killed in action.

His Cork-born ‘widow’ Mary organised a traditional Irish wake in his absence.

Later news came through that far from being dead her husband was still very much alive and doing his bit for king and country.

And family legend has it that Mary quipped: ‘I've never been able to rely on him for anything.’

For some reason, his name was still put forward in the early 1920s when the Cardiff memorial was built.

Before he died in 1950 he was known for taking special trips with family visitors to the Grangetown Memorial to show how his name had been wrongly recorded as one of the area's 330 war dead.

Zena Mabbs, the chairman of Grangetown Local History Society, said that it is one of several mistakes her group has found on the memorial.

‘I would imagine that in those days people had to fill in a form about their family member,’ she said.

‘As you can appreciate, in 1914 a lot of people were quite illiterate. For example, one of the men that died is named as 'W.C Ridland', but we've discovered his name was actually 'Cridland', which is a very well known family in Grangetown.

‘The name of another man Private George Harben is on twice.’

Father-of-five Sgt Norman, born in Somerset in 1869, had run away from home to join the army at 15. As well as his Boer and Great War service he also served in Britain's colonies of India and Ireland.

He escaped the Blitz when a German bomb hit his home in Maitland Place, Grangetown, on January 2, 1941.

It was the worst night of the Blitz for the Welsh capital.

Up to 165 people were killed and 427 more injured, while nearly 350 homes were destroyed or had to be demolished. Chapels and the nave of Llandaff Cathedral were also damaged.

Grangetown was the first area to be hit by 100 German aircraft during the 10-hour air raid.

Mr Norman, who worked as a postman and an inspector in Cardiff's arcades in civilian life, had taken refuge in an air-raid shelter when the sirens sounded and family legend has it that he calmly surveyed the burnt out remains of his home while puffing on a cigar he had been given for Christmas.

To mark the centenary of the First World War the local history society has been collecting the personal histories of the men whose names appear on the Grangetown Memorial to produce online tributes.

Their research has unearthed 90 soldiers killed in the conflict whose names are missing from the memorial.
