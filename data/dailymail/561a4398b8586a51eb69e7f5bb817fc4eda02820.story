Women's fashion firm Jane Norman fell into administration today in a move which could put up to 1,600 jobs at risk.

Accountancy firm Zolfo Cooper hopes to find a buyer for the stricken retailer, which closed its 90 stores on Saturday.

Media reports have suggested that Jane Norman could be sold imminently in a so-called pre-pack administration deal, with department store chain Debenhams and knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill reported to be among the potential bidders.

Pre-pack administrations are controversial because creditors, such as suppliers, can lose out as some of the debts are scrapped.

Jane Norman, which specialises in selling to women between the ages of 16 and 25, is the latest retail victim of the squeeze in consumer spending brought about the financial crisis.

Habitat's UK shops outside London and Homeform, the owner of Dolphin bathrooms and Moben kitchens, were put into administration last week. Mothercare, Comet and HMV are among retailers closing stores.

The retailer, which also has around 
100 concessions within department stores including Debenhams, is 
understood to have asked its landlords last week to defer its rent 
payments as its quarterly payments deadline loomed.

Around 1,600 jobs are at risk as a result of the collapse of Jane Norman

The company, founded in London in 1952, has failed to find a buyer in recent weeks but putting the company into administration may speed up the sale process because some of its £140 million debts could be scrapped.

Jane Norman has been squeezed in recent months as cash-strapped consumers put off non-essential purchases and consumer confidence plunged amid fears over the strength of the economic recovery.

Clothes have also become more expensive as raw materials such as cotton have soared in price, and VAT rose to 20% from 17.5% in January.

Debenhams, which operates most of the Jane Norman concessions, could be interested in buying the stock and brand.

Knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill has a record of turning around troubled companies after it bought 77 stores from the administrators for textiles business Rosebys in November 2008.

They were merged with the assets of furnishings business Ponden Mill to create the 150-strong Ponden Home chain.

 

Habitat:Thirty stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the webstie and three stores in central London for £24.5million.

HomeForm:

About 3,000 jobs at risk across 160 showrooms, including 1,500 fitters and designers. The private equity owned business is behind Moben kitchens, bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms. Administrators were called in last week.

All Saints:Fashion chain on the brink of administration until Lion Capital stepped in. Lion owns La Senza and American Apparel and the deal secures undreds of jobs in 63 stores and 47 concessions in the UK, Europe, US and Russia. Badly affected by Icelandic banking crisis as Glitnir and Kaupthing held significant stakes.

Focus DIY:Ernst & Young launched a closing down sale in May as it moved to shut 123 stores out of the company's 178-strong store estate. The administrator earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 workers facing redundancy.

Oddbins:The wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37 Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte.

JJB Sports:The sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments. The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a new banking facility.

HMV:The sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus more on gadgets such as iPads.

Mothercare:Mothercare unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre brand.
