A California woman who became the first ever ticketed for driving while wearing Google Glass in October pleaded not guilty Tuesday.

Cecilia Abadie appeared unfazed by the charges as she yucked it up with her attorney in a San Diego traffic courtroom.

Abadie was pulled over for allegedly doing 80mph in a 65mph zone October 29 and was fined before promptly uploading a photo of the ticket to Google Plus.

Not sweating it: Cecilia Abadie appeared jovial December 3 when she appeared in a San Diego court to plead not guilty to the first ever ticket written for driving while wearing Google Glass

Double trouble? The software developer was pulled over October 29 for speeding on a California freeway, then given another charge for doing it while wearing the head-mounted computer. Here, she dons the glasses following her court date

In addition to speeding, her violation was ‘driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)’.

Abadie, a software developer and tech true believer, pleaded not guilty to both charges.

Her
attorney William Concidine said she will testify at a trial scheduled 
for January that the glasses were not on when she was driving, and 
activated when she looked up at the officer as he stood by her window.

The device is designed to respond to a head tilt by waking itself up.

Concidine
also said the vehicle code listed in the citation applies to video 
screens in vehicles and is not relevant to mobile technology such as 
Google Glass.

The California Highway Patrol declined comment on Concidine's assertions.

'This has to play out in court,' spokeswoman Fran Clader said.

The technology will not be made widely 
available to the public until 2014, but defendant Cecilia Abadie was one
of about 10,000 'explorers' who received the glasses earlier this year 
as part of a tryout.

At the time of Abadie's citation, the CHP said anything which takes a driver's attention from the road is dangerous and should be discouraged.

Unfazed: Abadie seemed carefree as she walked out of the San Diego traffic court Tuesday. She's expected to take the stand when the trial commences in January

The lightweight frames are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display that responds to voice commands. The technology can be used to do things such as check email, learn background about something the wearer is looking at, or to get driving directions.

Legislators in at least three states - Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia - have introduced bills that would specifically ban driving with Google Glass.

Chris Dale, a spokesman for the tech giant, said he was not aware of any other tickets issued for driving with Google Glass.

Google's website contains an advisory about using the headgear while driving: 'Read up and follow the law. Above all, even when you're following the law, don't hurt yourself or others by failing to pay attention to the road.'

Fined: Cecilia Abadie, a Google Glass explorer, was pulled over on Tuesday and given a ticket for wearing the smart device while driving

Illegal: Abadie's violation was 'driving w/monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)', according to the ticket, which she posted on Google Plus

The law prohibits drivers from operating vehicles if ‘a television receiver, a video monitor, or a television or video screen, or any other similar means of visually displaying a television broadcast or video signal that produces entertainment or business applications, is operating and … visible to the driver’, according to International Business Times.

The law exempts GPS devices, parking assist camera monitors, and ‘interlocking’ devices that automatically disable when the vehicle is in motion.

Google Glass is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display that is being developed by Google with a mission of producing a mass-market product, which displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format, and which can communicate with the internet via natural language voice commands.

The Explorer Edition is available to testers and Google I/O developers in the United States for $1,500, while a consumer version is expected to be available in 2014.

Abadie, who is a self-confessed ‘geek and Google Glass pioneer’, received many support messages since the incident, some suggesting she challenge the ticket.

A fellow Glass Explorer, Matt Abdou, offered to help Abadie fight the ticket in court, according to the Times.

‘This law is to prevent people from watching TV in their car. Seriously. You don't need an attorney for this, you can beat this by yourself. I have won several tickets in court. I'll fly down there to help you in court if you like,’ he said in a thread on Google Plus.

Several supporters encouraged Abadie to argue for Glass’ use on its basis as a navigation device.

Yet others have rejected that notion, writing that unlike new navigational systems, Google Glass ‘is not built to disable itself to block user interaction when moving’. 

Abadie, who is the founder and developer
at 
her company, 33 Labs,
has also given TED talks about the smart glasses.

Her violation ‘driving w/monitor visible to driver' is likely the first such  ticket ever issued to a Google Glass wearer

It is not available on the market yet but is being tested by 'Google Glass Explorers', such as Abadie
