As she cuts open deep red radishes to reveal the pink rings inside, you might think Amber Locke is creating an elaborate salad.

But while she tears up lambs lettuce and arranges waxy-skinned chillies, she is actually creating an exquisite piece of art.

Artist, vegan cook and blogger Ms Locke has made a series of designs in which she lays real fruit and vegetables on a sheet and photographs them from above. 

She says the idea for 'veg art'  blossomed from her own passion for a fruit and vegetable-based diet and living a healthy lifestyle.

Eighteen months ago she decided to follow a vegan diet, which was not for ethical or health reasons but simply because it makes her feel 'fantastic'.

She accidentally dropped some vegetables she was carrying home onto her flagstone doorstep, and some autumn leaves blew into them.

It looked so beautiful, she decided to start creating other pieces of art, deconstructing salads and placing the produce into intricate patterns in order to create gorgeous designs.

'I love the beauty of natural foods; their different colours, shapes, textures and characters,' she told MailOnline.

'So to me, fruit and veg are not only really good for you nutritionally they also have a wonderful aesthetic appeal too. 

'It’s a joy to use beautiful ingredients and my work aims to showcase their unique qualities, reflect the changing seasons of the year and also be a celebration of healthy living.' 

'I love how each ingredient has its own little back story and how sometimes a seemingly random collection of things can inexplicably make a harmonious whole.' 

This is a rose petal strewn design, with ingredients  for a middle-eastern inspired salad. Amber said: 'I was making a salad with a slightly more unusual dressing. I used candy beetroots, cut finely so you could see the beautiful rings inside. Then I used chilli, ginger and some yellow beetroot which my mother had grown for me in her garden. As well as lettuce in the salad, I tossed through rose petals afterwards for a romantic feel'

'A textile-type design using a selection of fruit and veg I had to hand. It features watermelon radish from my parents. They pulled them out of the garden which is why you can see the roots. Then I used the last of the yellow courgettes from my greenhouse, long green peppers and pomegranates  , purple heirloom carrots (a gift from my mother’s kind friend) and some forgotten figs I found in the fridge'

This design features yellow courgettes, fig leaves and radicchio flowers. 'I loved the yellows, greens and blues. My radicchio plant looks so beautiful when it goes to seed. The sun came out and cast a shadow across everything - I just love the quality of natural light.'

This is a design for a root vegetable salad using heirloom carrots and autumn celeriac. Amber said wanted to use 'boring' ingredients like celeriac (pictured in white) and make them look interesting. She was inspired when she found the multi-coloured carrots at a stand in her local market. She said: 'He stocks veg by garden enthusiasts. You get an array of colours. This is where the carrots came in. I made it into two salads. Made a cashew mayonnaise and a julienne salad with a poppy seed dressing.'

This was a paisley-inspired design for a super berry smoothie, featuring raspberries, strawberries, pink grapes, oranges, currents, goji berries, cashews and almonds. 'I arranged the fruits into a paisley design and put some glassware in, which I've never done before. I just thought it was really beautiful glassware' Amber said. 'It made for a pink, sweet and creamy smoothie.'

This design is a wintery vegetable pattern using purple carrots, red Brussels sprouts, romanesco cauliflower, baby beets and turnips

'It was winter and I was thinking about spring. I found some champagne rhubarb and I liked the way the leeks looked fluffy. I added, oranges, grapefruit and lime. The black twiggy  things that have pink flower were from a Japanese plant in my garden. I love the design because it looked spring like and cheered me up,' Amber said

This Caribbean style design features purple and white kale, pomegranate, papaya, oranges, strawberries, cucumber, passion fruit and cherries. Later, Amber whizzed it up into a smoothie. The design was a result of a trip to a Caribbean stall at her local market. 'I found some beautiful vivid kale, as bright as the picture,' she said. 'It was the colour of dark lavender. Then some white kale, with a green ruffle. It looked like fabric. For the design I just came back from the market with all these bright fruits and flunked down on the floor. The gorgeous smell of passion fruit filled the room'

An autumn fruit salad with red apple 'spaghetti', pale pink pomegranates, turkish figs, black dessert grapes and an orange and passion fruit dressing. Amber said: 'The black grapes were from my little vine. They are very sweet and I scattered them at the end and the sunlight just caught them'

Pictured are candy cane beets, purple radishes, and pink flamingo swiss chard, photographed with a soft, vintage-style filter. 'Every candied beetroot looks different and I get excited each time I cut into one. I just love that they have psychedelic pink and white candy cane stripes.'

'I have this green smoothie everyday. The design includes cucumber, broccoli, pears, lemon, spinach, apple, parsley and romaine lettuce'

A design for a tropical smoothie featuring apple bananas, pineapple, papaya, mango. super sweet. 'The long spiky things were from a palm plant outside my black door. Pinepples are my favourite fruit, they're so beautiful and regal with their spikes and tortoise-shell skin.'
