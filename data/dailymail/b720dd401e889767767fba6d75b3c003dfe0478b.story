Former Real Madrid defender and captain Fernando Hierro will take over from Zinedine Zidane as coach Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, the La Liga club said on Thursday.

Real announced last week that former France captain Zidane would manage the club's reserve team, Castilla, next season.

Hierro, 46, left Real in 2003 under something of a cloud along with current Spain coach Vicente del Bosque after being considered surplus to requirements by club president Florentino Perez.

Hierro made 601 appearances for Real, scoring 127 goals, and was capped 89 times by Spain.

After leaving Real, he had a short playing stint at Bolton Wanderers in the English Premier League and was later sporting director of the Spanish national team and at Malaga in the Andalusian city where he was born.

Meanwhile, Arsenal target Alvaro Morata has revealed he is on the verge of a move to Juventus.

The
 forward is set to undergo a medical with the Serie A champions by the 
end of the week before signing a four-year contract, with the move 
believed to be worth around 22million euros (£17.5m).

The Gunners have also been told they will have to make Sami Khedira their highest paid player if they are to tempt him from the Bernabeu.

The German midfielder is available for £24million but is paid around £8million - that is more than £150,000 a week and in excess of the £140,000 Mesut Ozil earns at the Emirates.
