Guilty: Graham Axford falsely claimed housing and council tax benefit of £37,670 while failing to declare he had a mortgage, the court heard

A benefit cheat who sailed the Atlantic in his private yacht has been convicted of three charges of fraud.

Graham Axford, 58, falsely claimed housing and council tax benefit worth nearly £40,000 while failing to declare he had a mortgage, a court heard.

He failed to declare he owned a property in Wales that he bought in 1984 and had a mortgage for.

He also did not reveal he part owned a farmhouse in Normandy. As a result he pocketed benefits he should not have received, a jury at Croydon Crown Court heard.

Axford of South Norwood, Croydon, south London, denied six counts of fraud by false representation in relation to benefits paid by Croydon Council between September 2000 and July 2007, but was found guilty on three counts yesterday. His sentencing has been adjourned until next month.

Axford hit the headlines two years ago when he appeared on an episode of BBC Panorama.

He was in receipt of incapacity benefit after injuring his back in a motorcycle accident in 1995, but an investigation was launched after he was caught sailing his private yacht across the Atlantic.

The episode, aired in November 2011, showed footage of Axford as he sailed from America to the Azores. He told an undercover reporter he wouldn't sell his 42ft yacht for less than £25,000.

After he appeared on national television, it was revealed he had also participated in a national bike race lasting 24 hours. He has never faced charges over his receipt of incapacity benefit.

At his housing and council tax benefit trial Croydon Crown Court heard Axford was accused of receiving a housing and council tax benefit overpayment of £37,670.18.

Axford, who stood for election as a 
Liberal Democrat councillor in Upper Norwood ward in 2010, repeatedly 
failed to declare the properties on forms between 2000 and 2003, the 
court heard.

When 
visited by a council officer in 2006, he did not mention the two 
properties or the mortgage, nor were they mentioned on a change of 
address form in 2007, the jury was told.

Axford claimed the mortgage on the property in Abertillery, Gwent, was paid for by his wife, despite being in his name.

He said a second loan taken out 
against the property was also paid to his wife and used to fund 
improvements to their house in France.

Axford
was found guilty of two counts of failing to declare the two properties
and that he was paying a mortgage on housing and council tax benefit 
change of address forms.

He
was also found guilty of one charge of fraud by false representation in
relation to the housing benefit and council tax benefit claim form.

He was found not guilty of three counts of the same charges.

Axford will be sentenced on March 14.
