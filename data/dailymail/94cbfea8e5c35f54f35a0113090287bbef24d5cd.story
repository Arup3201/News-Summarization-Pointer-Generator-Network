A study by University of Chicago researchers suggests the difference between love and lust might be in the eyes after all.

Specifically, where your date looks at you could indicate whether romance or passion is on the cards.

The research found that eye patterns concentrate on a stranger's face if the viewer sees that person as a potential partner in romantic love, but the viewer gazes more at the other person's body if he or she is feeling sexual desire.

University of Chicago researchers say the direction of a person's gaze can indicate their feelings for another when they first meet them (stock image shown). They found that where a person looked at another determined 'love or lust'. Students were asked to view photographs of strangers in the study

The report was published in the journal Psychological Science

If you want to improve your health while giving your love life a boost, try a cup of moringa tea with your breakfast.

Moringa, or ‘miracle tree’, is being hailed as a superfood that not only increases energy levels and boosts the immune system, but can also be an aphrodisiac.

Native to North Africa and the Himalayan mountains in northwestern India, the plant has traditionally been used to boost sexual desire and to treat male sexual disorders.

A recent study in the International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences found that it enhanced sexual behaviour in rats. It’s also known to contain chemical compounds called saponins which have been shown in other studies to support libido and levels of the sex hormone testosterone.

Gram for gram, moringa has seven times the vitamin C found in oranges, four times the calcium of milk, four times the vitamin A of carrots, three times the potassium of bananas and three times the iron of spinach. Its tiny leaves are also high in protein, with twice the amount found in yoghurt.

The plant, which can be taken as a tea, or in tablet, powder or oil format, is said to help the body recover after exercise, and is also rich in zeatin, a plant hormone which has an anti-ageing effect on skin cells.

Lead author Stephanie Cacioppo of the University of Chicago said that although 'little is currently known about the science of love at first sight or how people fall in love, these patterns of response provide the first clues regarding how automatic attentional processes, such as eye gaze, may differentiate feelings of love from feelings of desire toward strangers.'

The automatic judgment of love or lust can apparently occur in as little as half a second, producing different gaze patterns.

Previous research by Cacioppo has shown that different networks of brain regions are activated by love and sexual desire.

In this study, the team performed two experiments to test visual patterns in an effort to assess two different emotional and cognitive states that are often difficult to disentangle from one another - romantic love and sexual desire (lust).

Male and female students from the University of Geneva viewed a series of black-and-white photographs of persons they had never met.

In part one of the study, participants viewed photos of young, adult heterosexual couples who were looking at or interacting with each other.

In part two, participants viewed photographs of attractive individuals of the opposite sex who were looking directly at the camera or viewer.

None of the photos contained nudity or erotic images.

In both experiments, participants were placed before a computer and asked to look at different blocks of photographs and decide as rapidly and precisely as possible whether they perceived each photograph or the persons in the photograph as eliciting feelings of sexual desire or romantic love.

The researchers analysed eye movements and found patterns in how subjects experienced feelings of romantic love or sexual desire. In this illustrated image a viewer's eyes fixate mostly on the faces of a couple that evokes feelings of romantic love. Looking at other parts of the body apparently indicates feelings of lust

The study found no significant difference in the time it took subjects to identify romantic love versus sexual desire, which shows how quickly the brain can process both emotions, the researchers believe.

But analysis of the eye-tracking data from the two studies revealed marked differences in eye movement patterns, depending on whether the subjects reported feeling sexual desire or romantic love.

People tended to visually fixate on the face, especially when they said an image elicited a feeling of romantic love.

However, with images that evoked sexual desire, the subjects' eyes moved from the face to fixate on the rest of the body.

The effect was found for male and female participants.

'By identifying eye patterns that are specific to love-related stimuli, the study may contribute to the development of a biomarker that differentiates feelings of romantic love versus sexual desire,' said co-author John Cacioppo, director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience.

'An eye-tracking paradigm may eventually offer a new avenue of diagnosis in clinicians' daily practice or for routine clinical exams in psychiatry and/or couple therapy.'

For people they felt romantic love for they were likely to look in their eyes

But when they just felt lust they were more likely to look at other body parts
