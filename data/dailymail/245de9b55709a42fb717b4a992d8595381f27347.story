The dramas of Whitney Houston's life seem to be continuing into her daughter's as Bobbi Kristina awaits the first $1.2 million installment of her inheritance.

The only child of Houston and Bobby Brown will inherit Whitney's entire $12 million estate by the time she turns 30, but her grandmother Cissy is worried the 20-year old will dwindle the money away.

This comes after the 80-year old branded Bobbi's marriage to 'adoptive brother' Nick Gordon, 24, as 'incestuous', after the two announced they had tied the knot on Twitter earlier this month.

At war: Bobbi Kristina Brown is set to inherit the first $1.2m chunk of her mother's funeral, amid continued rows with her grandmother Cissy

As the second anniversary of Whitney's death approaches, a family friend told the Sun: 'It's a terrible thing, but maybe it is only to be expected. Whitney's lasting legacy has just been more drama, more trouble.'

The celebrated singer, who was found unconsciousness in a hotel bathtub and declared dead on 11 February 2012, has a turbulent history with her only daughter.

Aged 15, Bobbi Kristina reportedly tried to stab her mother in March 2008, before attempting to slit her own wrists, and, was subsequently admitted to a psychiatric ward.

On her 18th birthday, Bobbi was allegedly seen doing cocaine, which she vehemently denies, as well as after her mother's funeral and memorial service.

She then moved in with Nick - who was taken in by her mother and father but never legally adopted - into Whitney's Atlanta apartment despite Cissy's protestations, and her father Bobby's attempts to persuade her to live with him and his new family in Los Angeles.

Bobbi was six and Nick nine when he was brought into their family, and the two still reportedly use the nicknames 'Baby Sis' and 'Big Brudder' to affectionately call one another.

They originally denied dating 
following Whitney's death, with Nick taking to Twitter to quash the 
rumours: '@REALbkBrown and I are not engaged or dating. Just close like 
we always have been.'

However, Bobbi has been flooding her Twitter feed with statements of love for her 'hubby' and talk of her burgeoning music career as she tries to make it as a singer and actress like her mother.

She is also reportedly hoping to start a family, as a source told Grazia magazine: 'They want to have a baby as soon as possible. After a tough few years, Bobbi wants a happy ending. But her grandmother is beside herself with worry.'

But
 now the newly-weds have been forced to find a new home, after being 
evicted from Whitney's Atlanta property because of several noise 
complaints from neighbours.Â

Cissy
 has reportedly outraged her granddaughter because of her reported 
comments about Nick, as well as her plans to publish a tell-all book 
about the tragic singer, called Remembering Whitney.

But
 Bobbi's seemingly rebellious behaviour is unsurprising, considering the
 years of substance abuse and domestic violence she witnessed as a child
 growing up in the home of Whitney and Bobby.

The couple's former chauffeur, Al Bowman, claims he watched the distressing scenes of his employers doing crack cocaine in front of their young daughter.

Unrelenting: Bobbi Kristina was witness to years of her parents, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's abuse of narcotics and violent rows

For years, the substance abuse and 
irrational behaviour continued as Bobbi became a teenager, witnessed by 
her ex-boyfriend Zach Jafarzadeh, who told the Sun: 'There were blow-ups
 a lot. Krissi was the parent sometimes. She always looked out for her 
mom.'

Zach also says Whitney would buy Bobbi expensive gifts in order to keep her daughter in the house and close-by, even if that meant allowing her to consume alcohol: 'She'd rather have Krissi at the house drinking, then out partying and drinking, getting into trouble.'

Now Bobby, Cissy, and Bobbi Kristina's family - including Whitney's cousin Dionne Warwick - are 'praying' she will find her way back to them and not follow in her mother's destructive footsteps.
