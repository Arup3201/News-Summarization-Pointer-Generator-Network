It's the job every parent tries to avoid but one comedian has turned the dreaded task of changing his babie's dirty nappies into a Twitter hashtag.

Australian funny-man Adam Hills coined the social media term #smelfie after he posted a picture online holding up one of his daughter's used nappies.

The 44-year-old turned his messy situation into a new phrase and encouraged more dads to change their babies' dirty nappies, with some of his followers posting hilarious photos in response to his tweet.

Hills took to Twitter on Tuesday to share the snap, initially calling his different kind of selfie a #shelfie. 

'I'm encouraging more dads to change their babies' dirty nappies,' he told his over 342,000 followers, adding: 'I call this a #shelfie. Feel free to post your own.' 

However, after a few fans thought the term 'smelfie' was more appropriate, he later Tweeted: 'Yes tweeps, you're right. Photos of Dads changing nappies should be called #smeflies. Now go!'

'Real men change nappies #smelfie,' he later tweeted. as hoardes of men tweeted the comedian photos during their unenviable nappy changing duty.

'BTW I'm RT'ing #smelfie photos to encourage more dads to change nappies. Anyone unhappy with that needs a sense of humour transplant,' he said.

Their first daughter, Beatrice Pearl, was born in 2010 in Melbourne Hospital.

At the time of birth, proud father Adam took to Twittier, telling the social media realm: 'When I woke up yesterday I wasn't a dad. Today I am. Life is good. Wife is better. Baby is the best.'
