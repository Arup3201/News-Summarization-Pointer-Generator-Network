Schools and hospitals are on lock-down across Cleveland and seven people have voluntarily quarantined themselves after it emerged the second US nurse to contract Ebola spent three days in the city.

Amber Jay Vinson, 29, already had a fever when she traveled home to Ohio to plan her wedding and visit her mother last Friday, despite being one of the 76 medical workers from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital under observation by the Centers for Disease Control.

Today it emerged Vinson, who had treated  Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, went shopping at a bridal store with five friends for a fitting while harboring concerns that she was sick.

Health officials say she was told she was at risk for exposure to the disease but boarded a Frontier Airlines flight regardless.

The news has prompted high schools and medical centers to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with Vinson. 

And the Ohio Department of Health has now ordered anyone who had contact with Amber Vinson to go into a mandatory quarantine for 21 days.

Fears: Schools have been closed and nurses placed under observation after it emerged the second nurse to be struck with Ebola flew on a commercial flight from Cleveland with Ohio citizens despite knowing she was ill

Infected: Amber Jay Vinson, 29, knew she had a fever when she boarded the commercial flight in Cleveland

Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with five friends.

Those friends have now all been placed in quarantine where they will be interviewed and tested daily. 

The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk.

There are now seven people in quarantine in Ohio after being in contact with Vinson, and her mother is in quarantine in Dallas. 

Health officials at a press conference in Cleveland today insisted they will continue to plug Vinson for more details about her three days in and around the city as they acknowledged she may not be able to remember her every move.

Meanwhile, schools and hospitals are taking precautions. 

Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) has ordered a teacher at Cranwood elementary school to stay at home today after learning last night that they may have come in contact with a person diagnosed with the Ebola virus.

Overnight, the entire school has been 'thoroughly cleaned with a bleach-based cleaning solution according to guidelines provided by the Center for Disease Control,' the board said. 

A few miles south east of Cleveland, staff and pupils were today barred from Solon Middle School and Parkside Elementary School in Solon, Ohio.

It came after a middle school teacher that works at both schools revealed they had traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines on Tuesday - on a different flight, but possibly the same plane as Vinson, NBC reported. 

Meanwhile, a number of nurses at Cleveland Clinic, The MetroHealth System, and University Hospitals have been placed on paid leave after traveling on the same flight as Vinson.

They are being monitored for symptoms of fever, nausea or fatigue.

The hospitals said in a statement: 'We are confident that these nurses are at low risk of exposure since we understand [Vinson] did not have symptoms at the time. 

'We have taken this measure as an extra precautionary step for our employees, patients, and visitors.'

A stream of people admitted themselves to Cleveland's UH Case Medical Center yesterday claiming to have flown with Vinson but it transpired none had been aboard the same flight.

According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements.

He said CDC guidelines would be updated to clarify that air travel should not occur.

Parkside Elementary School, a few miles south east of Cleveland, was closed today amid fears of Ebola

Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days.

But on October 10, Miss Vinson left the Dallas area to plan her upcoming wedding in Cleveland, Ohio. Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane.

When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. 

'This nurse, Nurse Vinson, did in fact call the CDC several times before taking that flight and said she has a temperature, a fever of 99.5, and the person at the CDC looked at a chart and because her temperature wasn’t 100.4 or higher she didn’t officially fall into the category of high risk,' CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports.

CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call. 

Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus.

Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' on Wednesday.
