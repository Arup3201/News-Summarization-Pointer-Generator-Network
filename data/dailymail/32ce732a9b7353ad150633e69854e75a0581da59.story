A school netball team have been banned after reaching the national finals of a tournament - because of a 10p debt.

Central Newcastle High School's under-16s and under-18s teams made their way through county and regional heats earlier this year, but as the girls trained for the upcoming national finals, they were told they had been disqualified.

The private girls' school pays an annual subscription to be affiliated to England Netball and enter the competition, open to all schools.

The under 18s, pictured and the under 16 netball teams of Central Newcastle High School, reached the national finals of a schools tournament, but have been banned because they underpaid on their subscription

For the 2011/2012 they paid £24 of the £24.10 fee and were put on a debtors list without their knowledge. This meant they were not sent an invoice to pay their subscription for 2012/13.

Once staff found out about the outstanding money, the school paid up. Despite appeals over the ban, England Netball have refused to back down, meaning the girls cannot fight for the title at next month's finals in Basildon, Essex.

Headmistress Hilary French said: 'It all seems very petty to me. We have always paid our subscriptions for all the different sports played here.

'We 
weren't made aware of the small underpayment and we didn't get any 
further bills - either about the 10p or the fee for affiliation to 
England Netball the next year.

'It was only when two teams reached the finals that we were told about the problem.'

Mrs French said: 'We paid straight 
away once we found out. It was only raised once we reached the finals, 
that's when we were told we were disqualified.

'I guess they make extra 
checks before the finals but we have paid and it's very unfair on the 
girls.'

'Our PE teachers are some of the busiest staff in the school and because they didn't receive a bill, the payment was not made.

'We made a mistake and we did everything we could to rectify it immediately.

Headteacher Hilary French said her students were 'very upset' after England Netball refused to let them compete in the national finals after they settled their debt

'All of this has happened because of an unpaid 10p. The girls are very upset - they've trained a lot and they reached the finals.'

Mrs French said: 'They've been able to compete so far, I guess technically they were not supposed to have but we didn't know at the time.

'Yes we made a mistake, but we paid at the earliest opportunity and they should take that into account.

'It's frustrating. It feels like the girls are being unfairly penalised for something that is not their fault.'

The school's Head of PE, Jackie Atkinson, was named England Netball's Coach of the Year in 2009.

Mrs French added: 'Jackie is a coach to the girls and she's a netball fanatic.

'She is so disappointed and hopes something can be done before March.'

The school also won the sporting body's Endeavour Award in 2010 to acknowledge the number of times its teams had reached the finals.

Mrs French said: 'We've hosted competitions for England Netball for free before and two of our staff are due to go on a training course with them.

England Netball said Central Newcastle High School was the only school not to pay their annual subscriptions properly

'They had to give our school's affiliation number and that all seemed to go through fine.'

A spokesperson for England Netball said: 'England Netball has eligibility criteria for its National Schools Competition.

"This includes schools responsibility to affiliate to England Netball prior to the start of the competition.

'Central Newcastle High School failed to affiliate in accordance with these time scales and therefore it is with much regret that England Netball was unable to accept their entry into the National Schools Final.

'All other entrants to the National Schools Final adhered to England Netball's affiliation process.'
