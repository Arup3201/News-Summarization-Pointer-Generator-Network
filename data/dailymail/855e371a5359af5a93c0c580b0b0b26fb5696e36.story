Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke arrived in Phillip Hughes' home town in northern New South Wales on Monday to help his best mate's parents, Greg and Virginia, prepare for Wednesday's funeral in Macksville.

Clarke, 33, has won wide admiration for the leadership he has shown throughout the ordeal, including from the Prime Minister during a parliamentary condolence motion.

His trip to Macksville comes as the first test match of the summer appears increasingly likely to take place in Adelaide next week, instead of Brisbane and Sydney's new year's test to be delayed.

It's been an emotional week for the Australian cricket captain after the death of the mate he called 'my little bro'

As Australian players struggle to cope with the grief of losing their close mate and Indian officials confirming they will work with whatever rescheduling is proposed by Cricket Australia, it appears increasingly likely that Adelaide, at Phillip Hughes' home ground, will now host the first test match of the summer next week, possibly starting on Tuesday or Wednesday rather than the previously slotted Friday.

First Test (Adelaide): Dec 9/10 to Dec 13/14

Second Test (Brisbane): Dec 17/18 to Dec 21/22

Third Test (Melbourne) Dec 26 to Dec 30

Fourth Test (Sydney): Jan 6 to Jan 10

One Day International Tri Series: Jan 16

That would see the Brisbane match between Australia and India squeezed in before the Boxing Day Test, with a possible start on Wednesday, December 17.

The Boxing Day Test Match in Melbourne would go ahead as normal but the biggest change might be for the Sydney game.

What's known as the New Year's Test is set down for January 3 but could be pushed back three days to January 6. All Sheffield Shield matches set down for this week have been postphoned a week.
