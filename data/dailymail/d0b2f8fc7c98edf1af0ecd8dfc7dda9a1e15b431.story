A Virginia mom is facing a social media backlash for hitting out at a restaurant that kicked her out for drinking alcohol while breastfeeding.

Crystal McCullough was refused service from the Big Woody's Bar and Grill in Chesapeake on Labor Day because she was nursing her 11-month-old baby with a beer and shot of whiskey in front of her.

McCullough - who says she has a degree in chemistry - told the wait staff the drinks were for after she was finished, that she had only had one sip of beer before breastfeeding and was well within her rights to be doing so.

After the restaurant asked her to leave, McCullough took to Facebook to vent her anger, opening the feedback floodgates for people to both commend and blast her.

'That treatment was wrong,' McCullough told News Channel 3.

Controversial: Crystal McCullough says she was within her rights to sip a beer while breastfeeding her 11-month-old daughter at a bar on Labor Day, however staff asked to leave

Facebook floodgates: After venting her anger on social media, McCullough was hit back with a variety of responses, many of them blasting her, but more supporting the rights of women who breastfeed

Scene: McCullough was celebrating Labor Day with her family at Big Woody's Bar and Grill in Chesapeake when the incident occurred

Standing his ground: Big Woody's co-owner Jeff Leeroy said the issue was not with breastfeeding, but that other patrons were uncomfortable seeing McCullough drink while doing so

'I had a huge water I was downing. I had a beer and a shot of Fireball in front of me but that was for after I was done.'

'And I had one sip of beer and I’m not planning on the rest until after I’m done nursing.'

Restaurant co-owner Jeff Leeroy said the staff issue was not over McCullough breastfeeding, but the reaction of other patrons to her drinking while doing so.

'Women have breastfed in here numerous times with no issues whatsoever,' Leeroy said.

'It was about the drinks being in front of her and people seeing that she had partaken in the drink.

'It’s not easy to go and talk to someone and say you’re breastfeeding but you’re drinking too.'

Alot of the comments McCullough received supported her stance, saying that women have a right to breasfeed.

However other branded her a bad mom who should have left her daughter at time if she wanted to drink.

Backlash: Crystal McCullough, a chemist, said she would never endanger her daughter and had done her research about consuming alcohol while nursing

There is no medical consensus on whether women should or should not drink while breastfeeding.

While the Mayo Clinic is against doing so, the American Academy of Pediatrics has approved the use of alcohol in breastfeeding mothers.

'Alcohol does pass into breast milk more readily that other drugs, but unless you drink several drinks or more a day, every day, then there should be no problem,' the Academy said, according to News Channel 3.

As a chemist, McCullough said she is well aware of her limits while breastfeeding and would never endanger her child.

She wants an apology from Big Woody's for the incident.
