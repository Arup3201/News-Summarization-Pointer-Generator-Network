Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has urged his former club to sign PSG talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the summer.

The well travelled Sweden international has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in the past and could be tempted to leave Ligue 1 should the big spending Parisians not qualify for the Champions League next season.

Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles and the Championships League during his time at United, believes Ibrahimovic has the 'personality' required to succeed at the club in the same mould as former greats Eric Cantona and David Beckham.

The former Denmark No 1 told L'Equipe: 'What he does with PSG is incredible. He gives so much credibility and visibility to PSG .. This is someone who takes his responsibilities.

'Last summer there were rumours that he would come to Manchester United. I then said that Zlatan was built for the club, he was born to play there.

'It's why Cantona was so strong when he was there, not at Leeds or in all other clubs in France? Why? Because it is Manchester United. In Manchester, there was the freedom given to the players, but also responsibilities.

The PSG striker could leave France should the reigning champions fail to qualify for the Champions League

'We do not care who you are or what you love, we look at what you're doing on the pitch and the influence you have in the club. If you do not respect that, you're leaving.

'But you can have any personality. Beckham, Cantona, they could go out and also be at their best. There are hundreds of players who are trying to be a Beckham or Cantona, but do not have the personality, and they fail.'

Louis van Gaal is expected to sign a new forward in the summer as doubts continue to surround the lon-term future of loan signing Radamel Falcao who has managed to score only four goals since his arrival.
