Colo, the world's first and oldest captive-bred gorilla, has celebrated her 58th birthday.

The mother-of-three was born on December 22 1956 at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, with her ground-breaking delivery making headlines worldwide.

In celebration of today's milestone, Colo was treated to a cake made of peanut butter, apple sauce, honey and shredded carrot, topped with Greek yogurt frosting.

The party was broadcast live to online viewers from her enclosure.

Dozens of visitors watched on as she tucked into her dessert before opening presents of tomatoes and clementines.

She was also serenaded by zoo staff.

Audra Meinelt, an assistant curator at the park who has helped care for Colo for 18 years, said that the primate is a great fan of birthdays and loves the attention.

'She knows the whole day is about her,' Meinelt told The Columbus Dispatch.

The average lifespan for female gorillas in captivity is around 35 years, making Colo the oldest swinger going. 

Although she is in good health now, she was given three months to live at the age of six when she was hit by tuberculosis.

Following treatment, she made a remarkable recovery. 

She has outlived two of her children, nine of her 16 grandchildren, two of her ten great-grandchildren and one of her three great-great-grandchildren. 

Commenting on Colo's current condition, Meinelt said: She does not appear to have a single bit of trouble with her eyes or ears.

'Mostly, she has arthritis in her hands and feet.'

Before she was christened in a national naming contest, Colo was known as Cuddles.

Her current moniker is short for her birthplace: Columbus, Ohio.

Although she is a fan of birthday cake, tomatoes are one of Colo's favorite foods.

For the past ten years she has lived primarily alone and often sits quietly in her gorilla habitat watching visitors.

But today, all eyes were on her as she got into the party spirit.
