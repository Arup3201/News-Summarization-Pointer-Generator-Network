Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled a tough new line on EU migrants – amid reports of a major Tory split over how to respond to Ukip’s election triumph.

Mrs May last night indicated ministers want to radically rein in free movement rules.

But aides furiously denied a spat between her and Foreign Secretary William Hague over immigration.

Home Secretary Theresa May has taken a tough new line on EU migrants, amid reports of a major Tory split over how to respond to the triumph of Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, pictured right, in the election

The Tories are under pressure after Nigel Farage’s triumph at last week’s European elections.

Ministers have already said they would restrict migration from new EU states until their country’s economy was in line with Britain’s.

But Mrs May is said to also be pressing to limit migrants from existing member states. This would allow migrants from developed countries such as France, but block those from poorer countries such as Romania and Bulgaria.

Mrs May said: ‘We need to reduce the abuse in free movement and we do need to look at free movement.’

Campaigning in Newark, Mrs May added: ‘I recognise the concern people have shown on immigration.’

She went on that she was working ‘across the board to deal with abuse, to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live here, and [to] reduce the pull-factors for people coming here from the European Union'.

Former Tory Cabinet minister Norman Lamont has warned that uncontrolled immigration will have 'serious consequences' for society

A report in The Sun yesterday claimed Mr Hague has moved to block tougher controls, saying such a move would be ‘undeliverable’.

But a Home Office spokesman said: ‘There is no disagreement between the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary.’

Meanwhile, former Tory Cabinet minister Norman Lamont warned last night that uncontrolled immigration will have ‘serious consequences’ for society.

Lord Lamont criticised claims by former Labour Cabinet ministers Alan Milburn and John Hutton this week, saying they exaggerated the economic benefits of immigration.

The Blairite former ministers made the pro-immigration case, writing: ‘Instead of preparing to concede yet more ground on the issue, Mr Miliband should have the courage of his convictions and come out fighting.’

They said the Labour leader must not ‘retreat in the face of the myths and fears of anti-immigrationists’.

Lord Lamont, the chancellor under John Major, dismissed their views in a letter to The Times newspaper. He cited a House of Lords report that found ‘no evidence. . . that immigration generates significant economic benefit’.

He also rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘bulwark against an ageing population’. This, he said, would lead to a need for ‘ever escalating levels of immigration’.

Lord Lamont added: ‘I am entirely in favour of an open economy such as we have enjoyed for decades, but that does not require massive immigration.

‘To dismiss genuine and justified concerns as “myths and fears” is to play into the hands of extremists.

‘It is not a more stringent immigration policy which would have 'serious consequences for the wellbeing of our economy and society', as they claim. On the contrary, it is failure to respond to the clear and consistent wishes of three-quarters of our population.’
