Anthony Weiner braved the winter cold with his young son this week after the disgraced Congressman confirmed that he and wife Huma Abedin had visited a broker to find a new place to live.

The former New York mayoral hopeful was spotted on Tuesday outside his Park Avenue home leading his two-year-old Jordan to their car as the snow fell.

Weiner and his political advisor wife have been living in the apartment, estimated at $12,000-per-month in rent since he resigned, amid a sexting scandal in 2011.

However it seems that the rent in one of New York City's most expensive neighborhood's has now become too steep.

The Flatiron apartment was being rented 
to them by Democratic donor Jack Rosen, who is close with Bill Clinton, 
the former president who officiated Weiner and Abedin's nuptials.

Now the Weiners are looking to move to a 
slightly cheaper apartment but are
staying in the neighborhood. The couple have been looking at a three-bedroom, 
two-and-a-half bath apartment in a doorman building on East 23rd Street.

CitiHabitats realtor Brian Morgan showed the couple an $8,000-per-month apartment in the modern building.

'He
 didn’t talk much; she was very nice. She was in control. She was asking
 all the questions and was way more vocal,' Mr Morgan told The Post this week.

Weiner confirmed that he was apartment hunting by blasting the real estate company in a tweet for 
not only allowing their broker to publicly speak about their working 
relationship but to publicize it on their Twitter account.

Weiner put down the CitiHabitats as having 'no class brokers' and name-checked the realtor.

He wrote: 'If no class brokers are your thing, here ya go MT @CitiHabitats: Guess who checked out our agent Brian Morgan's listing.'

Park Avenue digs: Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner have been living on Park Avenue South ever since he sold his Queens co-op during the 2011 sexting scandal that required him to resign from office

The new building that they are looking at is only a few blocks further east than their current apartment.

It comes as little surprise that the family would like to stay in the area: Anthony's brother Jason owns L&W Oyster Bar and Almond, two restaurants in the neighborhood.

The couple married in June 2010 and 
their home base was the apartment he owned in Forest Hills, which fell 
in his congressional district in Queens.

Shortly
 after he resigned in 2011- meaning that he no longer had to live in the
 district that he once represented- the couple sold his co-op apartment 
and moved to one of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods.

Daddy duty: Weiner has been regularly spotted with his son in the area around their apartment, taking now two-year-old Jordan to the grocery store and the playground in Union Square

Before the scandal, Abedin was best known in political circles for being Hillary Clinton's top aide and she has worked with the former Secretary of State for decades.

Weiner has said in previous interviews that he gave his wife full reign to pick their new apartment amid the controversy he put them both through.

They have been seen walking around the neighborhood by MailOnline, with Weiner shopping in the local grocery store and bringing their now two-year-old son Jordan to the playground in nearby Union Square.

Modern look: The couple are now reportedly looking at an apartment in this building on 23rd Street, which is only a few blocks east of the apartment they have called home for the past two years

For a while, they hoped that they would be calling Gracey Mansion home, as Weiner attempted to re-enter the public sphere by running for mayor.

But his candidacy went down in flames when more dirty sexts and emails were released by a young woman who had a virtual relationship with the married man after he had already resigned from office.

Ms Abedin is still working for Mrs Clinton and is considered to be one of the closest ‘gate keepers’ to the likely Democratic presidential candidate.

Weiner has made a guest appearance on the new Amazon political comedy Alpha House and is restarting some of the consulting work that he had been doing in the time between his resignation and his failed mayoral bid.
