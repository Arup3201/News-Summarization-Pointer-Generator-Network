Linda Motten has been receiving death threats for years.

On a Sunday in 1984, Father's Day, she found herself caught in the crossfire of the bloodiest bikie clash in Australia's history - the infamous 'Milperra massacre.'

Linda was sitting in her car outside a pub in Sydney's South-West, when screams and gunfire erupted in the parking lot, shattering her windscreen and showering her with shrapnel.

Wounded, she crawled under the car and started taking photos; photos which would become crucial to police investigations and the reason behind the death threats. She was just 22 years old.

This Fathers' day, September 7, marks 30 years since the bloodbath that stunned the country and left seven people dead, including a 14-year-old bystander, Leanne Walters.

The battle was thought to have been sparked by tensions to do with a split between members of the notorious outlaw Comancheros Motorcycle Club, who broke away from the brotherhood to form the first Bandidos chapter in Australia.

On that Father's day in 1984, a group of heavily-armed Comancheros turned up to the Viking Tavern for a motorcycle swap meet. They were met by 30 Bandidos with a back-up van of weapons close behind. Reports tell of the two sides lining up at opposite ends of the carpark and Comancheros head William “Jock” Ross waving a machete in the air before the violence erupted.

The first of 200 police arrived on the scene after receiving reports that 'a man had gone berserk with a rifle' and shots had been fired. It took them more than 10 minutes to stop the bloodshed. Seven were killed, 28 were wounded and 20 hospitalised.

This Fathers' day marks 30 years since the Milperra Massacre, the bloodiest bikie gang clash in Australia's history.

At the time, the 'Milperra Massacre' court case was one of the largest in Australian history, with a total of 43 people charged with murder. The New South Wales Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973 was subsequently amended as a result of the violence that day.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Leanne Walters, hit in the face by a stray .357 bullet while selling raffle tickets.

In a special edition of Australian current affairs program 60 Minutes this Sunday night, her father Rex will talk about his 30 year heartbreak and the Father’s Day present Leanne never got to give him.

Feared bikie boss and former Comancheros leader William 'Jock' Ross, who served five years in jail for manslaughter that day, told 60 Minutes: 'I didn't have a choice, I was marked to die'.

Thirty years after the event, the program promises to take viewers inside the massacre 'like never before'. It includes interviews with the detectives who stormed the car park to disarm the bikies - and will tell the story of key witness Linda Motten and the terrifying phone calls threatening she 'would be dead' because of those photos.
