When she was found abandoned in a carrier bag in a park, this new baby was just a few hours from death, police said yesterday.

The little girl, thought to be only a day or two old, was said to be alert and contented as she recovered in hospital.

Officers released this picture of the baby - named Jade by hospital staff after the dog walker who found her - in an effort to trace her mother.

Found: This newborn girl, known as 'Baby Jade', was discovered in a Birmingham park on Wednesday

Safe: The girl is now recovering in hospital, but police have not yet tracked down her mother

Jade had been wrapped in a towel 
inside a bag and left in Marlborough House Community Park, Birmingham, 
where she was found at 2pm on Wednesday. The umbilical cord was still 
attached. 

Roger Wilday raised the alarm after making the discovery as he walked his dog Jade through a community park in the Stechford area
 of the city.

The 68-year-old was led to the newborn by his pet, who refused to leave the child's side until Mr Wilday came to investigate.

'Jade
 has grown up with children around her, she loves babies and when she 
found the baby in the bushes she wouldn't leave until she knew I had 
seen it,' the retired engineer said.

'She
 is a hero dog. There was no-one else in the park at the time and it was
 very cold. If it wasn't for Jade that baby could have been dead.

Newborn: Jade was apparently no more than a day old when she was abandoned in Birmingham

'I always take her to the park and we
 were out walking - she was off the lead and headed off towards the 
bushes. She wouldn't come back when I called her and so I had to go 
over, and I saw the bag and then I heard a baby cry.

'I
 reached down to look at the bag closer and I saw there was a baby 
inside wrapped in a light blue blanket. I dialled 999 and picked the 
baby up, and within a minute the police and ambulance were here.

'She
 was a tiny little thing, you could tell she must have been recently 
born, she was still warm so I don't think she had been there long.'

West Midlands Police have 
released several photos of the girl and a heartwarming Instagram video in order to raise the likelihood
 of someone recognising her.

Chief 
Inspector Ian Green said: ‘Paediatricians have confirmed the baby was 
lucky to be found when even just a few more hours exposed to the 
elements could have had fatal consequences.’

Police hope forensic tests on the bag and DNA samples from the baby will help identify her.

Mr
 Green added: ‘I’m told she’s very alert and a contented, happy 
baby … but of course what she really needs is to be in her mother’s 
arms.

'Thankfully, we now know she's safe and 
well - and our priority is very much on finding her mum to ensure her 
safety and to provide whatever support she needs.

He urged the unknown woman to call police on 101.

Baby Jade, who weighs around 6lbs, is currently being treated in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.

Officers are continuing to make house-to-house inquiries near the park where the baby was found.

Mr Green added: 'We're still keen to hear from witnesses who were in the park yesterday - especially anyone who saw somebody with a carrier bag from The Entertainer toy shop - or anyone who believes they could have information that will lead us to identify the mother.'
