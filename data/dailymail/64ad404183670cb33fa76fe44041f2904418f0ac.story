A violent thug who kicked his lover's five-year-old son to death because he was jealous of the attention the little boy received was yesterday found guilty of murder.

Tyler Whelan died in hospital after suffering blunt traumas to the head and abdomen at his home.

The youngster was left alone at home with his mother's abusive boyfriend Elvis Lee, 34, who admitted the manslaughter of Tyler but denied murder.

Tragedy: Tyler Whelan, five, died after being savagely attacked by his mother's boyfriend because he was jealous of attention the child received

Unemployed Lee, of Peterborough, Cambs, admitted kicking the little boy in the stomach and biting his leg in March, 2011, but denied killing him.

He was found guilty of murder by a jury following the three-week trial.

Stephanie Whelan, 27, was found guilty of causing or allowing his death.

Both defendants were cleared of allegations of cruelty to the tragic youngster.

Tyler had been admitted to hospital ion several occasions before his death.

During the trial Cambridge Crown Court was told Lee wanted to harm Tyler because he had interrupted his sleep, or because he was jealous of the attention he received.

Tyler was confirmed dead at 11.25am in Peterborough City Hospital on March 7, 2011, after the incident at Lee's three bedroom house in Crabtree, Peterborough.

Tyler was not taken to hospital for four hours after suffering the fatal injuries, by which time medics could not save him, the court heard.

Doctors tried to resuscitate Tyler for 20 minutes but he died from blunt traumas to the head and abdomen.

Killer: Elvis Lee admitted manslaughter but denied murder while Stephanie Whelan was found guilty of causing or allowing the youngster's death

The court heard Lee and Whelan's relationship had been 'volatile' and Whelan had suffered a black eye at the hands of Lee in the past.

Christopher Donnellan, prosecuting, said: 'Lee has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Tyler because he admits he kicked Tyler in the abdomen and accepts that caused a significant injury.

'He has also admitted that he bit the leg of Tyler. It was a drastic and hard bite to the calf of the child's leg.

'The prosecution case is that he inflicted these injuries on that morning. He intended Tyler should suffer serious injury or death. That was his state of mind.'

Following the attack, Whelan and Lee claimed the next morning Tyler fell from a stool in the kitchen and they found him lying face down with a bleeding nose at about 6am - then took him back to bed.

The court heard how Tyler's mother had
left her son alone with abusive Lee, despite his history of violence - 
and being aware he was attending anger management courses.

In a harrowing 999 call Stephanie Whelan 
can be heard wailing down the phone as a man - believed to be Elvis Lee -
shouts in the background.

The inconsolable mother can be heard hyperventilating down the phone line as the operator tries to make sense of the noise.

A man can be heard saying: 'He can't breathe, he's got breathing problems."

Then Whelan can be heard sobbing: 'There is nothing I can do for him.'

Lee is due to be sentenced tomorrow while Whelan is expected to be sentenced on June 14 following a pre-sentence report.

Heartbreak: Tyler's father Shaun Harrison looks on whilst a statement is read by DS Simon Megicks, of Cambridgeshire Police

Following the verdict, Superintendent Simon Megicks, of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'This was a wicked crime in which an innocent five-year-old was murdered by a person who should have been looking after him.

'Lee is a controlling and violent man who lost his temper and inflicted fatal injuries to Tyler.

'Whelan has been found to have allowed his death following these fatal injuries - Tyler deserved more from his mother.

'Every child has the right to be protected and feel safe in their own home and it is a parent's responsibility to ensure this is the case.mThankfully, this type of crime is very unusual.

'It is our responsibility to ensure that offenders are identified and effectively brought to justice and I am pleased that this has happened in this case.

'I hope this verdict brings peace to Tyler's relatives knowing justice has been done.'

In statement read outside the court on
behalf of Tyler family, his father Shaun Harrison said: 'The last year 
of my life has been unbearable.

'Tyler was a fun-loving mischievous little boy with a big heart and amazing smile.

'I feel lost without him in my life and I can't believe he has gone.

'It hurts me that I will never get the
chance to see him grow up and see the man he should have become.'
