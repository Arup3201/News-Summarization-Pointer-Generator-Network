A betting company has been inspired by the film release of erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey to produce a slightly disturbing advertisement.

The ad 'stars' a greyhound playing the leading role of the raunchy movie's sadomasochistic billionaire Christian Grey, which they promise will leave you ‘hot under the collar’.

In the advertisement, a demurely dressed journalist is shown to Mr Grey’s high-rise office - just like in the best-selling book - but when the camera pans to the desk, a greyhound in a tie sits with his pink tongue hanging out in the place of the handsome Mr Grey.

What happens next is even more bizarre, as a dark haired woman seductively paints red lipstick on her lips and begins some kind of illicit encounter with the dog Tilly - who is actually a rescue dog.

Sportsbet has created a bizarre Fifty Shades Of Grey parody starring a woman and a greyhound

The pooch sprawls out on a cushion-covered bed as the woman playing the role of Anastacia Steele scoops peanut butter from a jar, licks her lips and rolls around.

But animal rights group Animal Liberation have slammed the advertisement, saying it is exploitative and demeaning to the greyhound.

'We completely oppose the whole notion of bestiality, which is clearly implied in ambiguous light in the clip,' a spokesman for Animal Liberation told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It is a federal offence and penalties are severe. 

'It is likely that exploitation would could have occurred in ‘training’ the dog to make the clip which is also not acceptable.

'Also, dressing the dog up demeans the animal,' the spokesman added. 

Fifty Shades of Greyhound has already been viewed over 200,000 times on Facebook

Later in the advert a dog’s paw is then seen opening the door to a red room of pain akin to the one in the novel but featuring doggy treats, chains and chews.

‘I want your chum,’ the woman shouts with her hands tied.

The ad then cuts to a race track scene, with the woman wearing a white bunny costume.

Tilly is released from the gates titled ‘the red box of pain’ and chases the woman to the sound of ‘who let the dogs out’.

Seemingly catching up with, the pair is then shown between the sheets. ‘You sure went wacko,’ she says with ruffled hair

The gambling company said: ‘Well, if you thought last week’s office sex romp between those two New Zealand co-workers was a “dog act”, wait until you see this. We promise it will leave you satisfied.

‘Sportsbet is giving doggy style a whole new meaning in a production that will leave you hot under the collar.’

Sportsbet’s YouTube channel highlights how Tilly the greyhound was adopted from the Greyhound Adoption Program.
