An eight-year-old boy who fell from a second floor window as he tried to escape being tickled by his little sister survived after a plastic porch broke his fall.

Rhys Sykes plunged two storeys when he recoiled from being tickled by his little sister Megan and accidentally tumbled out of the window of his Cheltenham home.

The youngster survived and escaped any serious injury after a plastic porch broke his fall. 

Paramedics said the porch  saved the youngster's life, because without it he would have fallen 10 feet to the concrete below.

Rhys Sykes escaped a fall from a second storey bedroom at his family home without serious injury because a plastic porch broke his fall, after he tumbled out of the window as his little sister tried to tickle him 

The youngster, eight, survived because he landed on the the plastic porch (pictured above) 

Tricia Sykes found her son lying outside. 

She said: 'I got there as he was trying to get up,' said Mrs Sykes. 'He was just screaming constantly. My neighbour actually thought someone was dying.' 

Rhys suffered an eight millimetre-long bleed on his brain and a fractured skull from the fall but after spending five days at Bristol Children's Hospital was well enough to be released.

Mrs Sykes added: 'I didn't see any of it but from what we can gather from Rhys, and the holes left in the porch. He fell out the window and landed squarely on the porch.

'Then he fell on to the concrete next to the back door.

'He is so lucky as on either side of the walkway is a wall, if he had fallen on that he could have broken his back or something, but incredibly he fell on the floor.'

Megan, six, had tried to tickle her older brother Rhys as the two played a game and he recoiled, falling out

She said she had never expected her naturally cautious son, who took six months worth of encouragement to play basketball would hurt himself.

The eight-year-old had been watching a film with his sister Megan in his parents' bedroom and had climbed up on to the ledge under the window - which doubles as an emergency exit. 

He then recoiled as his little sister tried to tickle him and tumbled down.  

Mrs Sykes and husband Adrian, 29, who were downstairs, heard a bump and assumed Rhys has fallen asleep watching the film and tumbled out of bed.

But as Mrs Sykes went upstairs she saw a stricken Megan, who told her: 'He's outside mummy. Rhys is outside.'

Rhys was taken to hospital by his mother and had to spend five days there after fracturing his skull 

A CT scan after the accident revealed that Rhys had a small bleed on the left hand side of his brain 

Tricia said: 'My nurse cadet training from school just kicked in and I rang for an ambulance.

'I went into autopilot really. I left the back gate open for the paramedics. I went around packing Rhys' possessions for hospital. If I hadn't have had the training, I would probably have been flapping.

'Rhys was very erratic. He was screaming in and out of the ambulance. The left side of his brain was swelling.

Rhys was rushed to the Gloucester Royal Hospital, where after a CT scan revealed a skull fracture, he was transferred to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

Rhys Sykes was released from hospital after five days and has made a recovery after the ordeal 

The fall has left Rhys more sensitive to noise although doctors believe he will adjust as he grows older.

Mrs Sykes added: 'It is a complete miracle, still to this day I have no idea how we were only in the hospital for so few days.

'I've always said the first person to break a bone or end up in hospital would be Megan as she is a daredevil.'
