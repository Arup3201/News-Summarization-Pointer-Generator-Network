She's a key aide to Ed Miliband and has campaigned tirelessly to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour.

Yet Karen Buck’s son is an amateur gangster rapper who pens lyrics about ‘spreading out the kush’ and ‘blazin’ - colloquial references to cannabis use.

Ms Buck, who has worked to reduce drug misuse in her constituency Westminster North, has been Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary since April 2013.

Cosmo Buck-Taylor, 21, has posted several videos on his YouTube channel, CuzzyOfficial, in which he appears to be smoking the illegal drug.

His raps, Don’t Like Freestyle and My Reality, show a teenage Mr Buck-Taylor wearing a tracksuit and smoking alongside marijuana paraphernalia.

Surrounded by friends dressed in hoodies and caps, Mr Buck-Taylor is filmed rapping in front of graffitied garages and walking through housing estates.

Although the videos were uploaded around two years ago, the rapper appears to still promote the Class B substance.

Private matter: MP Karen Buck said her son's video had nothing to do with her role in public life

In his newly released single ‘Young Livin I Fade’, he raps ‘we get high everyday’ and ‘we just smoke weed till our eyes get red’.

His mother has held the seat of Westminster North since May 2010 and is defending a majority of 2,126 votes at the general election on May 7.

The 56-year-old withdrew her son from one of Tony Blair’s flagship city academies - Paddington Academy - in 2006 after he allegedly received barely any education for a year.

Mr Buck-Taylor, who was 12-years-old at the time and had only been at the academy for a term following its opening, was switched to a nearby comprehensive school.

When questioned about his rap videos, Mr Buck-Taylor said: ‘This is none of your business. This is my personal life, you have no right to interfere in my life. This was when I was 18-years-old. I was not smoking a joint.’

But when questioned about what substance was in the cigarette, he said: ‘No comment’.

Ms Buck, who first became an MP in Westminster in 1997, said the video had no bearing on her position in politics.

She said: ‘As far as I’m aware this is some time ago. It’s a private matter and I don’t see that it has anything to do with my role in public life.’

Ms Buck, who has been an MP since 1997 when her seat was called Regents Park and Kensington North, made her name while a councillor at Westminster when she was involved in exposing fraudulent behaviour of Shirley Porter and the Homes for Votes scandal.

She caused a stir in her ward in 2014 when she infuriated one of her non-muslim constituents by twice sending him a card celebrating an Islamic festival.

She admitted that her staff went through the electoral register picking out people with ‘Islamic’ names.
