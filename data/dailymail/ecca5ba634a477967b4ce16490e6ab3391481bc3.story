This certainly wasn't a delicate burglary job. 

CCTV caught the moment three bungling thieves reversed their pickup truck through the window of a Quick Mart store in Arlington, Texas, in a bid to steal an ATM.

However, the grainy night-time footage shows the men running into the store before quickly exiting again, seemingly in a state of panic and without stealing anything. 

The smash and grab attempt took place Wednesday morning.

From the surveillance video it is difficult to make out the men's faces. They appear to be wearing dark clothing.

According to authorities they left the scene empty-handed and disappeared in their escape vehicle.

Police told NBC News that the truck was found abandoned in a neighborhood several blocks away.

They later took someone into custody fitting the description of the driver.  

The incident at 5000 West Arkansas Lane remains under investigation.

While there was nothing taken, the front window of the Quick Mark outlet will need to be replaced along with the security blind. In the CCTV clip, shards of glass are seen flying everywhere.

Store displays will also need to be repaired after being mowed down by the thieves' truck.
