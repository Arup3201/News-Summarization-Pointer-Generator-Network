Ed Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe like the one facing France under Francois Hollande, a former advisor to Gordon Brown said last night.

Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Lastminute.com and a member of the last Labour government’s business advisory council, warned that Mr Miliband would attempt to repeat the failed socialist experiment that has left the French economy in the doldrums.

His comments follow a series of damning interventions from captains of industry who queued up yesterday to attack Labour’s economic policies and warn of the consequences if Mr Miliband enters No10 in May.

As the party’s damaging row with business entered a third day, Mr Miliband came under fire from Digby Jones, trade minister under Gordon Brown.

Lord Jones, the former director general of the CBI, said: ‘We cannot have political leaders who are creating the wrong sort of mood music, that says we do not like business. I don’t want to be France. I don’t want people thinking that they do not want to come here. I want business to want to be here.’

Business leader Peter Hargreaves, who co-founded the FTSE100 investment giant Hargreaves Lansdown, said a Labour government would be a disaster for the economy and cause entrepreneurs and the wealthy to flee the country.

He added: ‘If the Labour Party got into power they would leave a monstrous deficit and will bankrupt the country.’

Former Chairman of Pizza Express Luke Johnson said it would be a disaster if Labour ‘carried out the policies they’re suggesting’. The former Channel 4 chairman said: ‘Take freezing energy prices – an example of how the Opposition are ignorant of the way markets and capitalism works.’

Mr Hoberman – who is now a government trade ambassador, warned that Labour’s ‘anti-business rhetoric’ was ‘scaring business’. 

The internet guru and tech entrepreneur said: ‘Should Labour get elected then what we may well find is that it will be similar to what Hollande did in France, in that he sends businesses away and investment out of the country and then he does a U-turn and it’s almost too late.’

He accused Labour of ‘anti-business populism’ and failing to recognise that many firms ‘contribute huge amounts’.

The damaging war of words between Labour and business began on Sunday when Boots boss Stefano Pessina warned that a Labour government would be a ‘catastrophe’.

Left-wing Labour MPs last night accused their party of not being radical enough and insisted they would push for ‘real Labour policies’ if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street in a coalition.

A group led by John McDonnell will meet trade unions, Left-wing academics and campaign groups this weekend to decide what their demands would be in negotiations with other parties. Mr McDonnell said: ‘Many Labour MPs, candidates and activists will want to campaign for a more radical agenda of policies than we have seen so far.

‘Many voters will also want to know that there are people within the Labour party arguing for real Labour policies.’

His comments sparked a furious response from Labour, whose business spokesman Chuka Umunna questioned Mr Pessina’s tax affairs and Labour MPs said they would not listen to a multi-millionaire who lived in ‘a big mansion’.

Yesterday Stuart Rose, the former Marks & Spencer boss, accused Mr Miliband of being a ‘1970s throwback’ in an article for the Daily Mail.

Lord Rose, a Tory peer, said Labour’s ‘business bashing’ could curb investment and lead to ‘shuttered shop fronts, empty high streets and lengthening dole queues’.

This sparked an angry response from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who accused Lord Rose of ‘playing party politics’ and making the claims ‘because he’s a Tory’.

But the rush of critical opinion from so many business leaders will be harder for Labour to shrug off.

Charlie Mullins, who set up Pimlico Plumbers in 1979, also went on the attack, accusing Mr Miliband of being ‘clueless about business’.

The tycoon said: ‘I’m one business owner who isn’t going to keep quiet about the destructive power of having a business-hating government with Ed Miliband at the helm.’

A report by Deutsche Bank warned that British families will face higher borrowing costs under Labour as interest rates earlier to offset extra government spending.
