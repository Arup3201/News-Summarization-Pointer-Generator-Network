Running an investment portfolio is a far cry from selling papers on the street to sympathetic passers-by. But the Big Issue, the magazine that supports the homeless, has drawn up plans to branch out into fund management.

Big Issue Invest, the magazine’s finance arm, intends to raise some £250m over the next five years and to invest the cash in projects with a social conscience around the UK.

It hopes to attract backing from City institutions, foundations and rich individuals to fund fledging community businesses.

The Big Issue has already dipped a toe into the water, raising £20m for investment in new businesses back in 2005. It was an early stage investor in Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant project, that offered training and jobs to disadvantaged young people.

But its latest plans will put it into a much bigger investment league.

‘Since the financial crisis, people are looking at new ways to raise cash and support companies. We are interested in funding firms in poorer areas or employing people who find it hard to get work.

‘We want to extend the boundaries of what is a traditional investment. These will be sustainable projects, which will offer worthwhile returns,’ said Nigel Kershaw, Chairman of Big Issue Invest. ‘This is a step change.’ 

Mr Kershaw is looking for a chief executive with City experience to lead the fund raising effort.

He said: ‘We want someone who has spent a lot of time in the City and feels it is time to put something back. We want them to use their experience and know-how to raise investment.’

The new chief executive will lead the magazine group’s fund raising, which it hopes will get off the ground by the end of the year.

In addition to supporting Fifteen, the 
Big Issue has also backed London-based transport business Connection 
Crew, which takes 25 per cent of its recruits from the homeless.

It has also given £1.8million to 
Moneyline, the Blackburn-based not-for-profit company which lends cash 
to people who are unable to secure bank loans.

Mr Kershaw said: ‘These are the types of businesses we want to back with the new fund. There are a lot of opportunities out there.’

Moneyline’s business model differs greatly from payday loan firm Wonga, condemned last month by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby for exploiting the poor, which charges annual interest of over 5,800 per cent.

The Big Issue was founded in London in 1991 by John Bird and Gordon Roddick, the husband of the late founder of the Body Shop, Anita Roddick.

It supports the homeless by turning them into vendors and giving them a cut of the magazines they sell. The magazine now has operations in cities as far afield as Tokyo and Nairobi.
