A couple whose two-year-old daughter died unexpectedly in April have given $100,000 to another toddler picked at random in honor of their little girl.

Savannah Carroll was found dead in her room on April 4 after suffering SUDC - Sudden Unexplained Death in Children.

Distraught, her parents Larry and Carrie, both writers, vowed to channel their love for 'Savvy' into giving a hard-up family the money to afford all manner of special experiences and a college education.

Passing on: Savannah (left) was two when she passed away in April this year of Sudden Unexplained Death in Children. Her Los Angeles-based family flew to Savannah, Georgia, where they found Isabella (right)

The pair flew from their California home to Savannah, Georgia, to find the chosen family.

And when four-year-old Isabella Williams walked up to their son Jack at a play center, they knew.

'We both knew that this was our family because Isabella was such a sweet little girl, just like Savannah,' Larry told Yahoo Parenting.

The couple had spent a day scouring the city's parks, streets and cafes before deciding to take Jack for a break.

'I felt as though something was guiding us in that direction.'

As soon as they saw Isabella, they went over to meet her mom Sarah, a single mother-of-five.

Tragic: The couple, who have an older son called Jack, devised the plan to channel their grief into love

'We told Sarah about Savannah and made our offer.'

The Carrolls had originally planned to raise $10,000 through the website Fundly and a campaign titled Savannah's Stolen Moment Campaign. 

Within weeks, donors helped them reach $96,000.

They hope it will help the Williams family to afford a special trip or experience then ease the financial weight of parenthood.

'When Savvy was alive, we made a point to create spontaneous memories with her — a surprise cookie, a trip to the playground — and we'd refer to these experiences as "Stolen Moments",' Carroll said.

Fast friends: Jack, Isabella and Isabella's siblings have had a lot of fun playing together since they met

Stolen moments: The Carrolls hope the Williams family can experience the moments Savannah didn't get to

'We wanted to find a girl who resembled Savannah and give her a Stolen Moment.'

Larry devised the project - which they hope to replicate for more children - in the immediate aftermath of Savannah's death as he grappled to control his emotions.

'All I wanted to do was show my wife there was a reason to go on, that there was joy in the world and, even in the most brutal moments, the world is still a beautiful place with amazing people,' Carroll told Today, as he recounted his thoughts the first night after Savannah's death. 

He then wrote on their website: 'I'm feeling very powerless right now. The only way I can handle this powerlessness, I figure, is with the power to give someone else joy.'
