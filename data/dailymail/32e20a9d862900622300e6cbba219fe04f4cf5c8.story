A judge questioned 'which genius' had decided to charge a man who was spotted holding a kitchen knife when guarding his home from a gang of yobs.

David Beeley, 44, was woken up by 'rowdy' drunk youths who were shouting outside his Nottingham home in August and shouted down asking the group to be quiet with the gang shouted back.

The yobs went away but returned later and started banging on his door brandishing metal objects.

Nottingham Crown Court where a judge questioned the wisdom of David Beeley being on trial for taking a knife to protect his home from a gang

Mr Beeley came to the door with a kitchen knife, police were called and he was arrested for possessing a bladed article.

None of the gang of yobs were detained by police.

Judge Michael Stokes, QC, asked whether Beeley should be in court when 
none of the people who came to his door had been arrested.

He gave him a conditional discharge, meaning he will face no punishment for the charge.

Describing Beeley as of 'good character', he added: 'Which genius 
thought it was in the public interest to prosecute this defendant?'

Andrew Tanser, prosecuting, said that Mr Beeley had been asleep at about 11.30pm when he was woken by the group's shouts outside his home in the Mapperley Park area of the city.

He added that the gang were 'rowdy and clearly in drink' and said that they 'came back with metal implements and were banging on his door' when he came to the door with the knife.

Michael Evans, defending, said his client admitted possession of a 
bladed article to avoid the stress of a trial and simply wanted the 
matter to end.

After the hearing Mr Beeley said: 'I was a little bit rankled because of the aggression I received, but I shouldn't have done that, it was a bad decision.'

Charged: Mr Beeley was arrested by Nottinghamshire Police following the incident

He said he did not believe any of the people who banged on his door had been prosecuted and added: 'I was a little bit disappointed by that because you wonder whether they will go on to do something else.'

A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'When this case was charged, a prosecutor, as in all cases, considered the evidence in the case and the public interest.

'The evidence provided showed that the defendant had left his apartment building carrying a large kitchen knife with the intention of making a group of youths who were causing a disturbance leave the vicinity.

'The prosecutor took the view that going out in public with a knife can often inflame a situation, rather than resolve it.

'The defendant pleaded guilty to this offence, on the basis that he had the knife in his hand because he had been cooking and had gone outside out of fear for himself and other residents in the block.

'This plea was accepted by the prosecution.'
