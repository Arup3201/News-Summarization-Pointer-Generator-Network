Wayne Rooney has expressed his desire to lead Manchester United to success next season after he was named Manchester United captain.

Rooney was given the permanent honour by new boss Louis van Gaal after United's final pre-season game against Valencia on Tuesday night.

The 28-year-old has shared skippering the Red Devils alongside Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley during pre-season but led out United in their 2-1 win against their Spanish opponents at Old Trafford.

Front man: He will take on the role from Nemanja Vidic who departed at the end of last season

'Walking out last night as captain of @manchesterunited was an unbelievably proud moment for me and my family,' he wrote on Instagram.

'It’s a huge honour for me to captain this great club and I will take great pride in doing so.

'I would like to thank all the fans for their support, I am looking forward to the exciting times ahead and leading their club to more success.'

The position of captaincy at United had long been debated following the departures of Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra this summer, but Van Gaal chose the England striker due to his impressive approach.

'For me, it's always very important, the choice of captain,' van Gaal told the official club website.

'Wayne has shown a great attitude towards everything he does. I have been very impressed by his professionalism and his attitude to training and to my philosophy.

'He is a great inspiration to the younger members of the team and I believe he will put his heart and soul into his captaincy role.'

Rooney will be hoping to lead United to better fortunes this season, after they endured a disappointing last term that saw the deposed Premier League champions finish seventh. 

Meanwhile, Darren Fletcher has been appointed United vice-captain, with van Gaal acclaiming the Scot as a 'natural leader'.

'I am delighted to have been named as vice-captain,' said the Scot.

'It's a very proud moment for me and my family. Wayne and I have always worked well together and we will continue to work closely together in our new roles. I would like to thank the manager for putting his trust in me.'

Van Gaal added: 'Darren is a natural leader and will captain the team when Wayne isn't playing. Darren is a very experienced player and a very popular member of the dressing room, I know he will work well alongside Wayne.' 

Rooney is following in the footsteps of centre-back Vidic, who was captain of the club for three years before his departure for Inter Milan at the end of last season.
