A rare albino hedgehog called Extra which was given away by its owner has found a soul mate at his new animal rescue centre.

Extra, a rare African Pygmy hedgehog, was no longer wanted but luckily he was taken in by Mistley Place Park animal rescue centre in Essex.

But with his pure white spikes and bright red eyes, it was unclear what the centre’s resident black and white African Pygmy, called Elsie, would make of the new arrival.

Extra, who weighs less than 500oz, was given away to the rescue centre by owners who no longer wanted him

But thankfully the two have proved that opposites do attract and they have now become best friends.

Park owner Maureen Taylor said: 'Extra and Elsie really are sweet - they love to burrow together and they change their house around all the time to get themselves comfortable.

'They’re very active and very sweet.'

Extra and Elsie have been given special permission to live in Mrs Taylor’s home as they have to be kept in warm conditions.

Mrs Taylor added: 'These hedgehogs ave to be kept in warm temperatures so they live with us in our house.

Elsie and Extra will join owls, a skunk, snakes, a leopard ghekko and other exotic creatures for a special public viewing at Easter

'You have to have heating on all the time for African Pygmys. You can’t just turn it off when you go to bed because they will die.

'People buy these pets on impulse, but five minutes later they don’t want them - they don’t realise the amount of care that is needed.

'African pygmys are small and don’t hibernate because Africa is warm and they don’t have the body fat to survive.'

Elsie and Extra will join owls, a skunk, snakes, a leopard ghekko and other exotic creatures for a special public viewing on Easter Sunday and Monday.

The tourist attraction found it could only showcase wild and exotic animals not native to the UK seven days of the year, after officials at Tendring District Council realised the centre did not have a zoo licence.
