Riot police accidentally turned a football fan into a human fireball after a flare he was holding burst into flames when they tear-gassed him.

The bizarre incident, which was caught on film, happened during crown trouble at a Polish top division match between Slask Wroclaw and Zaglebie Lubin.

The security officer who fired the gas at him presumably didnâ€™t know that the two chemicals were combustible.

Fireball: The fan, who is holding a flare, bursts into flames when a police officer fires tear gas at him

The supporter was spotted climbing onto a section of the fence surrounding the seats and police took action by firing the gas at him.

He then burst into flames, falls down the stairs, and then gets back up and runs back amongst the fans, apparently unhurt.
