Advances: Sales executive Anna Mazover endured unwelcome advances from her boss Darren Scott, including having her leg groped

Two female sales executives were groped and leered at by their married boss, who was ‘fixated’ with one of the women’s breasts, a tribunal has ruled.

Darren Scott, 55, was obsessed with Diane Nicholl-Pierson’s breasts and regularly spoke to them instead of her face, an employment tribunal found.

He also fondled her thigh and groped the leg of her colleague, Anna Mazover, 29, whom he falsely accused of being a part-time prostitute.

Mr Scott made smutty comments to the women, both university graduates, about his sexual prowess and desirability.

He also made unwelcome advances towards Miss Mazover, offering to buy her gifts from Harrods and Selfridges, and tried to persuade both women to dump their partners and go out with him instead.

Last night the women – who are each in line for up to £25,000 compensation after the tribunal ruled they had been victims of sexual harassment – told the Daily Mail they felt ‘vindicated’ by the judgment.

However, tribunal judge Dr Simon Auerbach said claims that he had asked the women for a threesome and bragged about bedding prostitutes and strippers and snorting cocaine were untrue.

The panel also rejected the women’s allegations that Mr Scott had shown them images of scantily clad women on escort websites on his computer.

The judge said the women, who earned £18,000-a-year plus potentially high commissions, exaggerated the allegations because they feared they were about to lose their jobs.

The tribunal, sitting in central London, was told that the women made a formal complaint against Mr Scott two days after he warned them about their poor sales performance.

Darren Scott told Anna Mazover, right, that their colleague Diane 
Nicholl-Pierson, left, would not drown as 'she would just float because 
of her boobs'

Yesterday Miss Nicholl-Pierson, 24, 
who has a new job but has been treated for depression, said: ‘We were 
regularly embarrassed and humiliated at work by Darren Scott, it was 
disgusting the way he treated us.

'He would stare at my breasts, making 
remarks about them.’

The tribunal ruled that both women wrongly claimed that Mr Scott had invited both women to his £1.4 million penthouse for a threesome

Miss Mazover, who is working as a sales executive 
for her father’s security business in her native Ukraine, added: ‘It was
 his word against ours, but now people know he did sexually harass us.’

The
 women began working at Entico Corporation Ltd, a Mayfair-based 
publishing firm, in May last year. Miss Mazover told the tribunal that 
on her first day Mr Scott said she had a ‘great body’, adding: ‘Have you
 ever considered working in a strip club?’

She
 claimed that the following day Mr Scott asked the pair of them to have 
sex with him at his £1.4million penthouse in north London in return for a
 promotion.

Although he had 
made some comment about Miss Mazover’s appearance being ‘good’, Mr Scott
 did not refer to a ‘strip club,’ the tribunal found.

The panel also 
said that while he did ask the women to go and see his flat, he did not 
ask them for a threesome.

Recovering
 alcoholic Mr Scott told the tribunal a threesome would be his ‘worst 
nightmare’ because, even with Viagra, he was unable to have sex.

However,
 the panel upheld Miss Nicholl-Pierson’s claims that, almost immediately
 after she started working for the firm, Mr Scott spoke to her breasts 
rather than her face and made crude comments about them.

The
 panel partly upheld the women’s claims of sexual harassment and 
victimisation, but rejected their sex and race discrimination claims.

Michael McDonough, who represented the women, said he would be seeking ‘substantial damages’.

‘It
 was a terrible ordeal for both women,’ he said. ‘There is some 
disappointment that certain of their allegations were not proven but 
that is more than balanced by the fact that sexually humiliating verbal 
comments and actual sexual assaults were found proven.’

A spokesman for Entico said that Mr Scott was an independent contractor and no longer worked for the firm.

The tribunal heard that Diana Nicholl-Pierson (left) and Anna Mazover (right) had joined Entico Corporation Ltd in Mayfair in May 2013 but were soon facing dismissal for poor performance
