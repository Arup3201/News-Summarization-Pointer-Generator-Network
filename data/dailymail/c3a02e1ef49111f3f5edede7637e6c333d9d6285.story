As Mario Gotze's left-foot strike hit the back of the net in Rio de Janeiro, it was an end and a beginning. It was the end of a long wait for this group of players to finally crown their talent with a major trophy. It was the end of speculation that the golden generation might have been wasted. It was the beginning of what may well be a period of dominance.

Joachim Low had predicted it even before the final. 'We have a future,' he said, 'we can play on top of the world for a few years yet.'

He is almost certainly right. Of the team which beat Argentina at the Maracana, only Miroslav Klose will not be around for very much longer. Even he will not be a terrible loss for Germany.

Hero: Mario Gotze came off the bench to score the winner for Germany in extra-time in Rio de Janeiro

The 36-year-old has performed magnificently in a black and white shirt for over a decade, and with his 16 World Cup goals is already a living legend. But in truth, Klose has played only a secondary role for a while now. This team is built on youth.

Age is not merely a number either. Those lining up to replace Klose are not only considerably younger, they also belong to a much more modern breed of attacker. Germany has a gliding false nine in Mario Götze, a poaching one in Thomas Mueller, and a incredibly quick one in Marco Reus. 

All of those three are 25 or younger, and their best years are yet to come. They are also only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the attacking talent Joachim Low is able to choose from. In the next few years, we will almost certainly see the rise of players like Kevin Volland and Andre Hahn, who were on the fringes of the preliminary squad this year, while Julian Draxler is becoming ever more established.

In midfield, too, there is an almost endless supply of talent. The likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos all have years ahead of them, but already a wealth of experience behind them.

Even if Schweinsteiger's fitness and age become a problem over the next few years, there are plenty of understudies waiting to fill his shoes. Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka and Liverpool's Emre Can are all capable of reaching the top of the international game, and Ilkay Gündogan should return to full fitness in the near future.

Only in defence are there any long term problems for Germany. While young Dortmund left back Erik Durm will have gained invaluable experience as part of this World Cup squad, there are no truly remarkable young defensive talents emerging at the moment.

Nonetheless, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng are still young. Phillipp Lahm may be 30, but even he is showing no signs of stopping.

Even beyond the current team, everything seems set for Low and his employers at the moment. In the last 10 to 15 years, German football has completely restructured itself. It is not just the FA, but the league and the clubs themselves.

In the Bundesliga, the clubs who develop their own players are the successful ones. That is visible from the heights of Borussia Dortmund down to lowly Mainz, who have been punching above their weight for years due to a brilliant youth system which spawned, among others, Chelsea's Andre Schurrle.

As long as clubs like Mainz continue to play in a league which encourages that youth development, they will continue to produce top talents to represent Germany, and we will see many more golden generations. 

The main reason for this German team's success is not national pride or machine-like efficiency, as some in Britain continue to insist. The reason is that this young group of players has been allowed to thrive from a very young age.

They have played together or against each other from a very young age. Even those who are under 25 now have an immense amount of experience. There is no reason to believe that won't be the case for the next German generation, and the next one, and the one after that.
