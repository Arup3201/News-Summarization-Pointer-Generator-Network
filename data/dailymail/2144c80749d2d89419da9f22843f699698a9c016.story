A major operation has been launched tracking Santa Claus as he makes is annual delivery of presents to all the children who have been good over the past year. 

Santa left his top-secret toy factory deep underneath the North Pole several hours ago, with Rudolf leading the reindeer on their trip around the world. 

International aircraft have been warned to steer clear of the North Pole as Santa Claus dashes around the world at almost the speed of light.

Central to the tracking operation is the North American Aerospace Defense Command, who have been following Santa's movements from space since 1955. 

Before the invention of satellites, ground observers had to try and spot the reindeer-powered sleigh as it shot across the night-time sky. 

NORAD is especially busy on Christmas Eve and has brought in volunteers in order to field hundreds of phone calls, emails and tweets from anxious children, wondering what time Santa will arrive. 

Also parents and guardians want to ensure that their children are in bed before Santa arrives so he stops and makes his much-anticipated delivery. 

This year, NORAD has launched a live-feed of Santa's journey from a special satellite which is able to keep up with the Mr Claus as he hurtles across the night sky.   

The 59-year-old program is based at a special Santa nerve centre at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.

In December 1955, children discovered a phone number for the top-secret NORAD facility and rang officers who routinely passed on detail's of Santa's progress.

Pilots have been warned to avoid the area around Santa's top-secret workshop for the rest of the day

At 2pm GMT Santa was spotted in the middle of Australia before heading north east to Papua New Guinea

The volunteers will work for 23 hours today following Santa, before racing home just in time for the delivery of their own presents. 

By lunchtime today, the Santa Tracker had more than 1.5 million likes on Facebook with more than 19.5 million people visiting the website. 

Major Beth Castro, who is in charge of communications between Santa and the children said in 2012, 22.3 million people logged onto the website. 

This year, the website features an animated elf named 'Radar'. 

Normally the NORAD facility is responsible for defending the skies of the United States and Canada and was originally located deep within Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs.  

Pilots flying near the North Pole have been advised to avoid the area for the whole of Christmas Eve. 

A special pilot map produced by Jeppesen warned air crew that: 'Departures may be illuminated by a blinding red nose. 

The notice also warns of 'supersonic heavy departures' and that 'non-sleigh traffic discouraged'. 

Pilots are also warned that 'reindeer and elves on and in the vicinity of the runway'. 

British Airways Captain, David Thomas, said: 'Santa has absolute priority over the skies on Christmas Eve and we’ll be cheering him on. 

'There will be 28 British Airways aircraft flying tonight to the four corners of the world, so we’ll be telling our customers to look out for the sleigh and to give Santa and his reindeer a wave.'
