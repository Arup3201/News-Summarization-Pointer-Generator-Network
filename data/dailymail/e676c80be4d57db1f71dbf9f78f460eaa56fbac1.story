Cristiano Ronaldo may be on the verge of leaving the World Cup, but the Portugal skipper can console himself with having the biggest sponsorship deal of all the players in Brazil - worth a staggering £14.1million-a-year with Nike.

Ronaldo’s mega-bucks contract is a result of the Real Madrid forward’s ongoing commercial pulling power and means he also continues to collect more from sponsorship deals than his great rival Lionel Messi does, who is said to earn £13.6m a year from Adidas.

According to research by German analyst Dr. Peter Rohlmann, Brazil's poster boy Neymar Jr. is the next biggest earner at the tournament, pulling in an estimated £9.5m a year from Nike.

Despite England’s woeful tournament, three England players make the top 10 list, with Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard all commanding in the region of £3m a year from their sponsors.

Disgraced Uruguay striker Luis Suarez also rakes in £3m a year, from his deal with adidas, however this may be jeopardised after he was caught biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during their Group D clash on Tuesday.

FIFA have opened disciplinary proceedings against the 27-year-old who could be hit with a long-term ban following his antics in Natal.

On the compiled list Rohlmann said: ‘The top footballers have learned that their face and their reputation can be marketed very well for advertising of products and companies. As the most popular sport in the world, football is in focus before and during major tournaments like the World Cup.’

The research also estimated that kit manufacturers have spent an estimated total of £100m on boot deals with the players on show at the World Cup.
