Robin Boness, from Torquay, is finally working again after five years out of work

A 60-year-old former electrician is finally working again after five years of unemployment and 547 failed job applications.

Robin Boness, from Torquay, secured just one interview while he was unemployed, despite applying for hundreds of jobs. 

A string of rejections and the constant isolation began to take its toll on Mr Boness and he developed severe depression.

He said he began to 'hate the world' and wonder if he would ever find work again.

He said he got so fed up that he even applied to be the managing director of Imperial Chemical Institutions (ICI) on one of his 'silly days'. 

But Mr Boness has now found work with Frontline Total Security, a firm based in St Austell, Cornwall, which carries out security contracts around the south west. 

The 60-year-old, who lives alone, said he is 'over the moon' to be working again and said the new job has turned his life around. 

When he received his first pay packet, he also went out and treated himself to a steak - for the first time in five years.  

He said: 'My story shows you should never give up - keep plugging away because there's always something round the corner. 

'Now, I love every second of my job and I am so happy to be working. I get treated with respect, treated like a human being. I've completely turned my life around and I love doing the job.' 

Mr Boness had been working as an electrician for 30 years when he was made redundant.

He had gone through brief spells of unemployment, but never more than around two or three weeks. 

But what Mr Boness thought would be a temporary gap in his CV turned out to be a five-year wait for a job, during which he relied on his weekly £74 state handout. 

He said: 'It was tight. No matter what people say, you've can't live on the dole. You might be able to survive, but you can't live.   

'I used to go out for long walks around Torquay, because that's all I could afford. I love fishing but I couldn't even do that because I couldn't afford a bus fare, or take all my equipment on the bus.

'Even going to the cinema was something I had to save up for.' 

Although he began applying for electrical work, he soon began applying to do 'anything and everything' around the Torquay area.

He could not apply much further afield because he did not have a car - and could not buy one because he did not have the money. 

Mr Boness also believes his age and the fact he computer illiterate - something he has now remedied - were to blame for his employment struggle. 

He said: 'I'd been an electrician for 30 years but because of my age I could no longer work at the same speed and I got made redundant, which resulted in me being unemployed for five years.

Mr Boness was referred to Pluss, pictured, which finally helped him secure a job in security 

'I felt so low - I couldn't see a future. I applied for 547 jobs which resulted in only one interview. Every advert said you must have a car. 

'You just feel so damn useless. It's the being ignored that really drives you down. 

'The fact that nobody acknowledges the fact that you are even alive. But you can't give up - we've all got to work.'

'It got the point where I thought this is how it's going to be - I'll go stir crazy. I think I became introverted and snappy.

'For five years, apart from signing on, I didn't speak to people. I hated the world and myself.'

Mr Boness's luck changed when he was referred to Pluss, a social enterprise which works across Torbay and South Devon to get people back into work.

The group paid for him to get a new suit, shirt and tie and, after putting him on an employability course, secured his second interview in five years.

Staff from Pluss even drove Mr Boness to his interview - which later became a solid job offer. 

He said: 'They were a tremendous help - I did an employability course and they helped me get my Security Industry Authority badge.

'They helped fund my suit, shirt and tie for interview. They also drove me to interview and I was terrified.

'I couldn't believe it when I actually got the job. Pluss then helped me with a hire car until I had a couple of months' wages and could buy my own car.

'I could never have done this for myself. I think I was getting to the point of giving up and withdrawnig completely from society. Pluss made me see everything in a different way.' 

Mr Boness now works doing security and client and customer safety. The job could be based anywhere across the south west. 

He said: 'At the moment I am guarding an empty Grade II listed building. I patrol the building, secure windows and doors, check security of the building and make sure no-one can get in.

'Every hour we do a patrol.

'Someone actually gave me a chance and so I am doing my best to repay them by putting in 120 per cent effort. I am getting a wage.' 

Lee Williams, operations director at Frontline Total Security, said 'He's extremely smart, well mannered and has a good sense of humour.

'He is calm, respectful and has good judgement, he always turns up on time and is good with customers. Robin knows how to speak to people with respect.

'We are very busy so ultimately if we have people, like Robin, who really want to work that makes such a difference to us as a business.'
