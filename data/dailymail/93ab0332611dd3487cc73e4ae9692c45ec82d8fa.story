If you always have room for dessert – and maybe even a second helping – you are about to be handed the perfect excuse. It may be in your genes.

Scientists say that millions of Britons carry a rogue stretch of DNA that stops them feeling full  and leaves them craving sugary and fatty foods.

The FTO gene, carried by more than half of the population, was discovered several years ago. But while researchers knew it made people fat, they didn’t know how it did so.

Scientists have shown that a rogue stretch of DNA carried by millions of Britons stops them from feeling full after eating. The 'hunger gene' prevents a drop in the hunger  hormone ghrelin after eating

Now they have learned that it keeps people feeling hungry, it could lead to new ways to tackle the obesity crisis. 

The 16 per cent of the population 
that carries two copies of the rogue DNA are 70 per cent more likely to 
become obese than those without the gene.

A rogue stretch of DNA - the FTO gene - carried by millions of Britons stops them from feeling full after eating.

People with this DNA particularly crave sugary and fatty foods.

Half of Britons carry the gene and they are 30% more likely to be obese.

16% of Britons carry two rouge copies of the rogue DNA and they are 70% more likely to be obese.

They eat up to 200 extra calories  a 
day and are almost half a stone heavier than their average counterparts.
 And for those with the ‘hunger gene’ dieting is doomed to failure.

Even those who have inherited just 
one flawed FTO gene – 49 per cent of the population – are 30 per cent 
more likely to be obese.

The British-led research team asked 
young men with and without the genetic flaw to rate their hunger before 
and after a meal. Volunteers’ blood samples were then tested for 
ghrelin, a hormone that triggers feelings of hunger. 

Levels of ghrelin are usually high before we eat, and fall afterwards. 

But in the men with the ‘hunger gene’, levels remained relatively high after eating. They also felt hungrier than the others. 

Next, the volunteers were shown 
pictures of various foods after they had eaten and asked how appealing 
they seemed. And despite just having had a meal, those with the gene 
still found cakes, pastries, chips and burgers highly tempting.

The scientists then used MRI scanners to peer into the volunteers’ brains.

Those with the ‘hunger gene’ lit up 
more at the thought of fatty and sugary foods, the Journal of Clinical 
Investigation reports.

People with the FTO gene particularly crave sugary and fatty foods - explaining why some people find dessert irresistible, no matter how much they have already eaten

Study leader Dr Rachel Batterham, of 
University College London, said that some of us were simply 
‘biologically programmed to eat more’.

She added: ‘Not only do these people 
have higher ghrelin levels and therefore feel hungrier, their brains 
respond differently to ghrelin and to pictures of food. It’s a double 
hit.’

The work, which was funded by the 
medical research charity  the Rosetrees Trust and the  Medical Research 
Council, could speed research into new obesity treatments. 

Despite the scale of the obesity crisis, there is only one prescription-strength weight loss drug available in the UK.

But drugs are not the only weapon against the hunger gene. 

Dr Batterham said: ‘We know that 
ghrelin, and therefore hunger, can be reduced by exercise like running 
or cycling or by eating a high- protein diet.’

Professor Steve Bloom, an obesity 
expert from Imperial College London, agreed the research would spur on 
the search for new treatments. It could also help in targeting any drugs
 to those who would benefit the most, he said.
