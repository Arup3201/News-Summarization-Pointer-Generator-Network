This terrified 13-year-old was lucky not to be badly hurt after an adventure turned sour and he was forced to cling to a crumbling cliff at least 30ft above a rocky beach.

Numerous paramedics, 20 firefighters, four police officers and eight coastguards were needed to save the teenager who had got marooned in Whitehaven, Cumbria as the tide swept in under him.

Onlookers said the unnamed boy was stuck at the ocean’s edge for more than 40 minutes until he was rescued yesterday.

Don't look down: More than 30 rescue workers were needed to save the teenager seen here hanging dangerously from the middle of the rock

Gently does it: A rescue worked ties ropes to the boy to ensure that if he falls he'd be safe

A multitude of vehicles tore through the town and its surrounding water, including three fire engines with a rescue van, two police cars, two coastguard vehicles, and one lifeboat.

Ropes were used to gently lift the teenager, understood to be from London, to safety in a joint effort by the coastguard and the fire service.

Michael Amor, 18, of Whitehaven, who had been watching the rescue, said: 'He is only a little lad. He must have been terrified.

'He had been using the skate park earlier with his mates.

'Not a lot of kids usually go to the rock, it is a place people go to drink and sometimes fish.'

Another onlooker, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The rock is quite dangerous.

We're coming to get you: A brave rescuer slowly eases his way down to the boy, who got stuck

The works: A large amount of people and equipment was needed on the Whitehaven beach to save him before the tide swept in

'There is another access to it on the other side and it looks as though the boy must have been trying to climb down when he got stuck.

'Older teenagers go out there to drink, it is not a place younger children normally go.”

Two fire engines from Whitehaven and one from Workington in Cumbria attended the scene along with their major rescue vehicle.

A fire service watch manager and a station manager also attended 
along with the ambulance service, police and Coastguard.

Nearby St Bees' 
lifeboat was also alerted.

A spokesman for the Whitehaven Coast Rescue Team said: 'The boy had climbed 30ft of the 40ft shale outcrop on the beach at Whitehaven, when he became stranded on a crumbling ledge.

Rescue: One lifeboat came to the scene and another was on standby amid fears for the teenager's safety

Between a rock and a hard place: The boy was saved from two directions

'Fortunately he managed to alert a family member to his predicament and the police were called who informed the coastguard.

'We were alerted and deployed a cliff rescue team to the top of the outcrop and a water rescue team to stand by at the base of the rock as the tide was rapidly flooding.

'The team managed to reach the boy from the top of the outcrop and lowered him down the more stable seaward side of the rock.

'The rescue was made difficult and dangerous due to the shale make-up of the rock making the cliff face unstable and slippery. There was a constant danger of either the youth slipping off the ledge, or the ledge itself crumbling away.'
