For those of us struggling to tone and trim our unyielding  winter bodies in time for hitting the beach this summer, ice cream may seem firmly off the menu.

But a new type of ice cream has hit the shelves which promises to allow those looking to shed the pounds to still indulge in the frozen dessert.

Despite its low sugar and high protein content though, some nutritionists warn that, though a healthier option than the original, it should still be enjoyedas an occasional treat.

Available in chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavours the Wheyhey ice cream is higher in protein than normal ice-cream

WheyHey, from Holland & Barrett, contains no sugar and has as much protein as a 70 gram chicken breast.

With just 123 calories in each tub, its makers claim it is a much healthier alternative to similar products.

The whey protein - which gives each 150ml tub its name – is said to help build lean muscle and is perfect for those wanting to tone-up their bodies in time for their holidays.

Priced at £2.69, it is available in the traditional ice cream flavours - strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.The product, which is already on sale, is set to be one of the stores biggest selling products this summer.

While the ice cream may be a healthier alternative to normal ice-cream, nutritionists warn it should still be viewed as a treat

A spokesman for Holland & Barrett said: ‘WheyHey received huge interest in a small trial recently and quickly sold out. The stock we’ve ordered is enough to fill more than 1,000 ice cream vans so we hope to be able to meet customer demand, especially now the sunny weather is finally here.’

Nutritionist Kate Butler said the product provides very high levels of protein for what is normally a ‘treat’ food, although urged caution that it was not the sole-solution to weight loss or muscle building.

She added: ‘The reason there is no sugar in each tub is due to a natural sweetener called Xylitol. This combined with the protein content is what makes WheyHey a much healthier alternative to other ice creams –and is why the 123 calories in each tub are derived mainly from the protein content rather than empty sugars and fats.

‘You would however need to combine a tub of WheyHey with hours in the gym and eat it as part of an overall balanced diet if you want to see the ultimate results.’

WheyHey, founded last year, is a favourite among celebrities, including former Dancing On Ice contestant Chloe Madeley and professional sportspeople including Rugby Player Jake Haskall and TV presenter Jake Humphries.

Nutritional experts were sceptical of the product. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum said: Trying to portray an ice cream as being healthy cuts no ice with me and it shouldn’t with anyone.  

‘An ice cream is an indulgence, pure and simple and this fad treat should be consumed sparingly and with some caution. 

‘When even the sales spiel recommends caution – and suggests that hours of work-out are needed to work off a tub -  look for a ‘cooler’ way of rewarding yourself or your children. A glass of water, for instance, will do the trick and certainly be better. ‘
