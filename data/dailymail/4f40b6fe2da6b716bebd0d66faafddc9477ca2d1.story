Amanda Knox's former boyfriend has claimed Italian police tried to bribe him into framing her for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher - and revealed his fears 'out of control' Knox would do the same to him.

Raffaele Sollecito says 'sneaky' officers instigated a string of approaches from a prison guard, other inmates and even his family as he and his American lover were awaiting trial for the 21-year-old's murder in Perugia, Italy.

But Italian Sollecito, 29, said he refused to point the finger of blame at Knox to save his own skin because he was 'really fond of her'.

Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime

Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her

Yet he admits he was terrified Knox, who he had been dating for just a week before the 2007 killing, would do a deal to stitch him up because she was 'out of control'.

Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared

Sollecito and Knox, 26, were convicted of Meredith’s murder in 2009 then cleared on appeal two years later.

But Italy’s highest court later threw out the acquittals and the pair face a new trial, beginning later this month.

Sollecito claimed detectives told him he would be released immediately if he distanced himself from Knox, saying he should pretend he couldn't remember anything or that he was sleeping in order for the prosecution to catch her.

But Sollecito said in the Daily Mirror: 'They did not persuade me. It was the most sneaky situation. I couldn’t invent anything.'

But he still 'feared Amanda' and added: 'I knew her for a short time, a week, and in reality I did not really know this woman. I was scared because she was out of control at the police station. She had been making crazy statements and everything was just wrong.

'I thought she could make a deal to blame me. I was scared of that.'

Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 following the trial in 2009.

Italian Sollecito said the first 'deal' was when he was in solitary confinement and came about when he his father tried to speak to the proseuction and was told to pass on the message his son should keep his distance from Knox.

Other family members urged Sollecito to take the deal and free himself, but he refused to be persuaded and wrote a letter to his nearest and dearest vowing to stand by Knox.

Sollecito claimed police then began trying to get him to turn against Knox and that, unless he distanced himself from the American, he would spend the rest of his life in prison.

He claims this message was passed to his family in no uncertain terms.

His father was allegedly approached by a Perugia lawyer offering a similar deal.

Prosecutors claimed that Leeds ­University exchange student Meredith had her throat slashed when a drug-fuelled sex game went wrong.

Her grieving family, from Coulsdon, Surrey, were devastated when Knox and Sollecito were freed on appeal but vowed to keep Meredith’s memory alive.

November,  2007  - Meredith Kercher is found dead in Perugia, ItalyOctober, 2008 - Rudy Guede convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering KercherDecember 2009 
- Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito found guilty of murdering Miss 
Kercher. Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito to 
25. October 2011  -  After an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown outMarch 2013 - Italy’s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito

They have kept out of the public eye and refused to read the books that Knox and Sollecito wrote about their 'ordeal'.

But in March the family welcomed news of the retrial and hoped they would finally get answers.

No murder weapon was ever found, DNA tests were faulty and prosecutors provided no motive for murder.

The pair, along with a third man, were accused of killing Meredith when she refused to participate in the sex game at her hillside home.

In a series of confused interviews after their arrest Knox initially claimed to have witnessed the murder and named a local bar owner as the killer.

She later withdrew the statement, insisting it had been made under duress, and said she had been at Sollecito’s student apartment throughout the night – which he confirmed.

The pair met at a classical music concert and became lovers within hours. Meredith was murdered just a week later.

Sollecito said the pair 'were like teenagers in a fantasy romance' but then became friends bonded by the tragedy. The couple were photographed being reunited in New York earlier this year – but he insists there is no romance.

Sollecito is often asked if he wished he had never met Knox. He said: 'No, I don’t think like that. I don’t blame her, it is not her fault this nightmare. It is others.'

And he claimed his own life is 'in limbo', and that he is without a home. He fears he is a target in Italy for those who still believe he and Knox were involved and worries police will try to seek revenge by planting drugs in his car.

He has tried to settle in Lugano, Switzerland, and set up a computer software firm – but was kicked out by the Swiss authorities because he failed to disclose details of the murder charges.

Sollecito then went to stay with relatives in the US and even got marriage proposals from female murder trial 'groupies'.

He has now moved to a secret location in the Caribbean, where he is currently trying to establish a business.'

Knox’s lawyers have insisted she will not be at the retrial in Florence and Sollecito said he will wait until after the first of eight scheduled hearings to see 'which way the court is going'.

Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011

Sollecito feels victimised and slammed the police handling of the case, saying everything about the investigation was handled 'wrong' and that officers were 'incompetent' and 'fools'.

Despite his own grievances, he insists he hasn't forgotten the pain of Meredith's family, saying he 'can't imagine their suffering'.

But he urged them to read the case documents and ask questions about what really happened instead of sticking by the 'theory' of what happened.

'If you accept only the prosecution case you will never find what is right and what really happened,' he added.
