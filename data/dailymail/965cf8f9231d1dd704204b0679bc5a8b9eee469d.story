A young woman who was given three months to live and started completing her ‘bucket list’ has stunned doctors by making a miraculous recovery.

Kayleigh Allport bravely made a list of things to do before she died when she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at the age of just 21.

Her list of final wishes, which takes its name from the phrase, ‘kick the bucket’, included learning to drive, seeing a West End show and visiting New York - her life-long dream.

Brave: Kayleigh Allport was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21 after being given three months to live

It was only when she returned from the United States that her fortunes changed, when doctors put her on a new treatment which might prolong her life.

She was warned that it would not cure her illness -but against the odds she proved the experts wrong and is now in remission.

Kayleigh, now 26, has just completed a degree and now plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby, 24.

She said: ‘The drug has worked wonders. I was given three months to live but I’m still here now.

‘I’m so grateful and I live life to the full now.

‘Before this happened I was quite shy, but now nothing holds me back or bothers me anymore.

‘Facing up to dying has showed me how to live.’ 

Six years after being told she had months to live, Kayleigh Allport graduated from Teeside University with a 2:1 in psychology. Left to right mum Michelle, Kayleigh, sister Claire, and dad Eddie

The problems began for Kayleigh when she had a scan for an unrelated back problem and doctors found a tumour on her kidney.

The cancer was removed in an operation and she was told no further treatment was needed.

But two years later, she received the devastating news that the cancer was back - this time in her liver.

Doctor said described the organ as ‘a mass of tumours’ and declared it inoperable, giving her three months to live.

It was then that Kayleigh, from Middlesborough, started on her bucket list - which saw her taking driving lessons and going to see her first West End show, Dirty Dancing.

And after tireless fundraising by family and friends, Kayleigh, her mother Michelle, 45, father Eddie, 51, and sister Claire, 25, jetted off to New York fulfil the then 21-year-old’s final wish.

The drug trial had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline

She added: ‘I just thought of the list, it was just things that I’d always wanted to do.

‘When I first found out I had three months left to live, I was in shock.

‘There were a lot of people around me and it was hard to take in.

‘I came to terms with it a couple of days later.’

On her return from America, Kayleigh was offered the chance to take part in a drug trial of Sunitinib, which was brand new to the market.

The drug had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline.

Determined to get on with her life, no matter how long she had left, Kayleigh passed her driving test and enrolled at Middlesbrough College before moving on to study Psychology at Teesside University, graduating with a 2:1.

Kayleigh is just about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher

And in September last year, Kayleigh was told she was in remission as the cancer had almost disappeared.

She is just now about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher.

Kayleigh requires check ups every three months but has been told she is remission and will not require any further medical treatment.

Kayleigh said: ‘It feels great because I didn’t think anything like this was going to happen. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.’

The phrase ‘bucket list’ is derived from the phrase ‘kick the bucket’, a morbidly humorous way to refer to death thought to be derived from the kicking of a bucket in a hanging.

The idea was popularised by John Goddard’s ‘Life List’, which featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul.

It also featured in the film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences.
