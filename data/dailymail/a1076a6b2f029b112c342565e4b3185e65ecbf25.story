Victoria Beckham with her bob from October 2001

It's been a good few weeks for style icon Victoria Beckham. 

First her new store opened in London, and now she's been crowned as the celebrity with the most iconic bob of all time.

A new survey asked respondents to pick the celebrity woman they thought sported the infamous cut best - and Posh Spice topped the poll.

Victoria bagged best bob for her cute cropped hairstyle from 2001. Almost a quarter of respondents (24 per cent) said it was their favourite.

Fashion legend Mary Quant comes in second place with over a fifth of the vote (21 per cent)  for the distinctive cut she became known for in the 1960s.

American Vogue boss Anna Wintour was next on the list, with 16 per cent of people saying her full fringe and geometric cut was the most iconic.

English model Alexa Chung took the fourth spot, with her middle parted bob proving most popular with 12 per cent of respondents.

In fifth place was American actress Jennifer Aniston who gained ten per cent of the vote for her long cropped bob made famous by the sitcom Friends, while eight per cent of respondents voted for global superstar Beyoncé, who shocked fans last year when she replaced her long locks with a short edgy cut.

Singer Rihanna followed closely with six per cent of respondents loving her bob with a long side fringe.

In joint eighth place were TV personality Fearne Cotton and fashion legend Twiggy who both received three per cent of votes for their blonde bobs.

In final place was pop singer Katy Perry who received one per cent of the vote.

One respondent said: 'I had to pick Victoria Beckham as the winner, the bob that she had when she married David Beckham is just unforgettable. She is one of those people who can literally pull off any hairstyle, I would look absolutely ridiculous with a bob but she looked flawless as always.'

A second commented: 'I went right back to the 60s and had to choose Mary Quant as the winner of the most iconic bob. I'm not necessarily saying I liked it that much because it did look a bit like a bowl cut, but it is definitely the most classic.'

A third respondent said: 'I voted for Beyoncé as the winner because that pixie cut she had last year was such a drastic change that it has to be the most iconic.'

A spokesman for online hair and beauty retailer Hairtrade.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'Bob haircuts have been around for years and a style most women are able to carry off. It's a really versatile cut - great if you're growing your hair or growing out layers.

'Equally, if you have long hair and want a shorter cut, they're ideal.

'Victoria Beckham did look amazing with her bobbed cut - it suited her face and bone structure perfectly. 

'The other celebrities in the list all suit the cut well too.'
