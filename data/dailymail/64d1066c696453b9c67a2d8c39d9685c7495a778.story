Loss: Tommy Main, 23, died after he was punched in the chest while doing a 'Punch4punch' drinking game with friends

A young father died after taking part in a dangerous new ‘Punch 4 Punch’ craze that is sweeping the nation.

Tommy Main, 23, collapsed after trading heavy punches with another man in the violent ‘game’ during a birthday party.

He was rushed to hospital by ambulance in a critical condition but died an hour later without ever regaining consciousness.

Last night his family lashed out at revellers who filmed the violent clash and its tragic aftermath instead of helping to save the stricken young man.

Ben, 38, one of his three brothers, said they have been left ‘devastated’ by the tragedy which they are still struggling to understand.

He said: ‘I can’t believe my little brother has lost his life. He was punched in the heart and it stopped beating. He died instantly.

‘He’s got a little girl and she doesn’t know yet. How do you tell a three-year-old her dad is dead? She doesn’t even know what it means.’

Punch 4 Punch, which began in the U.S, is the latest reckless game of dare to take hold of the internet.

Social networking sites are full of photos of young men showing off bloody cuts and large bruises after exchanging punches, often while being filmed.

The tragedy echoes the neknominate drinking game which has claimed several young victims who were dared to drink huge amounts of alcohol.

Tommy, who worked for his father’s removal firm, collapsed shortly after midnight on Sunday morning at a 16th birthday party at a house opposite his home in Erith, South East London.

Witnesses said he traded several blows with another man, aged 20, before falling to the ground after a heavy blow to his upper chest.

Ben Main said: ‘Even if they were exchanging punches, you can’t just play games and kill someone. It was a massive punch to the heart.’

Paying tribute to his brother, Ben added: ‘I’m facing my worst fear. It has come real and he is dead. I would call him every weekend to make sure he wasn’t getting in with the wrong crowd.

‘He was a well-loved character and his death has sent shockwaves everywhere. There are so many tributes to him it is surreal.

‘It has devastated my whole family. He had a heart of gold and has never done anything wrong to anyone – and now his life has been taken away.’

Another brother, Roy, 36, added that 
life would never ‘be the same again’ and slammed those who watched Tommy
 suffer the fatal injury.

Writing
 online, he said: ‘For the people that was at the party that can see 
this call yourself friends … you should have stopped it not try and film
 it.’

A Met Police 
spokesman confirmed that the 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion 
of murder and has been released on bail until September.

A
 post mortem examination was inconclusive and the family has been warned
 it could take months for forensic tests to be completed.

Investigation: The young father's death is being treated as unexplained rather than suspicious by police

Dozens of pictures were posted online in tribute to Tommy as his family and large circle of friends learned of the tragedy.

Friends
 said Ben, a Liverpool soccer fan, idolised his only child, 
three-year-old Aimee. His father Mike, 60, was too upset to speak and 
has already put his semi-detached home on the market.

A
 tribute page set up by best friend Matthew Davey attracted more than 
1000 ‘likes’. Mr Davey said: ‘He was my best friend in the whole world.’

Punch4Punch is a social media challenge and drinking game that started in the U.S. and has now landed in the Britain.

The
 two players have one hand tied behind their back and take it in turns 
to punch each other with the free hand until one player gives up.

Their 
defeat usually involves a forfeit, often related to drinking excessive 
amounts of alcohol.

The challengers usually punch each other in the arm, but some players target other areas of the body, sometimes even the head.

Like NekNominate, the challenge is filmed and then posted online for others to see.

Dozens
 of films of young men exchanging blows in ‘Punch 4 Punch’ can be found 
on YouTube and via social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

In
 many cases those involved drink shots of spirits in between punches as 
crowds cheer and jeer their progress. The loser pays a forfeit, which 
inevitably means drinking more alcohol.

The fad comes in the wake of the Neknominate online drinking contest which was linked to several deaths earlier this year.They
 included Isaac Richardson, 20, who died in February after downing a 
lethal cocktail of wine, whisky and vodka at a backpackers’ hostel in 
Woolwich.

Investigators appealed for anyone who filmed or photographed the fatal confrontation to hand over the material.

Det
 Insp Michael Norman said: ‘Tommy's death is being treated as 
unexplained but I would urge any of his friends who were at the party on
 the night of his death to make contact.

‘I am especially interested in any images or footage from the nights of his death.’

A
 Met spokesman said: ‘We await the results of a post mortem. It is being
 treated as an unexplained death rather than suspicious.’

London
 Ambulance Service said they were originally called to treat a man for a
 ‘cardiac arrest’. He was taken to Darent Valley Hospital where he died.

The NekNominate craze is only thought to have started in January this year in Perth, Australia, but has quickly spread via social media.

It is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them.

An early example of the trend was a woman who was filmed riding a horse into a supermarket before downing a can of Pepsi. But the videos have become increasingly dark with three deaths in Britain now linked to the craze.

In March Bradley Eames, 20, from Nottingham, was found dead after he filmed himself downing almost two pints of gin mixed with teabags.
