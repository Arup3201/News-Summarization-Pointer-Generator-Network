An Australian woman is one of 11 passengers injured after a landslide caused a train to derail into a ravine in the Swiss Alps.

The woman's name and the extent of her injuries have not yet been disclosed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

'The Australian Consulate-General in Geneva is providing consular assistance to an Australian woman in relation to a railway accident in Switzerland,' a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia.

Swiss Police spokeswoman Anita Senti confirmed that five people were seriously injured, while the other six sustained slight injuries.

The injured passengers include eight Swiss, two Japanese citizens and one Australian.

Rescuers work near a train after it was derailed by a landslide near Tiefencastel, in a mountainous part of eastern Switzerland.

A passenger train derails in Switzerland down a 10 metre ravine leaving 11 people injured including one Australian.

Rhaetische Bahn the company operating the train disclosed that 140 people were on board at the time of the accident.

Police initially said the train ran into a landslide on the track, but later revised their comments to say a landslide hit the train as it travelled between two tunnels along the side of a valley.

Injured passengers have been photographed being airlifted by helicopters out of the mountainous terrain as there aren't any roads nearby. Those uninjured have been taken to the nearby town of Tiefencastel.

Although accidents like this are rare and the Swiss rain system is considered one of the safest and most efficient in the world, an accident in 2010 saw the derailment of a Glacier Express tourist train that killed one person and injured 42 others.

A helicopter flies over the derailed train in Switzerland where an Australian woman is injured.

A victim of Wednesday's train crash near Tiefencastel, Switzerland, is recovered by helicopter.
