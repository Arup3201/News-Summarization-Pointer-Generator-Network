Many women are understandably anxious about starting to breastfeed.

But Chloe Pullen admits she was slightly more worried than most, after her daughter Rose was born with two fully formed front teeth.

Most babies start teething at around six months, but Rose astounded nurses and midwives at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff with her pearly white incisors.

Rose Pullen, 25, woke up from a Caesarean to find her newborn daughter Rose Esme was born with two fully-formed white incisors on her lower gum

Rose Esme was born with two teeth - but they were removed when she was three days old in case she choked on them

Mrs Pullen, 25, from Pantmawr in Powys, Wales had a Caesarean so was under general anaesthetic for her daughter's birth. 

When she came round, her husband Daniel told her their daughter had been born with teeth.

She said: 'The midwives had never seen a baby with teeth before.

'Everybody came to the ward to see her – you could tell it was rare,' she told Wales Online.

Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth.

Doctors say they occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies.

They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure, meaning they are often wobbly. 

Mrs Pullen, who also has a two-year-old son Thomas, said she and her husband were so surprised by their daughter's appearance that they sent a picture of them to their friends and family.

She said the incisors looked like normal teeth, only smaller.

And luckily, breastfeeding didn't hurt as much as she had expected.

'I was worried about breastfeeding her but it didn't hurt,' she said.

'I could not actually feel her teeth.' 

It turned out that Rose is not the first baby in the family to be born with gnashers - the family later learned her grandmother was also born with one front tooth.

Rose's teeth, which were in the middle of her lower gum, were removed three days after she was born

This is often the case with natal teeth  because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them.

They can also injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain. 

Rose had to be fed with bottled milk until the teeth were removed, but Mrs Pullen could resume breastfeeding again after that.

She is still expected to grow a full set of baby teeth.

Her mother added: 'I was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and I never thought I would be using it so soon - especially for Rose before her older brother Thomas.'  

Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth. They occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies.

They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly.

They are not usually well formed but can injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain.

Natal teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them.

These teeth are not usually associated with any other medical problems. There is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed. 

'I was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and I never thought I would be using it so soon' said Mrs Pullen, who decided to keep daughter Rose's teeth in a jar as a souvenir
