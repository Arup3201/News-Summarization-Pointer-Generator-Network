They've long been snapping at their heels - and now, Next appear to be stealing a march on the grande dame of the British High Street, M&S.

Last week Next, who made their fortune in the Eighties with a groundbreaking mail order directory, announced profits that saw them overtake their rival for the first time.

A bumper Christmas for Next and a blossoming online division may be part of the reason for their success, but M&S haven't been doing themselves many favours.

Here Eliza Scarborough, Femail's fashion editor, shows M&S where they're going wrong - and how they can take a leaf out of Next's Directory...

Boring: Skirt, £21, marksandspencer.com

Elegant: Tube skirt, £20, next.co.uk

Skirt, £21, marksandspencer.com: The cut of this skirt is neither one thing nor the other, hovering uncertainly somewhere between a mini skirt and a pencil shape. It's too boxy and short for mature shoppers, but too frumpy, woolly and drab for 20-somethings.

I doubt even M&S know what age group they were aiming for with this. Despite usually having a reliable collection of staple skirts, they've lost their way with this piece.

Tube skirt, £20, next.co.uk: Next's skirt is elegant, stylish and perfectly suited to mature figures. The midi-length covers and elongates the leg while jersey material is figure-hugging without being clingy. The different width stripes break up the figure, drawing attention away from the hips and making the look much more high-end designer. Prada used a similar style stripe in 2012.

Adds inches: Spotted swimming costume, £39.50, marksandspencer.com

Flattering: Polka dot swimming costume, £30, next.co.uk

Spotted swimming costume, £39.50, marksandspencer.com: No woman wants their clothes to make them look fatter, but that's what this M&S swimsuit seems to do. They've made the cardinal sin of thinking that slinging a skirt around your bottom half will make you look slimmer. Instead, it just adds extra inches.

This is the last thing you'd want on the beach and disappointing as M&S swimwear is usually so well designed.

Polka dot swimming costume, £30, next.co.uk: Anyone would look trim in this costume. The material is body smoothing and, from the waist down, a Spanx-like lining holds you in.

The leg is elegantly cut and while the small cups might not be ideal on those with bigger busts, the overall shape is wonderfully flattering.

Too fussy: Prom dress, £89, marksandspencer.com

Sophisticated: Embroidered dress, £175, next.co.uk

Prom dress, £89, marksandspencer.com: The M&S dress may look simple from a distance, but close up the design is far too fussy.

The pale pink, leopard print fabric has a metallic sheen, the waist is nipped in, there are diagonal seams along the bust, the collar is embellished and the skirt flared.

It's a riot of detail and they're all fighting against one another. One thing should be pared back - whether it's the material, embellishment or cut.

Embroidered dress, £175, next.co.uk: Next's dress from its Signature Collection is far more sophisticated - if also far more expensive.

The simple cut, which nips in at the waist and has a loose panel of fabric hanging over the top, cleverly disguises the stomach while still flattering the silhouette.

And while it's covered in embellishments, they're dainty and intricate, rather than being overwhelming. A simple yet show-stopping classic. Worth the price.

Got it wrong: Linen dress, £39.50, marksandspencer.com

Spot on: Monochrome dress, £38, next.co.uk

Linen dress, £39.50, marksandspencer.com: Sometimes block colour can be used to divert the eye and optically 'trim' the figure. But M&S haven't mastered it here. Thick horizontal panels across M&S's linen dress have the reverse effect, widening the hips and bust.

The white middle band cuts you off just below the armpits, a deeply unflattering place, making larger busts look droopy and producing a mono-boob effect. The linen fabric felt comfortably light, but creased a little too easily.

Monochrome dress, £38, next.co.uk: Next have got it spot on. The black front panel optically reduces your waist size while the dark side panels alongside the leg give you a trimmer silhouette and the diagonal seams flatter curves.

The polyester material is stretchy, figure-hugging, but breathable, and the overall style is not a million miles away from a Roland Mouret frock. For £38, it's an absolute bargain.
