 

I understand the angst that many Arsenal supporters feel over the future of the club under Arsene Wenger. I understand why a swathe of the club’s support has started to give up hope that Wenger can recreate the success he brought to the club more than a decade ago.

I even started to inch in that direction myself last autumn after Arsenal made a poor start to this season.

Sometimes, it feels like Wenger is the problem, not the solution. He is a stubborn man and it can be hard to defend the choices he makes.

Arsene Wenger is facing increasing calls for his resignation from Arsenal fans after an undulating season

After the desperately dispiriting defeat by Monaco, Wenger will come under fierce scrutiny again  when Arsenal visit Manchester United to contest an FA Cup quarter-final. Lose and people will say that their season is over. Lose and the ‘Wenger Out’ bandwagon, which is already accelerating, will move up another gear.

Well, maybe they should be thinking about slamming the brakes on it instead. Because in the last five months, Arsenal have taken great strides forward.

I don’t buy the idea that the club is standing still or even going backwards. The defeat by Monaco notwithstanding, there are real signs of progress at last. Put it this way, if you are an Arsenal fan, which team in the Premier League would you swap places with today? Look around. Which team looks more upwardly mobile or better set for the future than Wenger’s side?

Manchester City? I don’t think so. City are creaking. They’re starting to look like a side at the end of an old cycle, not at the start of a new one.

Manchester United? Be serious. United may have spent lavishly under Louis van Gaal but they are beset by doubts about Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie.

And that’s before we start on their defence and the continuing absence of a dominating central midfield player.

Despite all their lavish investment, Manchester City do not look like defending their Premier League crown

Angel di Maria has been a disappointment since joining Manchester United for £60m from Real Madrid

Spurs? Well, Tottenham might well be advancing under Mauricio Pochettino but they’re still a way away from the level they achieved under Harry Redknapp.

Liverpool? Liverpool are looking good again under Brendan Rodgers and, like Arsenal, their prospects are improving.

OK, so that leaves Chelsea. And everybody would swap with Chelsea at the moment, but the point is that Arsenal’s future looks bright again.

It is easy, and valid, to point out the occasional failings of Per Mertesacker, but why not consider Arsenal’s array of attacking talent instead? Alexis Sanchez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla, Danny Welbeck, Mesut Ozil, Theo Walcott and, yes, Olivier Giroud are formidable forward- thinking players close to their prime.

And that’s before we talk about Jack Wilshere and Mathieu Debuchy, coming back from injury, and the emergence of Francis Coquelin as a holding midfielder.

Calum Chambers has not made the strides expected of him since his summer move from Southampton but his qualities are not in doubt.

Per Mertesacker winces during the defeat by Monaco, but Arsenal will surely strengthen their defence

Alexis Sanchez is surrounded by an embarrassment of attacking riches in the Arsenal ranks

There is no reason why he should not bolster Arsenal’s defence next season. If Wenger signs another central defender in the summer and perhaps a more experienced central midfielder, there is no reason why they should not challenge for the title next season.

It would be a shame if Arsenal lost their nerve on Wenger now just when it feels as if they are on the verge of being real contenders again.

Their victory over City at the Etihad in January was the clearest evidence yet of the fact they are casting off the inferiority complex they had developed against the other leading clubs. The tie against United, at the venue where they were humiliated 8-2 in 2011, will be another good test.

Arsenal are the FA Cup holders, let’s not forget. There is plenty to suggest that they are about to re-emerge into the light. Defeat by United won’t change that even if it will, inevitably, lead to renewed calls for Wenger’s head. It has got to the stage now where some Arsenal fans behave as if Wenger is the only thing standing between them and the Premier League summit.

There seems to be an assumption that, once liberated from the yoke of the professorial tyrant, Arsenal would be free to soar. Free to soar back to the top of the Premier League table as if that were their rightful place, as if that were the position that their history demanded.

Wenger last won the Premier League title in 2004, and his side may well challenge for the title next season

There is another inconvenient truth here: even in the last 10 years under Wenger that fans like to characterise as a desert of achievement, Arsenal have played at a higher level than they had in the 30 years before he arrived.

It may come as a surprise to some of those Arsenal fans who think that football began in 1992 but in the period from 1966 to Wenger’s arrival in 1996, Arsenal’s average position in the league was between sixth and seventh. Their traditional place in English football pre-Wenger was not in the top four.

There is no worth in lionising Wenger just because of his longevity. Nor is he entitled to remain in situ because he is the father of the modern Arsenal and his achievements built the Emirates. But he worked stoically through the period of retrenchment that followed the building of the new stadium and kept Arsenal among the elite.

It is only now that Wenger has been given the tools to aim for the top again. He has got Arsenal moving forward. He deserves the chance to try to finish the job.

Stadiums no longer a haven for bigotry 

The defenders of the faith bemoan the fact that you can’t do anything at a football ground these days without attracting sanction.

Can’t throw bananas on to the pitch and make monkey chants like we used to because it will upset black supporters.

Can’t sing songs about Auschwitz and Belsen or make hissing sounds to mimic gas chambers like we used to because it will upset Jewish supporters.

Can’t sing songs using a derogatory term for people who have Down’s Syndrome because it might upset supporters who have kids with disabilities.

Can’t even yell abuse at women in the directors’ box or sitting on the bench and sing songs urging them to get their kit off because it might upset female supporters.

‘It’s getting ridiculous,’ the legions of the disaffected say. ‘What has happened to the football we used to know?’

Well, the answer is simple.

What has happened is that our society has decided stadiums should no longer be havens for those who wish to vent their bigotry and their ignorance without fear of disapproval or repercussions.

What has happened is that we have come to the conclusion that it is wrong for swathes of our population to be made to feel uncomfortable when they go to watch their team play.

People can lament that if they wish to. The shame is that it has taken us this long to come to our senses.

At least spitting doesn’t threaten careers 

I have always found it hard to understand why biting a player on the shoulder during a football match and not even breaking the skin attracts far more opprobrium than snapping the same player’s leg with a terrible tackle, sending him to hospital and putting his entire career in doubt.

Up to a point, it is the same with spitting. ‘If a player spat at me,’ Stoke striker Jon Walters said on Thursday, ‘he’d be eating his supper through a straw.’ I wonder if Walters has considered that if an opponent committed the altogether more acceptable offence of deliberately smashing his jaw with a swinging elbow, it would be Walters who would be eating through a straw.

Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates 

Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident

‘There is nothing worse in football than spitting,’ player after player has said after the altercation between Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse at St James’ Park on Wednesday.

I’m sorry but I don’t agree. There is nothing worse in football than depriving another man of his livelihood. Pathetic and unpleasant though it may be, spitting never threatens that.
